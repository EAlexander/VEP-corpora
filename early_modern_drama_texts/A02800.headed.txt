HOw smug this gray-eyde Morning seems to be,
A pleasant sight; but yet more pleasure have I
To think upon this moystning Southwest Wind,
That drives my laden Ships from fertile Spain:
But come what will, no Wind can come amiss,
For two and thirty Winds that rules the Seas,
And blows about this ayerie Region;
Thirty two Ships have I to equal them:
Whose wealthy fraughts do make Pisaro rich:
Thus every Soil to me is natural:
Indeed by birth, I am a Portugal,
Who driven by Western winds on English shore,
Here liking of the soil, I married,
And have Three Daughters: But impartial Death
Long since, depriude me of her dearest life:
Since whose decease, in London I have dwelt:
And by the sweet loud trade of Usury,
Letting for Interest, and on Mortgages.
Do I wax rich, though many Gentlemen
By my extortion comes to misery:
Amongst the rest, three English Gentlemen,
Have pawnde to me their Livings and their Lands:
Each several hoping, though their hopes are vain,
By marriage of my Daughters, to possess
Their Patrimonies and their Lands again:
But Gold is sweet, and they deceive them-selues;
For though I guild my Temples with a smile,
It is but Iudas-like, to work their ends.
But soft, What noise of footing do I hear?

Now Master, what intend you to read to us?


Pisaro your Father would have me read moral Philosophy.


What's that?


First tell me how you like it?


First tell us what it is.


They be my Daughters and their Schoole-maister, Pisaro, not a word, but list
their talk.


Gentlewomen, to paint Philosophy,
Is to present youth with so sour a dish,
As their abhorring stomachs nill digestes.
When first my mother Oxford (Englands pride)
Fostered me puple-like, with her rich store,
My study was to read Philosophy:
But since, my head-strong youths unbridled will,
Scorning the leaden fetters of restraint,
Hath pruned my feahers to a higher pitch.
Gentlewomen, Moral Philosophy is a kind of art,
The most contrary to your tender sexes;
It teaches to be grave: and on that brow,
Where Beauty in her rarest glory shines,
Plants the sad semblance of decayed age:
Those Weeds that with their riches should adorn,
And grace fair Natures curious workmanship,
Must be converted to a black faced veil,
Griefs livery, and Sorrows semblance:
Your food must be your hearts abundant sighs,
Steeped in the brinish licquor of your tears:
Day-light as darke-night, darke-night spent in prayer:
Thoughts your companions, and repentant minds,
The recreation of your tired spirits:
Gentlewomen, if you can like this modesty,
Then will I read to you Philosophy.

Not I.


Fie upon it.


Hang up Philosophy, I'll none of it.


A Tutor said I; a Tutor for the Devil.


No Gentlewomen, Anthony hath learned
To read a Lector of more pleasing worth.
Marina, read these lines, young Haruie sent them,
There every line repugnes Philosophy:
Then love him, for he hates the thing thou hates.
Laurentia, this is thine from Ferdinande:
Think every golden circle that thou see,
The rich unvalued circle of his worth.
Mathea, with these Gloves thy Ned salutes thee;
As often as these, hide these from the Sun,
And Wanton steals a kiss from thy fair hand,
Presents his serviceable true harts zeal,
Which waits upon the censure of thy doom:
What though their Lands be mortgaged to your Father;
Yet may your Dowries redeem that debt:
Think they are Gentlemen, and think they love;
And be that thought, their true loves advocate.
Say you should wed for Wealth; for to that scope
Your Fathers greedy disposition tends,
The world would say, that you were had for Wealth,
And so fair Beauties honour quite distinct:
A mass of Wealth being powrde upon another,
Little augments the show, although the sum;
But being lightly scattred by it self,
It doubles what it seemed, although but one:
Even so your selves, for wedded to the Rich,
His stile was as it was, a Rich man still:
But wedding these, to wed true Love, is duty:
You make them rich in Wealth, but more in Beauty:
I need not plead that smile, that smile shows hearts consent,
That kiss showed love, that on that gift was lent:
And last thine Eyes, that tears of true joy sends,
As comfortable tidings for my friends.

Have done, have done; what need thou more procure,
When long ere this I stooped to that fair lure:
Thy ever loving Haruie I delight it:
Marina ever loving shall requite it young.
Teach us Philosphy? I'll be no Nun;
Age scorns Delight, I love it being:
There's not a word of this, not a words part,
But shall be stamped, sealed, printed on my heart;
On this I'll read, on this my senses ply:
All Arts being vain, but this Philosophy.

Why was I made a Maid, but for a Man?
And why Laurentia, but for Ferdinand?
The chastest Soul these Angels could entice?
Much more himself, an Angel of more price:
were it thy self present, as my heart could wish,
Such usage thou should have, as I give this.

Then you would kiss him?


If I did, how then?


Nay I say nothing to it, but Amen.


The Clarke must have his fees, I'll pay you them.


Good God, how abject is this single life,
I'll not abide it; Father, Friends, nor Kin,
Shall once dissuade me from affecting:
A man's a man; and Ned is more then one:
Y faith I'll have thee Ned, or I'll have none;
Do what they can, chafe, chide, or storm their fill,
Mathea is resolved to have her will.

I can no longer hold my patience.
Impudent villainy, and lascivious Girls,
I have ore-heard your wild conuersions:
You scorn Philosophy: You'll be no Nun,
You must needs kiss the Purse, because he sent it.
And you forsooth, you flurgill, minion,
A brat scant folded in the dozens at most,
You'll have your will forsooth; What will you have?

But twelve year old? nay Father that's not so,
Our Sexton told me I was three years mo.

I say but twelve: you're best tell me I lye.
What sir Anthony.

Here sir.


Come here sir, you light housewives get you in:
Stare not upon me, move me not to ire:
Nay sir stay you here, I'll talk with you:
Did I retain thee (villain) in my house,
Gave thee a stipend twenty Marks by year,
And hast thou thus infected my three Girls,
Urging the love of those, I most abhord;
Unthrifts, Beggars; what is worse,
And all because they are your Country-men?

Why sir, I taught them not to keep a Merchants Book, or cast account: yet to
a word much like that word Account.


A Knave past grace, is past recovery.
Why sir Frisco, Villain, Loggerhead, where art thou?

Here's a calling indeed; a man were better to live a Lords life and do
nothing, then a Serving creature, and never be idle. Oh Master, what a mess
of Brewesse stands now upon the point of spoiling by your hastiness; why they
were able to have got a good Stomach with child even with the sight of them;
and for a Vapour, oh precious Vapour, let but a Wench come near them with a
Painted face, and you should see the Paint drop and curdle on her Cheeks, like
a piece of dry Essex Cheese toasted at the fire.


Well sir, leave this thought, mind my words,
Give diligence, inquire about
For one that is expert in Languages,
A good Musician, and a French-man borne;
And bring him hither to instruct my Daughters,
I'll ne'er trust more a smooth-fac'd English-man.

What, must I bring one that can speak Languages? what an old Ass is my
Master; why he may speak flaunte taunt as well as French, for I cannot
understand him.


If he speak French, thus he will say, Awee awee:
What, can thou remember it?

Oh, I have it now, for I remember my great Grandfathers Grandmothers sisters
cousin told me, that Pigs and French-men, speak one Language, awee awee; I
am Dog at this: But what must he speak else?


Dutch.


Let's hear it?


Haunce butterkin slowpin.


Oh this is nothing, for I can speak perfect Dutch when I list.


Can you, I pray let's hear some?


Nay I must have my mouth full of Meat first, and then you shall hear me
grumble it forth full mouth, as Haunce Butterkin slowpin frokin: No, I am a
simple Dutchman: Well, I'll about it.


Stay sir, you are too hasty; for he must speak one Language more.


More Languages? I trust he shall have Tongues enough for one mouth: But what
is the third?


Italian.


Why that is the easiest of all, for I can tell whether he have any Italian in
him even by looking on him.


Can you so, as how?


Marry by these three points; a Wanton Eye. Pride in his Apparel, and the
Devil in his Countenance. Well, God keep me from the Devil in seeking this
French-man: But do you hear me Master, what shall my fellow Anthony do, it
seems he shall serve for nothing but to put Latin into my young Mistresses.


Hence ass, hence loggerhead, begone I say.
And now to you that reads Philosophy,
Pack from my house, I do discharge thy service,
And come not near my doors; for if thou dost,
I'll make thee a public example to the world.

Well crafty Fox, you that work by wit,
It may be, I may live to fit you yet.

Ah sir, this trick was spied in time,
For if but two such Lectures more they'd heard,
For ever had their honest names been marde:
I'll in and rate them: yet that's not best,
The Girls are wilful, and severity
May make them careless, mad, or desperate.
What shall I do? Oh! I have found it now,
There are three wealthy Merchants in the Town,
All Strangers, and my very special friends,
The one of them is an Italian:
A French-man, and a Dutch-man, be the other:
These three entirely do affect my Daughters,
And therefore mean I, they shall have the tongues,
That they may answer in their several Language:
But what helps that? they must not stay so long,
For whiles they are a learning Languages,
My English Youths, both wed, and bed them too:
Which to prevent, I'll seek the Strangers out,
Let's look: tis past aleauen, Exchange time full,
There shall I meet them, and confer with them,
This work craves hast, my Daughters must be Wed,
For one Months stay, saith farrewell Maiden head.

Come Gentlemen, we're almost at the house,
I promise you this walk ore Tower-hill,
Of all the places London can afford,
Hath sweetest Air, and fitting our desires.

Good reason, so it leads to Croched-Fryers
Where old Pisaro, and his Daughters dwell,
Look to your feet, the broad way leads to Hell:
They say Hell stands below, down in the deep,
I'll down that Hill, where such good Wenches keep,
But sir Ned, what says Mathea to thee?
Wilt fadge? wilt fadge? What, will it be a match?

A match say you? a mischief twill as soon:
Should I can scarce begin to speak to her,
But I am interrupted by her father.
Ha, what say you? and then put ore his snout,
Able to shadow Powles, it is so great.
Well, tis no matter, sirrs, this is his House,
Knock for the Churl bid him bring out his Daughter;
I'll, sbloud I will, though I be hanged for it,

Hoyda, hoyda, nothing with you but up ride,
You'll be within, ere you can reach the Door,
And have the Wench, before you compass her:
You are too hasty, Pisaro is a man,
Not to be fed with Words, but won with Gold.
But who comes here?

Whom, Anthony our friend?
Say man, how fares our Loves? How doth Mathea?
Can she love Ned? how doth she like my suit?
Will old Pisaro take me for his Son;
For I thank God, he kindly takes our Lands,
Swearing, Good Gentlemen you shall not want,
Whilst old Pisaro, and his credit holds:
He will be damned the Roage, before he do it?

Prethy talk milder: let but thee alone,
And thou in one bare hour will ask him more,
Then heel remember in a hundred years:
Come from him Anthony, and say what news?

The news for me is bad; and this it is:
Pisaro hath discharged me of his service.

Discharged thee of his service; for what cause?


Nothing, but that his Daughters learn Philosophy.


Maids should read, that it teaches modesty.


I, but I left out mediocrity,
And with effectual reasons, urged your loves.

The fault was small, we three will to thy Master
And beg thy pardon.

Oh, that cannot be,
He hates you far worser, then he hates me;
For all the love he shows, is for your Lands,
Which he hopes sure will fall into his hands:
Yet Gentlemen, this comfort take of me,
His Daughters to your loves affected be:
Their father is abroad, they three at home,
Go cheerly in, and cease that is your own:
And for my self, but grace what I intend,
I'll overreach the Churl, and help my Friend.

Build on our helps, and but devise the means.


Pisaro did command Frisco his man,
(A simple sotte, kept only but for mirth)
To inquire about in London for a man,
That were a French-man and Musician,
To be (as I suppose) his Daughters Tutor:
Him if you meet, as like enough you shall,
He will inquire of you of his affairs;
Then make him answer, you three came from Paules,
And in the middle walk, one you espied,
Fit for his purpose; then describe this Cloak,
This Beard and Hat: for in this borrowed shape,
Must I beguile and ouer-reach the Fool:
The Maids must be acquainted with this drift.
The Door doth open, I dare not stay reply,
Least being discride: Gentlemen adieu,
And help him now, that oft hath helped you.

How now sir, whither are you going?


Whither am I going, how shall I tell you, when I do not know my self, nor
understand my self?


What dost thou mean by that?


Marry sir, I am seeking a Needle in a Bottle of Hay, a Monster in the liknesse
of a Man: one that in stead of good morrow, asks what Porrage you have to
Dinner, Parley vous seignior? one that never washes his fingers, but lickes
them clean with kisses; a clipper of the Kings English: and to conclude, an
eternal enemy to all good Language.


What's this? what's this?


Do not you smell me? Well, I perceive that wit doth not always dwell in a
Satten-dublet: why, tis a Frenchman, Bassimon cue, how do you?


I thank you sir, but tell me what would thou do with a French-man:


Nay faith, I would do nothing with him, unless I set him to teach Parrets to
speak: marry the old Ass my Master, would have him to teach his Daughters,
though I trust the whole world sees, that there be such in his house that can
serve his Daughters turn, as well as the proudest French-man: but if you be
good lads, tell me where I may find such a man?


We will, go hye thee straight to Paules,
There shalt thou find one fitting thy desire;
Thou soon may know him, for his Beard is black,
Such is his raiment, if thou run appace,
Thou can not miss him Frisco.

Lord, Lord, how shall poor Phrisco reward your rich tidings Gentlemen: I am
yours till Shrouetewesday, for then change I my Copy, look like nothing but
Red-Herring Cobs, and Stock-Fish; yet I'll do somewhat for you in the mean
time: my Master is abroad, and my young Mistresses at home: if you can do any
good on them before the French-man corn, why so? Ah Gentlemen, do not suffer
a litter of Languages to spring up amongst us: I must to the Walk in Paules,
you to the Vestrie. Gentlemen, as to my self, and so forth.


Fools tell the truth men say, and so may he:
Wenches we come now, Love our conduct be.
Ned, knock at the door: but soft forbear;
The Cloud breaks up, and our three Suns appear.
To this I fly, shine bright my lives sole stay,
And make griefs night a glorious summers day.

Gentlemen, how welcome you are here,
Guess by our looks, for other means by fear
Prevented is: our fathers quick return
Forbidds the welcome, else we would have done.

Mathea, How these faithful thoughts obey,

No more sweet love, I know what thou would say:
You say you love me, so I wish you still,
Love hath loves hier, being ballancst with good will:
But say; come you to us, or come you rather
To pawn more Lands for money to our father?
I know tis so, a Gods name spend at large:
What man? our marriage day will all discharge;
Our father (by his leave) must pardon us,
Age save of age, of nothing can discuss:
But in our loves, the proverb we'll fulfil*
Women and Maids, must always have their will.

Say thou as much, and add life to this Coarse,

Your self your good news doth more enforce:
How these have set forth love by all their wit,
I swear in heart, I more then double it.
Sisters be glad, for he hath made it plain,
The means to get our Schoole-maister again:
But Gentlemen, for this time cease our loves,
This open street perhaps suspicion moves,
Fain we would stay, bid you walk in more rather,
But that we fear the coming of our father:
Go to the Exchange, crave Gold as you intend,
Pisaro scrapes for us; for us you spend:
We say farewell, more sadlier be bold,
Then would my greedy father to his Gold:
We here, you there, ask Gold; and Gold you shall:
We'll pay the interest, and the principal.

That's my good Girls, and I'll pay you for all.


Come to the Exchange, and when I feel decay,
Send me such Wenches, Heavens I still shall pray.

Good morrow, M. Strangers.


Good morrow sir.


This (loving friends) hath thus emboldened me,
For knowing the affection and the love
Master Vandalle, that you bear my Daughter:
Likewise, and that with joy considering too,
you Monsieur Delion, would fain dispatch*
I promise you, me thinks the time did fit,
And does bir-Lady too, in mine advice,
This day to clap a full conclusion up:
And therefore made I bold to call on you,
Meaning (our business done here at the Burse)
That you at mine entreaty should walk home,
And take in worth such Viands as I have:
And then we would, and so I hope we shall,
Loosely tie up the knot that you desire,
But for a day or two; and then Church rites
Shall sure conforme, confirm, and make all fast.

Seker Master Pisaro, me do so groterly dank you, dat you macke me so sure
of de Wench, datt ic can neit dank you genough.


Monsieur Pisaro, mon pere, mon Vadere, Oh de grande joy you give me (oconte)
me sal go home to your House, sal eat your Bakon, sal eat your Beef, and shall
tack de Wench, de fine Damoysella.


You shall, and welcome* welcome as my soul:
But were my third Son sweet Alvaro here,
We would not stay at the Exchange to day,
But hye us home and there end our affairs.

Good day master Pisaro.


Master Moore, marry with all my heart good morrow sir; What news? What
news?


This Merchant here my friend, would speak with you.


Sir, this jolly South-west wind with gentle blast,
Hath driven home our long expected Ships,
All laden with the wealth of ample Spain,
And but a day is past since they ariude
Safely at Plimmouth, where they yet abide.

Thanks is too small a guerdon for such news.
How like you this News friends? Master Vandalle,
Here's somewhat towards for my Daughters Dowry:
Here's somewhat more then we did yet expect.

But hear you sir, my business is not done;
From these same Ships I did receive these lines,
And there inclosde this same Bill of exchange,
To pay at sight; if so you please accept it.

Accept it, why? What sir should I accept,
Have you received Letters, and not I?
Where is this lazy villain, this slow Post:
What, brings he every man his Letters home,
And makes me no body; does he, does he?
I would not have you bring me counterfeit;
And if you do, assure you I shall smell it:
I know my Factors writing well enough.

You do sir; then see your Factors writing:
I scorn as much as you, to counterfeit,

Tis well you do sir.
What Master Walgraue, and my other friends:
You are grown strangers to Pisaros house,
I pray make bold with me.

I, with your Daughters
You may be sworn, we'll be as bold as may be.

Would you have ought with me, I pray now speak.


Sir, I think you understand our suit,
By the repairing we have had to you:
Gentlemen you know, must want no Coin,
Nor are they slaves unto it, when they have:
You may perceive our minds; What say you to it?

Gentlemen all* I love you all:
Which more to manifest, this after noone
Between the hours of two and three repair to me;
And were it half the substance that I have,
Whilst it is mine, tis yours to command.
But Gentlemen, as I have regard to you,
So do I wish you'll have respect to me:
You know that all of us are mortal men,
Subject to change and mutability;
You may, or I may, soon pitch ore the Perch*
Or so, or so, have contrary crosses:
Wherefore I deem but mere equity,
That some thing may betwixt us be to show.

M. Pisaro, within this two months without fail,
We will repay.

God save you Gentlemen.


Good morrow sin.


What M. Browne, the only man I wished for,
Does your price fall? what shall I have these Clothes?
For I would ship them straight away for Stoade:
I do wish you my Money fore another.

Faith you know my price sir, if you have them.


You are to dear in sadness, master Heigham:
You were about to say somewhat, pray proceed.

Then this it was: those Lands that are not mortgaged

God bless your worship.


I must crave pardon; Oh sir, are you come?


Hoyda, hoyda; Whats the matter now;
Sure, yonder fellow will be torn in pieces.

Whats he, sweet youths; that so they flock about:
What old Pisaro tainted with this madness?

Upon my life, tis some body brings news;
The Court breaks up, and we shall know their Counsel:
Look, look, how busely they fall to reading.

I am the last* you should have kept it still:
Well, we shall see what news you bring with you;
Our duty premised, and we have sent unto your worship Sack, siuill Oils,
Pepper, Barbery sugar, and such other commodities as we thought most requisite,
we wanted money therefore we are fain to take up 200. l. of Master Towersons
man, which by a bill of Exchange sent to him, we would request your worship pay
accordingly. You shall command sir, you shall command sir, The news here
is, that the English shipes, the Fortune, your ship, the adventure and good
luck of London coasting along by Italy Towards Turkey, were set upon by to
Spanish-galleis, what became of them we know not, but doubt much by reason of
the weathers calmnesse.


How is't six to one the weather calm,
Now before God who would not doubt their safety,
A plague upon these Spanish-galli Pirattes,
Roaring Caribdis, or deuowring Scilla,
Were half such terror to the antique world,
As these same antique Villains now of late,
Have made the Straights twixt Spain and Barbary.

Now sir, what doth your Factors letters say?


Marry he saith, these witless luckless doults,
Have met, and are beset with Spanish Galleys,
As they did sail along by Italy:
What a bots made the dolts near Italy,
Could they not keep the coast of Barbary,
Or having past it, gone for Tripoly,
Being on the other side of Sicily,
As near, as where they were unto the Straights:
For by the Gloabe, both Tripoly and it,
Lie from the Straights some twenty five degrees;
And each degree makes three-score english miles?

Very true sir: But it makes nothing to my Bill of exchange: this dealing fits
not one of your account.


And what fits yours? a prating wrangling tongue,
A woman's ceaseless and incessant babbling,
That sees the world turned topsy turuie with me;
Yet hath not so much wit to stay a while,
Till I bemoan my late excessive loss.

S'wounds tis dinner time, I'll stay no longer:
Hark you a word sir.

I tell you sir, it would have made you whine
Worse then if shooles of luckless croaking Ravens,
Had ceasd on you to feed their famished paunches:
Had you heard news of such a ravenous rout,
Ready to cease on half the wealth you have.

Sbloud you might have kept at home be hanged,
What a pox care I.

God save your worship, a littlemony and so forth.


But men are senseless now of others woe,
This stony age is grown so stony hearted,
That none respects their neighbours miseries,
I wish (as Poets do) that Saturnes times
The long out worn world wear in use again,
That men might sail without impediment.

I marry sir that were a merry world indeed, I would hope to get more money
of your worship in one quarter of a year, then I can do now in a whole
twelue-moneth.


Master Pisaro how I have run about,
How I have toyld to day to find you out,
At home, abroad, at this mans house, at that,
Why I was here an hour ago and more,
Where I was told you were, but could not find you.

Faith sir I was here but was driven home,
Here's such a common hant of Crack-rope boys,
That what for fear to have m'apparell spoiled,
Or my Roughs durted, or Eyes struck out:
I dare not walk where people do expect me:
Well, things (I think) might be better looked unto,
And such Coin to, which is bestowed on Knaves,
Which should, but do not see things be reformd,
Might be employed to many better uses:
But what of beardless Boys, or such like trash;
The Spanish Galleys: Oh, a vengeance on them.

Mass, this man hath the luck on it, I think I can scarce ever come to him
for money, but this a vengeance on, and that a vengeance on it, doth so trouble
him, that I can get no Coin: Well, a vengeance on it for my part; for he shall
fetch the next Letters him self.


I prithee, when think thou the Ships will be come about from Plimmouth?


Next week, sir.


Came you sir from Spain lately?


I sir; Why ask you that?


Marry sir, thou seems to have bin in the hot countries, thy face looks so
like a piece of rusty Bacon: had thy Host at Plimmoth meat enough in the house,
when thou were there?


What though he had not sir? but he had, how then?


Marry thank God for it; for otherwise, he would doubtless have Cut thee out in
Rashers to have eaten thee; thou look as thou weart through broyld already.


You have said sir; but I am no mere for his moing, nor yours neither: If I
had you in place where, you should find me tough enough in digestion, I
warrant you.


What will you swagger sir, will ye swagger?


I beseech you Sir, hold your hand; Get home ye patch, cannot you suffer
Gentlemen Jest with you?


I'd teach him a Gentle trick and I had him of the burse; but I'll watch him a
good turn I warrant him.


Assure ye master Towerson, I cannot blame him,
I warrant you it is no easy loss;
How think you master Stranger? by my faith sir,
There's twenty Merchants will be sorry for it,
That shall be partners with him in his loss.

Why sir, whats the matter.


The Spanish-gallies have beset our ships,
That lately were bound out for Siria.

What not? I promise you I am sorry for it.


What an old Ass is this to keep us here:
Master Pisaro, pray dispatch us hence.

Master Vandalle I confess I wrong you;
But I'll but talk a word or two with him, and straight turn to you.
Ah sir, and how then y faith?

Turn to us, turn to the Gallows if you will,

Tis Midsomer-Moone with him: let him alone,
He call's Ned Walgraue, Master Vandalle.

Let it be shrouetide, I'll not stay an inch master Pisaro.


What should you fear: end as I have vowed before,
So now again; my Daughters shall be yours:
And therefore I beseech you and your friends,
Defer your business till Dinner time;
And what youd say, keep it for table talk.

Marry and shall; a right good motion:
Sirrs, old Pisaro is grown kind of late,
And in pure love, hath bid us home to dinner.

Good news in truth: But wherefore art thou sad?


For fear the slave ere it be dinner time,
Remembering what he did, recall his word:
For by his idle speeches, you may swear,
His heart was not confederat with his tongue.

Tut never doubt, keep stomachs till anon,
And then we shall have cates to feed upon.

Well sir, since things do fall so crosely out,
I must dispose my self to patience:
But for your business, do you assure your self,
At my repairing home from the Exchange,
I'll set a helping hand unto the same.

Bon iurno signeour Padre, why be de malancollie so much, and grave in you a:
wat News make you look so nought?


Nought is too good an epithet by much,
For to distinguish such contrariousnesse:
Hath not swift Fame told you our slow sailed Ships
Have been ore-taken by the swift sail Galleys,
And all my cared-for goods within the lurch
Of that same Caterpillars brood of Spain.

Signor si, how de Spaniola have almost tack de Ship dat go for Turkie: my
Pader, hark you me on word, I have receive un lettre from my Factor de
Vennise, dat after un piculo battalion, for un half howre de come a Wind fra
de North, de Sea go tumble here, tumble dare, dat make de Galleys run away for
fear be almost drowned.


How sir; did the Wind rise at North, and Seas wax rough: and were the
Galleys therefore glad to fly?


Signior si, de Ship go drite on de Iscola de Candy.


Were thou not my Alvaro my beloved,
One whom I know does dearly count of me,
Much should I doubt me that some scoffing lack,
Had sent thee in the midst of all my griefs,
To tell a feigned tale of happy luck.

Will you no beleuue me? see dare dan, see de lettre.


What is this world? or what this state of man,
How in a moment cursed, in a trice blessed?
But even now my happy state began fade,
And now again, my state is happy made,
My Goods all safe, my Ships all escaped away,
And none to bring me news of such good luck,
But whom the Heavens have marked to be my Son:
Were I a Lord as great as Alexander,
None should more willingly be made mine Heir
Then thee thou golden tongue, thou good-newes teller
Joy stops my mouth.

M. Pisaro, the day is late, the Bell doth ring:
Wilt please you hasten to perform this business?

What business sir? Gods me, I cry you mercy:
Do it, yes sir, you shall command me more.

But sir, What do you mean, do you intend
To pay this Bill, or else to palter with me?

Marry God shield, that I should palter with you:
I do accept it, and come when you please;
You shall have money, you shall have your money due.

I beseech your worship to consider me.


Oh, you cannot cog: Go to, take that,
Pray for my life: pray that I have good luck,
And thou shalt see, I will not be thy worst master.

Marry God bless your Worship; I came in happy time: What, a French crown?
sure he knows not what he does: Well, I'll begone, least he remember himself,
and take it from me again.


Come on my lads, M. Vandalle, sweet son Alvaro:
Come don Balsaro, lets be jogging home
Bir laken sirs, I think tis one a clock.

Come M. Moore, th'Exchange is waxen thin,
I think it best we get us home to dinner.

I know that I am looked for long ere this:
Come master Towerson, let's walk along.

And if you be so hot upon your dinner,
Your best way is, to haste Pisaro on,
For he is cold enough, and slow enough;
He hath so late digested such cold news.

Mary and shall: Hear you master Pisaro.


Many Pisaros here: Why how now Ned;
Where is your Matt 'your welcome, and good cheer?

Swounds, lets follow him; why stay we here?


Nay prithee Ned Walg. lets bethink our selves,
There's no such haste, we may come time enough:
At first Pisaro bade us come to him
Twixt two or three a clock at after noone?
Then was he old Pisaro: but since then,
What with his grief for loss, and joy for finding,
He quite forgot himself, when he did bid us,
And afterward forgot, that he had bade us.

I care not, I remember't well enough:
He bade us home; and I will go, that's flat,
To teach him better wit another time.

Heer'le be a gallantiest, when we come there,
To see how mazed the greedy chuff will look
Upon the nations, sects, and factions,
That now have borne him company to dinner:
But hark you, lets not go to vex the man;
Prithee sweet Ned lets tarry, do not go.

Not go? indeed you may do what you please;
I'll go, that's flat: nay, I am gon already,
Stay you two, and consider further of it.

Nay all will go, if one: I prithee stay;
You're such a rash and giddy headed youth,
Each Stone's a Thorne: Hoyda, he skips for haste;
Young Haruie did but jest; I know heel go.

Nay, he may choose for me: But if he will,
Why does he not? why stands he prating still?
If you'll go, come: if not, fare-well?

Hier a Poast-horse for him (gentle Frank)
Here's haste, and more haste then a hasty Pudding:
You mad-man, mad-cap, wild-oates; we are for you,
It boots not stay, when you intend to go.

Come away then.


A thousand welcomes friends: Monsier Delion,
Ten thousand Ben-venues unto your self.
Signior Alvaro, Master Vandalle;
Proud am I, that my roof contains such Friends.
Why Mall, Larentia, Matth; Where be these Girls?
Lively my Girls, and bid these Strangers welcome;
They are my friends, your friends, and our wel-willers:
You cannot tell what good you may have on them.
Gods me, Why stir you not? Hark in your ear,
These be the men the choice of many millions,
That I your careful Father have provided
To be your Husbands: therefore bid them welcome.

Nay by my troth, tis not the guise of maids,
To give a slavering Salute to men:
If these sweet youths have not the wit to do it,
We have the honesty to let them stand.

Gods sekerlin, dats vn-fra meskin, Monsieur Delion dare de Groat freisler,
dare wode ic zene, tis vn-fra Daughter, dare heb ic so long loud, dare Heb my
desire so long gewest.


Ah Venice, Roma, Italia* Frauncia, Anglitera, nor all dis orb can show so
much belliza, veremante de secunda, Madonade granda beauty.


Certes me dincke de mine depeteta de little Angloise, de me Matresse Pisaro is
un net, un becues, un fra, et un tendra Damosella.


What Stocks, what stones, what senseless Trunks be these?
When as I bid you speak, you hold your tongue:
When I bid peace, then can you prate, and chat,
And gossip: But go too, speak and bid welcome;
Or (as I live) you were as good you did.

I cannot tell what Language I should speak:
If I speak English (as I can none other)
They cannot understand me, nor my welcome.

Bella Madonna, dare is no language so dulce; dulce, dat is sweet, as de
language, dat you shall speak, and de vell come dat you sal say, sal be well
know perfaytemente.


Pray sir, What is all this in English?


De vsa sal vell teash you vat dat is; and if you sal please, I will teash you
to parler Italiano.


And that me thinks sir, not without need:
And with Italian, to a Childes obedience,
With such desire to seek to please their Parents,
As others far more virtuous then them selves,
Do daily strive to do: But tis no matter,
I'll shortly pull your haughty stomachs down:
I'll teach you urge your Father; make you run,
When I bid run: and speak, when I bid speak:
What greater cross can careful parents have
Then careless Children. Stir and see who knocks?

Good morrow to my good Mistress Mathea.


As good a morrow, to the morrow giver.


A murren, what make these? What do they here?


You see master Pisaro, we are bold guests*
You could have bid no surer men then we.

Hark you Gentlemen; I did expect you
At after noone, not before two a clock.

Why sir, if you please, you shall have us here at two a clock, at three a
clock, at four a clock; nay till to morrow this time: yet I assure you* sir,
we came not to your house without inviting.


Why Gentlemen, I pray who bade you now?
Who ever did it, sure hath done you wrong:
For scarcely could you come to worser cheer.

It was your own self bade us to your cheer,
When you were busy with Balsaro talking;
You bade us cease our suites till dinner time,
And then to use it for our table talk:
And we I warrant you, are as sure as Steel.

A murren on your selves, and surenes too:
How am I crossed: Gods me, what shall I do,
This was that ill news of the Spanish Pirats,
That so disturbed me: well, I must dissemble,
And bid them welcome; but for my Daughters
I'll send them hence, they shall not stand and prate.
Well my Masters, Gentlemen, and Friends,
Though unexpected, yet most heartily welcome;
(Welcome with a vengeance) but for your cheer,
That will be small: yet too too much for you.
Mall, in and get things ready.
Laurentia, bid Maudlin lay the Cloth, take up the Meat:
Look how she stirs; you sullen Elf, you Callet,
Is this the haste you make?

Signor Pisaro, no soiat so malcontento de Gentlewoman your filigola did parler
but a litella to, de gentle homa y our grande amico.


But that grande amico, is your grande inimico:
One, if they be suffered to parlar,
Will poll you, I and pill you of your Wife:
They love together: and the other two,
Loves her two Sisters: but tis only you
Shall crop the flower, that they esteem so much.

Do they so; vell let me lone, sal see me give them de such grand mock, sal be
shame of them selves.


Do sir, I pray you do; set lustily upon them,
And I'll be ready still to second you.

But Matt, art thou so mad as to turn French?


Yes marry when two Sundays come together;
Think you I'll learn to speak this gibberidge,
Or the Pigs language? Why, if I fall sick,
They'll say, the French (et-cetera) infected me.

Why how now Minion; what, is this your service?
Your other Sisters busy are employed,
And you stand idle: get you in, or.

If you chide her, chide me (M. Pisaro:
For but for me, she had gon in long since.

I think she had: for we are sprights to scare her;
But er't belong, I'll drive that humour from her.

Signor, me thincks you soud no macke de wen she so hardee, so disobedient to
de padre as ditt madonna Matt.


Signor, me thinks you should learn to speak, before you should be so
foole-hardy, as to woe such a Maiden as that Madonna Matt?


Warrent you Monsieur, he sal parle wen you sal stand out the doure.


Hark you Monsieur, you would wish your self half hanged, you were as sure
to be let in as he.


Macke no doubt de signor Alua. sal do vel enough

perhaps so: but me thinks your best way were to ship your self for Stoad, and
there to batter your self for a commodity; for I can tell you, you are here
out of liking.


The worst perhaps dislike him, but the best esteem him best.


But by your patience sir, me thinks none should know better who's Lord, then
the Lady.


Den de Lady, vat Lady?


Marry sir, the Lady let her alone: one that means to let you alone for fear
of trouble.


Every man as he may: yet sometimes the blind may katch a Hare.


I sir, but he will first eat many a Fly:
You know it must be a wonder, if a Crab catch a Foul.

Maer hortens; if he ic monsier Delion be de Crab, we sal kash de Foul well
genough, I warrent you.


I, and the Fool well enough I warrant you;
And much good may it do ye.

Me dincke such a piculo man as you be, sal have no de such grande luck
madere.


Non da Monsieur, and he be so granda amorous op de Damosella, he sal have
Mawdlyn de wit Wenshe in de Kichine by maiter Pisaros leave.


By M. Pisaros leave, Monsieur I'll mumble you, except you learn to know, whom
you speak to: I tell thee Francois, I'll have (maugre thy teeth) her that shall
make thee gnash thy teeth to want.


Yet a man may want of his will, and bate an Ace of his wish: But Gentlemen,
every man as his luck serves, and so agree we; I would not have you fall out
in my house: Come, come, all this was in jest, now lets too't in earnest; I
mean with our teeth, and try who's the best Trencher-man.


Ah sir, now I know, what manner of thing Powles is; I did so marle before
what it was out of all count: For my master would say, Would I had Powles full
of Gold. My young Mistresses, and Grimkin our Taylor, would wish they had
Powles full of Needles: I, one asked my master half a yard of Freeze to make
me a Coat and he cried whoop holly-day, it was big enough to make Powles a
Night-gowne. I have been told, that Duke Humfrie dwells here, and that he
keeps open house, and that a brave sort of Cammileres dine with him every day;
now if I could see any vision in the world towards dinner, I would set in a
foot: But the best is, a the ancient English romaine Orator saith,
So-lame-men, Misers, Howsewiues, and so forth: the best is, that I have great
store of company that do nothing but go up and down, and go up and down,
and make a grumbling together, that the meat is so long making ready: Well,
if I could meet this scurvy Frenchman, they should stay me, for I would be
gone home.


I beseech you Monsieur, give me audience.


What would you have? What should I give you?


Pardon, sir mine uncivil and presumptuous intrusion, who endeavour nothing
less, then to provoke or exasperat you against me.


They say, a word to the Wise is enough: so by this little French that he
speaks, I see he is the very man I seek for: Sir, I pray what is your name?


I am nominated Monsieur Le Mouche, and rest at your bon service.


I understand him partly; yea, and partly nay: Can you speak French? Content
pore vous monsieur Madomo.


If I could not sir, I should ill understand you: you speak the best French
that ever trod upon Shoe of Leather.


Nay, I can speak more Languages then that: This is Italian, is it not? Nella
slurde Curte zana.


Yes sir, and you speak it like a very Natural.


I believe you well* now for Dutch:
Ducky de do watt heb ye ge brought.

I pray stop your mouth, fot I never heard such Dutch before brocht.


Nay I think you have not met with no pezant: Hear you M. Mouse, (so your
name is I take it) I have considered of your learning in these aforesaid
Languages, and find you reasonable: So, so, now this is the matter; Can you
take the ease to teach these Tongues to two or three Gentlewomen of mine
acquaintance, and I will see you paid for your labour.


Yes sir, and that most willingly.


Why then M. Mouse, to their use, I entertain ye, which had not been but for
the troubles of the world, that I my self have no leisure to show my skill:
Well sir, if you'll please to walk with me, I'll bring you to them.


Sit till dinners done; not I, I swear:
Shall I stay? till he belch into mine ears
Those rustic Phrases, and those Dutch French terms,
Stammering half Sentences dogbolt Elloquence:
And when he hath no love for-sooth, why then
He tells me Cloth is dear at Anwerpe, and the men
Of Amsterdam have lately made a law,
That none but Dutch as he, may traffic there:
Then stands he still and studies what to say;
And after some half hour, because the Ass
Hopes (as he thinks) I shall not contradict him.
He tells me that my Father brought him to me,
And that I must perform my Fathers will.
Well good-man Goose-cap, when thou woest again,
Thou shalt have simple ease, for thy Loves pain.

Alas poor Wench, I sorrow for thy hap,
To see how thou art clogged with such a Dunce:
Forsooth my Sire hath fitted me far better,
My Frenchman comes upon me with the Sa, sa, sa;
Sweet Madam pardon moye I pra^:
And then out goes his Hand, down goes his Head,
Swallows his Spittle, frissles his Beard; and then to me:
Pardon moy mistress Mathea,
If I be bold, to macke so bold met you,
Think it go will dat spurs me dus up you.
Dan cast neit off so good ande true Lover,
Madama celestura de la, (I know not what)
Do oft pray to God dat me would love her:
And then he reckons a catalogue of names
of such as love him, and yet cannot get him.

Nay, but your Monsieur's but a Mouse in cheese,
Compared with my Signor; he can tell
Of Lady Venus, and her Son blind Cupid:
Of the fair Scilla that was loved of Glaucus,
And yet scorned Glaucus, and yet loved King Minos;
Yet Minos hated her, and yet she holp'd him;
And yet he scorned her, yet she killed her Father
To do her good; yet he could not abide her:
Nay, heal be bawdy too in his discourse;
And when he is so, he will take my Hand,
And tickle the Palm, wink with his one Eye,
Gape with his Mouth, and

And, hold thy tongue I prithee: here's my father.


Unmannerly, untaught, vnnurtred Girls,
Do I bring Gentlemen, my very friends
To feast with me, to revel at my House,
That their good likings, may be set on you,
And you like misbehaud and sullen Girls,
Turn tail to such, as may advance your states:
I shall remembert, when you think I do not.
I am sorry Gentlemen, your cheare's no better;
But what did want at Board, excuse me for,
And you shall have amends be made in Bed.
To them friends, to them; they are none but yours:
For you I bred them, for you brought them up:
For you I kept them, and you shall have them:
I hate all others that resort to them:
Then rouse your bloods* be bold with what's your own:
For I and mine (my friends) be yours, or none.

God-gee god-morrow sir, I have brought you M. Mouse here to teach my young
Mistresses: I assure you (for-sooth) he is a brave Frenchman.


Welcome friend, welcome: my man (I think)
Hath at the full, resolved thee of my will.
Monsieur Delion, I pray question him:
I tell you sir, tis only for your sake,
That I do mean to entertain this fellow,

A bots of all ill luck, how came these here?
Now am I posde except the Wenches help me:
I have no French to flap them in the mouth,

To see the luck of a good fellow, poor Anthony
Could ne'er have sorted out a worser time:
Now will the pack of all our sly devises
Be quite laid open, as one undoes an Oyster:
Frank, Heigham, and mad Ned, fall to your muses,
To help poor Anthony now at a pinch,
Or all our market will be spoiled and marde.

Tut man, let us alone, I warrant you.


Monsieur, Vous estes tresbien venu, de quell pais estes vous.


Vous, that's you: sure he says, how do men call you Monsieur le Mouche?


Sister, help sister; that's honest Anthonie,
And he answers, your woer cuius contrarium.

Monsieur, Vous n'entens pas, Je no demand puit, vostre nom?


Monsieur Delion, he that made your Shoes, made them not in fashion: they
should have been cut square at the toe.


Madame, my Sho met de square toe, vat be dat?


Why sauce-box; how now you irreverent mincks
Why? in whose Stable hast thou been brought up,
To interrupt a man in midst of speech?
Monsieur Delion, disquiet not your self,
But as you have begun, I pray proceed
To question with this Countryman of yours.

Dat me sal do tres beien, but de bella Madonna de june Gentlewoman do monstre
some singe of amour to speak lot me, epurce monsieur, me sal say but two tree
four five word to di^ francois: or sus Monsieur Le mouche en quelle party de
France esties vous no?


France.


Ned.


Sbloud, let me come.
Master Pisaro, we have occasion of affairs,
Which calls us hence with speed; wherefore I pray
Defer this business till some fitter time,
And to perform what at the Exchange we spoke of.

A blessing on that tongue, saith Anthony.


Yes marry Gentlemen, I will, I will.
Alvaro to your task, fall to your task,
I'll bear away those three, who being here,
Would set my Daughters on a merry pin:
Then cheerly try your luckes; but speak, and speed,
For you alone (say I) shall do the deed.

Hear you M. Mouse, did you dine to day at Paules with the rest of the
Gentlemen there?


No sir, I am yet vndined.


Me thinks you should have a reasonable good stomach then by this time, as
for me I can sell nothing within me from my mouth to my Codpiece but all
Empty, wherefore I think a piece of wisdom to go in and see what Maudelin
hath provided for our Dinner master Mouse will you go in?


With as good a stomach and desire as your self.


Lett's pass in then

Han seg you Dochtor, for vat cause, voer why bed also much grooterlie
strange, Ic seg you wat, if datt ghy speak to me, is datt ghy love me.


Is't that I care not for you, is't that your breath stinks, if that your
breath stinks not, you must learn sweeter English or I shall never
understand your suite.


Pardon moy Madame.


Withal my heart so you offend no more.


Is dat an offence to be amorous di one belle Gentleawoman.


I sir see your Belle Gentle-woman cannot be amorous of you.


Then if I were as that belle Gentlewoman's lover,
I would trouble her no further, nor be amorous any longer.

Madonna yet de Belleza of de face beauty deform of all de Corpo may be such
datt no perriculo, nor all de mal shaunce, can make him leave her dulce visage.


But signor Alvaro if the periculo or mal shaunce were such, that she should
love and live with an other, then the dulce visage must be left in spite of
the lovers teeth, whilst he may whine at his own ill fortune.


Datts waer matresse, for it is untrue saying, they wint he taught they verleift
lie scrat sin gatt.


And I think to are like to scratch there but never to claw any of my Sisters
love away.


Dan sal your sistree do against her vaders will, or your vader segt dat ick sal
heb har for mine wife.


I think not so sir, for I never heard him say so* but I'll go in and ask him
if his meaning be so.


Hark sister signor Alvaro saith, that I am the fairest of all us three,


Believe him not for heel tell any lie.
If so he thinks thou may be pleased thereby,
Come go with me and near stand prating here,
I have a jest to tell thee in thine ear,
Shall make you laugh: come let your signor stand,
I know there's not a Wench in all this Town,
Scoffs at him more, or loves him less then thou.
Master Vandalle, as much I say for you;
If needs you marry with an English Lass,
Woe her in English, or sheele call you Ass.

Tut that's a French cog; sure I think,
There's ne'er a Wench in France not half so fond,
To woe and sue so for your Mounsership.

Par may foy Madame, she does tincke dare is no Wench so dure as you: for de
Fillee was cree dulce, tender, and amorous for me to love her; now me tincke
dat I being such a fine man, you should loua me.


So think not I, sir.


But so tincke esh oder Damosellas.


Nay I'll lay my love to your command,
That my Sisters think not so: How say you sister Mall?
Why how now Gentlemen, is this your talk?
What beaten in plain field: where be your Maids?
Nay then I see their loving humour fades,
And they resign their interest up to me;
And yet I cannot serve for all you three:
But least two should be mad, that I love one,
You shall be all alike, and I'll love none:
The world is scant, when so many Jack Daws,
Hover about one Coarse with greedy paws:
If needs you'll have me stay till I am dead,
Carrion for Crows, Mathea for her Ned:
And so farewell, we Sisters do agree,
To have our wills, but ne'er to have you three.

Madama attendez, Madama: is she alle? do she mockque de nows in such sort?


Oh de pestilence, no if datick can neite this Englese spreake vel, it shall
her Fader seg how dit is to pass gecomen.


No parlate, see here signors de Fader.


Now Friends, now Gentlemen, how speeds your work; have you not found them
shrewd unhappy girls?


Master Pisaro, de Dochter maistris Laurentia call me de Dyel, den Ass, for
that ic can neit englesh spreken.


Ande dat we sal no parler, dat we sal no hauar den for de wive.


Are they so lusty? Dare they be so proud?
Well, I shall find a time to meet with them:
In the mean season, pray frequent my house.
Ho now sir, whither are you running?

About a little tiny business.


What business, Ass?


Indeed I was not sent to you: and yet I was sent after the three Gen-men that
dined here, to bid them come to our house at ten a clock at night, when you
were abed.


Ha, what is this? Can this be true?
What, art thou sure the Wenches bade them come?

So they said, unless their minds be changed since: for a Woman is like a
Weather-cocke they say, I am sure of no more then I am certain of: but I'll go
in and bid them send you word, whether they shall come or no.


No sir, stay you here; but one word more: Did they appoint the come one by
one, or else al together?


Altogether: Lord that such a young man as you should have no more wit: why if
they should come together, one could not make rome for them; but coming one by
one, they'll stand there if there were twenty of them.


How this news glads me, and revives my soul: How say you sirs, what will you
have a jest worth the telling; nay worth the acting: I have it Gentlemen, I
have it Friends.


Signor Pisaro, I prey de gratia watte maneire sal we have? wat will the
parler? wat bon do you know Signor Pisaro, dicheti noi signor Pisaro.


Oh that youth so sweet, so soon should turn to age; were I as you, why this
were sport alone for me to do.

Hark ye, hark ye; here my man,
Saith, that the Girls have sent for Master Heigham
And his two friends; I know they love them dear,
And therefore wish them late at night be here
To revel with them: Will you have a jest,
To work my will, and give your longings rest:
Why then M. Vandalle, and you two,
Shall soon at midnight come, as they should do,
And court the Wenches; and to be unknown,
And taken for the men, whom they alone
So much affect; each one shall change his name:
Master Vandalle, you shall take Heigham, and you
Young Haruie, and monsieur Delion Ned,
And under shadows be of substance sped:
How like you this device? how think you of it?

Oh de brave de galliard devise: me sal come by de night and contier fair de
Anglois Gentlehomes dictenous ainsi monsieur Pisaro.


You are in the right sir.


And I sall name me de signor Haruy, end monsicur Delion sall be de piculo
signor Ned, end when madonna Laurentia sall say, who be dare? mister Vandalle
sall say, Oh my sout Laid, hier be your love Mestro Heigham: Is no dis de
brauissime, master Vandalle?


Slacked up den tromele, van ick sall come
Up to de camerken, wan my new Wincken
Slacked up den tromele, van ick sall come.

Ha, ha, ha, master Vandalle,
I trow you will be merry soon at night,
When you shall do in deed, what now you hope of.

I sall v seg vader, Ick sall tesh your Daughrer such a ting, make her laugh
too.


Well my Sons all, (for so I count you shall)
What we have here deuis'd, provide me for:
But above all, do not (I pray) forget
To come but one by one, as they did wish.

Mar hortens vader, ick veite neite de wecke to your houis, hort ens sall
master Frisco your manneken come to call de me, and bring me to v house.


Yes marry shall he: see that you be ready,
And at the hour of eleven soon at night:
Hie you to Bucklersburie to his Chamber,
And so direct him straight unto my house:
My Son Alvaro, and monsieur Delion,
I know, doth know the way exceeding well:
Well, we'll to the Rose in Barken for an hour:
And sir Frisco, see you prove no blab.

Oh monstrous, who would think my Master had so much wit in his old rotten
budget: and yet yfayth he is not much troubled with it neither. Why what wise
man in a kingdom would send me for the Dutch-man? Does he think I'll not
cousin him: Oh fine, I'll have the bravest sport: Oh brave, I'll have the
gallentest sport: Oh come; now if I can hold behind, while I may laugh a
while, I care not: Ha, ha, ha.


Why how now Frisco, why laugh thou so heartily?


Laugh M. Mouse: Laugh, ha, ha, ha.


Laugh, why should I laugh? or why art thou so merry?


Oh master Mouse, master Mouse, it would make any Mouse, Ratte, Cat, or
Dog, laugh to think, what sport we shall have at our house soon at night:
I'll tell you, all, my young Mistresses sent me after M. Heigham and his
friends, to pray them come to our house after my old Master was a bed: Now I
went, and I went; and I run, and I went: and whom should I meet, but my
Master and M. Pisaro and the Strangers; so my Master very worshipfully (I
must needs say) examined me whither I went now? I durst not tell him an
untruth, for fear of lying, but told him plainly and honestly mine arrande:
Now who would think my Master had such a monstrous plaguy wit, he was as
glad as could be; out of all scotch and notch glad, out of all count glad? and
so firra he bid the three Vplandish-men come in their steads and woe my young
Mistresses: Now it made me so laugh to think how they will be cousend, that I
could not follow my Master: But I'll follow him, I know he is gone to the
Tavern in his merry humour: Now if you will keep this as secret as I have done
hitherto, we shall have the bravest sport soon, as can be. I must be gone,
say nothing.


Well it is so:
And we will have good sport, or it shall go hard;
This must the Wenches know, or all is marde.
Hark you Mis. Moll, Mis. Laurentia, Mis. Matt,
I have such news (my Girls) will make you smile.

What be they Master, how I long to hear it?


A Woman right, still longing, and with child,
For every thing they hear, or light upon:
Well* if you be mad Wenches, hear it now,
Now may your knaveries give the deadliest blow
To night-walkers, eauese-droppers, or outlandish love,
That ere was stristen.

Anthony Mowche,
Move but the matter; tell us but the jest,
And if you find us slack to execute,
Never give credence, or believe us more.

Then know: The Strangers your Outlandish loves,
Appointed by your Father, comes this night
In stead of Haruie, Heigham, and young Ned,
Under their shadows to get to your bed:
For Frisco simply told him why he went:
I need not to instruct, you can conceive,
You are not Stocks nor Stones, but have some store
Of wit and knavery too.

Anthony, thanks
Is too too small a guerdon for this news;
You must be English: Well sir signor sows,
I'll teach you tricks for coming to our house.

Are you so crafty, oh that night were come,
That I might hear my Dutchman how he would swear
In his own mother Language, that he loves me:
Well, if I quit him not, I here pray God,
I may lead Apes in Hell, and die a Maid;
And that were worser to me then a hanging.

Well said old honest huddles; here's a heap
Of merry Lasses: Well, for my self,
I'll hie me to your Lovers, bid them mask
With us at night, and in some corner stay
Near to our house, where they may make some play
Upon your rivals, and when they are gon,
Come to your windows.

Do so good Master.


Peace, begone; for this our sport,
Some body soon will moorne.

How favourable Heaven and Earth is seen,
To grace the mirthful complot that is laid,
Nights Candles burn obscure, and the pale Moon
Favouring our drift, lies buried in a Cloud:
I can but smile to see the simple Girls,
Hoping to have their sweete-hearts here to night,
Tickled with extreme joy, laugh in my face:
But when they find, the Strangers in their steads,
They'll change their note, and sing an other song.
Where be these Girls here? what, to bed, to bed:
Mawdlin make fast the Doors, rake up the Fire;
Gods me, tis nine a clock, hark Bow-bell rings:
Some look down below, and see who knocks:
And hark you Girls, settle your hearts at rest,
And full resolve you, that to morrow morn,
You must be wed to such as I prefer;
I mean Alvaro and his other friends:
Let me no more be troubled with your nayes.
You shall do what I'll have, and so resolve.
Welcome M. Moore, welcome,
What wind a-gods name drives you forth so late?

Faith sir, I am come to trouble you,
My wife this present night is brought to bed.

To bed, and what hath God sent you?


A jolly Girl, sir.


And God bless her: But what's your will sir?


Faith sir, my house being full of Friends,
Such as (I thank them) came to see my wife?
I would request you, that for this one night,
My daughter Susan might be lodged here.

Lodge in my house, welcome withal my heart,
Matt hark you, she shall lye with you,
Trust me she could not come in fitter time.
For here you sir, to morrow in the morning.
All my three Daughters must be married,
Good master Moore lets have your company,
What say you sir; Welcome honest friend.

How now sir whats the news with you?


Mowche hear you, stir betimes to morrow,
For then I mean your Schollers shall be wed:
What news, what news man that you look so sad,

He brings me word my wife is new fallen sick,
And that my daughter cannot come to night:
Or if she does, it will be very late.

Believe me I am then more sorry for it.
But for your daughter come she soon or late,
Some of us will be up to let her in,
For here be three means not to sleep to night:
Well you must be gone? commend me to your wife,
Take heed how you go down, the stairs are bad,
Bring here a light.

Tis well I thank you sir.


Good night master Moore farewell honest friend,
Come, come to bed, to bed tis nine and past,
Do not stand prating here to make me fetch you,
But get you to your Chambers.

Byr'lady here's short work, hark you Girls,
Will you to morrow marry with the strangers.

Y faith sir no I'll first leap out at window,
Before Marina marry with a stranger,

Yes but your father swears, you shall have one.


Yes but his daughters, swears they shall have none,
These horeson Canniballs, these Philistines,
These tango mongoes shall not rule Ore me,
I'll have my will and Ned, or I'll have none.

How will you get him? how will you get him?
I know no other way except it be this,
That when your fathers in his soundest sleep,
You open the Door and run away with them,

So we will rather then miss of them.


Tis well resolude yfayth and like your selves,
But hear you? to your Chambers presently,
Least that your father do descry our drift,
Mistres Susan should come but she cannot,
Nor perhaps shall not, yet perhaps she shall,
Might not a man conceit a pretty jest?
And make as mad a Riddle as this is,
If all things fadge not, as all things should do,
We shall be sped y'fayth, Matt shall have hue.

Wear be you master Frisco.


Here sir, here sir, now if I could cousin him, take heed sir hers a post.


Ick be so groterly hot, datt ick sweat, Oh wen sal we come dare.


Be you so hot sir, let me carry your Cloak, I assure you it will ease you
much.


Dare here, dare, tis so Dark ey can neit see.


I, so so: now you may travel in your Hose and Doublet: now look I as like
the Dutchman, as if I were spit out of his mouth: I'll straight home, speak
groote and brood, and toot and gibrish; and in the dark I'll have a fling at
the Wenches. Well, I say no more; farewell M. Mendall, I must go seek my
fortune.


Master Frisco, master Frisco, wat sal you no speak; make you de Fool? Why
master Frisco; Oh de skellum, he be ga met de Cloak, me sal seg his master,
han master Frisco, waer sidy master Frisco.


Goes the case so well signor bottle-nose*
It may be we shall overreach your drift;
This is the time the Wenches sent us word
Our bombast Dutchman and his mates will come.
Well neat Italian, you must don my shape:
Play your part well, or I may haps pay you.
What, speechless Ned? faith whereon musest thou?
Tis on your French coriuall, for my life:
He come ete vostre, and so forth,
Till he hath foisted in a Brat or two?
How then, how then?

Swounds I'll geld him first,
Ere that infestious loszell revel there.
Well Matt, I think thou know what Ned can do;
Should thou change Ned for Noddy, me for him,
Thou did not know thy loss, yfayth thou did not.

Come leave this idle chat, and lets provide
Which of us shall be scar-crow to these Fools,
And set them out the way?

Why that will I.


Then put a Sword into a mad-mans hand:
Thou art so hasty, that but cross thy humour,
And thou't be ready cross them ore the pates:
Therefore for this time, I'll supply the rome.

And so we shall be sure of chatt enough;
You'll hold them with your sloutes and gulles so long,
That all the night will scarcely be enough
To put in practise, what we have devised:
Come, come, I'll be the man shall do the deed.

Well, I am content to save your longing.
But soft, where are we? Ha, here's the house,
Come let us take our stands: France stand you there,
And Ned and I will cross the other side.

Do so: But hush, I hear one passing hither.


Oh de favourable aspect of de heaven, tis so obscure, so dark, so black dat
no mortalle creature can know de me: I pray a Dio I sal have de reight Wench:
Ah si I be recht, here be de huis of signor Pisaro, I sall have de madonna
Marina, and daruor I sall knock to de door.


What a pox are you mad or drunk;
What, do you mean to break my Glasses?

Wat be dat Glass? Wat drunk, wat mad?


What Glasses sir; why my Glasses: and if you be so crancke, I'll call the
Constable; you will not enter into a mans house (I hope) in spite of him?


Nor durst you be so bold as to stand there,
If once the Master of the House did know it.

Is dit your House? be you de Signor of dis Cassa?


Signor me no signors, nor cassa me no cassas: but get you hence, or you are
like to taste of the Bastinado.


Do, do, good Ferdinand, pummel the logerhead.


Is this neit the House of master Pisaro?


Yes marry when? can you tell: how do you?
I thank you heartily, my finger in your mouth.

Wat be dat?


Marry that you are an Ass and a Logerhead,
To seek master Pisaros house here.

I prey de gratia, wat be dis plashe?
Wat do ye call dit street?

What sir; why Leaden-hall, could you not see the four Spouts as you came
along?


Certenemento Leden hall, I hit my head by de way, dare may be de voer Spouts: I
prey de gratia, wish be de wey to Crochefriers?


How, to Croched-friers? Marry you must go along till you come to the Pump,
and then turn on your right hand.


Signor, adio.


Farewell and be hanged Signor:
Now for your fellow, if the Ass would come.

By my trot me do so mush tincke of dit Gentle-woman de fine Wenshe, dat me
tincke esh hover ten day, and esh day ten year, till I come to her: Here be de
huise of sin vader, sall alle and knock.


What a bots aisle you, are you mad?
Will you run over me and break my Glasses?

Glasses, wat Glasses? Prey is monsieur Pisaro to de mayson?


Hark Ned, there's thy substance

Nay by the Mass, the substaunce's here,
The shaddow's but an Ass.

What Master Pisaro?
Logerhead, here's none of your Pisaros?

Yes but dit is the houis of master Pisaro.


Will not this monsieur Motley take his answer?
I'll go and knock the ass about the pate.

Nay by your leave sir, but I'll hold your worship.
This stir we should have had, had you stood there.

Why, would it not vex one to hear the ass,
Stand prating here of dit and dan, and den and dog?

One of thy mettle Ned, would surely do it:
But peace, and hark to the rest.

Do no de fine Gentlewoman matresse Mathea dwell in d^t Plashe?


No sir, here dwells none of your fine Gantle-woman* Twere a good deed sir, to
see who you are;

You come hither to steal my Glasses.
And then counterfeit you are going to your Queens.

I be deceu dis dark neight; here be no Wenshe, I be no in de right plashe: I
prey Monsieur, wat be name dis Street, and wish be de way to Croshe-friers?


Marry this is Fanchurch-streete,
And the best way to Crotched-friers, is to follow your nose

Vanshe, street, how shaunce me come to Vanshe street? vell monsieur, me must
alle to Croche-friers.


Farewell fortipence, go seek your Signor,
I hope you'll find your selves two Dolts anon:
Hush Fredinand, I hear the last come stamping hither.

Ha sir, I have left my fat Dutchman, and run my self almost out of
breath too: now to my young mistresses go I, some body cast an old shoe after
me: but soft, how shall I do to counterfeit the Dutchman, be cause I speak
English so like a natural; Tush, take you no thought for that, let me alone
for Squintum squantum: soft, her's my Masters house,


Whose there.


Whose there, why sir here is: Nay that's too good English; Why here be de
growtte Dutchman.


Then there's not only a growte head, but an Ass also.


What be yoo, yoo be an English Ox to call a gentle moan Ass.


Hark Ned yonders good greeting.


But yoo, and yoo be Master Mouse that dwell here, tell your matressa
Laurentia datt her sweet heart Master Vandall would speak with horde,


Master Mendall, get you gon, least you get a broken Pate and so mar all:
here's no entrance for misstres Laurentios sweet heart.


Gods sacaren watt is the luck now.
Shall not I come to my friend master Pisar House?

Yes and to master Pisaros Shoes too, if he or they were here.


Why my grout friend, M. Pisaro doth dwell here.


Sir, you lye, here dwells no body but I, that have dwelt here this one
forty years, and sold Glasses.


Lye farther, one and fifty at the least.


Hoo, hoo, hoo; do you give the Gentleman the lie?


I sir, and will give you a like of my Cudgel, if ye stay long and trouble
the whole street with your bawling: hence dolt, and go seek M. Pisaros
House.


Go seek M. Pisaros House;
Where shall I go seek it?

Why, you shall go seek it where it is.


That is here in Crodched-friers.


How Loger-head, is Croched-friers here?
I thought you were some such drunken Ass,
That come to seek Croched-friers in Tower-streete:
But get you along on your left hand, and be hanged;
You have kept me out of my Bed with your bangling,
A good while longer then I would have been.

Ah, ah, How is this? Is not this Croched-friers? Tell me, I'll hold a Crown
they gave me so much Wine at the Tavern, that I am drunk, and know not out.


My Dutchman's out his Compass his Card;
He's reckoning what Wind hath drove him hither:
I'll swear he thinks never to see Pisaros.

Nay tis so, I am sure drunk: Soft let me see, what was I about? Oh now I
have it, I must go to my Masters house and counterfeit the Dutchman, and get
my young Mistress: well, and I must turn on my left hand, for I have forgot
the way quite and clean: Fare de well good friend, I am a simple Dutchman I.


Fair weather after you. And now my Lads,
Have I not plied my part as I should do?

Twas well, twas well: But now let's cast about,
To set these Woodcocks farther from the House,
And afterwards return unto our Girls.

Content, content; come, come make haste.


I go and turn, and dan I come to dis plashe, I can no tell watt, and sall
do I can no tell watt, turn by the Pump; I pump it fair.


Me alle, end alle can no come to Croche-friers.


Oh miserable Blacke-pudding, if I can tell which is the way to my Masters
house, I am a Red-herring, and no honest Gentleman.


Who parlato daer?


Who be der? who alle der?


How's this? For my life here are the Strangers: Oh that I had the Dutchmans
Hose, that I might creep into the Pockets; they will all three fall upon me beat
me.


Who do der ander?


Amiss?


Oh brave; it's no body but M. Pharoo and the Frenchman going to our House, on
my life: well, I'll have some sport with them, if the Watch hinder me not. Who
goes there?


Who parle der, in wat plashe, in wat street be you?


Why sir, I can tell where I am; I am in Tower-streete: Where a Devil be you?


Io be here in Lede-hall.


In Leaden-hall? I trow I shall meet with you anon: in Leaden-hall? What a
simple Ass is this Frenchman. Some more of this: Where are you sir?


Moy I be here in Vanshe-streete.


This is excellent ynfayth, as fit as a Fiddle: I in Tower-streete, you in
Leaden-hall, and the third in Fanchurch-streete; and yet all three hear one
another, and all three speak together: either we must be all three in
Leaden-hall, or all three in Tower-streete, or all three in Fanchurch-streete;
or all three Fools.


Monsieur Gentle-home, can you well tesh de wey to Croshe-frier?


How to Croched-friers? I, I sir, passing well if you will follow me.


I dat me sal monsier Gentle-home, and give you tanks.


And monsiur Pharo, I shall lead you such a iaunt, that you shall scarce give
me thanks for. Come sirrs follow me: now for a dirty Puddle, the pissing
Condit, or a great Post, that might turn these two from Asses to Oxen by
knocking their Horns to their Fore-heads.


Whaer be de now signor?


Even where you will signor, for I know not:
Soft I smell: Oh pure Nose.

What do you smell?


I have the scent of London-stone as full in my nose, as Abchurch-lane of
mother Walls Pasties: Sirrs feel about, I smell London-stone.


Wat be dis?


Soft let me see; feel I should say, for I cannot see: Oh lads pray for my
life, for we are almost at Croched-friers.


Dats good: but watt be dis Post?


This Post; why tis the May-pole on Iuie-bridge going to Westminster.


Ho Wesmistere, how come we tol Wesmistere?


Why on your Legs fools, how should you go? Soft, here's an other: Oh now
I know in deed where I am; we are now at the fardest end of Shoredich, for
this is the May-pole.


Sordiche; O dio, dere be some nautie tinge, some Spirit do lead us.


You say true sir, for I am afraid your French spirt is up so far already, that
you brought me this way, because you would find a Charm for it at the Blew
Bore in the Spittle: But soft, who comes here?


Maids in your Smocks, look well to your Locks, Your Fire and your Light; and
God give you good night.


Monsieur Gentle-home, I prey parle one, too, tree, fore, words vore us to dis
oull man.


Yes marry shall I sir. I pray honest Fellow, in what Street be we?


Ho Frisco, whither frisk you at this time of night?


What, Monsieur Frisco?


Signor Frisco?


The same, the same: Hark ye honesty, me thinks you might do well to have
an M. under your Girdle, considering how Signor Pifaro, and this other Monsieur
do hold of me.


Oh sir, I cry you mercy; pardon this fault, and I'll do as much for you the
next time.


Well, passing over superfluicall talk, I pray what Street is this; for it is
so dark, I know not where I am?


Why art thou drunk, Dost thou not know Fanchurch-streete?


I sir, a good Fellow may sometimes be overseen among Friends; I was drinking
with my Master and these Gentlemen, and therefore no marvel though I be none
of the wisest at this present: But I pray thee Goodman Buttericke, bring me to
my Masters House.


Why I will, I will, push that you are so strange now adays: but it is an old
said saw, Honours change Manners.


Good-man Buttericke will you walk before:
Come honest Friends, will ye go to our House?

Ouy monsieur Frisco.


Si signor Frisco.


Oh de skellam Frisco, ic weit neit waer dat ic be, ic go and hit my nose op
dit post, and ic go and hit my nose op danden post; Oh de villain: Well, waer
ben ic now? Haw laet syen is dut neit croshe vrier, ya seker so is't and dit M.
Pisaros huis: Oh de good shaunce, well ic sall now have de Wenshe Laurentia,
mestris Laurentia.


Who's there, Master Haruie?


Master Walgraue?


Master Heigham?


Ya my Louue, here be master Heigham your groot friend.


How, Master Heigham my grot vrinde?
Out alas, here's one of the Strangers.

Peace you Mammet, let's see which it is; we may chance teach him a strange
trick for his learning: M. Heigham, what wind drives you to our house so late?


Oh my leif Mesken, de love tol v be so groot, dat het bring me out my bed voor
you.


Ha, ha, we know the Ass by his ears; it is the Dutchman: what shall we do
with him?


Peace, let him not know, that you are here: M. Heigham, if you will stay
awhile that I may se, if my Father be a sleep, and I'll make means we may come
together


Dat sal ick my Loua. Is dit no well counterfett I speak so like master
Heigham as tis possible.


Well, what shall we do with this Lubber? (Lover I should say.)


What shall we do with him?
Why crown him with a --

Fie Slut: No, wele use him clenlier; you know we have never a Sign at the
door, would not the jest prove currant, to make the Dutchman supply that want.


Nay, the fool will cry out, so wake my father.


Why, then wele cut the Rope cast him down.


And so jest out a hanging; let's rather draw him up in the Basket, and so
starve him to death this frosty night.


In sadness, well advised: Sister, do you hold him in talk, and we'll
provide it whilst.


Go to then. M. Heigham, oh sweet M Higham, doth my Father think that his
unkindness can part you poor Laurentia? No, no, I have found a drift to bring
you to my Chamber, if you have but the heart to venture it.


Ventre, salick go to de see, and be de see, and ore de see and in de see voer
my sweet Louue.


Then you dare go into a Basket; for I know no other means to enjoy your
company, then so: for my Father hath the Keys of the Door.


Salick climb up tot you? sal ick fly up tot you? salick, wat segdy?


Bid him do it Sister, we shall see his cunning.


Oh no, so you may catch a fall. There M. Heigham, Put your self into that
Basket, and I will draw you up: But no words I pray you, for fear my Sister
hear you.


No, no; no word: Oh de seete Wenshe, Ick come, Ick come.


Are you ready master Heigham?


In ick my sout Lady.


Merrily then my Wenches.


How heavy the Ass is: Master Heigham, is there any in the Basket but your
self?


Neit, neit, dare be no man.


Are you up sir?


Neit, neit.


Nor never are you like to climb more higher: Sisters, the Woodcock's caught,
the Fool is cag'd.


My sout Lady I be nuc neit up, pull me totv.


When can you tell; what master Vandalle,
A whether beaten soldier an old wencher,
Thus to be over reached by three young Girls:
Ah sir now we'll brag with Mistres Moore,
To have as fine a Parrot as she hath,
Look sisters what a pretty fool it is:
What a green greasy shining Coat he hath,
An Almonde for Parrot, a Rope for Parrot.

Do you moc que me seger seger,
I sal seg your vader.

Do and you dare, you see here is your fortune,
Disquiet not my father; if you do,
I'll send you with a vengeance to the ground,
Well we must confess we trouble you,
And over watching makes a wiseman mad,
Much more a fool, there's a Cusshon for you.

To bore you through the nose.


To lay your head on.
Couch in your Kennel sleep and fall to rest,
And so good night for London maids scorn still,
A Dutch-man should be seen to curb their will.

Hort ye Daughter, hort ye* gods se ker kin? will ye no let me come tot you?
ick bid you let me come tot you watt sal ick don, ick would neit for un hundred
pound Alvaro Delion, should see me open dit manner, well wat sal ick don, ick
mout neit cal: for de Wenches will cut de rope and break my neck; ick sal here
bleauen till de morning, dan ick sal cal to master Pisaro, make him shafe shite
his dauctors: Oh de skellum Frisco, Oh des cruel Hores.


I'll put the Light out, least I be espied,
For closely I have stolen me forth a doares,
That I might know, how my three Sons have sped.
Now (before God) my heart is passing light,
That I have ouerreach'd the Englishmen:
Ha, ha, Master Vandalle, many such nights
Will swag your big swollen bulk, and make it lancke:
When I was young; yet though my Hairs be gray,
I have a Young mans spirit to the death,
And can as nimbly trip it with a Girl,
As those which fold the spring-tide in their Beards:
Lord how the very thought of former times,
Supples these near dried limbs with actiuenesse:
Well, thoughts are shadows, sooner lost then seen,
Now to my Daughters, and their merry night,
I hope Alvaro and his company,
Have read to them moral Philosophie,
And they are full with it: Here I'll stay,
And tarry till my gallant youths come forth.

You mad-man, wild-oats, mad-cap, where art thou?


Here before.


Oh ware what love is? Ned hath found the scent;
And if the Connie chance to miss her Borough,
She's ouer-borne y faith, she cannot stand it.

I know that voice, or I am much deceived.


Come, why loiter we? this is the Door:
But soft, here's one asleep.

Come, let me feel:
Oh tis some Rogue or other; spurn him, spurn him.

Be not so wilful, prithee let him lie.


Come back, come back, for we are past the house
Yonder's Matheas Chamber with the light.

Well fare a head, or I had been discride.
Gods me, what make the Youngsters here so late?
I am a Rouge, and spurn him: well Jack sauce,
The Rogue is waking yet, to mar your sport.

Matt, Mistress Mathea; where be these Girls?


VVho's there below?


Thy Ned, kind Ned, thine honest trusty Ned.


No, no, it is the Frenchman in his stead,
That Mounsieur motlicoate that can dissemble:
Hear you Frenchman, pack to your Whores in France;
Though I am Portugal by the Fathers side,
And therefore should be lustful, wanton, light;
Yet goodman Goosecap, I will let you know,
That I have so much English by the Mother,
That no base slavering French shall make me stoop:
And so, sir Dan-delion fare you well.

What speechless, not a word: why how now Ned?


The Wench hath taken him down,
He hanges his head.

You Dan-de-lion, you that talk so well:
Hark you a word or two good Mistress Matt,
Did you appoint your Friends to meet you here,
And being come, tell us of Whores in France,
A Spanish lennet, and an English Mare,
A Mongrill, half a Dog and half a Bitch;
With Tran-dido, Dil-dido, and I know not what?
Hear you, if you'll run away with Ned,
And be content to take me as you find me,
Why so law, I am yours: if otherwise,
You'll change your Ned, to be a Frenchmans Trull?
Why then, Madame Delion, Ie vous lassera a Di^, et la bon fortune.

That voice assures me, that it is my Love:
Say truly, Art thou my Ned? art thou my Love?

Swounds who should I be but Ned?
You make me swear.

Who speak you to? Mathea who's below?


Marina.


Young master Haruy? for that voice saith so.


Speak sister Matt, is not my true Love there?


Ned is.


Not master Heigham?


Laurentia, here.


Yfayth you're welcome.


Better cannot Fall.


Sweet, so art thou.


As much to mine.


Nay Gentles, welcome all.


Here's cunning harlotries, they feed these off
With welcome, and kind words, whilst other Lads.
Revel in that delight they should possess:
Good Girls, I promise you I like you well.

Say master Haruy, saw you, as you came,
That Lecher, which my Sire appoints my man;
I mean that wanton base Italian,
That Spannish-leather spruce companion:
That antique Ape tricked up in fashion?
Had the Ass come, I'd learn him, difference been
Betwixt an English Gentleman and him.

How would you use him. (sweet).
If he should come?

Nay nothing (sweet) but only wash his crown:
Why the Ass woos in such an amorous key,
That he presumes no Wench should say him nay:
He slauers not his Fingers, wipes his Bill,
And swears in faith you shall, in faith I will;
That I am almost mad to bide his wocing.

Look what he said in word, I'll act in doing.


Leave thought of him, for day steals on apace,
And to our Loves: Will you perform your words;
All things are ready, and the Parson stands,
To join as hearts in hearts, our hands in hands,
Night favours us, the thing is quickly done,
Then truss up bag and Bagages, and be gone:
And ere the morning, to augment your joys,
We'll make you mothers of six goodly Boys.

Promise them three good Ned, and say no more.


But I'll get three, and if I get not four.


There's a sound Card at Maw, a lusty lad,
Your father thought him well, when one he had,

What say you sweets, will you perform your words?


Love to true love, no lesser mead affords?
We say we love you, and that loves fair breath
Shall lead us with you round about the Earth:
And that our loves, vows, words, may all prove true,
Prepare your Arms, for thus we fly to you.

This works like wax, now ere to morrow day,
If you two ply it but as well as I,
We'll work our lands out of Pisaros Daughters:
And cansell all our bonds in their great Bellies,
When the slave knows it, how the Rog will curse.

Sweet hart.


Matt.


Where art thou.


Here.


Oh Iesus here's our father.


The Devil he is.


Master Pisaro, twenty times God morrow*


Good morrow? now I tell you Gentlem^n,
You wrong and move my patience overmuch,
What will you Rob me, Kill me, Cut my Throat:
And set mine own blood here against me too,
You huswifes? Baggages? or what is worse,
Wilful, stoubborne, disobedient:
Use it not Gentlemen, abuse me not,
Newgate hath rome, there's law enough in England,

Be not so testy, hear what we can say.


Will you be wiu'de? first learn to keep a wife,
Learn to be thrifty, learn to keep your Lands,
And learn to pay your debts to, I advise, else.

What else, what Lands, what Debts, what will you do?
Have you not Land in Mortgage for your money,
Nay since tis so, we owe you not a Penny,
Fret not, Fume not, never bend the Brow:
You take Tenn in the hundred more then Law,
We can complain, extortion, simony,
Newgate hath Rome, theirs Law enough in England.

Prethe have done.


Prethy me no Prethies.
Here is my wife, Sbloud touch her, if thou dare,
Hearst thou, I'll lie with her before thy face,
Against the Cross in Cheap, here, any where.
What you old crafty Fox you.

Ned, stop there.


Nay, nay speak out, bear witness Gentlemen,
Whers Mowche, charge my Musket, bring me my Bill,
For here are some that mean to Rob thy master.
I am a Fox with you, well Jack sauce,
Beware least for a Goose, I pray on you.
In baggages, Mowche make fast the door.

A vengeance on ill luck,

What never storm,
But bridle anger with wise government.

Whom? Anthony our friend, Ah now our hopes,
Are found too light to balance our ill haps.

Tut ne'er say so, for Anthony
Is not devoid of means to help his Friends.

Swounds, what a devil made he forth so late
I'll lay my life twas he that fainde to sleep,
And we all unsuspicious, tearmde a Roage:
Oh God, had I but known him; if I had,
I would have wrote such Letters with my Sword
Upon the bald skin of his parching pate,
That he should ne'er have lived to cross us more.

These menaces are vain, and helps nought:
But I have in the depth of my conceit
Found out a more material stratagem:
Hark Master Walgraue, yours craves quick dispatch,
About it straight, stay not to say farewell.
You Master Heigham, hie you to your Chamber,
And stir not forth, my shadow, or my self,
Will in the morning early visit you;
Build on my promise sir, and good night.
Last, yet as great in love, as to the first:
If you remember, once I told a jest,
How feigning to be sick, a Friend of mine
Possessed the happy issue of his Love:
That counterfeited humour must you play;
I need not to instruct, you can conceive,
Use master Browne your Host, as chief in this:
But first, to make the matter seem more true,
Sickly and sadly bid the churl good night;
I hear him at the Window, there he is.
Now for a trick to overreach the Devil.
I tell you sir, you wrong my master much,
And then to make amends, you give hard words:
H'ath been a friend to you; nay more, a Father:
I promise you, tis most ungently done.

I, well said Mouche, now I see thy love,
And thou shalt see mine, one day if I live.
None but my Daughters sir, hanges for your tooth:
I'd rather see them hanged first, ere you get them.

Master Pisaro, hear a dead man speak,
Who singes the woeful accents of his end.
I do confess I love; then let not love
Prove the sad engine of my lives remove:
Marinaes rich Possession was my bliss?
Then in her loss, all joy eclipsed is:
As every Plant takes virtue of the Sun;
So from her Eyes, this life and being sprung:
But now debarred of those clear shining Rays,
Death for Earth gapes, and Earth to Death obeys:
Each word thou spakst, (oh speak not so again)
Bore Deaths true image on the Word engraven;
Which as it flue mixed with Heavens ayerie breath,
Summoned the dreadful Sessions of my death:
I leave thee to thy wish, and may th'euent
Prove equal to thy hope and hearts content.
Marina to that hap, that happiest is;
My Body to the Grave, my Soul to bliss.
Have I done well?

Excellent well in troth.


I, go; I, go: your words move me as much,
As doth a Stone being cast against the air.
But soft, What Light is that? What Folks be those? Oh tis Alvaro his other
Friends, I'll down let them in.


Where are we now gaffer Buttericke?


Why know you not Croched-friers, where be your wits?


Wat be tis Crosh-viers? vidite padre dare; tack you dat, me fall troble you no
far.


I thank you Gentlemen, good night:
Good night Frisco.

Farewell Buttericke, what a Clown it is:
Come on my masters merrily, I'll knock at the door.

Who's theere, our three wise Wooers,
Blockhead our man? had he not been,
They might have hanged them selves,
For any Wenches they had hit upon:
Good morrow, or good den, I know not whether.

Monsieur de Mowche, wat macke you out de Houis so late?


What, what, young men sluggards fie for shame
You trifle time at home about vain toys,
Whilst others in the mean time, steal your Brides:
I tell you sir, the English Gentlemen
Had wel-ny mated you, and me, and all;
The Doors were open, and the Girls abroad,
Their Sweet-hearts ready to receive them to:
And gone forsooth they had been, had not I
(I think by revelation) stopped their flight:
But I have cooped them up, and so will keep them.
But sir Frisco, where's the man I sent for?
Whose Cloak have you got there?
How now, where's Vandalle?

For-sooth he is not here:
Master Mendall you mean, do you not?

Why logerhead, him I sent for, where is he?
Where hast thou been? How hast thou spent thy time?
Did I not send thee to my Son Vandalle?

I M. Mendall; why forsooth I was at his Chamber, and we were coming
hitherward, and he was very hot, and bade me carry his Cloak; and I no sooner
had it, but he (being very light) sirkes me down on the left hand, and I turned
down on the left hand, and so lost him.


Why then you turned together, Ass.


No sir, we never saw one another since.


Why, turned you not both on the left hand?


No for-sooth we turned both on the left hand.


Hoyda, why yet you went both together.


Ah no, we went clean contrary one from another.


Why Dolt, why Patch, why Ass,
On which hand turned ye?

Alas, alas, I cannot tell for-sooth, it was so dark I could not see, on which
hand we turned: But I am sure we turned one way.


Was ever creature plagud with such a Dolt?
My Son Vandalle now hath lost himself,
And shall all night go straying bout the Town;
Or meet with some strange Watch that knows him not;
And all by such an arrant Ass as this.

No, no, you may soon smell the Dutchmans lodging: Now for a Figure: Out alas,
what's yonder?


Where?


Hoyda, hoyda, a Basket: it turns, hoe.


Peace ye Villain, and let's see who's there? Go look about the House; where
are our weapons? What might this mean?


Look, look, look; there's one in it, he peeps out: Is there ne'er a Stone
here to hurl at his Nose.


What, would thou break my Windows with a Stone? How now, who's there,
who are you sir?


Look, he peepes out again: Oh it's M. Mendall, it's M. Mendall: how got he
up thither?


What, my Son Vandalle, how comes this to pass?


Signor Vandalle, wat do yo go to de wenshe in de Basket?


Oh Vadere, Vadere, here be sush cruel Dochterkens, ick ben also weary, also
weary, also cold; for be in dit little Basket: lo prey help dene.


He looks like the sign of the Mouth without Bishops gate, gaping, and a
great Face, and a great Head, and no Body.


Why how now Son, what have your Adamants
Drawn you up so far, and there left you hanging
Twixt Heaven and Earth like Mahomets Sepulchre?

They did unkindly, who so ere they were,
That plagued him here, like Tantalus in Hell,
To touch his Lips like the desired Fruit,
And then to snatch it from his gaping Chappes.

A little farther signor Vandalle, and dan you may put v head into de windo and
cash de Wensh.


Ick prey Vader dat you help de me, Ick prey Goddie Vader.


Help you, but how?


Cut the Rope.


Sir, I'll go in and see,
And if I can, I'll let him down to you.

Do gentle Mouche: Why but here's a jest;
They say, high climers have the greatest falls:
If you should fall; as how you'll do I know not,
Byr'lady I should doubt me of my Son:
Pray to the Rope to hold: Art thou there Mouche?

Yes sir, now you may choose, whether you'll stay till I let him down, or
whether I shall cut him down?


Cut him down master Mouse, cut him down And let's see, how heal tumble.


Why sauce, who asked your counsel?
Let him down.
What, with a Cushion too? why you provided
To lead your life as did Diogines;
And for a Tub, to creep into a Basket.

Ick sall seg v Vader, Ick quame here to your Huise and spreake tol de
Dochterken.


M. Mendall, you are welcome out of the Basket: I smell a Ratt it was not for
nothing, that you lost me.


Oh skellum, you run away from me.


I thought so sir, you gave him the flip.


Faw, no for-sooth; I'll tell you how it was: when we come from Bucklers-Burie
into Corn-Wale, and I had taken the Cloak, then you should have turned down on
your left hand and so have gone right forward, and so turned up again, and so
have crossed the streate; and you like an Ass.


Why how now Rascal; is your manners such?
You ass, you Dolt, why led you him through Corn-hill,
Your way had been to come through Canning street.

Why so I did sir.


Why thou see ye were in Corn-Hill.


Indeed sir there was three faults, the Night was dark, Master Mendall
drunk, and I sleepy, that we could not tell very well, which way we went.


Sir I owe for this a Cudgelling:
But Gentlemen, since things have faulne out so,
And for I see Vandalle quakes for cold,
This night accept your Lodgings in my house,
And in the morning forward with your marriage,
Come on my sons, sir fetch up more wood.

Nay never weep Marina for the matter,
Tears are but signs of sorrow, helping not.

Would it not mad one to be crossed as I,
Being in the very hight of my desire?
The strangers frustrate all: our true loue's come,
Nay more, even at the door, and Haruies arms
Spread as a Rayne-bow ready to receive me,
And then my Father meet us: Oh God, oh God.

Weep who that list for me, y faith not I,
Though I am youngest yet my stomack's great:
Nor tis not father, friends, nor any one,
Shall make me wed the man I cannot love:
I'll have my will ynfayth, y'fayth I will.

Let us determine Sisters what to do,
My father means to wed us in the morning,
And therefore something must be thought upon.

We'll to our father and so know his mind,
I and his reason too, we are no fools,
Or Babes neither, to be fed with words.

Agreed, agreed: but who shall speak for all?


I will.


No I.


Thou wilt not speak for crying.


Yes* yes I warrant you, that humours left,
Be I but mou'de a little, I shall speak,
And anger him I fear, ere I have done.

Whom Anthony our friend, our Schoole-maister?
Now help us Gentle Anthony, or never.

What is your hasty running changed to prayer,
Say, where were you going?

Even to our father,
To know what he intends to do with us.

Tis bootless trust me, for he is resolved
To marry you to.

The Strangers.


Y faith he is.


Y faith he shall not.
Frenchman, be sure we'll pluck a Crow together,
Before you force me give my hand at Church.

Come to our Father speech this comfort finds,
That we may scold out grief, and ease our minds.

Stay, Stay Marina, and advise you better,
It is not Force, but Policy must serve:
The Doors are locked, your Father keeps the Key,
Wherefore unpossible to escape away:
Yet have I plotted, and deuis'd a drift,
To frustrate your intended marriages,
And give you full possession of your joys:
Laurentia, ere the mornings light appear,
You must play Anthony in my disguise.

Anthony, what of us? What shall we wear?


Anthony, what of us? What shall we wear?


Soft, soft, you are too forward Girls, I swear,
For you some other drift deuisd must be?
One shadow for a substance: this is she.
Nay weep not sweets, repose upon my care,
For all alike, or good or bad shall share:
You will have Haruie, you Heigham, and you Ned;
You shall have all your wish, or be I dead:
For sooner may one day the Sea lie still,
Then once restrain a Woman of her will.

Sweet Anthony, how shall we quit thy hire?


Not gifts, but your contentments I desire:
To help my Countrymen I cast about,
For Strangers loves blase fresh, but soon burn out:
Sweet rest dwell here, and frightful fear obiure,
These eyes shall wake to make your rest secure:
For ere again dull night the dull eyes charms,
Each one shall fouled her Husband in her arms:
Which if it chance, we may avouch it still,
Women Maids will always have their will.

Are Wood Coals brought up to make a fire?
Is the Meat spitted ready to lie down:
For Bakemeates I'll have none, the world's too hard:
There's Geese too, now I remember me;
Bid Mawdlin lay the Giblets in Past,
Here's nothing thought upon, but what I do.
Stay Frisco, see who rings: look to the Door,
Let none come in I charge, were he my Father,
I'll keep them whilst I have them: Frisco, who is it?

She is come ynfayth.


Who is come?


Mistress Sushaunce, Mistress Moors daughter.


Mistress Susan, Ass? Oh she must come in.


Hang him, if he keep out a Wench:
If the Wench keep not out him, so it is.

Welcome Mistress Susan, welcome;
I little thought you would have come to night;
But welcome (trust me) are you to my house:
What, doth your Mother mend? doth she recover?
I promise you I am sorry for her sickness.

She's better then she was, I thank God for it,

Now before God she is a sweet smug Girl,
One might do good on her; the flesh is frail,
Man hath infirmity, and such a Bride,
Were able to change Age to hot desire:
Hark you Sweet-heart,
To morrow are my Daughters to be wed,
I pray you take the pains to go with them.

If sir you'll give me leave, I'll weight on them.


Yes marry shall you, and a thousand thanks,
Such company as you my Daughters want,
Maids must grace Maids, when they are married:
Is't not a merry life (thinks thou) to wed,
For to embrace, and be embraced abed.

I know not what you mean sir.
Here's an old Ferret Pol-cat.

You may do, if you'll follow mine advice;
I tell thee Mouse, I knew a Wench as nice:
Well, she's at rest poor soul, I mean my Wife,
That thought (alas good heart) Love was a toy,
Until (well, that time is gon and past away)
But why speak I of this: Hark ye Sweeting,
There's more in Wedlock, then the name can show;
And now (byr'lady) you are ripe in years:
And yet take heed Wench, there lies a Pad in Straw;

Old Fornicator, had I my Dagger,
I'd break his Costard.

Young men are slippery, fickle, wavering;
Constant abiding graces none but Age:
Then Maids should now wax wise, and do so,
As to choose constant men, let fickle go,
Youth's unregarded, and vnhonoured:
An ancient Man doth make a Maid a Matron:
And is not that an Honour, how say you? how say you?

Yes forsooth.
(Oh old lust will you never let me go.)

You say right well, and do but think thereon,
How Husbands, honoured years, long card-for wealth,
Wise stayednesse, Experient government,
Doth grace the Maid, that thus is made a Wise,
And you will wish your self such, on my life.

I think I must turn womankind altogether,
And scratch out his eyes:
For as long as he can see me, heal ne'er let me go.

But go (sweet-heart) to bed, I do thee wrong,
The latenesse now, makes all our talk seem long.
How now Mowche, be the Girls abed?

Mathea (and it like you) fain would sleep, but only tarrieth for her
bed-fellow.


Ha, you say well: come, light her to her Chamber,
Good rest wish I to thee; wish so to me,
Then Susan and Pisaro shall agree:
Think but what joy is near your bed-fellow,
Such may be yours; take counsel of your Pillow:
To morrow we'll talk more; and so good night,
Think what is said, may be, if all hit right.

What, have I past the Pikes: knows he not Ned?
I think I have deserved his Daughters bed.

Tis well, tis well: but this let me request,
You keep unknown, till you be laid to rest:
And then a good hand speed you.

Tut, ne'er fear me,
We two abed shall never disagree.

I have stood still all this while, and could not speak for laughing: Lord
what a Dialogue hath there bin between Age and Youth. You do good on her? even
as much as my Dutchman will do on my young Mistress: Master, follow my
counsel; then send for M. Heigham to help him, for I'll lay my Cap to two
Pence, that he will be asleep to morrow at night, when he should go to bed
to her: Marry for the Italian, he is of an other humour, for there le be no
dealings with him, till midnight; for he must slaver all the Wenches in the
house at parting, or he is no body: he hath been but a little while at our
House, yet in that small time, he hath licked more Grease from our Mawdlins
lips, then would have served London Kitchen stuff this tweluemonth. Yet for
my money, well fare the Frenchman, Oh he is a forward Lad, for heel no sooner
come from the Church, but heel fly to the Chamber; why heel read his Lesson
so often in the day time, that at night like an apt Scholar, heel be ready to
sell his old Book to buy him a new. Oh the generation of Languages that our
House will bring forth: why every Bed will have a proper speech to himself,
and have the Founders name written upon it in fair Cappitall letters, Here
lay, and so forth.


You'll be a villain still: Look who's at door?


Nay by the Mass, you are M. Porter, for I'll be hanged if you loose that
office, having so pretty a morsel under your keeping: I go (old huddle) for
the best Nose at smelling out a Pin-fold, that I know: well, take heed, you
may haps pick up Worms so long, that at length some of them get into your
Nose, and never out after: But what an Ass am I to think so, considering all
the Lodgings are taken up already, and there's not a Dog-kennell empty for a
strange Worm to breed in.


The day is broke; Mathea and young Ned,
By this time, are so surely linked together,
That none in London can forbid the Banes.
Laurentia she is near provided for:
So that if Haruies policy but hold,
Elce-wheare the Strangers may go seek them Wives:
But here they come.

Six a clock say you; trust me, forward days:
Hark you Mowche, hic you to Church,
Bid M Bewford be in readiness:
Where go you, that way?

For my Cloak, sir.


Oh tis well: and M. Browne,
Trust me, your early stirring makes me muse,
Is it to me your business?

Even to your self:
I come (I think) to bring you welcome news,

And welcome news,
More welcome makes the bringer:
Speak, speak, good M. Browne, I long to hear them.

Then this it is. Young Haruie late last night,
Full weak and sickly came unto his lodging,
From whence this sudden mallady proceeds:
Tis all uncertain, the Doctors and his Friends
Affirm his health is unrecoverable:
Young Heigham and Ned Walgraue lately left him,
And I came hither to inform you of it.

Young M. Haruie sick; now before God
The news bites near the Bone: for should he die,
His Living mortgaged would be redeemed,
For not these three months doth the Bond bear date:
Die now, marry God in heaven defend it;
Oh my sweet Lands, loose thee, nay loose my life:
And which is worst, I dare not ask mine own,
For I take two and twenty in the hundred,
When the Law gives but ten: But should he live,
He careless would have left the debt vnpaide,
Then had the Lands been mine Pisaros own,
Mine, mine own Land, mine own Possession.

Nay hear me out.


You're out too much already,
Unless you give him life, and me his Land.

Whether tis love to you, or to your Daughter,
I know not certain; but the Gentleman
Hath made a deed of gift of all his Lands,
Unto your beauteous Daughter fair Marina.

Ha, say that word again, say it again,
A good thing cannot be too often spoken:
Marina say you, are you sure twas she,
Or Mary, Margery; or some other Maid?

To none but your Daughter fair Marina*
And for the gift might be more forcible,
Your neighbour master Moore advised us,
(Who is a witness of young Haruies Will)
Sick as he is, to bring him to your house:
I know they are not far, but do attend,
That they may know, what welcome they shall have.

What welcome sir; as welcome as new life
Given to the poor condemned Prisoner:
Return (good master Browne) assure their welcome,
Say it, nay swear it; for they are welcome truly:
For welcome are they to me which bring Gold.
See down who knocks; it may be there they are:
Frisco, call down my Sons, bid the Girls rise:
Where's Mowche; what, is he gon or no?
Oh hear you siera, bring along with you
Master Balsaro the Spanish Merchant.

Many Balsaros I; I'll to my Love:
And thanks to Anthony for this escape.

Stay, take us with you. Hark, they knock again,
Come my souls comfort, thou good news bringer,
I must needs hug thee even for pure affection.

Lift softly (good my friends) for hurting him.
Look cheerly sir, you're welcome to my house.
Hark M. Vandalle, and my other Sons,
Seem to be sad as grieving for his sickness,
But inwardly rejoice. Master Vandalle,
Signor Alvaro, Monsieur Delion,
Bid my Friend welcome, pray bid him welcome:
Take a good heart; I doubt not (by Gods leave)
You shall recover and do well enough:
(If I should think so, I should hang my self.)
Frisco, go bid Marina come to me.
You are a Witness sir, of this mans Will:
What think you M. Moore, what say you to it?

Master Pisaro, follow mine advice:
You see the Gentleman cannot escape,
Then let him straight be wedded to your Daughter;
So during life time, she shall hold his Land,
When now (being nor kith nor kin to him)
For all the deed of Gift, that he hath sealed,
His younger Brother will enjoy the Land.

Marry my Daughter: no byr'lady.
Hear you Alvaro, my Friend counsel me,
Seeing young M. Haruie is so sick,
To marry him incontinent to my Daughter.
Or else the gift he hath bestowed, is vain:
Marry and he recover; no my Son,
I will not loose thy love, for all his Land.

Here you padre, do no lose his Lands, his hundred pont per anno tis wort to
hauar; let him have de matresse Marina in de marriage, tis but for me to
attendre vne day more: if he will no die, I sal give him sush a Drink, sush a
Potion sal make him give de Bonos noches to all de world.


Alvaro, here's my Keys, take all I have,
My Money, Plate, Wealth, Jewels, Daughter too:
Now God be thanked, that I have a Daughter, worthy to be Aluaroes bed fellow:
Oh how I do admire and praise thy wit,
I'll straight about it: Hear you Master Moore.

Nay saith he's sick, therefore though he be come, yet he can do you no
good; there's no remedy but even to put your self into the hands of the
Italian, that by that time that he hath past his grouth, young Haruie will be
in case to come upon it with a sis of fresh force.


Is my Love come, sick? I, now thou love me,
How my heart joys: Oh God, get I my will,
I'll drive away that Sickness with a kiss:
I need not fain, for I could weep for joy.

It shall be so; come hither Daughter.
Master Haruie, that you may see my love
Comes from a single heart vnfaynedly,
See here my Daughter, her I make thine own:
Nay look not strange, before these Gentlemen,
I freely yield Marina for thy Wife.

Stay, stay good sir, forbear this idle work,
My soul, is labouring for a higher place,
Then this vain transitory world can yield:
What, would you wed your Daughter to a Grave?
For this is but Deaths model in mans shape:
You and Alvaro happy live together:
Happy were I, to see you live together.

Come sir, I trust you shall do well again:
Here, here, it must be so; God give you joy,
And bless you (not a day to live together.)

Hort ye brother, will ye let den ander heb your Wive? nempt haer, nempt haer
your selue?


No, no; tush you be de fool, here be dat sal spoil de marriage of hem: you
have deceue me of de fine Wensh signor Haruey, but I sal deceue you of de mush
Land.


Are all things sure Father, is all dispatch'd?


What interest we have, we yield it you:
Are you now satisfied, or rests there ought?

Nay Father, nothing doth remain, but thanks:
Thanks to your self first, that disdaining me,
Yet loud my Lands, and for them gave a Wife.
But next, unto Alvaro let me turn,
To courteous gentle loving kind Alvaro,
That rather then to see me die for love,
For very love, would loose his beawtious Love.

Ha, ha, ha.


Signor Alvaro, give him de ting quickly sal make hem die, autremant you sal
lose de fine Wensh.


Oyime che hauesse allhora appressata la mano al mio core, o suen curato ate, I
che longo sei tu arriuato, o cieli, o terra.


Am I awake? or do deluding Dreams
Make that seem true, which most my soul did fear?

Nay faith Father, it's very certain true,
I am as well as any man on earth:
Am I sick sirres? Look here, is Haruie sick?

What shall I do? What shall I say?
Did not you counsel me to wed my Child?
What Potion? Where's your help, your remedy.

I hope more happy Stars will reign to day,
And don Alvaro have more company.

Now Anthony, this cottens as it should,
And every thing sorts to his wished effect:
Haruie joys Moll: my Dutchman and the French,
Thinking all sure, laughs at Aluaros hap;
But quickly I shall mar that merry vain,
And make your Fortunes equal with your Friends.

Sir Mowche, what answer brought you back?
Will master Balsaro come, as I requested?

Master Balsaro; I know not who you mean.


Know you not Ass, did I not send thee for him?
Did not I bid thee bring him, with the Parson?
What answer made he, will he come or no?

Sent me for him: why sir, you sent not me,
I neither went for him, nor for the Parson:
I am glad to see your Worship is so merry.

Hence you forgetful dolt:
Look down who knocks?

Oh Master, hang your self: nay never stay for a Sessions: Master Vandalle
confess your self, desire the people to pray for you; for your Bride she is
gone: Laurentia is run away.


Oh de Diabolo, de mal-fortune: is matresse Laurentia gaen awech?


First tell me that I am a lifeless coarse;
Tell me of Doomes-day, tell me what you will,
Before you say Laurentia is gone.

Master Vandalle, how do you feel your self?
What, hang the head? fie man for shame I say,
Look not so heavy on your marriage day.

Oh blame him not, his grief is quickly spied,
That is a Bridegroom, and yet wants his Bride.

Master Pisaro, and Gentlemen, good day to all:
According sir, as you requested me,
This morn I made repair unto the Tower,
Where as Laurentia now was married:
And sir, I did expect your coming thither;
Yet in your absence, we performed the rites:
Therefore I pray sir, bid God give them joy.

He tells you true, Laurentia is my Wife;
Who knowing that her Sisters must be wed;
Presuming also, that you'll bid her welcome,
Are come to bear them company to Church.

You come too late, the Marriage rites are done:
Yet welcome twenty-fold unto the Feast.
How say you sirs, did not I tell you true,
These Wenches would have us, and none of you.

I cannot say for these; but on my life,
This loves a Cushion better then a Wife.

And reason too, that Cushion fell out right,
Else hard had been his lodging all last night.

Master Pisaro, why stand you speechless thus?


Anger, and extreme grief enforces me.
Pray sir, who bade you meet me at the Tower?

Who sir; your man sir, Mowche; here he is.


Who I sir, mean you me? you are a jesting man.


Thou art a Villain, a dissembling Wretch,
Worser then Anthony whom I kept last:
Fetch me an Officer, I'll hamper you,
And make you sing at Bride-well for this trick:
For well he hath deserude it, that would swear
He went not forth a doors at my appointment.

So swear I still, I went not forth to day.


Why arrant liar, were thou not with me?


How say you master Browne, went he not forth?


He, or his likeness did, I know not whether.


What likeness can there be besides himself?


My self (forsooth) that took his shape upon me,
I was that Mowche that you sent from home:
And that same Mowche that deceived you,
Effected to possess this Gentleman:
Which to attain, I thus be guil'd you all.

This is excellent, this is as fine as a Fiddle: you M. Heigham got the Wench
in Mowches apparel; now let Mowche put on her apparel, and be married to the
Dutchman: How think you, is it not a good vize?


Master Pisaro, shake off melancholy,
When things are helpless, patience must be used.

Talk of Patience? I'll not bear these wrongs:
Go call down Matt, and mistress Susan Moore,
Tis well that of all three, we have one sure.

Mistress Susan Moore, who do you mean sir?


Whom should I mean sir, but your Daughter?


You're very pleasant sir: but tell me this,
When did you see her, that you speak of her?

I, late yesternight, when she came here to bed.


You are deceived, my Daughter lay not here,
But watched with her sick mother all last night.

I am glad you are so pleasant M Moore,
You're loath that Susan should be held a sluggard:
What man, t'was late before she went to bed,
And therefore time enough to rise again.

Master Pisaro, do you flout your friends;
I well perceive if I had troubled you,
I should have had it in my dish ere now:
Susan lie here? 'am sure when I came forth,
I left her fast asleep in bed at home;
Tis more then neighbour-hood to use me thus.

A bed at your house? tell me I am mad,
Did not I let her in adores my self,
Spoke to her, talked with her, and canuast with her;
And yet she lay not here? What say you sir?

She did, she did; I brought her to her Chamber.


I say he lies (that saith so) in his throat.


Mass now I remember me, I lye indeed.


Oh how this frets me: Frisco, what say you?


What say I? Marry I say, if she lay not here, there was a familiar in her
likeness; for I am sure my Master and she were so familiar together, that he
had almost shot the Gout out of his Toes ends, to make the Wench believe he
had one trick of youth in him. Yet now I remember me she did not lye here;
and the reason is, because she doth lye here, and is now abed with mistress
Mathea; witness whereof, I have set to my Hand Seal, and mean presently to
fetch her.


Do so Frisco. Gentlemen and Friends,
Now shall you see how I am wronged by him.
Lay she not here? I think the world's grown wise,
Plain folks (as I) shall not know how to live.

She comes, she comes: a Hall, a Hall.


Nay blush not wench, fear not, look cheerfully.
Good morrow Father; Good morrow Gentlemen:
Nay stare not, look you here, no monster I,
But even plain Ned: and here stands Matt my Wife.
Know you her Frenchman? But she knows me better.
Father, pray Father, let me have your blessing,
For I have blessed you with a goodly Son;
Tis breeding here yfayth, a jolly Boy.

I am undone, a reprobate, a slave;
A scorn, a laughter, and a jesting stock:
Give me my Child, give me my Daughter from you.

Master Pisaro, tis in vain to fret,
And fume, and storm, it little now avails:
These Gentlemen have with your Daughters help,
Outstripped you in your subtle enterprises:
And therefore, seeing they are well descended,
Turn hate to love, and let them have their Loves,

Is it even so; why then I see that still,
Do what we can, Women will have their Will.
Gentlemen, you have outreacht me now,
Which ne'er before you, any yet could do:
You, that I thought should be my Sons indeed,
Must be content, since there's no hope to speed:
Others have got, what you did think to gain;
And yet believe me, they have took some pain.
Well, take them, there; and with them, God give joy.
And Gentlemen, I do entreat to morrow,
That you will Feast with me, for all this sorrow:
Though you are wedded, yet the Feast's not made:
Come let us in, for all the storms are past,
And heaps of joy will follow on as fast.
