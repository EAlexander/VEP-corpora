WHy is there no curtesy^ now I am come
I t^owe that all the people be d^me
Or else so god help me and halyd^
They were almost a sleep.
No words I harde, no^ yet no ^lking
No instrument went nor ballattes synging
What ails you all thus ^ sit dreaming
Of whom take ye care?
Of my coming ye may be ^l^d
Therefore I pray you ^
For all your desire shall be had
I can amend your che^e
By God I think ye have forgotten me.
I am wealth of this realm look upon me
For I am to every man loving and fre^ndly
For wealth hath no pere.
Brother wealth have ye not yet done?
ye praise your self above the moon
Every man may perceive thereby soon
That you lack discresyo^

Wherefore, by god I cannot say to much
I am so wealthy of substance and rich
In all the world where is one such
As I am of comparison.

Wealth is good I cannot den^y
Yet praise your self so much ye may
For wealth oftentimes doth decay
And wealth is nothing s^re.

Wealth hath ben ever in thi^ country
And here I p^rpose styll for to be
For this is the land most mete for me
And here I will endure.

Therein ye speak^full louingle
For in this realm wealth should be
yeth no displeasure I pray you heartily
But in the way of communication.
And for pastime I would ^peake some ways
Of no comparison, nor to you no dysp^yre,
I do not intende that manner always,
But for a recreation,

Brother wh^t soever ye say to me.
I will hear yo^ p^ci^tly
I am content and I (...) you heartily
Begin and say your pleasur^

I thank you h^ly th^ will I
Some what unto my purpose apply
Though wealth be praised maru^lu^ly
yet to mine vnderstauding.
Wealth is mutable, and th^t in shame
And wealth is hauty and proud of name
Wealth t^ cruel, and in great blame
For wealth is ^er wauerynge.

To whom have I done any harm can ye say,
ye stander me no^e, yet I trust I may
Answer for my selte in every manner way
ye will not deny that?

God forbid but ye should d^ so
And ye may do it whe^her I will or no
Inlykewise, I must answer you als^
When ye say not true.
Though I be but to you a poor man
yet health I height, the same I am
That is desired universally than
Some calls me as good as you

As I, mary there in deed ye do compare.
Such words might bring you soon in care
Lewd parson, thou art not ware
Of what substance I am

Yes I can tell what you are, be not displeased
wealth is of great substance, that cannot be denied
yet show your commodities, and ye shall be answered
I promise you wellh is fugitive.

What say thou`am I a tagetyue
I was never so taken up in my life
Nor called unsure, well I will make no strife
yet where as thou dost lay,
Thai I should show my commodities always
The best for my self whereof I ask praise
if I should staud her all my life days
yet I could not say.
Nor half the benefits that comes of me
yt cannot be told nor resyted shortly
Wealth is the (...) of althing earthly
That you cannot deny.
Ferste god save, our sovereign Lady the Queen
With all the counsel and all that wish them b^ne
Am not I wealth with them ever at eve
Who should be there but I?
Men of the law, and jolly rich merchants
There be wealthy both of goods and lands,
Without comparison is in their hands
I walth hatg all freasure.

O good sir, of whom comes all this
Of god only, to yo^ no thank I wis
And yet mans wealth ^tands not all in riches
I dare say that boldly,
W^an a man hath a cempetent living
with the grace of god that passes all thing
Love of his neighbor, and good reporting
Then is he wealthy,
Wealth of goods is but a fame
Ye is wel^hy that hath a good name
Every wise man will coueyte the same
For other wealth I not reche
if a man have never so much good name
Every wise man will couey^e the same
if his disposicions be nought and wood
Then he is but a wretch,

Nay thou art a wretch, and a fool vuwyse
wealth of riches thus to despise
Doest thou not se all the world arise
By goods and substance
He that hath plenty of silver and gold
May have all thing whatsoever he would
when can wealth lack, seeing all thing is sold
A^d wealth is of assurance.

I deuye that, your saying is nought
Grace^ heaven, nor cunning, cannot be bought
wi^hout great pain, ad good deeds wrought
Else man cannot them have.

Stop thereat, and hold thy peace
May not men by hea^en with riches
As to bylde churches and make bye ways
Such deeds mans soul doth sans

Yea, ^ut yet ye ^ust mark one s^ynge
if these goods came with wro^ge doyng
Shall ye have heaven for so spending
Or yet a^y mede.
Nay nay except that ma^ himself do meek
And make resysta^ce the right ho^our to seek
Else all such good deeds is not woth a leek
wealth hereof take heed.

Why think thou that all men which h^th wealth
Gets their goods with brybry and s^ealeth
Thy repor^e is nought therefore Helthe
I counsel thee to ^ay the best.

So I will, but yet I must say true
And ^ow a little more I will say to you
Much sorrow and care w^lth doth ^rewe
He i^ seldom in rest.
when a man is a little hit and wealthy
A^d hath in his ^hes^e treasures plenty
Then will he wrangle, and do shreudly
By his power and might.
With his neigh^oures he will go to law
And a wreke his malice for value of straw
wealth is fykle and out ^f awe
wilful in wrong or right

Thou speak with a slanderous tong^
All of evil will, and yet it is wro^e
wealth in this realm hath bin louge
Of me comes great honour.
Because that I wealth ^ath great port^
All the world, hy^her doth resort
Therefore I w^l^h, am this realms comfort,
And here I will endure.

So I wold ye shou^, and I shall do the same
Health I am called, and that is my name
If I would not abide hear I were to blame
For here I am well cheri^hed
Yet say your self, nhw indifferen^ly
And if every man do not love me
Health as well as wealth, yes verily
Thereof I dare be reported

Why should they love thee^ that wo^lde I know
As well as me, I pray you show
I am the superior of hi^ and lowe
No man may compare with me.

To show why I will not be afraid
For I can bide by that I ^aue said
If wealthy men be very well apayd
Or much they set you by.
But of wealth, if they have never so much
Goods, tryasure and gold, and be called rich
Yet if they lack health, there payne is such
That they were better dye.
A man to were gold, and be in pay^e
What joy hath he? none, but would be fain
To give all his treasure for health plain
Or else he were very mad:
For if a man be never so pour
Yet if he have health, that is a treasure,
Then for his living, he may labour
And in his heart be glad,

I never marked thus much, nor understood
That Health was such a treasure, and to man so good
Wherefore I am sorry, a^d I will change my mood
Now I pray you forgive me.

I will forgive or else I were to blame
And I pray you to forgive me the same
I love you heartily, and will praise your name
if it please you to keep my company.

Why tarry sirs whether are ye going
I see well ye looked not for my commi^g
Lo, out of sight out of remembry^g
Abse^ce is cause of strau^gnes,
What look ye on werwhy are ye so strange
From your fellow liberty, doth your minds change
I^ your company I was wont to range
What needs all this business,

By liberty now I do not set
Saying that health and I am met
As feloweh together no man shall let
Me for to love him best.

Let me hear what ye do say
Then ye are about to cast me away
How haps this? mary then I may
Go pike straws and take me rest.
I pray you tell me whom I have o^fended
if I have made a fault it shalde amended
with so short warning let me not be voided
I crow yet ye do but jest.

Why do ye make this cauelacion
we entende to make no alteracyon
wealth and I have had communication
He is my friend of old.

What was the matter, I pray you tell
Me thinks I ought to be of counsel
Or else I promise you ye do not well
With you I should behold.

The matter is done we are agreed
To reason it more it shall not need
O brother health, thou art in deed
More preciouser then gold.

Gods body how comes this ger to pas
I am cast out at the cartes arse
The world is nothing as it was
For I am here refused

Why be you angry that we do agree
Then are ye not wy^e, for if ye love me
I will love him again, so it should be
Or else I were mysaduised

Then of my love ye set no store
My company I see well ye looked notfore
Farewell I will get me out of the door
yet I am your betters and so am I called.

Such presumptuous words will have a fall
your comparison is but feeble and small
What can ye do nothing at all
As you have reputed.

What were ye both two, were not I.
Wretches and caytyfes, look not so hye
Think no scorn hardly
For I may be your pear
if wealth have never so much substance
Lacking Liberty and we^r in durance
Within a white, I am in assurance
ye would pray me come ne'er.
If Health be never so lust and strong
yet if Liberty were kept from him lunge
Then sorrow and care would be his songe.
yt would abate your cheer.
Fie of wealth which lacks ^ybertye
Fie of Health and be in captivity
Fie of riches and lack good company
Liberty hath no pere,

Will ye hear how he doth clatter?
What need ye to rehearse all this matter.
ye know that we twain before any other.
Liberty must needs have styll.
Liberty o^ us is glade to wait
ye sta^de to far i^ your own conceit
I wis lybertye ye ran make no bait
To catch us at your will.

Now there ye lye, I can suffer no lo^ger
Wealth for Liberty doth lobo^re ever
And health for Liberty is a great store
Therefore set me not so light

Liberty I pray the reasou no more
ye are welcome to us as ye were before
In dede of liberty it is great suitor
Therefore welcome by this light

Now I thank you both full kindly
your strange words a little did grene me
And now at your comaudement I am ready
And at your own will.

Mary I am come at the first call
Will, your own man have me who shall
For I am will seruaunt to you al
Ye shall not need to send for me.

Who is acquanted with this man
He is very homely and little good he can
To come in here so boldly, then
D^ue him away quickly,

Why, I cam not till C was called
your own will opeuly ye named
Then I came a pace lest I should be blamed
Ther^ore I pray you let me hyde styll,

Whose will, or what will, doth he mean
Thou art not my will, I forsake thee clean
My will and their wills is often scene
Our wills can none ill

Alas good masters I can none ill
yet by my troth I am your evil will
your will, your will, yonr will, therefore keep m^
I love ye by gods mother,

This is a strange saying unto me
My will, your will, and his will, this cannot be
For in our wiles is great diversity
For one is not like another,

Yet by Christ your own will I am
The maddest will, and the merriest, than
For gods sake now, let me be your man
Till ye have better acquaintance.

I perceive this fellow is kind
And owes to us good will and mind
Some kinds again then let him find
Let him have some furderauuce

By god ^ir and I durst be so bold
A^quaintance of this man claim I would
and ky^ted to, if the troth were told
we be of one consangnynitie

How so? let me here that I pray thee heartily

Will and lyberty^is, of aunci^erie old
with ont lyber^ye, wil^ dare not be^olde
And where will lacks, lybertye is full cold
Thyrfore will and lybertye must needs be of kin.

In dede as he says it may well be
For will ever longs unto lybrtye
Therefore good friend welcome to me
I pray you al be good to him

For your sake he is welcome to b^ all
Let him come to our place an^ than he shall
Have succour of us and help withal
now we will ^epart. And wealth health goth out.

Will ye go hence. I thank ye masters with al my heart
I will s^ke you out I warra^t you fear not
Now they be gone I am glad by saint mary
A little while hear I purpose to tarry
How to deceive wealth, health, and liberty
Now must I deuyse.
For I am a child that is pas grace
I will I am called that in every place
Doth much mi^chiefe this is a plain case
Virtue I do utterly despise,
But if they wit what I were
Then of my purpose I should be never y^ ^ere
I will keep my ^onge le^e that I ^r.
My whole intent and will.
But now I marvel by this day
Where shrewd wit is gone a stray
Some crafty touche is in his way
I here him, peace, stand styll
Dien vous guard playsaunce
On seven or no ^chaunce, what youkers dare avaunt
To play a groat or twain.
Lo hear I have in store
Two or three grotes and no more
I take great thought therefore
For to keep it, it is much payne
I come vow out of a place
where is a company of small grace
Thieves and hores that spends a pace
They were drunken all the sort.
One of their purces I did a spy
Out of his sleue where it did lye
And one wynked on me with his eye
But there began the sporte
Their false falsehode, and I crafty wit
got the purse lo, hear I have it
I ran my way and let him sit
Smoke and shitten arse together.
And if that I had ill will here
with this money we would make good chere
Gentle brother will, I pray the appear
For thou art in some corner.

I would come in but I am a feared
Least that I be taken by the beard
With some catchepol, I have heard
How thou haste stolen a purse

Thou horsou art thou mad, cum in I say
This is not the first hazard that I have escaped
if I make au hand to deck my felfe gay
what am I the worse.

From thy company I cannot abide
I must ^edes hold upon ^hy side
y^wyll and shrewd wit who ca^ hyde
For they will be together.

Now welcome will and what ch^a^:
By god I thought for thee a tho^sand year
P^ace for gods body who cummeth there

But go thy way they be not here that promot y^ ca

Cant ye me a de house dragen van degrot here.

Hauce ye must go to y^ court for wealth inquire

What segre ye wealth nenyke he is net whore

Be shrew your whoreson s^eminges heart therefore.
in dede as he saith, by war in ^lauders theris wealth store

Segt ye dat brower, by the moder got dan
Gut nought it mot waft, to sent cafrin to mi lanina

Is he gone, farewell hanykin hows
I pray god give him a hounded drouse
For I trow a knave brought him to house
But now brother wit.
We must deuo^e how that we may
Be in service with wealth always
Let me here what thou can do or say
To help for to contryue it.

For thy pleasure that I shall
This will I do first of all
Flatter and lye, and evermore call
Them my good masters styll.
Then with swering, lying and powlinge
Brybry theft, and privy pyking
Thus I shred wet, will ever be doing
I warrant there ill will.

I ^un thee thank, this is well devised
And I ill will, would have every man despised
B^ now another thing must be con^riued
O^ else al will be nought
There is one they call good remedy
I^ this realm, he hath gee^t actor^y
He is a no^le m^ and much worthy
M^ny thiuges he hach wrought
He is called l^st, discreet and indifference
Willing to fulfil his souer^i^es commandment
H^ is not afraid to do right punishment
T^erfore of him I am afraid

So an I to this makes me very sad
Yet oftentimes I h^e been harde bestadde
N^w yt I ^m ^a^ned of him I am v^ry glad

Beware of that, what doth he say?
Beguile us all, yet I charge ye ^ay
Ye shall not beguile us if I may
I will beware betyme.

Sir be not angry I you pray

He means ^hat he will be profitable always
And save you many things.

What he means I can^ot te^
But his saying is not well
Depart hence sirs by my council
And tarry us at our lodging.

Now and it please ye, will ye ^ere any synging
Therein I tell you I am s^what ^o^nyng

Sir I pray you sing and ye ran

Now will I begin like a lusty blood tha.
Sirs now go your way of you I am glad
As of any ser^auntes that ever I had
For these can do doth good ^o bad
We must needs have such men
What were we if we lacked will:
And without ^yt we ^oulde live ill
Therefore will and wit I will ^epe styll.
I promise you I love them

Sir your maystership is ^a^tely welcome
T^ke your place here above as it is reason.

I pray you ^ardon us, we know not what ye be
ye seem a man of honour, and of great anctority

S^r to know wherefore ye come we are desyrons

I am be that ought for to be well known
Of you three specially, and of duty
Great payne and business as for mine own
For you I have taken because I lo^e you heartily
To m^i^taine you is all my de^yre and faculty
yet hard it is to do, the people be so variable
And many be so wilful, they will not be reformable.

Sir I pray you pardon us of our ignorance now
I se well ye know us better tha^ we do yo^

I pardon you, for I do know you w^l both
wel^h, and ^l^h, is your ^
Th^ which ^ngla^d to forbe^e were very lot^
For by wealth and health comes ^re al sa^es

For that were to lunge to reher^e of a surety
And I desire you all or to be loving ^o me
For your own ease, come w^lth and profyt

Good remedy, then we ^anst des^re yo^r aydyng
For by good remedy comes all ou^ preferri^g.

All that I do intende, if ye^ will thereto agr^e
And to be reformable for your own case
It is not the thing that lies only in me
But my good will, therefore I will not cease
To have your love a^d favour, and thereby to please
Al the world over, and to promote ^his realm
That you three may prosper, ye perce^ue what I mene
The chief part of all wealth lies in great estates
Their substance and lands. is right commendable
Prelates of the church is wealthy of riches
Merchautes hath marchaudise goods iucoperable
Me of ^aw franklins is wealthy which i^ laudable
Th^s wealth of riches is divided diverse ways
A^d to these ma^ charges, come now a days

My heart re^o^se^h to ^er^ your good reporting

Forsooth here is (...) half^ that I cou^ re^erse
The benefits of god that ^e shows to you wealth

That no^e of you shall diminish nor amiss^ be ^ane
I good remedy therefore may will speak^ won^ blae
For the come wealth, health both of the soul b^dy

Our lord con^inue ye, we thank you har^ly
Both for your good i^struction, and for your kindness
That you int^nd^ so well for us good remedy
when we have need we will desire your goodness

When we be infect in the soul or body
Then will I seek good remedy for succo^r
As yet I thank god I have no need greatly
if I have then will I seek to have your favour

Sir now we will depart hence with yo^r licence

For other diverse business that we mus^ have tohether
Sirs I am coutent, now when ye will depart
To god I commit yo^ I will not make you tarry
But yet I pray with all my mind and heart
Take heed in any wise exchewe i'll shrewd company

Farewell good remedy well to fare.

I pray god be ^our speed preserve you fro pain
it is mi mind ye should prosper I wold have it so ^ain.

Here is none of our acquaiutauce will re^our^eth
we have made to louge tar^aunce
that will y^ say perc^unce
And they begone home come away apar^

Nay by god not so ^astie
A little while we will larye
Good even s^r to you mary
Dwell ye in this place?

Nay good fellow I dwell not ^eare
Wherefore doest thou ^hat inqui^:
Would thou ought with any ^eare
Speak ^e not afryde

By God I would I had yo^r gown
And were a mile without the town
Thereon A would borrow a crown
It is I that so said

Hew look thou one him half a scorn
I p^omise you he is a scant gentleman bor^e
What suy^st thou in his face

For somewhat in his face I lok^e
In dede his mastership stands a crook^
For false shrews both of you I took
And children that be past grace.

I will swear for him, as ^or this years twenty
that he hath ben ever as true as I
yet sometime he will steal and make a (...)
He is of my alyaunce.

In good faith the same think I
That ye be both like, full unthrifty
Sirs how do ye live, show me quickly
Or I shall put you in durance

How live we? mary our meat
Cummest thou hither for to threte:
So lordly sir wittam doth speak
From wh^n^e doth he come can ye show

What dost thou aisle can thou tell?
Hast thou any thing with us to mell?
By the mass thy hands doth tykell
Thou shalt bear me a blow.

you false thieves I know ye well
I shall let your purpose ^u^y deal
ill will, and shrewd wit, the devil of hell
Take ye both for me.

Mary thou lie, our names be not so
Call us but wit, and will, add no more thereto,
if thou doest thou were as good no
We shall handle you shrewdly

Sirs farewell here I will no longer abide
For you both shortly I will provide
Tha^ all your ^al^e craft shall be out tried
And our subtillitie known

To go so soon the whoreson was wise
therefore some now I must devise
that each man may wealth, health and liberti despise
Or else he will mar all our mateer.
Brother wat, let me alone
When they come you shall see me a none
C^mplayne of him^ unto them ec^one
And put him out of favour

Peace no mo word^s, for they come yonder

Sirs I am glade that you h^ hear
How doth all our houshold^ with them what chere^
Is every thi^g in order there
A^ir^ our intent?

ye sir they be all merry and glad
With revel and ^out sometime they be mad
Pipe whore bo^t heef, every knave and drabe
Is at our commaundeme^t.
What do ye say, then ^e are to blame
A^d we put you in trust for the same
To keep such rule, it is a shame
It is not for our honour^

By the mass ^he whoreson doth lye
There is no such rule by gods body
A man may break his ^eck as lightly
As his fast in your kechin, or seller truly.
With that another I am ^o^ co^te^t
I would there should be libera^itie compe^et
A^d with honesti it is con^enient
That our nei^hbour fare the better

you be a^g^y with all that we have done
Cum away brother let us go ^eus soon
I know a n^w m^ister where we shall be welcum^
God be with ^ou gentle master

Why will ye begone ^or a word
P^raduenture we did but board
Me think ye should your master ford
For to speak my mind.

Nay ^ay, I can tel what was the matter
Remedy was here, and he did ^latter
ye trust he more than us and better
But mark the end, what ye shall find

With good remedy we spake in dede
To ^low his counsel we had need
He warned us that we should take heed
Of excess and prodigality.

I marvel ye speak so of good remedy
It is I that can do more than be
Wit can make shyft at necessit^
When Remedi cannot be heard
I know some that hath this thousand year
Sought god remedy and yet never the ne'er
wit can put remedy by, yea this is clear
For wit is a crafty lad.

And will is an ungracious stay
Will hath done many things me^ say
And if ye let wit and will go his way
ye will repent it soon.

Why what cause have you to go your way
ye shall abide which us though you say nay
I will follow will, and wit always
And so I have ever done

if I wilt al my masters would so do
Then from your service I would ^ot goo
Speak ^ow whe^her ye will or no
And let us know your mind

Sirs ye be welcome to me plain
And for your company I am full fain
I had lever suffer great payne
Then to leave my wit and will,

Then let us go hence, with ki^dnes my herye do kill

I pray you let us go, wherefore do we bide styll.

As touching my first purpose hither I am com again
I trow ye k^ow me, good remedy is my name
That every day doth take great^ abor or payne
To amend all faults, I am chosen to the same
if any ma^s conscience here doth grudge or shame
Having in him self remorse, mends in time space
I am good remedy, and god is full of mercy and grace
Therefore I will stand aside, a little while remain
Of wealth, Health and Lybertye, for to inquire
How they be ordered, and if any man complain
I will be glad to show me remedy, my think I se one appear.

There is to mainy allaunts in this real, but now I

Is he gon^ I pray god the devil go with him
where is wealth, health ^iberty. I wold see the come i^

Health comes in with a kercher on his head.
O good lord help me, by yonr licence my souerain
I am homely to com her in your presence thus diseased
Need constrains me, for remedy I wold have fain
I am ifect both body soul, I prai you be not displesed

Why what ail you show me, yet you I do not know
Glad I am to remedy auy man, that is affirmity
I perceive by your phisnamy, yt ye are very weke feeble low
yet show me your g^iefe, I will help you gladl^.

Gracio{us} remedi I tha^k you, yet I am half ashamed
to show you mi maladi mi name, I was cal^ed health
Therefore I am well worthi to be punished blamed
Because I have not followed your counsel, but al thing
may be suffered save wealth.

Are you health, this makes me very pe^i^e and sad
yet be of good chere, show how you were infect
To remedy you a^d succour you I wold be very glad
For god will pu^ish the people when they be de^elt

Sir I thank god thereof for well worthy I am
My conscien^e doth judge, some trouble have I must
A me^des I will make to god and if I can
Will ad wit hath deceived me in them I put my trust.

if thou have ^oone amiss, and be sorry therefore
Then helfe ame^des is made, for that is contrission
Let that pass, now will I axe you one thing more
Where be wealth ad Liberty, be they of good disposition

As for wealth is fallen in decay, and neces^itie
By wast war, thorough ill will, and ^hrewd wit
And liberty is kept in durance and captiuite
God help us all, and send us good remedy for it

For to hear this tale it makes my hart heavy
yet be of good comfort, god is full of grace, I am good

Sir, the I beseech you help us in the way of charity

I would fain but I cannot tel which way to begin
Except I might catch will wi^, then I trow I could
Tie the shorter, for they destroy wealth, health liberty bi sin
if I had ye thieves, puni^h the extremely I wole.

You may soon catch them, if ye will stand a side
From this place they two, will uot^onge abide.

Me thinke^h I here them com, help to hold the fast will turns

Cum in wit for here is no body
We may ve bold and talk largely
Our hearts to ease and show plainly
What we have done.

I must needs laugh I cannot forbear
To remember war^e that knave will ye hear
The whoreson fleming was be ^itten for fear
Because he should boyde so soon.
Herke now do I marvel by this bread

For I we^ surely ^hat h^lth be dead
I saw saw him go with a kercher on his head
As he should go to hanging.

Hark in thine Ear, if t^e whoreson hap
To complain to him that weres the red cap
I fear theu shortly he will us cla^
By the heles from out liuing^

Nay nay, there is no doubt
By him I have reported all about
Tha^ he doth not well, his good name to put out
ylwyl cannot say well,

Friend therein thou art the more to blame
Cos^au^der me wro^gfully, and vudesr^ued
But or thou drpart thou shalt answer for the same.
where is Wealth liberty, how hast thou the ordered?

Qury cicis quest is un malt ombre
Me is un spy nardo compoco pa^lauere.

Thou folse thief is thine English tongue gone
as mischeuo{us} il will shrewd wit, ye have destroyed mani on

Sir hurt not me, I will tel you troth anon
This same i^ as false a knave as ever cam within saint Iohes

Per amorde my as pi ca un poco
Eo queris and a^ pour lag^n^ creae so

I can not tel what thou dost m^ae blabbler:
But you shalt speak English confess an other matter,

Sir I beseech your lordship, in the way of charity
Let not these thefes escape your hands they have destroyed us v^terly.

Sir, believe him not he speaks but of malice only
we be true men, thereof we shall fetch good witness
An honest man that shall be bound for him and me
The law saith plain, nulla fides con^estes
that is troth, but who will be witness or bound for the

There is three among you in this hows

I Iyf^o to fetch them quickly

They will come vnsed for I warrant you if they will

what be their names, tel me what they be,

That on is Iohn Irische and Iohn s^oler
But full these be honest men all thr^

Trust not their words they will dessemble styll
They are so false and cra^y, all ^heyr intent is ill.

ye lye falsely, I ^peake but right a^d reason
And by the law of arms ye must ned^s be ^ane
you a^e called good remedy which a^ al season
Should leave to mans life, and ma^taine the same
we be he^e ^oth your prisoners wrongfully accused bi de^ame
Keep ou^ of us fast let him lye for all
That other sor friends and wytnes goo shall.

Sir let him not goo a^d le^e me behind
He will ever ^e a false knave, for I k^ow his mind

Hold thy tongue folis^ k^aue I do not mean so

I here now ye ca^not agree, which of you should go

No by gods body there shall none go but I

Tho^ play the knave it must needs be I

Keep them safe I pray you for if they scap again
Many me^ shall repent it, it shal^e to our pay^e

They be here yet, to keep them fast is mine inteut,
Have them away both to prison in continent.

Lo false knave this is for thy crafty wi^.
Now fast by the heals we are lake to sit.

I am co^ent so that I may have comp^ny
if I should be hanged, I wold be hagged honest

Go bence with them bring wealth liberty.

Com away ye thenes, now I shall keep you s^rely,

Lock us up keep us as fast as ye can
yet ill will and ^rewd wit shall be with many a man.

I am half ashamed, that long i^ hath ben said
That noble men by such wretches hath ben decei^ed
they did rejoice and jest, and were very well apaid
Trusting to ^cape clea^e, and ^tyl for to have rained
But now they shall not so, let them be well assured
That ylwyl and shrew de wit shall have but i'll rest
For wheresoever they be I will break^ their nest

In the honour of god we ask you forgeue^es al th^e
we ought to be ashamed ^o look you in the face
By our folly negligence, we have done so unwisely
we were towel deceived, we p^t us to your grace
This shall be a good warding for us along space
when man is well punished then he will beware
w^o that knows what need is, well after dread ^are

I may not blame you greatly for by mine own reason
I know ylwyl and shrewd wit deceives great small
if ye can remabre thys^ and beware a ^other season
This is a good example and lerni^g to you all
Now serve god and love him, for grace ever call
And ylwyl and shrewd wit, from yo^ I shall ab^taine
ye have vs^d them to lunge to your damage and pain.

Forsooth sir ye sai troth, they did us great disp^esur
Full hard it is to banquishe the vngr^cious ylwyl
He is so crooked, by slattery, dissula^ion such other
Man mind i^ so var^able, glad to report i'll
I fear many one yet would have him rain styll
For some unto their own will hath so much affection
yet the devyl an^ i'll will is both of o^e complexion

ill will is nought, but worse is shrewd wit
For he contryueth al subtle ymanginacien
yt were impossible for a man else to do it
shrewd wit breweth myscef^ false conspyracion
He hath put me liberty in prison, ad great at tribulation
if it had not been for your good remedi fortherauce
I ^ other yt hath liberty, should have be in durance.

Be al of good chere, and have no mistrust
The e^de of i'll will and shrewd wit is but shame
Though they reygue a while, wrongfully and vniu^
yet truth will appear and their misdedes blame
Then wro^ge (...) su^ued, and good remedy ta^
Though ^alsehodeloke, and hide his matters all
Craft w^l out and disce^te will have a fall
Whereas ye are now, in distress all three
Near were ye brought in case like ^o mar
Now have ye no dou^t, if ye will ^e ruled after m^
I shall restore ye again as well as ever ye were
Wealth keep styll this realm, look ye stray not fa^
And Health be of good chere, yo^r disease I ca^ soon mede
Liberty now ye ^e released do no more off^nd,

Now let us al thake god ye good remedy hath s^ude
Trust to him only for his grace and goodness
we are forgiveness o^ our trespa^ I trust we will amed
And clean for^ake syn, folly, and vnthriftines
(...) we will here conclude, sovereign of your graciousnes
we beseech you to ^emyt our negligence, misbehauor
There we have said amiss, we commit also your favour

And for your preservation heartily we will pray
your realm to increase, w^th ^oy a^d tranquillity
That wealth, health liberty, may co^tinne here always
By the oversight and aide of him that is good remdy
which willingly doth his deu^, under your actoritye
As part here apereth your p^rpose to mai^taine
God continue his good^es, that lunge he may riagne

Iesu preserne queen Elizabeth ye noble pricis worthy
Iesu continue her health long for to endure
Ies^ endue her w virtue grace honour
Iesu maintain the lords of ye counsel to exec^te good remedi ever
Iesu speed and help al them gods honour to further
Iesu increase the comunaltie to prosper and do well.
