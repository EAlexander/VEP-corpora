Nature:

A goodly interlude of Nature copylyd by master Henry Medwall chapleyn to the
right reverent father in god Iohan Morton sometime Cardinal and arch bishop of
Canterbury


Thalmyghty god / that made each creature
As well in heaven / as other place erthly
By his wise ordynaunce / hath purueyd me nature
To be as mynyster / under him immedyately
For thencheson / that I should perpetually
His creatures / in such degre maintain
as yt hath pleased / his grace for them to ordeyne
To me yt longs by natural engendure
thing to contynew / that hath spyryte of life
which / no were my help should never endure
But suddenly peryshe / and wax all caytyfe
Atwyxt thesementys / that whylom were at strife
I have swagged / the old repugnaunce
and knyt them together / in manner of alyaunce
The I have ordained / the goddess Deane
Lady of the see / / and every fresh fontayn
which comenly decreceth / when she gynneth wane
And waxes abundant / when she creceth again
Of eb and flode / she is cause certain
and reyneth as princes / in every yle and town
That with the see / is compassed enuyron
I am causer / of such impressyon
as appears wonderouse / to mannys sight
As of flammes / that from the sterry regyon
Seems to fall / in times of the night
Some shot sydelong / and some down right
which causes the ignorant / to stand in dread
that sterrys do fall / yet falls there none in dede
What needs yt to speak / of things here by low
as fowls / bestys / and fish in their hynde
Of trees / herbys / and stones how they grow
In which / men sondry and meny virtuous find
One thing be ye sure / and thynk yt in your mind
No manner creature / may take on hy^ure
Of these works / but only I nature
And plainly there is / in earth no manner thing
That is not partyner / of my influence
I do provide / for every best living
Of natural food / always suffycence
And give them also / a manner of prudence
Whereby they may / naturallyensew
Thing that is delectable / and tother exchew
Who taught the cock / his watch hours to observe
And sing of courage / with shyrll throat on hye
who taught the pellycan / her tender hart to carve
For she nolde suffer / her byrdys to dye
Who taught the nyghtyngall / to record besyly
Her strange entuny^ / in sylence of the night
Certes I nature / and none other wight
But if that I / should clepe to memory
Each strange effect / and every great marvel
That I have caused / I ensure you faithfully
That rather time / than process should me fayll
yt were your payne / and to me but trauayll
All such maters / as now to bring in place
Wherefore I let pass them / tell other time and space
But if ye covet / now to know theffecte
Of things natural / by true conclusion
Counsel with Arystotell / my philosopher elect
Which hath left / in bokys of his tradycyon
Now every thing / by heuynly constellacyon
Is brought to effect / and in what manner wise
As far as mannys wytt / may naturally compryse
Wherefore sith god / of his great largess
Hath thus enryched me / with dower of his grace
And made me as who says / a wordly goddess
Of duty I can / no less do in this case
But with hart{is} joy / and entyere solace
My self address / to do his high pleasurs
And to this same / move all other creaturs
Enforce you therefore / his creaturs each on
To honour your maker / with humble obeisance
Nomely thow man / I speak to the alone
Byfore all other / as chyef of his creance
Think how he / hath made the to this semblance
Pluck up thyn heart / and hold thyn head upright
and ever more / have heaven in thy sight
Ouyde in his book / cleped the transformacyon
among all other his fables and poesyes
Makes specyall / mensyon of thy creacyon
Showing how god / wondrously began deuyse
when he the made / and gave to the thempryse
Of all this world / and feoffed the with all
as chyef possessyoner / of things mortuall
In token whereof / he gave the upright visage
and gave the in commandment / to lift thyn eye
Up to ward heaven / only for that usage
Thow should know him / for thy lord almighty
all other bestys / as things unworthy
To behold therth / with grovelling countenance
and be subdued / to thyn obeisance
But as touching / the cause specyally
wherefore I have ordained the / this night to appear
It is to put the / in knowledge and memory
To what intent / thow art ordained tobe here
I let the wit / thou art a passanger
That hast to do / a great and lunge voyage
and through the world / most be thy passage
Address the self / now towardys this iournay
For as now thou shalt / nolenger here abide
Lo here Reason / to govern the in thy way
and sensualyte / upon thyn other side
But reason I depute / to be thy chyef gyde
with innocence / that is thy tender noryce
Evermore to wene the / from thappetyte of vice

O lord of lords / my lord god immortuall
To the be honour / and joy ever to endure
whose heuenly empyreshall never be final
But world without end / remain stable and sure
whom heaven and hell / and erthly creature
with one assent / and all with one accorde
Honours / praises / and knowlegeth for their lord
To the mine head / I humbly incline
Thanking thy grace / that first hast ordained me
To be as a syly creature of thine
and after that / of thy great bownte
Thou hast me set / in sovereign degre
and given me the profettys / of every erthly thing
as well of frutys / as of bestys living
and that that is / also most precyouse
thou hast me enspyred / with heuenly wisdom
whereby I may / do worhys meruaylouse
In every place / where soever I come
Of each perfection / thy grace hath sent me some
So that I know / that creature no where
Of whose virtue / I am not partyner
I have as hath / each other element
among other in this world / a come being
with herbys and trees / continual noryshement
that is suffysant / to natural living
with sensual bestys / I have a manner of knowing
whereby I should / in good thing{is} delyte
and flee the contrary / of mine appetite
And over all this / thou hast given me virtue
Surmounting all other / in high perfection
That is understanding / whereby I may auew
And well dyscerne / what is tobe done
yet for all that / have I fre eleccyon
Do what I will / be yt evil or well
And am put in the hand / of mine own counsel
and in this point / I am half angelyke
Unto thy heuenly spyrytys / almost eagle
albeit in some part / I be to them unlike
For they be ordained / to endure perpetual
and I wretched body / shall have my funeral
When yt pleases / thy grace so to provide
Man is not ordained / always here to abide
Wherefore unto thy sovereign and high estate
Most heuenly prince / I make mine oryson
Sith yt hath pleased / thy noble grace algate
That I unworthy / of so great renown
In this world / shall have possession
thou give me grace / my self to enure
as may me profit / and be to thy pleasure

God hath herd thy prayer / makynd no dout
In all thy requestys / and right full petycyon
Now forth thy iournay / and loke well about
that thou be not / deceived by falls prodycyon
Let reason the govern / in every condition
For if thou do not / to his rule incline
yt will to thy great myschef and ruin
I wot well sensualyte / is to the natural
And granted to the / in thy first creacyon
But notwythstandyng / yt ought tobe overall
Subdued to reason / and under his tuycyon
Thou hast now lybertye / and need no maynmyssyon
And if thou abond the / to passyons sensual
Farewele thy lybertye / thou shalt wax thrall

What lady nature / have I none intresse
As well as reason / or innocence
Thank ye this lady / a good process
That they are advanced / and I let go by
ye know right well / that I ought naturally
Byfore all other / to have of him the cure
I am the chyef perfection of his nature
Alas what could / the sely body do
Or how should yt live / no were the help of me
Certes yt could not well / crepe nor go
At the lest wise yt should / neither feel here nor se
But be as other / incensate bodies be
In mouche wurscase / than worms of the grownde
In which vnneth / any tokyn of life is found
Mesemeth yt should / abhort him for to here
That I destrayned / should be in any wise
Standing that I / was create tobe his fere
Of all his guiding / to take thenterpryse
And now ye put me out of his service
And have assigned / reason to be his guide
With innocence his noryse / thus am I set a side
ye clepe him lord / of all bestys living
And nothing worthy / as far as I can se
For if there be in him / no manner of feeling
No no lively quyknes / what lord is he
A lord made of clout{is} / or karued out of tree
And fares as an image / araued out of stone
That nothing else can do / but stand alone
If ye intend / hymto contynew lunge
In honour / or worldly felycyte
He most needs follow / his apetyte among
And conferme him self / to the more part
I tell you men / will have no deynte
to do service / or homage to a block
all the world will / thynk yt but a mock
Suffer me therefore / to have with him a rome
and to be with him / as chyef counseyll
and if he do so / I thynk to dome
He shall reygn in the world / as chyef governor
But if Reason / tykyll him in the ere
Or bear him on hand the how is wood
He shall never be able / to do erthly good

My friend as I / said to you byfore
a Rome shall ye have / no man saith nay
But reason must be / preferred evermore
For he can best led him to the way
Of virtue and grace / whereby he may
Longest continue / to goddyshygh pleasure
To ye which end / god hath ordained this his creature
Content thy self / now with Reason my friend
And medyll the no further / than thou hast to do
Thou hast brought many a man / to a wrecched end
And so thou would spyll / his creature also
But what so ever he say / take no heed thereto
without that Reason / will allow the same
For who so doth the contrary / deserves myche blame
God and I Nature / have set the in better case
Than any creature / under the firmament
Abuse not man / abuse not thy grace
Of god almighty / that from above is sent
Thou shalt be the first / that shall repent
If ever thou fl / Reason and sue folly
when onys thou felest / the sinert of mysery
But be of confort / hardly god shall send
Both ghostly aid / and worldly help also
And I shall never / fayll unto thy lyf{is} end
To mynyster unto the / as me owes to do
To yender the world / which thou must needs to
Now shape the thither / there is no more to say
Thy lord and mine / guide the in thy way

Well lady nature leave / ye me in this case
Shall I have of you / none other confort
By cryst yet / will I not hyde my face
For as soon as we / shall to the world resort
I put no doubt / he will me support
He hath ben my good master meny a day
And he will not se me / thus cast away

(...)
^
(...) and wotyst not why
(...) body / will demean him thus
be sure thy mind (...) all erronyous
(...) self well / and (...)
Which (...) thyn and others confusion

ye Reason sir ye speak (...) a noble man
but yet are ye take / with a (...) of ouersyght
What wold ye make me / stand as a sordan
And not speak an word / for mine own right
I se yt well / that if your lordship might
by means possible / onys bring yt about
your self should be a ruler / and I but a cast owt

A rular? certes and so I owght to be
and a lord also / though ye say yt in scorn

A lord? whose lord.

Thy lord

Nay so mote I the
thou lie / yt may no lengar be forborne
thou camyst but to night / may hap go to morn
For if thou be as haute / as thou begynnest
thou shalt avoid / myche sonar than thou wenuyst

As for mine auoydaunce / how soon so ever yt be
It shall not skill / as for this intent
But he that first flees / or forsakes me
He shall have greets / occasyon to repent
It shall be to his great trouble and turment
that he hath lest Reason / and suyd his own folly
that thereby is fallen / to wretched penury
But now as touching / the honour and degre
that I am ordained to / I will thou understand
that almighty god / of his grace and bounty
Of the and such / hath given me the over hand
And will that I use / the as a seruand
to advise the and reform the / when thou gynst to err
And to clepe the homward / if thou rayll to far
And where thou say / thou art so necessary
that man without the / can have no living
as in that point / we shall not myche vary
I wot thou art necessary / to his being
But be thou sure / that is not the very thing
That makes him / to appear so wonderouse
and to be in his nature so noble and precyouse
(...) a thing that doth (...) far exceed
All other perfecc^s / and vertuouse natural
For sensualyte / in very dede
Is but a mean / which causes him to fall
In to much folly / and makes him besty all
So that there is no difference / in that at the lest
Bytwyxt man / and an vnresonable best
But this other / comes of great tenderauce
and spyrytuall love / that god owes to mankynde
whom he hath create / to his own semblance
and endued / with a wonderouse mind
whereby he may well dyscerne and find
Suffysant difference / bytwyxt good and bad
Which is to be left / and which is to be had
Lo this is yt / that doth him dygnyfye
and causes him to be / reputed so excessent
and of all this / the chyef doar am I
which from heaven in to earth by god am sent
Only for that cause / and final intent
That I should this his creature / demean and guyd^
For the season that he doth in this world abide
Now compare thy virtues / and mine together
and say which is / the wurthyar of them to

Which is the worthyar? forsooth I trow neither
we be good felowys.

Nay my friend not so
Thou ought to obey me / where so ever I go

Nay that shall I never do / for to dye
I shall be thy fellow be / loke thou never so hye
And therefore hardly / be somewhat selo wlyke
Leave thyn hawt conceytys / and take a meetly way
For shame of the world man / let us not styk
at a matter of tyght noght / and travers here all day
Have me in few words man / and hark what I say
Medyll thou in no point / that belongs to me
and I shall promise the / neu er to medyll with the
And standing the nonage / of this gentleman
On my apparel / take no care therefore
I shall demean yt / as well as I can
till he be passyd. xl. yerys and more
and reason then / if ye will vndershore
His crooked old age / when lusty youth is spent
Than take upon you. I hold me content
For trust ye me / the very troth is this
this man is put / in his own lybertye
And certainly / the fre choice is his
Wheder he will be governed / by the or by me
Let us therefore put yt / to his own ieopardye
and therein stand / to his arbytrement
To which of us twain / he had sever assent

Nar syrnot so / I know his fraylte
the body is / disposed for to fall
Rather to the worse / than the better part
Butrt be helped / by power supernal

yet Reason / when thou hast said all
if thou se him not / take his own way
Call me cut / when thou metest me another day

For cartayne yet / according to mine offyce
I must aduertyse / and counsel him at the lest
to hawnt virtue / and schew all vice
And therein assyst him / to the vttermest
and if he will / algatys be a best
And take none heed / to my lore and doctrine
The apparel and hurt / shall be his and not mine

Sirs I shall answer / for this man as yet
That he is maiden / for all such folly
as should dystayne nature / or dishonour yt
Brought up with me / full well and tenderly
wherefore I dare / the surelyar testyfye
for innocence / that he is yet vyrgyn
Both for dede / and eke consent of syn
And lengar will not I be of his acquaintance
Than he is vertuouse / and of good living
for fleshly lust / and worldly plesaunce
is with innocence / nothing according
But if his behauyour / and daily demeaning
Be of such draught / as reason will allow
I shall him favour / and love as I do now

Well spoken and wisely / now have ye all done?
Or have ye ought else / to this man to say

O sir ye.

piece no more of this dysputacyd
Here be many fantasies / to drive forth the day
That one chatreth like apye / that other like aiay
And yet when they both / have done what they can
Magry them teeth / I shall rule the man

O blessyd lord / what manner stryf is this
At wyxt my reason / and sensualyte
That one means well / and that all other amysse
In one is sekernes / and in the other great fraylte
And both they be / so annexed to me
That need I must / with one of them abide
Lord as thou thynkyst best / for me do provide
For I am wondrously / entryked in this case
and almost brought / into perplexyte
Not wythstandyng / thanked be thy grace
as I did never assent / no agree
To thing that should / be contraryouse unto the
Of sinful ded / and thought all innocent
Subduyd to reason / as his obedyent

Cryst grant you therein / good contynuaunce
to be ever / of the same mind and intent
But now will ye call / to your remembrance
For what cause / ye be hyder sent
I hold yt well done / and right expedyent
that ye were brough / unto the worldys presence

Be yt so in goddess name / I pray you go we hens

And will ye that I / shall for you declare
Unto the world / the cause of your coming
What is your intent / and what parson ye are

ye I wold be glad / that every thing
Be done even / after your deuysyng

Shall I than stand / as I were tong tide

ye hardly / till reason have said

Sir world / yt is the mind and also pleasure
Of lady nature / as she bad us to you tell
that ye accept / and receive this her creature
With you for a season / here to dwell
Despryng you heartily / to entreat him well
with all the favour / that ye can deuyse
Wherein ye shall do her / great pleasure and service

Sirs ye be welcome / to us heartily
your messagye is / to us right acceptable
Be ye assured / there is nothing erthly
to us so joyful / no yet so delectable
As to be acquainted / with parsons honourable
Namely souch / as ye seem to be
Men of high honour / and of great dygnyte
And as touching the message / that ye have brought
Have thereof / the full mind and intent
Assuring you that our bysy thought
Shall be to do / dame naturys commandment
and thereunto / we will be dylygent
To do her pleasurys / in that we may
And so we wold / ye should to her say
And were ye show / unto me that this man
Is ordained to reygne / here in this empry
I assent well / for or nature began
To shape the world / the thought fynally
to ordeyne man / therein to occupy
He to take upon him / as mighty governor
Having all thing / subdued to his power.
Wherefore I receive / greatly his coming
Mankynde sir / heartily welcome ye be
ye are the parsone / without feigning
that I have evermore / desired to se
Come let me kys you. O benedycyte
ye be all naked / alas man why thus
I make you sure / yt is right perylous.

I thank you / but I need none other vesture
Nature hath clothed me / as yet suffysantly
Gyltles of syn / and as a maiden pure
I were on me / the garment of innocence

ye hardly were that garment continually
It shall thy body / suffysantly safeguard
From stormy weder my life to ieopard

Be piece / fair woman ye are not very wise
Care ye not / if this body take cold
ye must consider / this is not paradyse
No yet so temporate / by a thousand fold
Whose so lives here / be he young or old
He must suffer / both fervent cold and hete
And be out of temperance / oft time in his diet
Also he must needs / do as the world doth
That intends any while / here to reygne
And follow the gyse that now a day goth
As for as his estate / may yt maintain
And who doth the contrary / I will be plain
He is abyect / and dyspysed utterly
and stands ever baneshed / from all good company
Sith god therefore / had ordained this body
To dwell here / in this erthly regyon
Of conuenyence / he must him self apply
To worldly thing{is} / and be of such condition
As all men be / and leave each fond opynyon
That is not approuable / of wysar men than he
to take such way / yt is but vanyte.
Take this garment / man do as I you bid
Be not ashamed / hardly to do yt on
So so / now this gurdell / have gurd yt in the mid
And this for your head / go set yt upon
By the charge of me / you be a goodly on
As ever I saw / sith yt I was borne
Worth a thousand / that ye were beforne.
Give me your hand / be not in fere
Sytdown / as ye are borne to occupy this place
I give you here / auctoryte and power
Over all thing / that conceived is in the space
Of all the earth / that round is in compace
To be as lord / of every regyon
and thereof I give you / pessyble possession.

Blessyd be thou / my lord most bounteouse
that of thy great / abundant cheryte
Me thy wretched creature / hast honoured thus
with natural gyftys / and worldly dygnyte
Now I beseke the / for thy great pity
Sith thou hast set me / in so noble way
Suffer me not here after / wrechedly to decay
For certes yt is / mine hartys desire
So to demayn me / in this life present
As may be most / unto thy pleasure
and unto nature / not dysconuenyent
This is my will / and my chyef intent
this will I observe / thy grace to borrow
though I therefore / suffer mouche worldly sorrow

Forsooth these words / be greatly to allow
if they from meke / and lowly hart proceed
Now mankynde / sith thou hast made this vow
Escape the thereafter / thy life to led
And set thy world / be cousin to thy dede
that is to say / do thou none other wise

Than thou here openly / to god dost promise
ye sir and ever / loke that ye abstain
Not only from dede / but also from the assent
So that ye commit / neither of them twain
if ye will observe / the high commandment
For surely ye may / not be cleped innocent
Nor gyltles of syn / as for as I can find
if onys ye assent / to folly in your mind.

This is an harde word / sister that ye have spoken
An hard word surely / and an heavy sentence
But thynk ye goddess / commandment broken
For a light tryfull / and matter of insolence
Alas have ye such a spyced conscience
That will be entryked / with every merry thought
Leave yt woman leave yt. For yt is nought

And man as for you / ye shall not take that way
That manner of observance / is to hard and strayte
ye must attempt the world / and therein assay
Whether ye can live / after that endrayte
These. ii. folk / harp both on refrayte
and ever enbesyeth them / to rebuke you of syn
That never was spotted / no fownd gylty therein
take none heed of them / their words be but wind
and as for this time / I command them to sylence
And set us se now / how prately ye can find
By sage polycy / and worldly prudence
To maintain the state / in honour and reverence
that ye shall be in / while ye in the world dwell
Speak of this matter / and ponder yt well
First me seems necessary / to provide
What manner folks / your saruauntys shall be
For surely ye are / nothing accompanyde
according / to a man of your degre
ye have here with you. ii. parsons or. iii.
That pleases you happily / in the best wise
yet yt appears not so / to every mannys ges.
What man is this?

Reason sir my chyef conselour
And this innocence / my noryce hyderto
And sensualyte that other / by whom I have power
To do / as all sensate bestys do
But reason and innocence / chyefly these two
Have the hole rule / and gouerny of me
To ^m eke is subdued / my sensualyte

For cartayne sir / reason hath done me wrong
More than ever he shall be able to recompense
God knows sir I thought / the season very long
Till we were brought / unto your presence
But now I pray you / to adnull the sentence
That nature gave unto me / by reasons advise
to my great hurt / and vttyr preindyce
And sir I ask / none amends erthly
But that reason / may have a chek mate
A little knack / a little prayty congy
His haut courage / some thing to abate
For hyderto / he hath kept great estate
And had of me / the over hand and strengar
But ye not displeased / I will suffer yt no lengar

Thou hast had great wrong / and that is pity
For if thou be the parson / that I take the fore
thou sholdyst be / as honourable as he

Lord ye say well / but woldgod ye wold se
Some manner help / and remedy for this evil
And let me not always / live this like a dryuyll

Sir ye know well / that if so yt were
A man should suddenly / come to a strange place
Wherein he is / but alyand and stranger
He must needs be / compelled in that case
to put him self / in the favour and grace
Of some syngler person / that can show him the way
Of all the behauour / and gyse in that contrary
So yt is now / that ye be hyder sent
this contrary as yet / to you unknown
In mine opynyon / yt is expedyent
to take some other counsel than your awne
Of well inured men / such as have grown
In worldly experience / and have thereof the dryft
And can best for you / in time of need skyft

Certes ye move / right well and prudently
and I am well content / that yt so be
But as yet / have I not the polycy
To know which men / have most abylyte.

Dare ye commit / the matter unto me

(...) well / I am fully content
That all thing be done / by your assygnement

Tha thus I will / that above all thing
From hens forward / ye be like and conformable
Unto other parsones / in all your demeaning
Namely to such / as be companable
Be they never so vycouse / or abhomynable
For every man / clepyth him wise
That doth after the come gyse.
And as for men / that should do you service
I know divers persons / that be right honourable
That can you serve / always point deuyce
In all the world / be there none so able
So wise / so polytyke / no yet so profytable
Lo here is one of them / that I speak fore
and he him self can tell you / where ye shall have more
Worldly affection is this mannys name
He is well brained / and wondrous of inuencyon
a fore casting man / and payne of shame
ye shall not find / in any crysten regyon
a wiser fellow / in things to be done
Specyally of maters / that be concerning
Worldly pleasure / that is for you according
Suffer him therefore / never to depart
But if yt be / for maters of great substance
and for sensualyte / I pray you with all my heart
To accept him to your favour and tendraunce
He hath ben lunge / of mine acquaintance
and on my faith / my heart can not but grudge
To think that ye should use him as a drudge
Do as he aduyseth you / hardly now and than
and dyspyse not / utterly his counsel
Think that ye be here / a worldly man
and must do as men / that in the world dwell
ye are not bound / to live like an angel
No to be as god / always immutable
Mannys nature / of him self is full miserable
I have told you now / my counsel and advise
And ye have promised / to be ruled thereby
Now set each man / execute his offyce
and se how wisely / ye can them occupy
To encreace the world / and yt thereto ye must apply
(...)
Now address you thereto / and demean you thus
I shall be to you ever good and prosperouse

(...) of this courtesy
^nde (...) as yet, but be ye sure
I sh^ (...) self / endeavour bysyly
to do that may be / to your pleasure
And for the season / that I shall her endure
I shall (...) / and to my power maintain
That unto you in any wise do partayne

Than to bygyn with all I will advise you
to put this man / from your company
I tell you / every man will despise you
As long as ye / be ruled by innocence
to follow such counsel / yt is but folly
For he can neither good neither evil
and therefore he is taken / but for a dryuyll

By my faith / euyn as ye say
It likes me not right well
With innocence lunge to dwell
therefore according to your counsel
I will not after this day
with his company my self affere
As me wet as yt were a gray frere
I suppose there is no man here
what soever he be
That could in in his mind be content
all ways to be called an innocent
Wherefore yt is mine intent
to do as ye advise me

ye hardly do euyn so

Forsooth and I hold me well content
to depart at your commandment
ye shall find me obedyent
What soever ye bid me do

So the company is well amend
Let him go to the devil of hell
He is but a boy I warn you well
and should ye follow his counsel
All mighty god defend
if ever ye sust to play the man
It is time that ye now bygan
Mar^ to play the boy now and than
For your (...)
It forces not though ye do
Wh^ ye may have ^ser thereto
And among I will help you also
In due time and place

ye that ye will indeed
But now sir will ye any thing
Command me byfore my departing

Nothing at all to my w^tyng
But our lord have you in his kypyng
And send you well to speed

Worldly affection come hyder / ye are polytyke

a well drawn man is he / and a well taught
That will not give his head for nought
And thereto goodly / as ye shall se in a day

As well apparelyd / at each point of his array
Who dwells here / will no man speak
Is there no foal nor body peke
Now by the bell yt were almys to break
Some of these knaves brows
A gentleman comys in at the doris
That all his days hath worn gilt sperys
And none of this knaves nor cutted horys
Byddys him welcome to house.

Of how noble progeny I cam

To thy masters service I will first begin
To set his hart on a merry pyn
And bid him make good chere
I will bid him / thynk how he is create
To be a worthy potestate
And eke that he is predestynate
to be a princes pere
And other things more than this
I shall bring that hart of his
To be more howt than yt is
By a dewys as
Specyally I will commend his wit
That no man can amend yt
And that he is able thereby to sit
as a jug in come place
And when I praise him this wise
I think his hart will begin to rise
and after that utterly despise
any opray counsel to here
He shall trust all to his own brain
and than wold Reason never so fain
Though he come and such opry twain
He shall be never the ne'er

Surely this conseyt is well found
I shall bring the in service for twaynty pound

They give you a praysyng good I now

My name is wurshyp.

Wurshpp now surely
The world told me yt was my destyny
To come to wurshyp or I dye

Truly I am the same

Now wurshyp I pray you me tell

ye can aduertyse me passing well
In things that I have to do

In good saith any thing that I
May do to your pleasure yt is ready
I am your own and pray you heartily
That ye accept me so
But where ye ask counsel of me
Me seems ye save not your honest

Mine honesty. Wherefore let se
I pray you show me why

Mary sir for yt is right fyttyng
That a man of your behauyng
Should have always suffycyent conyng
Of worldly wit and polycy
To guide him self every where
And not to be led by the ere
And beg wit here and there
Of every iak a pie
ye are well complexyond be ye sure
And nature hath done on you here cure
As myche as upon any creature
that ever I saw with mine eye
And by lykylyhod sir I wis
ye have wit according to all this
Dressys nature hath wrought a miss
And that is not likely

Now certain thanked be heaven king
I have a right quyk understanding
If ye show me any thing
I can soon perceive yt
But I was forbid by reason
On mine own fantasy to ron
Or to take any presumption
Of mine own wit

Said reason so. Mary fie on him knave

Reason nay nay hardly
He is forsaken utterly

He wold not onys appear
Nevertheless for a surte

For speed of the matter

Even as we sat together at the wine

And without more taryeng anon they came
And sat down with us / made nothing straug
as they be full curteys / ye know yt well
And anon our masters colour bygan to change
whereof yt cam / I can not tell
His chere was appalled / every dell
and scant that he could speak to me one word
But s^ert him even up and rose fro the board
He said he wold go / lie down on a bed
and prayed me for the manners sake
That margery might com hold his heed
Which as he told me / bygan to ache
And so she hath him undertake
To make him hole / in an hour or twain
when soever he hath any such soden pain
What yt means I wot never
But he syketh her phy^yk so well
That I trow the devil of hell

Lo this have I done / and what trow ye more

what is that.

Mary Reason that ye two spake of byfore
Ca^ even to us as we sat so drinking
And gave our master an hete worth an hanging
Because that margery sat on his kne

Trowyst thou yt is no feigned strife
Bytwyxt them two

No on my life.
For when they fought I ran between
and cried keep piece and leave debate
But ye wold have laughed had ye scene
How I departed them / and for all that
Sometime I clapped Reason on the pate
and cried keep the piece as fast as I could
Till I was horse I cried so loud

But can our master play the man now
and fare with this ger

ye make god avow
And beware ye of one thing
Medyll ye no more with margery
For by cokkys precyouse body
If our master may yt espy
Or have an understanding
That ye use her company
I tell you he will be angry
He is so full of jealousy
As ever I knew man

Jealousy piece man be styll
He can thereof no manner of skill

No but say what ye will
I am sure he can
He is now as famylyer
With bodily lust as ever ye were
ye and thereto as great a swerer
When time requyres
Knew I never of his age
A man of better courage
To do all manner of outrage
After our desires
Sith Reason and he were thus at varyaunce
He hath be full of such dalyaunce
And both called to his favour and a^quayntaunce
^ur (...) by and by
^uy wreth glotony and co^se
Sloth and lechery become to his ser^yce
And utterly he hatyth their (...)
And that he professes o^enly

And be these folk of his retynue

ye euerychon on I tell you true
But mary there names be changed new
For to blere his eye
I tell you he is a serefull man
For Reason styrreth him now and than
And therefore do we what we can
It is little I now hardly
Sir a there is first Pride as ye wot well
The sweet darlynge of the devil of hell
How his name is changed ye can tell

ye mary on the best wise
Wurshyp I wene is now his name

ye by the rode even the same
And couetyse to eschew all blame
Doth his name dysgyse
And calls him self worldly polycy
Wreth because he is somwat hasty
Is called manhood. Then is there envy
and he is called dysdayn
Glotony for good felyshyp is taken
and sloth his old name hath forsaken
And as fair a name hath he shapen
as ever man could ordayn
He is called ease right comfortable to the blod
Specyally for them that lust to do no good
and among all other I wold ye understood
That lechery is called lust
Lo these be fair names pard
Both good and honest as seems me
as for their conditions what they be
ye know well

^ery just
I know their conditions on the best wise
if they keep styll their old gyse

yes that they do on warantyse

But yet I have gr^t maruay^
that couetyse should dwell in his company

(...) troth so / and so have I
But one thing I ensure you faithfully
And that I have espied well
that (...) ^derto our master sets no store
By his council nor his lore
Mary when his head waxes whore
than shall be good season
To follow couetyse and his way
ye time I now another day
Even so I hard our master say

By my faith he said but reason
but all the remanent be well retained

ye be ye sure yt is matter unfeigned
And wot ye who is gretely dysdayned
With our master now

Who

By god even shamfastnes
when he shall do any such excess
No shame can fere him doubtless
I may say to you

No than the craft were nought
but now sirs well bethought
Sith the matter is hereto brought
It is time for me
To go and make some prouysyon
Of garmentys after the new inuencyon
As he commanded me to be don
thereto must I se
For yt is committed to my neglygence
And if he come hyder while I am hens
I pray the excuse mine absens

ye and mine also

Why will thou go with me

Will I {quod} a ye pard
It is according for Sensualyte
With Pride for to go

Now ye matter is all most in good case
After the world is mind and pleasure
there is no more / but now must I cupace
With all my wit and besy endeuure
how it may be stablysshed cotynued sure
For a little fantasy of mannys own will
May quayll this matter and utterly yt spy^
And if he vary again
of scrypyll ymagynacyon
Or else by the suggestyon
Of the foresaid reason
One thing I am certain
He will no lengar me support
And that were a shrewd crank dor^
Therefore yt is best that I resort
to my masters presence
And se of what demeanour he is
I am gretely to blame I wis
For that I saw him not or this
Sith he departed hens.

O good lord / to whom shall I complain
And show the sorrows of my mind
and nothing for mine own cause certain
But only for the decay of mankynde
which now of late is waxen so blind
That he hath dyspysed and forsaken me
And follows every mocyon of his sensualyte
What aduayled at the beginning
that Nature comytted me to his service
and charged me that byfore all thing
Of all his gydyng I should take thenterpryse
when he lusts not to follow mine advise
but follows thappety^ of his sensual affection
As a brute best that lakketh reason
And yet not wythstandyng
that he doth me dysdayn
I will resort to him again
And do my labour and bysy pain
To assay if I can him refrain
^ro such bestly living
but first will I stand hereby
In secrete manner to espy
Some token of grace in him whereby
I may dyscerne and find
that he hath any shamfastnes
After his great surfeit and excess
And if yt be so doubtless
It sha^ content my my^
I say sirs where is wurshyp can ye tell
In this place I left him last

Sir I warand you he is occupied well
In ordeynyng your garmentys full fast
He departed fro me in great hast
For that intent / and so he desired
That I wold tell you when need required
He showed me his mind or he went
How he had devised your garment
And if yt be made after that intent
as he told me
When ye were on that vestour
Every man shall do your honour
as becummeth a man of your hauyour
And so yt should be

ye but what will Reason say
When he sees me in that array

Reason. Mary let him go play
To the devil of hell
He promised me at the beginning
That ye wold no more be under his gydyng

No but yet yt were according
To have therein his counsel
Man without reason is but blind
And if I should speak after my mind
I can well a difference find
Bytwyxt man and a best
When he hath Reason in presence
and duly obeys his saw and sentence

Why have ye such a spyced conscience
Now within your breast
that changes your mind so suddenly
I am sorry and ashamed truly
On your behalf

No force hardly
Thouledest me all wrong
and therefore will I no more follow the

Not worldly affection?

Nparde
Nor yet thy brother Sensualyte
I have followed you to long

Is that your mind

ye doubtless
And now will I seek shamefastness
By whom I trust I shall redress
All my mysded

And sith thou will needs to shame bow
I pray god send the shame I now
and yet I trust make god avow
Ones thou shalt have need
To call me again to thy service

Nay nay on warantyse
Now sirs who can me advise
what is best to do

Sir if ye lust to have mine acquaintance
I am ready to give you attendance
Happily my service shall you advance
I am called shamfastnes

By your troth are ye the same

ye forsooth that is my name
Almys deeds I can attame
And help for to repress
when ye have done offence or syn
if ye will mercy and grace wyn
with shame fastnes ye must bygyn
This way must ye take

ye be the man without feigning
That I wysshed for / or ye cam here
and glad am I now of your coming
Prayng you with hart enter
when I have need thus to com ne'er

So will I do ye may trust yt verily
When soever ye call ye shall find me ready

Sir is yt your mind to do as ye say

ye that is yt as god me speed
Hard ye all this matter ye or nay

yes that I did in very ded

O ghostly reason I have greater need
Of your help than ever I had byfore
Help me now I shall never forsake you more
Sith I forsook your company
I have committed myche folly

I am ashamed certainly
when I think thereon
Bu^ now have I refused (...)
All such manner of company
and three have I done verily
Of mine own mocyon

Than my help shall be ready as oft as ye me ta^
It is my duty so for to do
And of your offences will I make no rehearsal
But what soever ye have done hyderto
To me ward set yt pass and go
Against god your offence is great
Of the which matter I will not lunge treat
But this confort of me ye shall have
if ye be contryte as ye pretend
God is mercyable if ye lust to crave
Call for grace and soon he will yt send
And be not in purpose hereafter to offend
accustom your self in the ways of virtue
And be not in doubt grace will ensue

Sir yt is my mind and intent
Hereafter to be your true obedyent
and never more to assent
To such folly again

And upon that condition
I take the unto my tuycyon
with all hartys affection
Never to part at wain
And for this seson
Here we make an end
Lest we should offend
This audience / as god defend
It were not to be don
ye shall understand never thelesse
That there is myche more of this process
wherein we shall do our besynes
and our true endeuure
To show yt unto you after our guise
when my lord shall so deuyse
It shall be at his pleasure


I assemble the life of mortal creature
To the allyege again a s^rong town or castle
In which there is myche b^st endenure
myche warly polycy with bysy trauayll
On every side which par^e shall prey ayll
By sleyght of ingyns or by strong power
that other to subdue and bring into danger
In such case and manner of condition
Is wretched man here in this life erthly
While he abides within the garyson
Of the frayll carcass and carynouse body
Whom to impugn laboreth incessantly
the world / the flesh / the enemy / these three
Him to subdue and bring into captyuyte
And for to show you what wise they us ipugn
First doth the world give us an allectyfe
to couetryches and worldly renown
With other vanyteys that be used in this life
Next that our flesh which ever is in stryse
again our spyryte / doth provoke and excite
Is to accomplish our sensual appetite
The last of all is our great enemy
Which ever hath us in continual haterede
Of old enkankred malice and envy
that he owes to us and all the kindred
Of all the aunceters of whom we do succeed
Nor yetcesseth his malice unto this day
Is to endanger in all that he can or may
And certes these our said enemies
Be of their nature so mighty and so strong
That hard yt will be for us in any wise
Again them war or battle to vnderfong
also our garrisons and fortress to mayntayn long
Again their ingens without spyrytuall grace
We can not perform in no manner case
Wherefore yt is to us right behouable
Besyly to pray to god that is immortal
Beseeching him as he is mercyable
To have compassion and pytye on us all
And not to suffer us any wise to fall
Into such folly and utter myschaunce
Is (...) them grieve and do (...)
Also yt behooves on our part
To fl all such manner of occasyon
as may be put in fere and Ieoparde
Of their displeasure in any con^cyon
New fangl^s and c(...)nice (...)
we must forsake in all manner wise
And acquaint us with their contrar^se
Quia contraria contrariis curantur. c.
I tell this tale sir to you
Trusting that yt be not done in wast
ye remember as I suppose well I now
Now yt is not fully. in. days past
Sith ye me promised and bound yt fast
From that day forth to be obedyent
unto my counsel and aduysement
ye sir so I did in very ded
And yet yt is my mind and intent
To follow the same have ye no dread

if ye do not your self shall repent
Now fare ye well for I must be absent
As for a season / and for your confort
when so ever ye call me I shall to you resort

God forbed that ever he com again
Iesu how may ye this life endure
Me seems yt should be to you a great pain
Sith ye be of good complexyon and nature
To forbere the worldly sport and pleasure
As ye have done now a great seson
and all by the folyshe counsel of reason
Where is your lusty hart bycom
That served you so well this other day
Now so help me god and halydom
I have great marvel how ye may
Live in such mysery / and this dare I say
without ye take some other ways
By my troth yt will shorten your days
And though I say yt that were pity
For by cryste and ye were gone
Meny a good fellow wold make great moan

Why weep ye so

let me alone
It will none other wise be
and ye saw the sorrowful countenance
Of my company your old acquaintance
that they make
For your sake
I dare say ye wold moan them in your mind
They be so loving and so kind
That I am sure
if ye endure
In this peuyshe opynyon
It will be their confession
There is none other remedy
But for sorrow they shall dye

Nay god forbed they should so do

In faith without ye help thereto
There is none other way

I will help yt in all that I may
And I wit by what mene

Mary call them to your company

By saint Ihan I am content
For I may say here to the
Sith I forsook my lyberte
And did to Reason assent
I had never merry day
But lived under awe and dread always
Nothing to mine intent
Another while I will me disport
and to mine old company resort

O than shall ye them confort
and your self also
Wot ye who will be very glad

Who

Margery

Why was she sad

ye by the mass she was stark mad
Even for very wo
When she hard tell of this chance
And because she wold live in penance
Her sorrow for to quench
She hath entered into a relygyouse place
At the grene friars hereby

ye has.
Alak good (...) wench
Is yt an house of strayt relygyon

ye as any that ever was bygon
Sith the world stood

Be they close nonnes as other be

Close {quod} a nay nay pard
That gyse were not good
ye must beware of that ger
Nay all is open that they do there
As open as a gose eye

And comes any man into their sellys

ye ye god forbede else
It is fre for every body
And bysyde all this they be
Ex omni gent cognite
No nacyon they forsake
Without yt be beggars going by the way
That have never a penny to pay
For that that they do take
And yet can I beggars thyderlede
Where they shall be for lumps of breed
Satisfy their desire
Such drabbes some there be
That require none other fe
Nor yet any other hire

Be they not wedded as other folk be

Wedded quod a no so mot I the
They will nottary therefore
they can wed them self alone
Com kys me Ihan gramercy Ione
This wed they ever more
And yt is the more to commend
For if the woman hap to offend
as yt is their gyse
a man may let her alone with sorrow
and wed another whore on the morrow
Even of the same wise

Forsooth this is a noble relygyon
It styrreth me to great devotion
For to se that place
Can thou bring me thither well I now

ye and yt were mid night I make god avow
As dark as ever yt was

But where is bodily lust now

Then comes in bodyly lust with him w. aff.
Mary sir I have sytten and sought you

This three or. iiii. howrys
I make god avow
ye give shrewd attendance

All this. ii. days I could not the espy
Sir ye know well that ye and I
Be never myche a sonder

albe yt I be from you among
And now me seems thou hast tarried to long

which is to me great wonder
Wonder ye pard for an howr or twain
Forth for a passing while and com again
Here is a sore matter
when was I so long absent as now
and yet I was for to seek you
at the the other side of the water
The place that ye wot of pard

Understand ye what ye mene

ye ye

Tell me in mine ere

Quid est latinum propter le stewys
What laten now this of the newys
I herd never this ere

I trow ye begin to wax shamfast
Nay nay hardly that ger is past
Meny days a gon

I am as wanton as ever I was
It were alms to hang you else by the mass
By the hard neck bon
But will ye now go with me to a place
and I shall show you the smorterst place

That ever ye saw with eyes

What thing is yt young or old
What ever yt be yt is able to be sold

It shall like you on the best wise
For my love let us some night be there
at a banquet or a rear supper
and get us some wanton mete
So we may have some deynty thing
yet wold I spend. xx. shyllyng
where so ever I yt get

Nay nay will ye spend a coyell of crowns
and there shall no gentleman in this. x. towns
Be better served than ye
Nor be received more honestly
As to an house of bawdry
For a banquet or ^nkry
For a dyshe. ii. or three

yes that will I spend with all mine hart

By your leave I will depart
To make ready this ger

What now in all this hast

ye for god sir I am a gast
that other knaves will come theder
byfore us and take up all

Se there to I pray the

So I shall
Else fie on all together

Now will margery make great moan
because ye com not.

ye let her alone
I am not her bond man pard
She hath dysappoynted me or now

yet on my faith sir and I were as you
at the lest I wold excuse me
Send her word that ye in no wise
May this night keep her promise
And if ye do not so
She will so morn that as I thynk
Of all this night she will sleep no wynk
She shall be so full of wo

ye on my apparel take no care
This answer will I deffar and spare
till I be certain
what answer bodyly lust shall bring
Of this other praty new thing
when he comes again

Will yt please you that I go to mergery
In your stead

Mary that were merry
would thou serve me so

Why sir by my troth I mene but well

ye what thou menyst I can not tell
But that shall thou not do

In good faith sir ye may do wurs
For while I have any thing in my purse
Or any penny to spend
I will make her even such chere
As I wold mine own wife if she were here
Else god defend

ye I thank the for thy good will
But as for that chere keep yt styll
Till I call thereon

By god sir for good love I spake yt
And now that I se ye will not take yt
I shall let yt alone

How now hast thou been yender away

ye sir.

Et que nouellys

Ie nescey
I could not speak with her
No with none of her folks

Not with one

No they be a sleep euerychone
All that ever dwell there

How know thou whether they be a sleep or n^

Mary she her self told me so
when I rapped at the door

It seems she was not a sleep than

No she was a bed with a strange man

A myschefe on her whore
I wold this fire were i her tayll I make god avow

That needs not she is hot I now
It were more alms to get
Some cold water her fire to quench
I tell you yt is as warm a wench
As any in all this street
I supposed I had angered her ill

How so

For I rang her a knyll
That waked her from her sleep
I gave her a pele for her frendys soulys
a man might have hard the noys from poulys
To the farthest end of chepe
She saw that I wold not face but knok
And rap styll at the gate
She opened a wyndow and put forth her head
Hens. xl. d. {quod} she. Iak noble is a bed
This (...) ye come ^o (...)
I ha stands the wynd so cold quod I
(...). q. title we have a bry
This ger goes all wide
And so I cam thens a great pace
till I cam hyder / lo this is the case
Have I not well hyde

Well man there is no more to do
that we cannot have we must forgo
there is none other remedy
Lo worldly affection now may thou se
Thy counsel was nought that thou gave me

No more yt was truly

ye I told the asmyche byfore
It is good to be sure ever more
therefore now let us go
And resort again to our old hostess
that is the best way now as I guess

ye hardly do so

Sirs remember ye that this other day
Man promised me even in this stead
that I should with him dwell and now I here say
The wild worm is com into his head
So that by reason only he is led
It may well be so / but I am sure
that Reason shall not always with him endure
Me thinks that Sensua. doth not his part
according to the duty of his offyce
for no body can better torn a mannys hart
Nor yet a redyer mean deuyse
to put away such folyshe fantasyse
than Sensualyte if he lust to assay
for he is chyef ruler when Reason is away

ye / a ruler will I be though Reason say nay

Ah Sensualyte welcome by this day
what tidings good

ye by my fay
as good as can be told
I have brought this man to his old gyse

Hast thou so

ye on warantyse

Now forsooth I give the pryk and pryse
Thou (...)
Of this tidings I am glad and fain
But shall I be welcome to him again
and all our company

ye hardly
as welcome as ever ye ware byfore

Goddess blessing have thyn hart therefore
thus am I in thy det more and more

Iapes why say ye so

for I speak yt after my mind
thou art to me always so kind
But where shall I our master find
to him will I go

He is besy hark in your ere
with little margery ye wot where
And as soon as I had brought him there
I cam my way a pace
and because he should not be alone
I left with him worldly affection
and other erand had I none
Now to this place
but even to show you what is done
and from hens I must anon
for to seek an other companion
to give attendance

Who is that

Mary glotony
Our master calls for him besyly
Sawyst thou him not

No certainly
To my remembrance

I must go seek him without any taryeng
But Pride I warn you of one thing
While I thynk thereon
when my master and ye shall mete
In any wise se that ye him great
In the old fassyon
And make as though ye know nothing
Of his divers and varyable dealing
Keep that in your breast
ye can not do him more displeasure
Than thereof to make reporture
Therefore let yt rest
(...) ^gh treason

(...) g^ad ye warn me thus in seson
(...) the better were
B^th ^s warning I shall be wise
And do as ye me aduertyse
take thereof no ca^

Will ye be wise quod a / mary that is a thing
By god ye had need to have better warning
Or ye bring that about

What brother Sloth fro whens comyst thou

Straight fro my bed I make god avow
Mine eyes be almost out
for lak of sleep / but this sir to you
Me thought ye called me sloth right now
Piece no more of that
I have a new name as well as ye

What is that / ease

ye pard
But yt forces not
while our master is not present
Between us twain I am content
Call me what ye will
But where is our master

Wotest thou ne'er

No

No more do I

There there there
Thou shalt dwell with me styll
Thou art as good a waiter as I

I shrew the better of us both hardly
But surely we do not well
we shall not continue with yonder man
but we await better now and than
Therefore by my counsel
Let us twain go together
To seek our master

But wotyst thou whether
we shall now go
To find our master

I shall assay
Thou shalt se me guess the way
And happily find him to
Now must I to the stews as fast as I may
to ^ech this gentleman but sirs I say
Can any man here tell me the way
For I cam never there
ye know the way pard of old
I pray the tell me which way shall I hold
will ye se this whoreson cocold
I trow he cannot here
Now yt were alms to clap the on the crown

Why be there any cocoldys in town

ye I durst hold thereon my gown
that there be a score
but for god I cry you mercy
for by my saith I wit you not so ny
Had I wit yt I ensure you faithfully
that word I wold have forbore

No force hardly yt touches not me
But wurshyp tell me where have ye be
Me thinks long sith I you se

Sir yt is no marvel
Bad ye not me the last day
To go purvey for your array
And ye remember well

ye for god have ye done the same

ye by the rode else were I to blame
All thing is ready in pain of shame
Else I quyte me ill
The tailor told me yester night
that all your garmentys were ready dyght
will ye go thither and have a sight

^emary with a good will

Will ye that I go with you also

I wot never whether ye may attend thereto
for ye do nothing
But even after your own sweet will

Why should I ever wait nay that I nyll
for to be a king
I may not endure continual besynes
I was never used thereto doubtless
I should not live a year
if I followed you I am sure
(...) and ^our ^ut of me sure
I saw never your pere
He wene there can nothing be do
But if ye put your hand thereto
and I wrs that is no need
ye have servants that be true and just
if yt wold like you to put them in trust
And quyte well they ^e mede
what should I attend you for to please
when I se well ye set by none ease
which belongs to me

Why ease what means the thus to say
I do but ete drink sleep and play
And none other labour pard

ye / ye may say what ye will
But I can never se you idol
And quyete as ye should be
your body laboreth as doth an hakney
That bareth the burdon every day
That pytye yt is to se
And your mind on that other side
Is never Idol nor vnoccupyed
I wis yt grieves me
To se you demeaned that wise
I trow ye be set all on couetyse

Cou^tyse / nay let be
It is a thing of greater cure
That stycketh in my mind be thou sure

So me thought by the rode
I wit as myche there was some thing
By your ^o wryng chere and your syghyng
That was not all thing good
But what is the matter I pray you heartily

I wis thou can not deuyse the remedy
with all the wit thou hast
But this is the case to tell yt shortly
A thing was told me as I cam hereby
Now Reason puruayth fast
And makes very great labour and ordynaunce
To dash us all out of countenance
And for that purpose
He hath gadred a great company

What to do

I wore ne'er I
But as I suppose
It is to bring me in captyuyte
And to take frome my l^berte
So he hath oft said

^ere ye that matter

Nay never a dell
but I care for yt wit ye well
Yet am I not afraid
For I wit wythstand yt proudly
and sirs I trust ye will stand thereby
when yt shall be need

ye by the way that god went
Or he have of you his intent
First shall I blede
The best blode that is in this carcass

Well ease go thy way hens a pace
and make therein good speed
Call my company all together
and bid them every man com heder
That is with me affeed

Mary sir that shall be do

Wurshyp in the mean time let us go
To se my new apparel

Will ye so. Now for your ladies sake
Go do yt on you and I undertake
It shall become you well

Worldly affeccy on abide thou here
For I will go do on this new ger
as wurshyp doth me counsel

Mary I shall with all mine hart
this good fire and I will nor depart
For very cold mine hand is do smart
It makes me wo bygon
Get me a s^ole here may ye not se
Or e^ys a chayr will yt not be
thou pyld knave I speak to the
Now ^ong shall I stand

^et him stand with a foul evil
^
(...) ye se so / every dr^uyll
Now adays I w^rand
Must command as he were a king
Let him stand on his sete with bredyng

What Glotony / I can tell the one thing
In fa^th you will be shent

Why

My master hath sent Sensualyte
To seek the all about the contre
Spoke thou not with him

yes pard
I know all his intent
And thereupon I am com here
For to awa^t / but wotest thou where
Our master is now

Nay I wot ne'er
I am not very certain
But Pride and he together begone
No said he wold com again anon
within an howr or twain
Tarry thou here and go net away
I will go break my fast and I may
For I ete never a morsel this day

Mary that is a thing
Go when thou wit I will abide
My stomach he shall not rule or gyde
That is now fasting
Nay of all thing erthly I hate to fast
Four times a day I make repast
Or thryse as I suppose
And when I am well fed
Than get I me to a soft bed
my body to repose
There take I a nap or twain
^p I go straight and to yt again
Though nature be net ready
yet have I some mete of delyte
For to provoke ^happetyte
And make the stomach greedy
After all this needs I must
Sometime follow the wanton lust
For hot drynkys and delicate reflecyon
Causes flesshely insurreccyon
ye know yt as well as I

Troth as ye say I know yt well

What gentleman is this can ye tell

Wotyst thou never

No by the bell
I saw him never byfore

Is yt our master

Nay by the rood
It is not he would thou make me wood

yes I am the same

I cry you mercy I se yt well now
Byfore I knew you not I make god avow
In ernest nor in game

Why. Because I have changed mine array

For that cause trow ye nay nay
That is not the thing
That can dysceyue me be ye sure
but I pray you who hath had you in cure
Sith my last departing

By my faith a little season
I followed the counsel and diet of reason

There went the hare away
His diet {quod} a / yt may be verily
For ye be haltred marvelously
Altered I wold say
alas the while had ye no mete
As long as ye were under his diet

Mete / yes I had some
without yt were on fasting days
Than he wythdrew my supper always
and gave me never a crom

No force hardly why wold ye than
favour him as ye did like a madman
ye loke now as yt were a gost
Had ye dwelt with him till this day
ye had been pined even away
as ye be now almost
your flesh is gon every dell
A vengeance on the morsel
That is left thereon

Now talk of the remedy

(...) now (...) the (...) and (...) safe
(...) ye there none

ye bu^ where ye the m^te now (...)

ye are ^yng hasty be no d^
frist must ye go
where as prouer spoon thereof ye made
Let ve go thither and re shall be had

But what to the marsiers of the in
A weddyd woman or a vyrgyn

Nerther of both I joys

(...) No / but for a maiden she goth

ye forgod that she doth
But yet she ye none by Iye

No / no / what than

I wye I not / but as men clater
They say she ye innupta matter
Hardly an holy woman

Well thither we will / go we hens

Sir ye will give me license
To sport me for a season

yes for a while ye well I now
but go not out of the way I charge you
for hyder will come anon
All my company as I suppose
Keep them together for I purpose
to come again anon
and show them my mind what I will do

Mary I shall do what I can thereto
and yet yt ye hard for me
to keep them together any while
But I shall tell you what
I had sever keep as many flese
Or wyld hares in an opyn less
as undertake that

Wherebe these knaves that make this array

Mary they be gon that other way
tell me whom ye mean

I trow thou scornyst

Nay certainly
How so be yt if I should not lie
at the first blush I ensure you faithfully
I f^nd forgot you (...)
(...) ye be thus defensybly arayd
(...) at that are ye afraid
who fiath you grieved

Nay I fere no man that bears an he
(...) I sever that I were dede
than that should be preued

By my faith ye are wont to be as bold
as yt were a lyon of cottyswold
but now to my questyon
what means all this defensyble array

Mary sloth warned us two this same day
Even sith yt was none
that our moyster and Reason should make a stay
and therefore he had us without delay
to await on our capytayn

A now I know the matter right well
But what shall com thereof I can not tell
It passes my brayn
Our master willed that we twain
Should tarry here till he com again

What will thou do than

Who I Ienay care not for me
I will not com where strokys be
I am not so mad a man
And I wis yt is not for any fere
But yt is a thing that I can well forbere
And will as long as I can
Of lust and pleasure is all my mind
It longs to me of properte and kind
And if I should to the war
And lie in mine harnes as other men do
^yth hunger and thirst a day or two
It should me utterly mar

It were a great loss if thou were mard
Now fie on the stath whoreson coward
By cokkys precious blode
It were no syn to sle such a knave
Host not thou wagys as other men have
And few of us so good
yet will thou fayll us at this need
Now who so ever shall quyte my mede
(...) will no further go
(...) I have (...) mine own hand
(...) I sh^d (...) were the land
Even when I have do
(...) I you re quy^e
(...) as wo^ ye not at my desire
Do so my^e for me
I (...) wold have done me more good
to have s^ne the knaves hart blode
than. xx. shrll^ ngys of fee

What how sirs what means this ger,
will ye sle each other here
No more of this work

By the hart of god and he had abyden
A little while he should never have spoken
with pressed nor with clarke

Who was that

your own mynyon
Bodyly lust

Why what hath he done

Even like a lurden
He saith that ye have given him license,
to abide at home and keep resydence
while we bear the burden
And serve you now at your need

He prayed me so in very dede
within these. ii. days
He said he wold serve me with a good will
But of the warrys he could no skill
Nor knew thereof the ways
How be yt I gave him thereof none answer

No but I am sure he will not com there
And now ma^ ye se
That no man is so myche to blame
As your self

I

ye by saint I am
No man but even ye
for I am well a Jured of one thing
ye gave him better clothing
Than ye did me
And better wagys and fees also
And though I said but little thereto
But suffered ever more
yet I by ^aynd yt ever in my mind
And though that ye were to me unkind
To set so (...) at store
By such a knave as he was
I wold I had him here by the mass
And no man but we twain

By my troth this is ever thy guise
Ioke by whom I set any pryse
Him thou will most dysoayn

By cryst he can do none other wise
but now sir is there any service
That ye will command me

ye mary is there / but my company
Dresses them forward passing slowly
I trow yt will not be
Manhood thou art good I now for one

ye by cryst and they cam every chone
I will not greatly fere

By my troth because he saith so
I shall tell you what I saw him do
I was present there
Sir yt happyned in westmynster hall
Even byfore the Iuges all
His handys were bound fast
And never upon him that ever god made
Dagger sword nor knife he had
And yet at the last
He drove. xii. men into a corner
and an howi after durst they not appear
How say ye hereto
and his handys had been at syberte
He woes have put them in great I eoparde
It is to suppose so

Mary there he qurte him well
but where be mine other folk can ye tell
The comes i Glotony with a chese i a botell.

Mary here comes one
Good felyshyp me seems yt should be

Sirs god speed you

What tidings with the

I shall tell you anon
(...) I am co^ (...)
For ^o a^de upon (...)
(...) ^ll a warfare (...) me

(...) w^re ^s (...)

Ma^y (...)
^re ^s ^es I now

Why hast thou no^e (...) but this

What the devil harnes should I mys
without yt be a botell
Another botell I will go purvey
Lest that drink be scarce in the way
Or happily none to sell

Thou must have other harnes than this man

Other harnes nay I shrew me than
I can no skill thereon
why trow thou that I will fight

ye so I trow

Nay by god almyght
Thereof will I none
I was never wont to that ger
But I may serve to be a vyteler
And thereof shall ye have store
So that I may stand out of danger
Ofgon shot / but I will com no ne'er
I warn you that byfore

Now such a knave I betake to the devil
This is even such a another dreuyll
As was here while ere
They be. ii. knaves anointed
I fere me sir ye shall be dysappoynted
I syke not this ger

O I had for gotten I make god avow
Sir my fellow ease commands me to you

Commands the to me

you to me

Me to the

Commands you to him I wold have said

Why comes he not hyder

By god for he is afraid
And lies sick in his bed
He toke such a consext when he hard of this ger
That for thought and very fere

And he were hanged yt were no (...)
I p^ay god the devil break his ne^
and all such as he is

Well l^t us suffer for a while
I will go walk hens half a mile
and for all this
Happily all this ger shall not need
Now be yt that I dout and dread
The wurst as wise men do
Manhood com thy self with me

And I to sir

ye pard
would thou be prayed thereto

Now he that wold have war or strife
I pray god send him a shrewd wife
and than shall he have I now
But I shall tell you sirs as for me
I am none of them so mot I the
I may say to you
I will no such rekennyng is abide
Goddess body here comes Pride
as crank as a pecok
As soon as he and I mete
without he stand right upon his fete
He shall bear me a proud mok

What tidings sirs can any man tell

ye mary that can I do as well
as any that was in field
ye have tarried so long about your gay ger
That the field is done or ye come there

Done mary god sheld

It is done without fayll
But whyehe of them hath won the balayll
I can not tell you certain

Thou were not there yt seems thereby

Not I there {quod} ayes hardly / (...) that to my great
but as soon as ye batellys joined together (pain
I cam my way straight heder / for to tell tydyng^

What the devil tidings can thou tell

Mary I can show you nothing of the batell
but of ma^y other tidings
ye are out of concext I tell you forever
B^cause (...) not you endeuou^
^t th^s great (...)
I^ so m^e (...) ye ore (...) to sees
^eth (...) off^ce and all your fees
And (...) out of wa^s

That is not true as I suppose

Sir and ^t be not t^ke my nose
And my head also
your offyce was given or I cam thens

Mary that was a very short sentence
and I not cassed thereto
Now envy what counsel wit thou give me

By my troth Pride thou may believe me
I^ I were in thy case
I wold wythdrawe me for a season
though yt be another felony nor treason
Nor yet wilful tree space
yet the same is wurst of all
For every knave will the call
a co ward to thy face

I am unhappy I seyt well
for thexpense of mine apparel
towardys this voyage
what in horses and other array
^ath compessed me for to say
all my sand to mortgage
and now when I have all do
To less mine offyce and fees also
For my true intent
I may say that all my cost
and all my time is evil lost
In service that I have spent
well what so ever by tide me
for a season I will hyde me
after thy counsel
and sith yt will no better be
Fare well I take my seue of the

^ow gentle Pride fare well
Alas that I had no good fellow here
to bear me company and laugh at this ger
this game was well found

yes and ye lust to play the knave
Some manner of company ye might have
S^e within this ground

Some I can think y^ng or old
And (...) yt were a small household
as any might be found

It is not small the company shows well
But me thought thou were about to tell
Of some merry I este
Or some merry game at my cummyng

ye fardely yt is a game for a hyng
when he lusts best
To laugh for his dysporte and solace
Sir I shall tell the this is the case
Right now as I stood
In this place and never a man with me
In cam Pride garnished as yt had be
One of the real blode
It grieved me to se him so well be scene
But I have abated his courage clean
For a little season
By the rode I have given him a chek mate
For I bare him an hand that he cam to fate
And that the field was done
and how his offyce was given away
Because he failed our master that day
I made him to believe so
And when I had told him all this tale
anon he began to wax all pale
Full of care and wo
and now he hydeth him felfe for shame
I gave him mine advise to the same
and so he is gon

Now on my faith this was madly do
but in faith what moves the thereto

Mary cause had I none
but only that yt is my guise
When I se another man arise
Or fare better than I
Than must I chafe and fret for ire

To dystroy him utterly
But now in ernest Sensualyte

I pray ye heartily. Sensua. What against Rea.

Age the devil him quell

Why is age now com in pl^ce

ye and that may ye spy by his face
and ye mark yt well
His stomach faints every day
His back croketh his head waxes gray
His nose drops among
His lust is gone and all his liking
I se yt well by every thing
He may not live long
and all makes age as I said byfore
He is the dear / and what trow ye more
this age hath done

What

By my faith he hath brought in Reason
In such wise that at no season
Nothing can be wrought
B^t Reason must be called thereto
I fere me he will us all undo
within few days
As soon as Glotony had espyde
all this ger he wold not abide
but went even his ways
Our master prayed him to t^ry a season
Nay nay quod he / now have I done
I may no lengar tarry
For age and I may not together dwell
and straight way he departed fair and well
Bodyly lust stood by
and saw that Glotony wold needs be gon
^aue with the Glotony quod he anon
For I must go with the
So that. (...). be gon together

Never a one that I se

Well they be gon some other way
to get a new master as soon as they may
They can not be ou^ urueyd
and as for^ as they. ii. were gon
Our master sent for couetyse anon
and ^rtesy him prayed
to await on him well for a year or two
and he hath promised him so to do
as for a year or twain
But Reason may not thereof know

Reason quod a / no so I trow
He will that dysdayn
but where hath couetyse ben many a day

He dwelled with a pressed as I herd say
For he loves well
Men of the church / and they him also
and lawyars the / when they may tend thereto
will follow his counsel

So men say these as I dwell
but Sensualyte can thou tell
Now in this case
what were best for us to do

Mary I hold yt best that we go
Ne'er by to some place
and semble together all our company
to here there myndys by and by
and every mannys opynyon
what shall be best for to do

By my troth and be yt so
I hold yt welldon

Sir I have oft times you advised
to live virtuously / and showed you the way
and that not wythstandyng / ye have me dyspysed
And followed Sensualyte / meny a day
will ye so continue / ye or nay
If ever ye purpose your self to amend
It is time / for your life draws fast to thend

I can not continue / though I wold
For age hath waned me clean therfro
and yet Reason / when ye me told
Of this ger meny day a go

Wold god that my life were to bygyn again

S^eke not thereof / that may not be

but the thing / that most fereth me
On your behalf / I tell you plain
Is that ye wold / in no wise abstayn
From sinful lustys / as I willed you to do
Till now that age compels you thereto

That is full true / wrthout feigning
as long as mine appetite did endure
I followed my lustys / in every thing
which now by the course and law of nature
And not of my polycy / or good endeavour
Is taken fro me / for ever more
And so can I deserve / no mede therefore
But not wythstandyng this mine abusyon
I trust that by the help of your good advise
I may be made the child of salvation

yes and ye will sir on warantyse
So that ye utterly forsake and dyspyse
All your old servants in will and dede
and do by my counsel

yes have ye no dread

Than my soul for yours / I lay to wed
ye shall do well / have ye no mystrust
And first to begin with / I you forbed
All manner of dyspeyre / and secundly ye must
Put to your mind / and good will
To be recured / of your great excess
For without your help / yt can not be doubtless
Is in this example / if so be the pacyent
Of him self / be willing to have any remedy
It is a great furtherance to that intent
So that to the preceptys of physyk he apply
And who so doth the contrary / no maruarll truly
Though he myskary / what should I bring
Any mo examples for so plain a thing

It shall be no need as in this case
I know right well / what ye mean thereby
And that will I follow by gods grace

Than as I told you / yt shall be no maystry

So that the contrary in all manner of wrse
Must heal his contrary as physyh doth deuyse
Right so who so lusts fro syn to arise
where he hath in pride / done any offence
He can be helpen thereof none other wise
but only by mekenes / that is the recompense
again Wreth and Envy / take charity and pacyence
take alms dede / again the syn of coue^rse
And to repress glotyny / acquaint ye with abstynece
Again foull lust of body / take chastrte (...) cotynece
Myche syn grows by Sloth and by Idelnes
and that must be eschewed by mene of good besynes
^o this be preparatyfys most sovereign
Against thy sores which be mortal
Onles that this medyeyns to them be lain
When thou hast received these preparatyfys all
I will com again if thou me call
And order the further after my mind

(...) ye but where shall I these preparatyfys find

Thou shalt them find wythm thyn own breast
Of the yt must com / yt must be thy dede
For voluntary sacrafyce pleases god best
Thou can not thereof have help or mede
But if this ger of thyn own hart proceed

Well I shall endeavour me to the uttermost
And trll I have found them I shall never rest
But how shall I know them that wot I ne'er
I pray you show me that byfore your departing

It needs not thereof to enquere
Thou shalt know them at the first me^yng

I pray you dyspose for me / as ye thynk most like
That I may live here well and honourably

if yt like you / to put me in so great trust
And I true ye shall find me / true and just

I wot well I shall. Surely you be bound
To the world / that hath given you so great comendacy^

ye sir some men had lever than a thousand pound
They might be commended / of the same fassyon
But sir let pass / all this commendacyon
and answer to me / I pray you frutefully
In that I shall meue you / substancyally
Sir at few words / I you exhort
Sith that ye be come to your own
Cast your self to bear such a port
That as ye be / ye may be known
Eke yt is necessary / for that behove
that there be made / some manner of puruyaunce
Whereby / ye may vere out your countenance
Will yt like you therefore / that I survey
And se thex^ent'of all your land

Both for rou and yours / all manner of v^nd
with other vtensy^tys / ready at your hand
So that ye be puruerd / all times ^rely and late
Of each thing / that belongs to your estate

your counsel is good / do as ye thynk best
I comm^t all such thing / to your dyscrecyon
I shall do my ^ew / bysynes at the lest
To bring all things / to good conclusion

To be more howt than yt is
^y a de wis a^e
^crally I will commend his wit
That no man can amend yt
And that he is able thereby to sit
as a jug in come place
And when I praise him this wise
I think his hart will begin to rise
and after that utterly despise
any opray counsel to here
He shall trust all to his own brain
and than wold Reason never so fain
Though he come and such oprytway^
He shall be never the ne'er

Surely this conseyt is well found
I shall bring the in service fortwaynty pound

Gramercy brother I thynk me much bound
To the forthy courtesy

To come to wurshyp or I dye

Truly I am the same

ye can aduertyse me passing well
In things that I have to do
