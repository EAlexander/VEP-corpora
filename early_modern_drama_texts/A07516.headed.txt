OF all Solemnities, by which the Happy inauguration of a Subject is
celebrated, I find none that transcends the State and Magnificence of that
Pomp prepared to receive his Majesties Great Substitute into his Honourable
charge, (the City of London,) Dignified by the Title of the Kings Chamber
Royal, which that it may now appear no less heightened with Brotherly
Affection, Colt, Art, or Invention, then some other praeceeding Triumphs (by
which of late times, the Cities Honour hath been more faithfully illustrated)
this takes it's fit occasion to present it self.

And first to specify the love of his Noble Fraternity after his Lordshippes
return from Westminster, having received some service upon the water, by a
proper and significant Maister-peece of Triumph, called the Imperial Canopy,
being the Ancient Arms of the Company, an Invention neither old, nor enforst,
the same Glorious and Apt Property, accompanied with four other Triumphal
Pegmes, are in their convenient Stages planted to honour his Lordships progress
through the City; the first for the land, attending his most wished arrival in
Pauls-Church-yard, which bears the inscription of a Mount Royal, on which
Mount are placed certain Kings and great Commanders, which Ancient History
produces, that were originally sprung from Shepherds, and humble beginnings;
only the number of Six presented, some with Crowns, some with gilt Laurels,
holding in their hands silver Sheephookes, viz. Viriat, a prime Commander of
the Portuguese, renowned amongst the Historians, especially the Romans, who in
battles of 14 years continuance, purchased many great and honourable
victories; Arsaces King of the Parthians, who ordained the first Kingdom that
ever was amongst them, and in the reverence of this Kings Name and memory, all
others His Successors were called Arsacides after his Name, as the Roman
Emperors took the Name of Caesar, for the love of Great Caesar Augustus; Also
Marcus Iulius Lucinus, Bohemiaes Primislaus, the Emperor Pertinax, the Great
Victor Tamburlayne, Conqueror of Syria, Armenia, Babilon, Mesapotamia, Scythia,
Albania, c. Many Honourable Worthies more I could produce; By their deserts
ennobling their mean Originals. But for the better expression of the purpose in
Hand, a Speaker lends a voice to these followings words!

THey that with Glory-enflamde hearts; desire
To see Great Worth deseruingly aspire,
Let em draw near and fix a serious Eye,
On this Triumphant Mount of Royaltye;
Here they shall find fair Virtue and her Name,
From low-obscure Beginnings raysde to Fame,
Like Light struck out of Darkness; the mean wombs
No more Eclipse brave Merit, then rich Tombs
Make the Soul happy; 'tis the Life, and Dying
Crowns both with Honours Sacred Satisfying;
And 'tis the Noblest Splendour upon Earth,
For man to add a Glory to his Birth
(All his Lifes Race with honoured Acts comixed)
Then to be Nobly-borne and there stand fixed;
As if 'twere Competent Virtue for whole Life
To be Begot a Lord; 'tis virtuous Strife
That makes the complete Christian; not high Place,
As true Submission is the State of Grace,
"The Path to Bliss, lies in the humblest Field,
"Who ever rise to Heaven that never kneeled,
Although the Roof hath Supernatural Height,
Yet there's no Flesh can thither go upright:
All this is instanc'st only to commend,
The low condition whence these Kings descend;
I spare the
And preserve him for a far Holier Stile,
Who being King Anointed, did not scorn
To be a Shepherd after; these were borne
Shepherds, and rise to Kings, took their ascending
From the strong hand of Virtue, never ending
Where She begins to raise, until she place
Her Love sick Servants equal with her Grace;
And by this Days great Honour it appears
She as much preuaylde amongst the Reverend years
Of these Grave Senators, chief of the rest
Her Favour hath reflected most and best,
Upon that Son whom we of Honour call,
And may' t Successively reflect on all.
From this Mount Royal beautified with the Glory of deserving Aspirers,
descend we to the Modern use of this Ancient and Honourable Mystery, and there
we shall find the whole Livery of this most renowned and famous City, as upon
this Day, and at all Solemn meetings, furnished by it; it clothes the
Honourable Senators in their highest and richest Wearings, all Courts of
Justice, Magistrates, and Judges of the Land.

By this time his Lordship, and the Worthy Company being gracefully conducted
toward the little Conduit in Cheap, there another part of the Triumph waytes
his Honours happy approach, being a Chariot Artfully framed, and properly
garnished; And on the Conspicuous part thereof is plac'st the Register of all
Heroic Acts and worthy Men, bearing the Title of Sacred Memory, who for the
greater Fame of this Honourable Fraternity presents the Neuer-dying Names of
many memorable and remarkable Worthies of this Ancient Society, such as were
the Famous for State and Government, Sir Henry Fitz-alwin Knight, who held the
Seat of Magistracy in this City twenty four years together, He sits figured
under the Person of Government: Sir Iohn Norman, tho first Lord Mayor rowed in
Barge to Westminster with silver Oars at his own cost and charges; under ^he
person of Honour, the Valiant Sir Francis Drake, that rich Ornament to Memory,
(who in two years and ten months space did cast a girdle about the world)
under the person of Victory, Sir Simon Eyre, (who at his own cost built Leaden
Hall, a Granary for the Poor,) under the figure of Charity, Sir Richard
Champion, and Sir Iohn Milborne, under the person of Munificenee or Bounty, Sir
Richard Hardell, and Sir Iohn Poultney, the one in the seat of Magistracy six
years, the other four years together, under the figures of Justice, and
Piety, That Sir Iohn being a Colledge-Founder, in the Parish of St. Lawrence
Poultney, by Candle-wick street; fic de caeteris. This Chariot drawn by two
pellited Lyons, being the proper Supporters of the Companies Arms, those two
upon the Lyons presenting Power and Honour, the one in a little Streamer or
Banneret bearing the Lord Majors Arms, the other the Companies.

I Am all Memory, and me thinks I see
Into the fardest Time, Act, Quality;
As clear as if 'twere now begun again,
The Natures, Dispositions, and the Men;
I find to Godnesse they bent all their powers,
Which very Name makes blushing Times of ours;
They heaped up Virtues, long before they were old,
This Age fits laughing upon Heaps of Gold,
We by great Buildings strive to raise our Names,
But they more truly wise built up their Fames,
Erected fair Examples, large and hie,
Patterns for us to build our Honours by;
For instance only Memory relates,
The Noblest of all City-Magistrates,
Famous Fitz-alwin, naming him alone,
I sum up twenty four Lord Majors in one,
For He by free election and consent
Filled all those years with virtuous Government;
Custom and Time requiring now but one,
How ought that year to be well dwelt upon,
It should appear an Abstract of that worth,
Which former Times in many years brought forth,
Through all the life of Man, this is the year,
Which many wish, and never can come near,
Think and give thanks; to whom this year does come,
The Greatest Subject's made in Christendom;
This is the year for whom some long prepared,
And others have their glorious Fortune shard,
But serious in thanksgiving, 'tis a year,
To which all Virtues like the people here
Should throng and cleave together, for the Place
Is a fit Match for the whole Stock of Grace;
And as men gather wealth, against the Year comes,
So should they gather Goodness with their Sums,
For 'tis not shows, Pomp, nor a House of State
Curiously decked, that makes a Magistrate,
'Tis his fair Noble soul, his Wisdom, Care,
His upright Iustnes to the Oath he swear
Gives him complete; when such a Man to me,
Spreads his Arms open, there my Palace be,
He's both an Honour to the Day so grac'st,
And to his Brother-hoods love that sees him plac'st,
And in his fair Deportment there revives,
The Ancient Fame of all his Brothers Lives.
After this, for the full close of the Fore-noones Triumph, near St.
Lawrence-lane, his Lordship Receives an Entertainment from an unparalleled
Maister-peece of Art, called the Crystal Sanctuary, stilde by the name of the
Temple of Integrity, where her Immaculate self with all her glorious and
Sanctimonious Concomitants sit transparently seen through the Crystal; and
more to express the Invention, the Art of the Engineer, as also for Motion,
Variet^, and the content of the Spectators, this Crystal Temple is made to
open in many parts, at fit and convenient Times, and upon occasion of the
Speech; the Columns or Pillars of this Crystal Sanctuary, are Gold, the
Battlements Silver, the whole Fabric for the Night Triumph adorned and
beautified with many Lights, dispersing their glorious Radiances on all sides
thorough the Crystal.

Have you a mind thick Multitude to see
A Virtue, near concerns Magistracy,
Here on my Temple throw your greedy eyes,
See me, and learn to know me, then y' are wise;
Look, and look through me, I no favour crave,
Nor keep I hid the Goodness you should have,
Tis all transparent what I think or do,
And with one look your Eye may pierce me through,
There's no disguise, or hypocriticke veil,
(Used by adulterous Beauty set to sale)
Spread over my actions, for respect or fear,
Only a Crystal which approves me clear;
Would you desire my Name? Integrity,
One that is over what she seems to be,
So manifest, perspicuous, plain, and clear
You may ee'n see my thoughts as they sit here,
I think upon fair Equity and Truth,
And there they sit crowned with eternal Youth,
I fix my Cogitations upon Love,
Peace, Meeknes, and those thoughts come from above,
The Temple of an upright Magistrate,
Is my fair Sanctuary, Throne, and State;
And as I dare Detractions euillest Eye,
Sore at the sight of Goodness, to epsy
Into my ways and actions, which lie open
To every censure, armed with a strong Hope:
So of Your part ought nothing to be done,
But what the envious Eye might look upon:
As Thou art Eminent, so must thy Acts
Be all Tralucent, and leave worthy Tracts
For future times to find, thy very Breast
Transparent, like this Place wherein I rest:
Vain doubtings; al thy Days have bin so clear
Never came Nobler Hope to fill a year.
At the close of this Speech, this Crystal Temple of Integrity with all her
celestial Concomitants, and the other parts of Triumph take leave of his
Lordship for that time, and rest from service till the great Feast be ended,
after which the whole Body of the Triumph attends upon his Honour, both toward
St. Paules, and homeward, his Lordship accompanied with the Grave and Honourable
Senators of the City; amongst whom the two worthy Consuls, his Lordships
Graue-Assistants for the year, the worshipful and Generous, Mr. Raph Freeman,
and Mr. Thomas Moulson, Sheriffs and Aldermen, ought not to pass of my
respect unremembered; whose Bounty and Nobleness will prove best their own
Expressers.

Near the entrance of woodstreete, that part of Triumph being planted to which
the concluding Speech hath chiefly reference, and the rest, about the Cross, I
thought fit in this place to give this it's full Illustration; It being an
Invention both glorious and proper to the Company, bearing the name of the
thrice Royal Canopy of State, being the honoured Arms of this Fraternity, the
three Imperial Crowns cast into the Form and Bigness of a Triumphal
Pageant, with Cloud and Sun-beames, those Beams by Enginous Art made often to
mount and spread like a Golden and Glorious Canopy over the Deified persons that
are plac'st under it, which are eight in number, figuring the eight Beatitudes,
To improoue with conceit, Beati Pacifici, being the Kings word or Motto, is
set in fair great Letters, near the uppermost of the three Crowns; and as in
all great Edifices or Buildings, the Kings Arms is especially remembered, as a
Honour to the Building and Builder in the Frontispiece: so is it comely and
requisite in these matters of Triumph framed for the Inauguration of his great
Substitute, the Lord Mayor of London, that some remembrance of Honour should
reflect upon his Majesty, by whose peaceful Government under Heaven we enjoy
the Solemnity!

THe Blessedness, Peace, Honour, and Renown,
This Kingdom does enjoy under the Crown,
Worn by that Royal Peace-maker, our King,
(So oft preserude from Dangers menacing)
Makes this Arms, (glorious in it self) outgo
All that Antiquity could ever show,
And thy Fraternity hath striude to appear
In all their course, worthy the Arms they bear,
Thrice have They Crowned their Goodness this one Day
With Love, with Care, with Cost; by which they may
By their Deserts most justly these Arms claim,
Got once by Worth, now Trebly held by Fame:
Shall I bring Honour to a larger Field,
And show what Royal Business these Arms yield?
First the three Crowns affords a Divine scope,
Set for the Graces, Charity, Faith, and Hope;
Which Three the only safe Combiners be,
Of Kingdoms, Crowns, and every Company;
Likewise with just propriety they may stand
For those three Kingdoms swaide by the meek Hand
Of Blessed Iames; England, Scotland, Ireland,
The Cloud that swells beneath em, may imply
Some Envious Mist cast forth by Heresy,
Which through his happy Reign, and Heavens blessed will;
The sun-beames of the Gospel strikes through still;
More to assure it to Succeeding Men,
We have the Crown of Britains Hope again,
(Illustrious Charles our Prince,) which all will say,
Adds the chief Joy and Honour to this Day:
And as three Crowns, three Fruits of Brotherhood
By which all Loves Worth may be understood,
So threefold Honour makes the Royal Suit
In the King, Prince, and the Kings Substitute:
By the eight Beatitudes, Ye understand
The Fullness of all Blessings to this Land,
More chiefly to this City, whose safe Peace
Good Angels guard, and Goodmens prayers increase:
May all succeeding-Honor'd Brothers be,
With as much Love brought Home, as Thine brings Thee.
FOr all the Proper Adornments of Art and Workmanship in so short a Time, so
gracefully setting forth the Body of so Magnificent a Triumph, the praise
comes as a just due to the Exquisite Deservings of Mr. Garret Crismas, whose
faithful performances still take the upper hand of his promises.
