These folysh lovers then that be so amerous

Now sorry now sad now Joyous now pensyfe

Combryd by dotage of one Cali^to
I know that nature hath gyuyn me bewte

(...) he makyth me almost weary
O his lamentations exclamacyons on fortune
with similitude manner as one that should die
But who shall pity this Infayth not I
Shall I accoplysh his carnal desire
Nay yet at a stake rather bren in a fire
Of troth I am sorry for his troble
To strive with him self thus for love of me
But though his sorows I assure you should doble
Out of his danger will I be at lyberte
what a mys woman now criste benedicite
Nay nay he shall never that day see
^ys voluptuous appetite cosentyd by me
wit he now that I were present here
I assure you shortly he wold seek me
And without dout he doth now inquere
whether I am gone or where I should be

A las of this man I can nener be rid

O god I might in your presens be able

Greater were that reward than the grace
Heuyn to optayn by workys of pity
Not so glorious be the saites that se gods face
No Joy not so much as I do you to see
yet dyffereus there is between them me
For they gloryfy by his assuryd presens
And I in torment be cause of your absens

why thynkyst thou that so great a reward

ye more greater than if god wold set me
In heuyn above all seyntes more in regard
And thynk it a more hyer felycyte

yet more gretter thy reward shall be
if thou fl (...) the determynacyon
Of thy ^sent of mind by such temptation
I perseyue the intent of thy words all
As of the wit of him that wold have the vert^w
Of me such a woman to be come thrall
Go thy wey with sorrow I wold thou kuew
I have foul skorn of the I tell the true
Or any humayn creature with me should begin
Any comunycacyon perteynyng to syn
And I promise the where thou art present
while I lyff by my will I will be absent
Lo out of all joy I am fallyn in wo
Upon whom aduers fortune hath cast her chauns
Of cruel hate which causyth now a wayto go
The keeper of my joy and all my pleasauns
Alas alas now to me what noyauns

Dew guard my lord and god be in this place

Sempronio /

ye sir.

a sir I shrew thy face
why hast thou been from me so long absent

For I have been about your bysynes
To order such thing as were convenient
your house and horse and all thing was to dress

O sempronio have pity on my dystres
For of all creature I am the woefullest

How so what is the cause of your unrest

For I serve in love to the goodliest thing
That is or ever was.

what is she
It is one which is all other exceeding
The picture of angelle if thou her see
Phebus or phebe no comparison may be
To her.

what hight she /

melebea is her name

Mary sir this wold make a wyld horse tame

I pray the sempronio goo fet me my lute
And bring some chair or stole with the
The argument of love that I may dispute
which scyens I find the art without pity
Hy the sempronio hy the I pray the

Sir shortly I assure you it shall be done

Then farewell cryst send the again soon
O what fortune is eagle unto mine
O what woeful wight with me may compare
The thirst of sorrow is my myxyd wine
which daily I drink with deep draught of ca^

Tush sir be merry let pas away the mare
How sey you have I not hied me lightly
Here is your chair and lute to make you merry

Miry quod a / nay that will not be
But I must needs sit for very feblenes
Give me my lute and thou shalt see
How I shall sing mine vnhappynes
This lute is out of tune now as I ges
Alas in tune how should I set it
when all armony to me discordith yche whyt
As he to whose will reason is unruly
For I feel sharp nedyls within my breast
Peas war truth haterad and injury
Hope and suspect and all in one chest

Behold nero in the love of tapaya oprest
Rome how he brent / old and young wept
But she toke no thought nor never the less slept

Gretter is my fire and less pity showed me

I will not mok this foul is a lover

what say thou /

I say how can that fire be
That tormentyth but one living man gretter
Than that fire that brenyth a hole city here
And all ye people theri.

mary for y^ fire is grettyst
That brennyth verey sore and lastyt{is} lengyst
And gretter is the fire that brenyth one soul
Than that which brenyth an hundred bodies

His saying in this none can control

None but such as list to make lies
And if the fire of purgatory bren in such wise
I had lever my spirete in brute best{is} should be
Than to go thydyr and than to the deyte

Mary sir that is a spyce of heryse

why so /

For ye speak like no crystyn man
I wold thou knewyst melebea worship I
In her I believe and her I love /

A ha than
with the melebea is a great woman
I know on which foot thou dost halt on
I shall shortly heal the my lyff theruppon

An vncredable thing thou dost promise me

Nay nay it is easy I nough to do
But first for to heal a man knowledge must be
Of the seknes than to gyff counsel thereto

what counsel can rule him sempronio
That kepyth in him kepyth no (...) of counsel

A is this Calisto his fire / now I know well
How that love over him hath cast her net
In whose perseuerans is all inconstans

why. is not Eliceas love and thyn met

what than.

why reprouest me than of ignorans

For thou settyst mannis dignite in obeysanus
To the unperfeccion of the weke woman

A woman Nay a god of goddesses.

beleuyst y^ tha

ye and as a gods I here confess
And I believe there is no such sufferayn
In heuyn though she be in yerth.

peas peas

A woman a god nay to god a villain
Of your saying ye may be sorry.

it is playu

why so.

because I love her and thynk surely
To obteyn my desire I am unworthy

O ferfull hart why comparyst thou with Nembroth
Or alexander of this world not lord only
But worthy to subdew heuyu as saying goth
And thou reputyst thy self more hye
Then them both and dyspayryst so cowardly
To wyn a woman of whom hath ben so many
Gotten and vngotten never harde of any
It is resytyd in the fest of saint Ihon
This is the woman of auncyoun malice
Of whom but of a woman was it long on
That adam was expulsyd from paradyse
She put man to pain whom ely did dispyse

Than sith adam gaff him to their governance
Am I gretter than adam my self to auannce

Nay but of those men it were wisdom
That overcame them to seek remedy
And not of those that they did overcome
Fl from their beginynge eschew their folly
Thou knowyst they do evil thing many
They keep no mean but rigour of intention
Be it fair foul wilful without reason
Keep them never so close they wylbe she wyd
Gyff tokyns of love by many subtell ways
Semyng to be sheep and serpently shrewd
Craft in them renewyng that never decays
Their seyenge sightynge provoking their plays
O what pain is to fulfil their appetite
And to accomplish their wanton delytis
It is (...) to se their dyssemblyng:
Their flattering count nann^ ^heyr ingratytude
(...) falls witnese feigned weeping
There vayn glory and how they can delude
Their folysh^es their ^anglyng not mewed
Their lecherous lust and wylenes therefore
witchcraft charmys to make men to theyr^ lore
Their enba winyng their vnshamfastnes
Their bawdry their suttelte fresh attyryng
what trimyng what painting to make fayrnes
Their falls intent flykkeryng smyl^ng
Therefore lo yt is an old saying
That women be the dyuelle net and head of syn
And mannys mysery in paradyse did begin

But what thynkyst thou by me yet for all this

Mary syrye were a man of clear wit
whom nature hath indewyd (...) the best gyfte
As bewte gretnes of members perfyt
Strenght lightness beyond this yche whyt
Fortune hath partyd with you of her influens
For to be able of liberal expens
For without good whereof fortune is lady
Noman can have wealth therefore by conjecture
you should be belouyd of every body

But not of Melebea now I am sure
And thought thou had praysyd me with out mesure
And comparyd me without comparison
yet she is above in every condition
Behold her nobleness her auncyon lynage
Her great patrymony her excellent wit
Her resplendent verteu hye portly courage
Her godly grace her suffereyn be wte perfyte
No tong is able well to express it
But yet I pray the let me speak a while
My sel^ to refresh in rehersyng of my style
I begin at her herr which is so goodly
Crispyd to her helys tied with fine lase
Far shynyng beyond fine gold of araby
I trow the son coler to hit may gyff place
That who to behold it might have the grace
wold say incomparison nothing couteruaylys

Then is it not like here of ass tails

O what foul comparison this fellow raylys
Her gay glasyng even so fair and bright
Her brows her nose in a mean no fassyon faylys
Her mouth ^per feat her teeth small whyght
^er lyppis (...) her body straight upright
Her lyttyll tetys to the eye is a pleasure
O what Joy it is to se such a figure
Her skyn of whytnes endarkyth the snow
with rose colour ennewyd I the ensure
Her lyttyll hand in mean manner this is no trow
Her fyngers small long with naylys ruddy most pure
Of proporcyon none such in purtrayture
without pere worthy to have for fayrenes
The apple that parys gave venus the gods

Sir have ye all done.

ye mary what than

I put case all this ye have said be true
yet are ye more noble sith ye be a man

wherein.

she is vnperfyte I wold ye knew
As all women be and of less value
Phylozophers say the marter is less worthy
Than the form / so is woman to man surely

I love not to here this alter^ion
Between melebea and me her lover

Possible it is in every condition
To abbot her as much as you do love her
In the wynnyug / begilyng is the danger
That ye shall see he^e after with even fre

with what even.

with clear even trust ^e

why with what even do I se now

with dyme even which show a lytyl thing much
But for ye shall not despair I assure you
No labour nor dylygens in me shall gruch
So trusty fryndely ye shall ^ynd ^he ^urh
In all thing possible that ye can (...)
The thing to accomplish to your desire

God bring that to pace so glad it is to me
To here the thus though I hope not in thy doyng

yet I shall do yt trust me for a suret^

God reward the for thy gentle intending
I gyff the this thayn of gold in rewarding

Sir god reward you lend us good spe^
I dout not but I shall perform it in dede
But without reward it is har^ to work well

I am ^ontent so thou be not ne^lygent

Nay be not you / for it passyth a marvel
The master slow / the servant to ^e dylygent

How thynky^t it can be show me thine intent

Sir I have a neighbor a moder of (...)

In all evil dede she is perfet wise
I trow more than a M vyrgyns
Have been destroyed by her subtell deuyse
For she ncuer faylyth where she begynnis
All only by this craft her lyffyng she wynnis
Maid wyffys wydows and euerychone
If she ones meddyll there skapyth none

How might I speak with her sempronio

I shall bring her ^ydyr unto this place
But ye must in any wise let rewardis go
And show her your greuys in every case

Else were I not worthy to attain grace
But alas sempronio thou taryest to long

Sir god be with you.

Lryst make the strong
The mighty and petdurable god be his gyde
As he gydyd the (...) king in to bedleme
From the est by the start and again did provide
As their conduct to retorn to their own reame
So speed my sempronio to quench the leme
Of this fire which my hart doth wast spend
And that I may com to my desired end
To pas the time now will I walk
Up and down within mine orchard
And to my self go comyn and talk
And pray that fortune to me be nothard
Longing to here whether made or mard
My message shall return by my seruannt sempronio
Thus fare well my lords for a while I will go

Now the blessing that our lady gave her soon
That same blessing I give now to you all
That I com thus homely I pray you of ^don
I am sought and sendfore as a woman universal
Celestina of trewth my name is to call
Sempronio for me about doth inquere
And it was told me I should have found hyin here
I am sure he will com hither anon
But the whylyst I shall tell you a pretty game
I have a wench of Sempronios a pretty one
That soiornyth with ^e Elecea is her name
But the last day we were both ny a stark shame
For sempron^o wold have her to him self seuerell
And she louyth one Cryto better or as well
This Cryto and Elicea sat drinking
In my house and I also making merry
And as the devil wold far from our thynkyug
Sempronio almost cam on us suddenly
But then wrought I my craft of bawdery
I bad Cryto go up and make himself rome
To hyde him in my chamber among the brom
Then made I Elicea sit down a sowyng
And I with my rok began for to spyn
As who says of sempronio we had no knowing
He knokkyd at the door and I let him in
And for a countenance I did begin
To catch him in mine armies and said see see
who kyssyth me Elicea and will not kys the
Elicea for a countenance made her grieved
And wold not speak but styll did sow
why speak ye not quod sempronio be ye meuyd
Have I not a cause quod she no quod he I trow
A traitor quod she full well dost thou know
where hast thou ben these. iii. days fro me
That the inpostume and evil death take the
Peas mine Elicea quod he why say ye thus
Alas why put you your self in this wo
The hot fire of love so brennyth between us
That my hart is with yours where ever I go
And for.iii. days absens to say to me so
In faith me thynkyth ye be to blame
But now hark well for here begynnyth the game
Cryto in my chamber above that was hyddyn
I thynk lay not easily and began to romble
Sempronio hard that and asked who was within
Above in the chamber that so did Iomble
who quod she a lover of mine / may hap ye stomble
Quod he on the trewth as many one doth
Go up quod she and loke whether it be soth
well quod he I go / nay thought I not so
I said com sempronio let this fool alone
For of thy long absens she is in such wo
And half beside her self and her wit ny gone
well quod he above yet there is one
will thou know quod I ye quod he I the requere
It is a wench quod I sent me by a frere
what frere quod he wilt thou ned{is} know (...) I tha
It is the (...) I pray (...)
O quod he what a lode hath that woman
To bear him / ye ^uod I though women per case
Bear heavy full oftyet they gall in no place
Then he laughed / ye quod I no mo word of this
For this time to long we spend here amys

Omoder Lelestyne I pray god prosper the

My son sempronio I am glad of our meting
And as I here say ve go about to seek me

Of troth to seek you was mine hither coming
Mother ley a pert now all other thyug
And all only tend to me and Imagyn
In that that I purpose now to begin
Calisto in the love of fair melebea
Burnyth wherefore of the he hath great need

Thou seyst well knowyst not me Celestina
I have the end of the matter and for more speed
Thou shalt wade no ferther / for of this dede
I am as glad as ever was the surgyon
For saluys for broke heed to make prouysyon
And so intend I to do to Calisto
To gyff him hope and assure him remedy
For long hope to the hart much troble will do
wherefore to the effect thereof I will hye

Peas for me thynkyth Calisto is ny

Parmeno.

what sey you.

wottyst who is here
Sempronio that reuyuyth my chere

It is sempronio with that old berdyd whore
Be ye they my master so sore for doth long

Peas I sey parmeno or go out of the door
Comyst thou to hinder me then dost thou me wrong
I pray the help for to make me more strong
To wyn this woman elle god forbod
She hath equal power of my lyff under god

wherefore to her do ye make such sorrow
Thynk ye in her ars there is any shame
The contrary who tellyth you be never his borrow
For as much she gloryfyeth her in her name
To be called an old whore as ye wold of fame
Dog in the street and children at every door
Bark and cry out there goth an old whore

how knowyst all this dost thou know her

ye that (...) lou^th one Cryto better (...) agone
For a falls whore the devil over throw her
My moder when she dyed gave me to her alone
And a sterker baud was there never none
For that I know I dare well se
Let se the contrary who can ley
I have been at her hows scene her trynkette
For painting thing innumerable
Squalmys ^almys I wonder where she get
The thing that she hath with folk for to fable
And to all bawdry ever agreeable
yet worse then that which will never be laft
Not only a baud but a wych by her craft

Say what thow will son spare not me

I pray the permeno lefe thy malycyous enu y

Hark hydyr sempronyo here is but we three
In that I have said can thou dcnye

Com hens permeno I love not this I
And good mother grieve you not I you pray
My mind I shall show now hark what I say
O notable woman O auncyent vertew
O'gloryous hope of my desired intent
The end of my delectable hope to renew
My regeneracion to this life present
Resurreccon from death / so excellent
Thou art above other / I desire humbly
To kys thy hands wherein lies my remedy
But mine unworthiness makyth resystence
yet worship I the ground that thou gost on
Beseeching the good woman with most reuerens
On my pain with thy pity to loke upon
without thy comfort my life is gone
To revyue my dede spryte thou may prefer me
with the words of thy mouth to make or mar me

Sempronio can I lyff with these bonys
That thy master gyffyth me here for to ete
words are but wynd therefore attons
Bid him close his mouth and to his purse get
For money makyth merchant that must Jet
I have herd his words but where be his deeds
For with out money with me no thing spedys

what says she sewpronio alas my hart bledes
That I with you good woman mystrust should be

sir she thynkyth that money all thing fedys
Then come on sempronio I pray the with me
And ta^ here moder a while I pray the
For where of mystrust ye have me appelyd
have here my cloak till your dout be assoylid

Now do ye well for wed among corn
Nor suspecious with frynde did never well
Or faythfulnes of word turned to a skorn
Makyth mind doutfull good reason doth tell

Loom on sempronio thou gyffyst me good counsel

Go ye before I shall wait you upon
Farewell mother we will come again anon

How sey ye my lordis se ye not this smoke
In my masters eyes yt they do cast
The one hath his chain the other his cloak
And I am sure they will have all at last
Ensample may be by this ye is past
How seruautis be dissaytfull in their masters folly
Nothing but for lucre is all their bawdry

It pleasyth me parmeno that we to gedyr
May speak whereby thou may se I love the
yet vndeseruyd now thou comyst hydyr
whereof I care not but vertew warnyth me
To fl temptation follow charity
To do good agayns ill so I rede the
Sempronio I will help thy necessyte
And in tokyn now that it shall so be
I pray the among us let us have a ^ong
For where armony is there is amyte

Go to when thou will I am ready

For the third part sempronio we must get
After that thy master shall come to skole
To sing the fourth part yt his purse shall sweat
For I so craftily the song can set
Though thy master be horse his purse shall sing clear
And taught to solf that woman's flesh is dere
How seyst to this thou praty parmeno
Thou knowyst not the world nor no delytis therein
Dost understand me infeyth I trow no

God be here i

who is there

will ye bye any thread

ye mary good water I pray you come in

Lryst save you fair mestres god be your sped^
And health be to you all your kin
And mary god mother that blessyd vyrgyn
Preserve prosper your womanly personage
And well to enjoy your yough pusell age
For that time pleasurys are most eschyuyd
And age is the hospytall of all manner sykenes
The resting place of all thought vnreleuyd
The sporte of time past the end of all quiknes
Neybour to death a dry stok without swetnes
Discomfort disease all age alowith
A tree without sap that small charge bows

I marvel moder ye speak so much ill
Of age that all folk desire effectuously

They desire hurt for them selfas all of will
And the cause why they desire to come thereby
Is for to lyff for death is so lothly
He that is sorrowful wold lyff to be soryer
And he that is old wold lyff to be elder
Fair damesell who can show all the hurt of age
His werynes feblenes his discontentyng
His chyldishnes frowardness of his rage
wrynkelyng in the face lak of sight and hearing
Holownes of mouth fall of teeth faint of going
And worst of all possessyd with pouerte
And the lymmys arestyd with debylite

Moder ye have takyn great pain for age
wold ye not retorn to the beginning

Folys are they that are past their passage
To begin again which be at the ending
For better is possession than the desyryng

I desire to lyff lengger do I well or no.

That ye desire well I thynk not so
For as soon goth to market the lambys fell
As the ship / none so old but may lyff a year
And there is none so young but ye wot well
May dye in a day then no aduauntage is here
Between youth age y^ matter is clear

with thy fablyng thy resonyng I wis
I am begylyd but I have known the or this
Art not celystyne y^ dwelled by the river syd^

ye for soth /

in dede age hath array the
That thou art she now can scant be espied
Me thynkyth by thy favour thou shuldyst be she
Thou art sore chaungid thou may believe me
Fair maydon keep thou well this time of youth
But bewte shall pass at y^ last this is truth
yet I am not so old as ye jug me
Good moder I joy much of thine accoyntanaunce
And thy moderly reasons right well please me
And now I thank the here for thy pastaunce
Fare well till a another time yt hap may chance
Again that we two may mete to gedyr
May hap ye have bysynes I know not whether

O angelyk image o {per}le so pcyous
O how thou spekyst it reioysyth me to here
Knowist thou not by the deuyne month gracious
That against the infernal feend lucyfe re
we should not only lyf by bred here
But by our good workys where in I take some pain
if ye know not my mind now all is in veyn

Show me moder hardly all thy nesessite
And if I can I shall provide the remedy

My necessite nay god wot it is not for me
As for mine I laft it at home surely
To ete when I will drink when I am dry
And I thank god ever one penny hath be mine
To by bred when Ilyst to have. iiii. for wine
Before I was wyddow I caryd never for it
For I had wine enough of mine own to sell
And with a tossed in wine by the fire I could sit
with. ii. dozen sop the collyk to quell
But now with me it is not so well
For I have nothing but that is brought me
In a pytcher pot of quartys scant three
Thus I pray god help them that be nedy
For I speak not for my self alone
But as well for other how ever speed I
The infyrmyte is not mine though that I groan
It is for a another yt I make moan
And not for my self it is a another way
But what I must moan where I dare not say

Say what thou will for whom thou lest

now gracious damsel I thank you than
That to gyf audyens ye be so pressed
with liberal redynes to me old woman
which gyffyth me boldness to show what I can
Of one that lies in danger by sekenes
Remyttyng his langour to your getyllnes

what meanyst thou I pray the good moder
Go forth with thy demand as thou hast done
On the one {per}te thou prouokyst me to anger
And on the other side to compassion
I know not how thy answer to fassyon
The words which thou spekyst in my presence
Be so mysty / I {per}seyue not thy sentence

I said I laft one in danger of sekenes
Drawing to death for ought that I can se
Now chose you or no to be murderes
Or reuyue him with a word to come from the

I am happy if my word be of such necessyte
To help any crystyn man or ells godd{is} forbod
To do a good dede is liking to god
For good ded{is} to good men be alowable
And specyally to nedy above all other
And ever to good deeds ye shall find me agreeable
Trusting ye will exhort me to non other
Therefore fere not spek your petition good mother
For they that may heal sekefolk do refuse them
Suerly of their death they can not excuse them

Full well graciously the case ye consider
For I never beleuyd that god in vayn
wold gyff you such countenaunnce bewte to gedyr
But charity therewith to releue folk in pain
And as god hath gyffyn you so gyff him again
For folk{is} be not made for them self only
For then they should lyff like best{is} all rudely
Among which best{is} yet some be pyteful
The unicorn humblyth hy^ self to a maid
And a dog in all his power ireful
Let a man fall to ground his anger is delayed
Thus by nature pity is conveyed
The kok when he skrapith happith mete to find
Lallith for his hen lo se the gentle kind
Should humayn creaturys than be of cruelnes
Should not they to their neybours show charity
And specyally to them wrappyd in sekenes
Than they that may heal them cause y^ infirmyte

Mother without delay for god sake show me
I pray the heartily without more prayeng
where is the patient that so is paynyng

Fair dasell thou may well have knowledge herto
That in this Lyte is a young knight
And of clear lynage called Calisto
whose life body is all in the I plyght
The pellycan to show naturys right
Fedyth his byrdys me thynkith I should not ^ch the
Thou wotist what I mean lo nature should tech the

A ha is this the intent of thy conclusion
Tell me no more of this matter I charge the
Is this the dolent for whom thow makyst petycyo
Art thow come hither thus to desseyue me
Thow berdyd dame shameless thou semest to be
Is this he that hath the passio offolishnes
Thikyst thow rybaud I am s^ch one of lewdness
It is not said I se well in vayn
The tong of man woman worst members be
Thow brut baud thow great enmy to honest certain
Lause of secret errors Ihu Ihu bnedicite
So good body take this old thef^ fro me
That thus wold me disseyue me (...) her falls sleyght
Go owt of my sight now / get the hens straight

In an yuyll howre cam I hither I may say
I wold I had brokyn my leg twain

Go ^ens thou brothel go hens in the devil way
B^yst thou yet to increase my pain
will thow make me of this foal to be fain
To give hymlyfe to make him merry
And to my self death to make me sorry
wilt thow ^ere a way profet for my perdi^ion
And make me less the house of my fathe^
To wyn the hows of such an old matron
As thow art shamfullyst of all other
Thikist thou that I uderstad not thou falls mother
Thy hurtful message thy falls subtell ways
Make a mend to god thou lyffyst to long days
Answer thou traytres how dare be so bold

The fere of the makyth me so dysmayd
That the blod of my body is almost cold
Alas fair maydyn what hast thou said
To me pore widow why am I denayed
Here my conclusion which is of honest
with out cause ye blame this gentleman me

I sey I will here no more of that foal
was he not here with me euyn now
Thow old which thou bryngyst me in great dole
Ask him what answer he had of me how
I toke his demand as now know may thou
More showing is but lost where no mercy can be
Thus I answered him thus I answer the

The more strange she makyth the gladder am I
There is no tempast that ever doth endure

what seyst thou what seyst thow shameful enmy
Speak out.

so ferd I am of your displeasure
your anger is so great I ^seyue it sure
And your pacyens is in so great an hete
That for wo fere I both weep sweet

Lyttyll is the hete incoparyson to say
To the great boldness of thy demeaning

Fair maiden yet one word now I you pray
Appease we pacyens here my saying
It Is for a prayer mestres my demanding
That is said ye have of saint appolyne
For the toth ache where of this man is in pine
And the girdle there thou weryst about the
So many holy relyke it hath towchyd
That this knight thynkyth his boat thou may be
Therefore let thy pity now be a vouchid
For my hart for fere like a dog is couthyd
The delight of vengen^s who so doth use
Pity at their need shall they^ refuse
if this betrew that thou s^yst to me (...)
Mine hart is lyghtnyd ^eyuyng thecase
I wold be content well (...) I wit how
To bring this seek knight unto some (...)

Fair damsel to the be hesth grace
For if this knight ye were aquap^tyd both two
ye wold not judge him the man that ye do
By god by my soul in him is no malyncoly
with grace indewid in freedom as alexandre
In strength as hectour in countenance merry
Gracious / envy in him reynyd never
Of noble blod as thou knowyst / if ye ^uer
Saw him armyd he seems a saint george
Rather than to be made in nature forge
An angel thou woldist judge him I make avow
The gentle narciso was never so fair
That was inamoryd on his own shadow
wherefore fair maid let thy pity repair
Let mercy be thy mother thou her heir
This knight whom I come for never seasyth
But cries out of pain that styll encresyth

How long time I pray the hath it holdyn him

I thynk he be. xxiiii. years of age
I saw him born help for to fold him

I demand the not thereof thine answer aswage
I ask the how long in this painful rage
He hath leyn /

of trewth fair maydyn as he says
He hath be in this agony this. viii. days
But he semyth he had leyn this. vii. year

O how it greuyth me the il of my pacyent
Knowing his agony thy innocence here
Unto mine anger thou hast made resistens
wherefore thy demand I grant in recompens
Have here my gyrdyll the prayer is not ready
To morrow it shall be / come again secretly
And moder of these word passyd between us
Show uothyng thereof unto this knight
Lest he wold report me cruel furious
I trust the / now be true for thougte be light

I marvel greatly thou dost me so atwyght
Of the dout that thou hast of my secretnes
As secret as thy self I shall be dowteles
And to calisto with this girdle celestina
Shall go and his ledy hart make hole light
For gabriell to our lady with aue maria
Came never gladder than I shall to this knight
Calisto how will thou now sit up right
I have shewid thy water to thy phesycyon
Comfort thy self the field is half won

Moder he is much beholdyn unto the

Fair maydyn for the mercy thou hast done to us
This k^yght I both thy bedfolkis shall be

Moder if need be I will do more than thus

It shall be needful to do so / ryghteous
For this thus begone must nedis have an end
which never can be without ye condescend

well mother to morrow is a new day
I shall perform that I have you promest
Show to this seek knight in all that I may
Bid him be bold in all thyngis honest
And though he to me as yet be but a gest
If my word or dede his holth may support
I shall not fail and thus bid him take comfort

Now cryst comfort ye keep the in thy need
Now say you now is not this matter carried clean
Can not old celestina her matter speed
A thing not well handlyd is not worth a been
Now know ye by ye ^alf tale what ye hole doth ^eane
These women at the first be angry furious
Fair we there comes after stormys tempestyous
And now to calisto I will me dres
which lies now languyshyng in great pain
And show him that he is not remedyles
And bear him this to make him glad and fain
And handyll him so that ye shall sey plain
That I am well worthy to bear the name
For to be called a no^le arch dame
O marvelous god what a dream had I to night
Most terryble vysy on to report and here
I had never none such nor none yerthely wight
Alas when I thynk thereon I quak for fere
It was of melebe^ my daughter dere
God send me good tythyuge of her shortly
For till I here from her I can not be merry

O dere father nothing may me more displease
Nothing may do me more anoyans
Nothing may do me gretter disease
Than to se you father in any perturbans
For me chiefly or for any other chauns
But for me I pray you not to be sad
For I have no cause but to be merry and glad

O sweet melebea my daughter dere
I am replete with ^oy and felycyte
For that ye be now in my presens here
As I perceive in Joy prosperite
From death to life me thynkyth it reuyuyth (...)
For the ferefull dream y^ I had lately

what dream sir was that I pray you heartily

Dowtles me though yt I was walking
In a fair orchard where were places two
The one was a hot ^ath wholesome pleasing
To all people that did repair thereto
To was^h them clen^ them from sekenes also
The other a pyt of foul stynkyng water
shortly they dyed all that there in did enter
And unto this wholesome bath me thought y^ ye
In the right path were coming (...)
But before that me thought that I did see
A foul rough bych aprikeryd cur it was
which strakyng her body along on the gras
And with her tail lykkyd her so that she
Made her self a fair spaniel to be
This bych then me thought met you in the way
Leppyng fawning upon you a pace
And round a bowt you dydrenne play
which made you then disport solas
which lykyd you so well yt in short space
The way to the hot bath anon ye left it
And toke the straight way to the foul pyt
And ever ye looked continually
upon that same bych somoth her eyed
That ye cain to the fonle pyt brynk suddenly
Lvke to have fallyn in to have been destroyed
which when I saw anon than I cried
Stertyng in my sleep therwt did awake
That yet for fere me thynk my body doth quaks
was not this a fcrefull dream marvelous
I pray you daughter what thynk ye now to this
Hic mese^ea certo tempore no ^oquit sed uustu (...)
why speak ye not why be ye now so studious
Is there any thing y^ hath chauncyd you (...)
I am your father tell me what it is

A las now your dream which ye have expressyd
Hath made me all pensyfe sore abashed
I pray you dere daughter now tell me why

Sir I know the canse of your vision
And what your dredefull dream doth signyfye
There of wold I fain now have noticion

Alas dere fade^ alas what have I done
Offendyd god as a wretch unworthy

wherein / dyspayre not god is full of mercy
Than on my knees now I fall down
And of god chefely asking forgyfnes
And next of you for in to oblyuyon
I have put your doctrine lessons dowtles

Fere not daughter I am not merciless
I trust ye have not so greatly offendyd
But that right well it may be amendyd

ye have fosterid me up full lovingly
In virtuous dis^plyne which is the right path
To all grace vert^w which doth sygnyfye
By your dream y^ ^ayre pleasant wholesome bath
The foul pyt whereof ye dremyd which hath
Destroyed so many betokneth ^yse syn
In which alas Thad almost fallyn In
The prikyeryd cur the foul ^ych
which made her self so smooth fair to see
Betokenyth an old queen a bawdy wych
Lallyd celystyne that wo might she be
which with her fair word ay so ^swadydme
That she had almost brought me here unto
To fulfil the foul lust of calis^

Alas dere daughter I taught you a lesson
wh^ch way ye should attain unto vertew
That was every morning to say an orason
Prayeng god for grace all vice to eschew

O dere fader that lesson I have kept true
which preseruyd me / for though I did coset
In mind / yet had he never his intent

The verteu of that prayer I se well on thing
hath preseruyd you from the shame of that sin
But because ye were somewhat consenting
ye have offendid god greatly therein
wherefore daughter ye must now begin
humbly to beseech god of his mercy
For to forgive you your syn mysery

O blyssid lord fader celestial
whose infynite merci no tong can exprese
Though I be a sinner wretch of wrechis all
yet of thy great merci grant me forgifnes
Full sore I repent my sy^ I cofese
Intending hens forth never to offend more
Now humbly I beseech thy mercy therefore

Now yt is well said mine one fayte daughter
Stand up therefore or I know verily
That god is good merciful ever
To all sinners which will ask mercy
And be repentant in will clearly
To syn no more he of his great goodness
will grant them therefore his grace forgif^es
Lo here ye may see what a thing it is
To bring up young people verteously
In good custom / fo^ gra^ doth never mys
To them that use good prayers daily
which hath preseruyd this maid vndoutydly
And kept her fro actual dede of shame
Brought her to grace preseruy^ her good name
wherefore ye vyrgyns (...) maidens all
Unto this example now take good h^de
Serve god daily the sone^ ye shall
To honest goodness no dout proceed
And god shall send you ever his grace at need
To wtstand all evil temptacions
That shall come to you by any occasions
And ye faders mothers other which be
Rulers of young folk your charge is dowtles
To bring them up verteously to see
Them occupied styll in some good bysynes
Not in idol pastime or vnthryftynes
But to tech them some art craft or lernyng
whereby to be able to get their lyffyng
The bryngers up of youth in this region
have done great harm because of their neclyges
Not putting them to lernyng nor occupacyons
So when they have no craft nor sciens
And com to mans state ye see thex{per}ience
That many of them compellyd be
To beg or steal by very necessite
But if there be therefore any remedy
The hedys rulers must first be dylygent
To make good laws execute them straytely
Upon such mistress that be neclygent
Alas we make no laws but ponyshment
when men have offendyd / but laws evermore
wold be made to prevent the cause before
if the cause of the myscheffe were seen before
which by coiecture to fall be most likely
And good laws ordynauncys made therefore
to put a way the cause / yt were best remedt
what is the cause that there be so many
Theft robberies / it is be cause me be
Driven thereto by need pouerte
And what is the verey cause of that need
Be cause they ^abur not for their lyffyng
And trewth is they can not well labour in dede
Be cause in youth of their ydyll vpbryngyng
But this thing shall never come to reforming
But the world cotynually shall be nought
As long as young pepyll be euell vpbrought
wherefore the eternal god that raynyth on hye
Send his merciful grace influens
To all governors that they circumspectly
May rule their inferiors by such prudence
To bring them to vertew dew obedyeus
And that they we all by his great mercy
May be {per}teners of his blessyd glory.
