THaboudant grace of the power deuyne
which doth illumyne ye world inuyron
P^eserue this audyece and cause them to incline
To charity this is my petycyon
For by your pac^ns and supportacyon
A little in^erlude late made and preparyd
Before your presence here shall be declaryd
which of a f^w conclusyons is contriuyd
And point{is} of philosophy natural
But though the matt^r be not so well declaryd
As a great clerk could do nor so substancyall
yet the auctour hereof requiryth you all
Though he be yngnorant and ca^ little skill
To regard his only intent and good will
which in his mind hath oft times ponderyd
what nombre of bok{is} in our tongue maternal
Of joys and tryfellys be made and impryntyd
And few of th^m of matter substancyall
For though m^y make bok{is} yet vnneth ye shall
In our englyshe tongue find any wark{is}
Of conning that is regardyd by clerk{is}
The grek^ th^ romayns with many other mo
In their moder tongue wrote wark{is} excellent
Than if clerk{is} in this r^alm^ would take pain so
Considering that our tongue is now suffycyent
^o expoun any hard sentence evident
^hey might if they would in our englyshe tongue
^ryt^ workys of grauyte sometime among
For divers pr^gnaunt wytt^ (...) this land
^s well of noble men as of mean estate
(...) ^othynge but ^nglyshe can vnderstand^
(...) if conning laten bokys were translate
(...) englyshe w^l corr^t and app^obate
^ in englyshe might be l^rnyd
^ oth^r people in their own tong{is} did
^But now so i^ is that in our englyshe tongue
(...) one th^r^ is that can but rede write
^ will oft presume among
^ to compile and balat{is} to indyte
Some o^ love or other matter not worth a myte
Some to opteyn favour will flatter and gloss
Some write curious term{is} nothing to purpose
Thus every man after his fantesye
will write his conseyte be it never so rude
Be it virtuous vicious wisdom or folly
wherefore to my purpose thus I conclude
why should not th^ the auctour of this interlude
Utter his own^ ^antesy and conseyte also
As well as divers other now a days do
For wys^dom^ and folly is as it is takyn
For ye one callyth wisdom a another callyth folly
y^t among most folk that man is holdyn
most wise / which to be rich studyeth only
But he that for a comyn wealth bysyly
Studyeth and laboryth and lyuyth by godd{is} law
Except he wax rich men count him but a daw
So he that is rich is ever honouryd
All though he have got it never so falsely
The pore being never so wise is reprouyd
This is the oppynyon most comynly
Thorough out the world / and yet no reason why
Therefore in my mind when that all such dawis
Have babelyd what they ca no force of.ii. strawis
For every man in reason thus ought to do
To labour for his own necessary living
And than for the wealth of his neighbor also
But what dyuylish mind have they which musig
And laboring all their lyff{is} do no another thing
But brige riches to their own possession
Nothing regardige their neighbours distruccio
yet all the riches in the world that is
^ysyth of the ground by goddess sendynge
And by the labour of pore mennys handys
And though thou rych^ ma have thereof ye keeping
y^t is not this ^yches of thy getting
Nor oughtyst not in reason to be preysyd ye more
For by other menys labour it is got before
A great wytted man may soon be enrychyd
That laboryth and studyeth for riches only
But how shall his coscyens than be discharged
For all clerk{is} afferme that that man presysely
which studyeth for his own wealth pryncypally
Of god shall deserve but little reward
E^cept he the comyn wealth somewhat regard
So they s^y that that man occupied is
For a comyn wealth which is ever laboring
To rel^ue pore people with temporal goodies
And that it is a comyn good act to bring
People from vice and to use good living
Like wise for a comyn wealth occupied is he
That bryngyth them to knowledge ye yngnorat be
But man to know god is a dyffyculte
Except by a mean he him self inure
which is to know godd{is} creaturys that be
As first them that be of the grosyst nature
And than to know them that be more pure
And so by little and little ascendynge
To know godd{is} creaturys marvelous werkige
And this wise man at the last shall come to
The knowledge of god and his hye mageste
And so to learn to do his dewte and also
To deser^e of his goodness partener to be
wherefore in this work d^claryd shall ye see
First of the element is the sytuacyon
And of their effectis the caul and generation
And though some me thyn^e this matter to hy^
And not mete for an audience vnlernyd
Me think for man nothing more necessary
Than this to know though it be not used
Nor a matter more lowe can not be arguyd
For though the elementis goddess creaturis be
yet they be most gross and lowyst in degre
How dare men presume to be called clerk{is}
Dysputynge of hye creaturis celestial
As things inuysyble and godd{is} hye warkys
And know not these vysyble things inferyall
So they would know hye thing{is} know nothige at all
Of the yerth here whereon they daily be
Another the nature form nor quantyte
wherefore it semyth nothing convenient
A man to study and his time to be stowe
First for the knowledge of hye thing{is} excellent
And of light matters beneth nothing to know
As of these.iiij. elementis here below
whose effectis daily appear here at eye
Such thig{is} to know first / were most mete study
which matter before your presence shortly
In this interlude here shall be declaryd
without great eloquence i rhyme rudely
Because the compyler is but small lernyd
This work with rethoryk is not adournyd
For perhappis in this matter much eloquence
Should make it tedious or hurt the sentence
But because some folk be little disposyd
To sadness / but more to mirth and sport
This phylosophycall work is myxyd
with merry conseytis to give men comfort
And occasyon to cause them to resort
To here this matter / where if they take heed
Some learning to them thereof may {pro}cede
But they that shall now this matter declare
Openly here unto this audience
Be hold I prey you see where they are
The pleyers begin to appear in presence
I se well it is time for me to go hens
And so I will do / therefore now shortly
To god I comyt all this hole company

THe hye mighty most excellent of all
The foutayn of goodness verteu conyng
which is eterne of power most potencyall
The {per}feccyon and first cause of every thing
I mean that only hye na^tu^e naturynge
Lo he by his goodness hath ordeynyd and create
Me here his mynyster called nature naturate
wherefore I am the verey naturate nature
The inmedyate mynyster for the preseruacyon
Of every thing in his kind to endure
And cause of generation and corrupcyon
Of that thing that is brought to distruccyon
A another thing styll I bring forth a gain
Thus wonders^y I work and never in vain
The great wor^d be hold ^o deuydyd wodersly
In to two regyons whereof on I call
The ethereal region with the heuyns hye
Containing the planettys sterris speris all
The lower region called the elemental
Containing these.iiij. elementis be loo
The fire the air the water and yerth also
But yet the elementis and other bodies all
Beneth / take their effectys and operacyons
Of the bodies in the region ethereal
By their influens and constellacyons
They cause here corrupcyons and generacyons
For if the mouyng^ a above should onys cease
Beneth should be another in^r^se nor decrese
These elementis of them self so single be
Unto divers formys can not be deuydyd
yet they comyx to gyder daily ye s^e
whereof divers kinds of thing{is} be ingenderyd
which thing{is} eftsonys when they be corruptyd
yche element I reduce to his ^urst estate
So that nothing can be utterly ad^y^helate
For though the form and fashion of any thing
That is a corporal body be destroyed
yet every matter remaynyth in his being
whereof it was first made and formyd
For corrupcyon of a body comyxyd
is but the resolucyon by time and space
Of every element to his own place
For who that will take any body corporal
And do what he can it to destroy
To break it or grynde it into ^ouder small
To wash to drown to bren it or to dry
yet the air and fire thereof ^aturally
To their own {pro}per places will ascend
The water to the water the yerth to ye yerth tend
For if hete or moisture of any thing certain
By fire or ^e water ^e cons^yd
yet yerth or ashes on yerth will remain
So the elementis can never be destroyed
For essencyaliy there is now at this tide
As much fire air water yerth as was
Ever before this time nether more nor las
wherefore thou man now I speak to the
Remember that thou art compound and create
Of these elementis as other creaturis be
yet they have not all like noble estate
For plantis and herbys grow and be insensate
Brute bestis have memory and their wytt{is} five
But thou hast all those and soul intellectyue
So by reason of thine understanding
Thou hast domynyon of other bestis all
And naturally thou sholdyst desire conynge
To know strange effect{is} and causys natural
Fo^ he that studyeth for the life bestyall
As voluptuous pleasure and bodily rest
I account him never better than a best

O excellent prince and great lord nature
I am thine own child and formyd instrument
I beseech thy grace take me to thy cure
And tech me such scyens thou thikyst expedyet

Than sith thou art so humble and benevolent
That thing that is mete for thy capasyte
And good for thy knowledge I shall Instruct the
First of all thou must consider and see
These elementis which do yche other penetrate
And by continual alteracyon they be
Of them self daily corruptyd and generate
The yerth as a point or center is sytuate
In the mydd{is} of the world / with ye water Joined
with the air fire round hole inuyronyd
Th^ yerth of it self is ponderous and heavy
Cold and dry of his own nature {pro}per
Some part lies dry continually
And part thereof coueryd over with water
Som^ with the salt see some with fresh river
which yerth and the water to gyder with all
So Ioynyd make a round figure sperycall
So the water which is cold moist is food
In and upon the y^rth fyllynge the hol^nes
In divers partis liynge with ye yerth round
yet th^ hyllys and mount^yns of ye yerth excess
Take nothing of hit a way the roundness
In comparison because they be so small
No more than the prikk{is} do that be on a gall
The air which is hot and moist also
And the fire which^ is ever hot and dry
A bout th^ yerth and water Jointly they go
And compass them every where orbycularly
As the white a bout the yolke of an egg doth lye
But the air in the lower part most remaynyth
The fire naturally to the hyer tendyth
The eth^ryall region which conteynyth
The sterrys and planettys and ^uery sphere
A bout the elementis daily mouyth
And coueryth them round a bout every where
Every sterre and sphere in strange manner
Upon his own poles mouy^h-dyuersly
which now to declare were to lunge to tarry
The fire and the air of their naturys be light
Therefore they move by natural prouydence
The water because it is ponderous in weight
Mouyth not naturally but by violence
Of the st^rris and plan^tt{is} by whose influence
The see is compellyd to ebb and flow daily
And fresh waters to spring continually
And though yt the water be gross and heavy
^t nothing so gross as the yerth I wis
Therefore by hete it is vaporyd up lightly
And in the air makyth clouds and mist{is}
But as soon as ever that it grosely is
Geder^d to gyder / it descendyth a gain
And causyth upon ye yerth hayle snow rain
The yerth because of his ponderosyte
A voydyth equally the moving{is} great
Of all extremytes and sperys that be
And ^endyth to the place that is most quiet
So in the myddys of all the sperys is set
Fo^mast abie^t from all manner mouynge
where naturally he restyth mouyth nothing
Mark well now how I have the showed told^
Of every element the very sytuacyon
And qualyte^ wherfor^ this figure b^holde
For a more manifest demonstracyon
And by cause thou sholdyst not put to oblyu^on
My doctrine / this man called studyous desire
with the shall have con^ynuall habytacyon
The styll to exhort more scyens to adquire
For ye more yt thou desyrest to know any thing
Therein thou semyst th^ more a man to be
For that man that desir^th no manner conynge
All that while no better than a b^st is he
why ben the ey^s made but only to see
The legs to bear the body of a creatur^
So ^uery thing is made to do his nature
So like wise reason wit and vnderstondyng
is gyu^n to the man for that thou sholdyst i dede
Know thy maker cause of thine own beyng^
And what ye world is whereof thou doest {pro}cede
wherefore it be houyth the of verey need
The cause of thing{is} ^urst for to learn
And than to know^ laud the hye god eterne

O glorious lord and prince most pleasant
Greatly am I now hold^n unto the
So to illumyne my mind that was yngnorant
with such noble doctrine as thou hast here showed me
wherefore I promise upon my fydelyte
My dylygence to do to keep in memory
And the for to honour styll {per}petually

And sith it hath pleasyd thy grace to admit
Me upon this man to give attendance
with thy doctrine here showed I shall qikkyn his wit
And daily put him in remembrance
His courage and desire I shall also enhance
So that his f^lycyte shall be most of all
To study and to search for causys natural

well than for a seas^n I will depart
Leuynge you to gyder here both twain
what I have shewid man prynt well in thine heart
And mark well this figure yt here shall r^mayne
whereby thou may perceive many things more plain
^ncernynge ye matter I spake of befor^
^nd when that I shall resort here a gain
Of hye point{is} of conynge I shall show ye more

Now humanyte call to your memory
The conynge point{is} that nature hath declaryd
And though he have showed divers poit{is} many
Of the el^mentis so wondersly formed
yet many other causys there are would be lernyd
As to know the generation of thing{is} all
Here in the yerth / how they be ingendryd
As herbys plantys well spring{is} ston and me^all

Those thing{is} to know for me be full expediet
But yet i those point{is} which nature late showed me
My mind in them as yet is not content
For I can no manner wise parceyue nor see
Nor prove by reason why the yerth should be
In the mydd{is} of ye firmament hengyng so small
And the yerth with the water to be roude with all

Me thynkyth my self as to some of those poit{is}
I could give a suffycyent solution
For first of all thou must needs grant this
That the yerth is so deep and botom hath non
Or else there is some gross thing hit stodyth upon
Or else that it hangyth thou must ned{is} consent
Euyn in the mydd{is} of the firmament

what than go forth with thine argument

Tha mark well in y^ day or in a wynters night
The soon and moan and sterris celestial
In the est first they do apere to thy sight
(...) after in the west they do down fall
(...) again in the morrow next of all
(...).xxiiij. hours they be come Just
To^ est poit{is} again where thou sawist them fur^
T^an if the earth shulde be of endless de^nes
Or shulde stand upon any other gross th^g^
It shulde be an impediment dowtles
To the soon moan and sterris in their mouynge
They shulde not so in the est again spring
Therefore in reason it semyth most convenient
The yerth to hang in ye mydd{is} of the fyrmamet

Thine argument in ye point doth me cofoude
That thou hast made but yet it {pro}uytht not right
That the yerth by reason shulde be round
For though ye firmament with his sterris bright
Compass about the yerth each day and night
yet the yerthe may be plain {per}aduentnre
Quadrant triangle or some other figure

That it can not be plain I shall well {pro}ue the
Be cause the sterris that a rise in the oryent
Appear more sooner to them that there be
Than to the other dwelling in the occident
The eclipse is thereof a plain experymente
Of the soon or moan which whane it doth f^
Is never one time of the day in places all
yet the eclyps generally is always
In the hole world as one time being
But when we that dwell here see it in ye mydday
They in the west partis see it in the morning
And they in the est behold it in the evening
And why that should so be no cause can be found
But only by reason that the yerthe is rownde

That reason proves the yerth at the lest
One ways to be rownde I cannot gain say
As for to account frome the est to the west
But yet not withstondynge all that it may
Less his rowndenesse by some other way

Na no dowte yt is rownde every where
which I could prove thou shoudest not say nay
if I had thereto any time and leser
But I know a man called experyens
Of divers instrumentys is never without
Cowed prove all these poyntys yet by his scye^
Can tell how many mile the earth is a bowte
(...) many other strange coclusios no dowte
^ys instrumentys cowed show the so certain
^at every rude carter should them {per}sayue plain

Now would to god I had yt man now here
For the contembtacyon of my mind

if ye will I shall for him enquere
And bring him heder if I can him find

Then might I say ye were to me right kind

I shall assay by god that me dere bought
For cunning is the thing yt would be sought

well hyet quod hykman when yt he smote
His wyffe on the buttock{is} with a bear pot
Aha now god euyn foal god euyn
It is even the knave that I mene
Hast thou done thy babelyng

ye peradventure what than

Tha hold down thy heed like a pretty ma take my blyssyng
Benedicite / I grant to the / this {per}do^
And give the absolution
For thy soth saws / stand up Jack daw
I be shrew thy faders soon
Make rome sirs and let us be merry
with huffa galand singe tyrll on the bery,
And let the wide world wind
Singe fryska Jolly with hey trolyloly
For I se well it is but a folly
For to have a sad mind
For rather than I would use such folly
To pray to study or be pope holy
I had as lyf be ded
By goggys body I tell you true
I speak as I think now else I be shrew
Euyn my next fellows head
Master humanyte sir be your leave
I were right loath you to grieve
Though I do him dyspyse
For if ye knew him as well as I
ye would not use his company
Nor love him in no wise

Sir he looks like an honest man
Therefore I marvel that ye can
This wise him deprave.

Though he loke never so well
I promise you he hath a shrewd sme^

why so I prey you tell

For he saueryth syke a knave

Hold your peas sir ye mys take me
what I trow that ye would make me
Like to one of your kin

Hark sirs here ye not how boldly
He callyth me knave again by polycy
The devil pull of his skyn
I would he were hangyd by the thro^
For by the mess I love him not
we two can never a gre
I am content sir with you to tarry
And I am for you so necessary
ye can not live without me

why sir I say what man be ye

I am called sensual apetyte
All craturs in me delyte
I comfort the wits five
The ^astyng smelling hearing
I refresh the sight and feeling
To all creaturs a live
For when the body wexith hongry
For lack of fode or else thursty
Than with drynkes plesaund
I restore him out of payne
And oft refresshe nature again
with delicate vyand
with plesaunde sound of armonye
The hearing always I satysfy
I dare this well report
The smelling with sweet odovr
And the sight with plesaunte fygovr
And colours I comfort
The feeling that is so plesaunte
Of every member foot or hand
what pleasure therein can be
By the towchynge of so^t harde
Of hot or cold nought in regard
Except it come by me

Than I cannot see the contrary
But ye are for me full necessary
And right convenient.

ye sir beware yet what ye do
For if you forsake my company so
Lord nature will not be content.
Of him ye shall never learn good thing
Another virtue nor no other conynge
This dare I well say

Mary avaunt knave I the defy
Died nature for bide him my copany
what say thou thereto speak openly

As for that I know well nay

No by god I am right sure
For he knows well no creature
without me can live one day

Sir I pray you be content
It is not utterly mine intent
your company to exile
But only to have comunycacyon
And a pastime of recreation
with this man for a while

well for your pleasure I will depart

Now go knave go I beshrew thy hart
The devil send the forward

Now by my troth I marvel greatly
That ever ye would use the company
So myche of such a knave
For if ye do no another thing
But ever study and to be musing
As he would have you it will you bring
At the last unto your grave
ye shulde ever study pryncypall
For to comfort your life natural
with metis and drynkes dilycate
And other pastimes pleasures a monge
Dausynge laughing or pleasant songe
This is mete for your estate

Be cause ye sey so I you {pro}myse
That I have musyd studied such wise
Me thinks my wits weary
My nature desires some refresshynge
And also I have ben so lunge fasting
That I am somewhat hongry

well than will ye go with me
To a tavern where ye shall se
Good pastaunce at your lyberte
Have what so ever ye will

I am content so for to do
if that ye will not fro me go
But keep me company styll

Copany quoth a / ye yt I shall point deuyse
And also do you good and true service
And thereto I plyght my truth
And if that I ever forsake you
I pray god the devil take you

Mary I thank you for that other

A myschyfe on it my tongue loo
will trip sometime what so ever I do
But ye wot what I mene well

ye no force let this matter pass
But seydest eui now thou knewyst where was
A good tavern to make solas
where is that I prey the tell

Mary at the door euyn here by
if we call any th^nge on hye
The taverner will answer

I prey the than call for him now

Mary I will / How taverner how
why dost thou not appear

who is that calls so hastily
I shrew thine heart speak softly
I tell the I am not here

Than I be shrew ye page of thine age
Come hither knave for thine auauntage
why makyst thou hit so tow

For mine auautage mary tha I come
Beware sirs how let me have rome
Lo here I am what seyst thou

Mary thus here is a gentleman I say
That another ete nor drank this day
Therefore ^ell me I the pray
if thou have any good wine

ye shall have spayneshe wine gascoyn
Rose colour whyt claretrampyon
Tyre capryck and maluesyne
Sak raspyce alycaunt rumney
Greek ipocrase new made clary
Such as ye never had
For if ye drink a draught or too
yt will make you or ye thens go
By gogg{is} body stark mad

I wot thou art not without good wine
But here is a gentleman hath list to dine
Can thou get him any good mete

what mete master would ye have

I care not so god me save
So that it be wholesome to ete
I would we had a good stewyd capon

As for capons ye can get none
The kyngys taker toke up each one
I wot well there is none to get

Though all capons be gone what than
yet I can get you a stewed hen
That is ready dyght.

if she be fat yt will do well

Fat or len I cannot tell
But as for this I wot well
She lay at the stews all night.

Thou art a mad gest be this light.

ye sir it is a fellow that never faylys
But cast get my master a dyshe of quales
small birds swalowes or wagtayl{is}
They be light of dygestyon.

Light of dysgestyon for what reason

For physyk puttyth this reason thereto
Because those birds fl to fro
And be continual mouynge

Then know I a lighter mete than y^

I pray the tell me what

if ye will needs know at short lunge
It is euyn a woman's tongue
For that is ever sterynge

Sir I pray the let such fanteses be
And come heder ne'er hark to me
And do after my bidding.
Goo p^ruey us a dinner euyn of the mos^
Of all manner dysshes both sod and roast
That thou can get spare for no cost
if thou make three course

Tha^ ye get another gose nor swane
But a dyshe of dreggys a dyshe of bra^e
A dysshe of draff and I trow than
ye can not get three worse

what whoreson would thou purvey
Bran draff stynkynge dregg{is} I sey
I hold the mad I trow

Gogges passion said ye not thus
That I shulde purvey you three course dysshe^
And these be course Inowe

Three course dysshes quoth a
what mad ^ole thou mys take me clean
I se well thou wotest not what I mene
And vnderstandyst a mys
I mene this wise I would have the
To purvey mete so great plente
That thou sholdyst of necessyte
Serve them at three coursys
That is to understand at one ^rde
Thou should bring them unto y^ ^or^
At three several tymes^

what than I se well ye will make a fes^e

ye by the rode euyn with the greets

By my troth than do ye best
Euyn after my mind
But ye must have more company.

That is true and so would I gladl^
If I knew any to find

why will ye follow my counsel

ye

Than we will have little nell
A {pro}per wench she daunsith well
And Iane with the black lace
we will have bounsynge bess also
And two or three proper wenchis mo
Right feyr and smotter of face

Now be it so thou art saunce pere

Tha I {per}ceyue ye will make god chere

why what shulde I else do

If ye think so best than will I
Go before and make all thing ready
Again ye come thereto

Mary I prey the do so

Than farewell sirs for I am gone

And we shall follow the anon
without any taryyng

Then it is best sir ye make hast
For ye shall spend here but time i wast
And do no another thing

if ye will let us goo by and by

I pray you be it for I am ready
No man better willing
Now cosyn experyens as I may say ye are right welcome to this country without
any feigning.

Sir I thank you thereof heartily
And I am as glad of your company
As any man living.

Sir I vnderstonde that ye have be
In many a stra^nge country
And have had great fylycyte
Strange causes to seek and find

Right far sir I have rydden gone
And seen strange things many one
In affryk / europe and inde
Both est west I have ben far
North also and seen the sowth sterr
Both by see and land
And ben in sondry nacyons
with peple of divers conditions

Marvelous to vnderstonde.
Sir if a man have such courage
Or devotion in pylgrymage
Iheruzalem unto
For to account the next way
How many mile is it I you pray

From hens theder to goo
Sir as for all such questyons
Of towns to know the sytuacyon
How ferr they be a sunder
And other points of cosmogryfy
ye shall never learn then more surely
Then by that fugure yonder
For who that figure did first deuyse
It seems well he was wise
And perfyte in this s^yens
For both these and land also
Lye true and just as they should do
I know by experyens.

who think you brought here this figure

I wot not

Certes lord nature
Him self not lunge a gone
which was here personally
Declarynge hye philosophy
And lafte this figure purposely
For humanytes instruccyon

Dowtles right nobly done

Sir this realm ye knou is callid eglade
Sometime brettayne I vnderstonde
Therefore I prey you poit with your hade
In what place it shulde lye.

Sir this is ynglande lyenge here
And this is skotlade yt Joins him ne'er
Compassyd a bout every where
with the occian see rownde
And next from them westwardly
Here by him self alone doth lie
Irelande that wholesome ground
Here than is the narowe seey
To Calyce and Boleyne the next wey
And flaunders in this {per}te
Here lies france next him ioynynge
And spayn southwarde fro these stadynge
And portugal in this quart
This country is called Italye
Behold where Rome in ye mydd{is} doth lie
And Naples here be yond
And this little See that here is
Is called the Gulf of Uenys
And here venys doth stand
As for almayne lies this way
Here lies denmark and norway
And northwarde on this side
There lies Iselonde where me do fyshe
But be yond that so cold it is
No man may there abide
This See is called the great Occyan
So great it is that never man
Could tell it since the world began
Till now within this.xx. year
westward be found new lands
That we never harde tell of before this
By writing nor other means
yet many now have ben there
And that country is so large of rome
Much longer than all cristendome
without fable or gyle
For divers mariners have it tried
And sailed straight by the cost side
Above.v. thousand mile
But what comodytes be within
No man can tell nor well Imagine
But yet not lunge a go
Some men of this country went
By the kings noble consent
It for to search to that intent
And could not be brought thereto
But they that were they venteres
Have cause to curse their mariners
Falls of promys and dissemblers
That falsely them be trayed
which wold take no pain to sail farther
Than their own list and pleasure
wherefore that voyage and divers other
Such kaytyffes have destroyed
O what a thing had be than
if that they that be englyshe men
Might have ben the first of all
That there shulde have take possession
And made first building habitation
A memory perpetual
And also what an honourable thing
Both to the realm and to the king
To have had his domynyon extendyng^
There into so far a ground
which the noble king of late memory
The most wise prince the.vij. Herry
Caused first for to be found
And what a great meritoryouse dede
It were to have the people instructed
To live more virtuously
And to learn to know of men the manner
And also to know god their maker
which as yet live all bestly
For they another know god nor the deuell
Nor never harde tell of heuyn nor hell
writing nor other scripture
But yet in the stead of god almyght
The honour the soon for his great lygg^
For that doth them great pleasure
Building nor house they have no at all
But wodes / cot{is} / and cauys small
No merueyle though it be so
For they use no manner of iron
Another in told nor other wepon
That shulde help them thereto
Copper they have which is found
In divers places above the ground
yet they dig not therefore
For as I said they have non yryn
whereby they should in the yerth mine
To search for any wore
Great haboundauace of wodd{is} there be
Most part vyr and pine apple tree
Great riches might come thereby
Both pyche and tar and soap asshys
As they make in the eest lands
By brynnynge thereof only
Fyshe they have so great plente
That in hauyns take and slain they be
with stauys withouten fail
Now frenchemen other have food the trade
That yearly of fyshe there they lad
A above an.C. sail
But in the south part of that country
The people there go nakyd always
The land is of so great he^e
And in the north part all the clothes
That they were / is but best{is} skynnes
They have no another fete
But howe the people first began
In that country or whens they cam
For clerks it is a questyon
Other things mo I have in store
That I could tel thereof but now no more
Till a another season

Tha at your pleasure show some other thige
y^ likes me so well your comynige
ye can not talk a mys

Tha will I torn a gain to my matter
Of Cosmogryfy where I was err
Behold take heed to this
Loo estwarde beyond ye great occyan
Here enters the see called mediterran
Of.ij.M. mile of length
The Soudans country lies here by
The great Turk on ye north side doth lie
A man of marvelous strength
This said north {per}te is called europa
And this south {per}te called africa
This eest {per}te is called inde
But this new land{is} found lately
Ben called america by cause only
Americus did first them find
Loo Ihrfin lies in this country
And this be yond is the red see
That moyses makes of mention
This quarter is India minor
And this quarter India mayor
The land of prester Iohn
But northwarde this way as ye se
Many other strange regions there be
And people that we not know
But estwarde on the see side
A prince there is that rulyth wide
Called the Cane of catowe
And this is called the great eest see
which goth all a lunge this wey
Towards the new landis again
But whether that see go thither dyrectly
Or if any wyldernes between them do lie
No man knows for certain
But these ^ewe land{is} by all cosmografye
Frome the cane of catous land ca not lye
Little paste a thousand mile
But from those new land{is} me ma^ ^ayle plain
Estwarde cu to englade agaie
where we began ere while
Lo all this part^ of the yerth which I
Have here discryuyd openly
The north part we do it call
But the south {per}te on the other side
is as large as this full and as wide
which we know nothing at all
Nor whether y^ most {per}te be land or see
Nor whether ^he people that there be
Be besty^l or conning
Nor wh^th^r th^y know god or no
No^ ^ow^ th^y believe nor what they do
Of this we know no^hynge
Lo is not this a thing wooderfull
How that

Pese sir no more of this matter
Behold where humanyte comes here

How sey you master humanyte
I prey you have ye not be mere
And had good recreation

yes I thank the thereof every dell
For we have faryd marvelously well
And had good comunycacyon

what how master where be ye now

what I shrew the what haste hast thou
That thou spekyst so hye

So hye quoth a I trow ye be mad by saint gyle
For did ye not ere while
Make poyntment openly
To come again all to supper
There as ye were to day at dinner
And yet ye pointed not plain
what mete that ye will have dressed
Nor what delycat{is} ye love best
M^ think you far over said

As for mine own {per}te I care not
Dress^ what mete thou love spare not
what so ever thou doest best think

Now if ye put it to my lyberte
Of all met{is} in the world that be
By this light I love best drink

It semyth by thy face so to do
But my master will have mete also
what so ever it cost

By god sir than ye must tell what

At thy discressyon I force not
whether it be soden or roast

well sir than ^are not let me a lone
ye shall se that all thing shall be done
And ordained well and fine

So I require the heartily
And in any wise specyally
Let us have a cup of new wine

ye shall have wine as new as can be
For I may tell you in pryuyte
Hit was brewed but yester night

But that is nothing for my delyte

But than I have for your apetyte
A cup of wine of old claret
There is no better by this light

well I trust the well Inowe

But on thing if it please you now
ye se well I take much payne for you
I trust ye will se to me

ye I {pro}myse the get the hens
And in this matter do thy dylygence
And I shall well reward the

By cause thou lokyst for a reward
One thing for the I have ppared
That here I shall the gyffe
Thou shalt have a knauys skyn
For to put thy body theri^
For term of thy life

Now gramercy my gentle brother
And therefore thou shalt have another
For voydynge of strife

Now farewell gentle Iohn

Than farewell foal for I am gone

A bide torn ones a gain hark what I sey
yet there is a another thing
would do well at our masters washing

what thing is that I the prey

Mary thus can thou tell us yet
where is any rose water to get

ye that I can well purney
As good as ever you put to your nose
For there is a ^eyre wench called rose
Dystylleth a quart every day

By god I would a pynt of that
were p^wryd ^uyn upon thy pate
Before all this presence

yet I had lever she and I
where both to gyther secretly
In some corner in the spence
For by god it is a pretty girl
It is a world to se her whyrle
Daunsynge in a round
O lord god how she will trip
She will bounce it she will whyp
ye clean above the ground

well let all such matters pass I sey
And get the hens and goo thy way
About this other matter

Than I goo straight lo fare ye well

But loke yet thou remember ^uerydell
That I spake of full ere

yes I warrant you do not fere

Goddis lord s^ist not who is here now
what study^{us} desire what newis with you

ye shall know sir or I go

what art thou here I se well I
The mo kn^ys the worse company

Thy lewd conditions thou doest styll occupy
As thou art wont to do

But I s^y who is this here in presence

Sir this is the man called experiens
That I spake of before

Experyens why is this he
Sir ye are right welcome unto me
And shall be ever more

Sir I thank you thereof heartily
But I assure you feythfully
I have small courage here to tarry
As lunge as this man is here

why whoreson what eylyst at me

For thou hast ever so lewd a {pro}pert
Science to dispyse and yet thou art he
That nought can nor nought will lere

Mary auaut knave I make god avow
I think my self as conynge as thou
And that shall I prove shortly
I shall put the a questyon now come ne'er
Let me se how well thou can answer
How spellest this word tom Couper
In true a^tografye

Tom co^per quoth a a wise qu^styo herdly

ye I tel y^ again yet / tom cou{per} how spellyst it
Lo he hath for gotten ye may se
The first word of his a b c.
Hark foal hark I will tech the
P. a. pa. t. ^. r. ^er. do to gyther tom couper
is not this a sore matter
Loo here ye may se him {pro}uyd a foal
He had more need to go to scole
Than to come hither to clatter

Certain this is a solution
Mete for such a boys questyon

Sensual apetyte I prey the
Let pass all such tryfles and vanyte
For a wy^e it shall not lunge be
And depart I the require
For I would talk a word or two
with this man here or he hens go
For to satysfy my desire

why goggis soul will ye so shortly
Break poyntment with yonder company
where ye shulde come to supper
I trust ye will not break {pro}mys so

I care not greatly if I do
yt is but a tavern matter

Than will I go show them what ye sey

Spare not if thou will go thy wey
For I will here tarry

Tha a dew for a while I tel you plain
But I {pro}myse you when I come a gain
I shall make yonder knauys twain
To repent and be sorry

Now I am full glad that he is gone

So am I for good will he do none
To no man living
But this is the man with whom ye shall
I trust be well content with all
And glad of his coming
For he hath expownyd connyngly
Divers points of Cosmogryfy
In few words and short clause

So I understand he hath god science
And that he hath by plain ex{per}ience
Lernyd many a strange cause

ye sir and I say for my {per}te
He is the conyngest man in that art
That ever I could find
For ask what questyon ye will do
Howe the yerth is round or other mo
He will satisfy your mind

why what dout have ye therein found
Think ye the yerth shulde not be round
Or else howe suppose ye

One wey it is round I must consent
For this man provide it evident
Toward the eest and occydent
It must nedis round be

And likewise from the south to north

That point to prove were su thake worth

yes that I can well prove
For this ye know as well as I
ye se the north star in the sky
Mark well ye shall vnethe it spy
That ever it doth remove
But this I assure you if you go
Northwarde an hundredth mile or two
ye shall think it rises
And how that it is ne'er approached
The point over the top of your head
which is called your zenyth
yet if ye go the other wey
Southwarde.x. or.xii. days Journey
ye shall then think anon
It descend and come more ny
The sercle {per}tynge the yerth and sky
As ye loke straight with your eye
which is called your oryson
But ye may go southwarde so far
That at the last that same star
will seem so far down right
Clear under neth your oryson
That sight thereof can you have non
The yerth will stop your sight
This {pro}uyth of necessyte
That the yerth must nedis round be
This conclulsyon doth it try

Now that is the {pro}perist conclusion
That ever I herd for by reason
No man may hit deuye
But sir if that aman sail far
Upon the see will than that star
Do there as on the ground

ye doutles sayl^ northward rise it will
And sail southwarde it falls still
And that prouyth the see round

So doth it in mine oppynyon
But know you any other conclusion
To prove it round save that alone

ye that I know right well
As thus mark well when y^ see is clear
That no storm nor wawe thero doth pere
This mariners can tell
Than if a fire be made on night
Upon the shore that gives great light
And a ship in the see far
They in the top the fire se shall
And they on hache nothing at all
yet they on haches be nerr
Also on the see where men be saylynge
Far frome land they se nothing
But the water and the sky
yet when they draw the land more ne'er
Than the hill tops begin to apere
Styll the ne'er more hye and hye
As though they were styll growing fast
Out of the see till at last
when they come the shore to
They se the hill top foot and all
which thing so could not be fall
But the see lay round also

Me thinks your argumet sowhat hard

Than ye shall have it more plainly declared
If ye ^aue great desire
For here loo by mine instrumentis
I can show the plain ex{per}iment{is}

Thereto I you require

with all my heart it shall be done
But for the first conclusion
That I spake of the fire
Be this the s^ey that is so round
And this the fire upon the ground
And this the ship that is here
ye know well that a man sight
Can never be but in a lyne right

Just you say that is clear

Mark well than may not yt manis eye
with argyng here their fo^y^ (...)
That is not worth iij. straws
I love not this horeson losophers
Nor this great conyng extromers
That tell how far it is to the sterres
I hate all manner conning
I would ye knew it I am Ignorance
A lord I am of gretter pusans
Than the king of yngland or france
ye the grettyst lord living
I have servant{is} at my retynew
That lunge to me I assure you
Here with in ynglande
That with me yngnorance dwell styll
And term of life cotynew will
A above v C. thousand

Gogg{is} naylys I have payed so of the I trow

why man what eylyth y^ so to blow

For I was at a shrewd fray

Hast thou any of them slain than

ye I have slain them every man
Save them that ran away

why is any of them skapyd gone

ye by gogg{is} body euerychone
All that ever were there

O sir ye know right well this
That when any man is
In other men's company
He must ned{is} follow the appyte
Of such thing{is} as they delyte
Some time among perdy

But such knaves wold always have y^
To put all thy mind felicite
In this folysh conyng to study
which if thou do will make ye mad
And always to be pensyf sad
Thou shalt never be merry

Merry quod a / no I make god avow
But I pray ye master hark on word now
And answer this thing
whether thought you it better chere
At the tavern where we were ere
Or ell{is} to clatter with these knaves here
Of their folysh cunning

Nay I can not say the contrary
But y^ I had much myryer company
At the tauer^e than in this place

Than if ye have any wit or brayn
Let us go to the tavern again
And make some merry solace

if he will do so tha doth he wisely

By my troth I care not gretely
For I am indyfferent to all company
whether it be here or there

Then I shall tell you what we will do
Master yngnorans you he also
Shall tarry both styll here
And I will go fet hither a copany
That ye shall here the sing as sweetly
As they were angel{is} clear
And yet I shall bring hydyr a another sort
Of lustily bludd{is} to make disport
That shall both dance spring
And torn clean above ye ground
with fryscas with gambawd{is} round
That all the hall shall ring
And yt done with in an howre or twain
I shall at the town again
Prepare for you a banquet
Of metys that be most delicate
And most pleasant drink{is} wynes there ate
That is possible to get
^which shall be in a chamber feyre
Replete with sot fragrat eyre
Preparyd point deuyse
with damask water made so well
That all y^ hows thereof shall smell
As it were pardyse
And after that if ye will touche
A feyre wench nakyd in a couch
Of a soft bed of down
For to satisfy your wanto lust
I shall apoynt you a trull of trust
Not a feyrer in this town
And when ye have taken your delyte
And thus satisfied the appetite
Of your wyttis five
ye may sey than I am a seruaunt
For you so necessary and pleasant
I trow non such a live

Now by the wey that god did walk
It coforthe mine heart to here the talk
Thy mache was never seyn

Than go thy wey by and by
And bring in this company
And he and I will here tarry
Till thou come again

And I prey the heartily also

At your request so shall I do
Lo I am gone now fare well
I shall bring them in to this hall
And come my self formast of all
And of these reuellis be ch^fe mershall
And order all thing well

Now set thy heart on a merry pyn
Agayns these lusty bludd{is} come in
And drive fantesys a wey

And so I will by heuyn king
If they other dance or singe
Have a monge them by this day

Than thou takyst good wise weys
And so shalt thou best please
All this hole company
For the folyshe arguing yt thou hast had
with that knave experiens yt hath made
All these folk thereof weary
For all they that be now in this hall
They be the most {per}te my seruaunt{is} all
And love pryncypally
Disportis as daunsynge syngyuge
Toys tryfuls laughing gestynge
For conning they set not by

I se well such company ever more
As sensuell appetite is gone fore
will please well this audyens

ye that I suppose they will
But peas hark I prey the be styll
I wene they be not far hens
^

P^ase sirs peas now peas sirs all

why who is that so hye doth call

Sylence I say be you among
For we be dysposyd to sing a song

Come in then boldly a mong this presens
For here ye shall have good audyens.

I ^an you thank y^ is done well
It is pity ye had not a mynstrell
For to angment your solas

As for mynstrell it makes no force
ye shall se me dance a course
without a mynstrell be it better or worse
Follow a^l I will led a trace

Now have a monge you by this light

That is well said be god almyght
Make rome sirs gy^ them p^ace
So merely let us dance ey / so merely c
And I can dance it gyngerly I c
And I can foot it by by I c
And I can prank it {pro}perly
And I can countenaunse comely
And I can kroke it curtesly
And I can leap it lustily
And I can torn it trymly
And I can fryske it freshly
And I can loke it lordly

I can the thank sensual apetyte
That is y^ best dance with out a py^e
That I saw this seven year

This dance wold do much better yet
if we had a kyt or taberet
But alas there is none here

Then let us go to ye tavern again
There shall we be sure of one or twain
Of mynstrell{is} yt can well play

Then go I pray ye by by
And purvey some mynstrell ready
And he I will follow shortly
As fast as ever we may

There with I am right well content

Then will I go in continent
And prepare every thing
That is meetly to be done
And for lack of mynstrell{is} y^ mean seaso
Now will we begin to sing
^
Now we will here begin to sing
For dance can we nomore
For mynstrell{is} here be all lacking
To ye tavern we will therefore

Now if that sensual appetite ca find
Any good mynstrell{is} after his mind
Dowt not we shall have good sport

And so shall we have for a suerte
But what shall we do now tell me
The mean while for our comfort

Then let us some lusty ballet sing

Nay sir by ye heuyn king
For me thynkyth it seruyth for no thyn^
All such peuysh prykyeryd song

Pes man pryksong may not be dispysy^
For there with god is well plesyd
Honowryd praysyd served
In the church oft times among

Is god well pleasyd trowst thou thereby
Nay nay for there is no reason why
For is it not as good to say plainly
Gyf me a spad^
As gyf me a spa ve va ve va ve vade
But if thou will have a song yt is good
I have one of robyn hod
The best that ever was made

Then a feleshyp let us here it

But there is a bordon thou must bear it
Or else it will not be

Than begin and care no^ ^o^

Robyn hod in barnysdale stood
And lent him till a mapyll thystyll
Tha cam our lady sweet saint andrewe
Slepyst thou wakyst thou geffrey coke
A.C. winter the water was deep
I can not tell you how broad
He toke a gose neck in his hand
And over the water he went
He start up to a thystell top
And cut him down a holyn clobe
He stroke ye wren between the hornys
That fire sprang out of the pygg{is} tail
Iak boy is thy bow I broke
Or hath any ma done ye wryguldy wrage
He plukkyd muskyllys out of a willow
And put them in to his sachell
wylkyn was an archer good
And well could handell a spade
He toke his bend bow in his hand
And set him down by the fire
He toke with him.lx. bows and ten
A pese of befe a another of baken
Of all the birds in merry englond
So merely pypys the merry botell

well Humanyte now I see plainly
That thou hast used much folly
The while I have ben absent

Sir I trust I have done nothing
That should be contrary to your pleasynge
Nor never was mine intent
For I have followed the counsel clear
As ye me bad of studyouse desire
And for necessyte a monge
Sometime sensual appety^{is} counsel
For without him ye ^nowe right well
My life can not endure lunge

Though it be for the full necessary
For thy comfort sometime to satysfy
Thy sensual appetite
yet it is not convenient for the
To put therein thy felycyte
And all thy hole dely^e
For if thou will learn no sciens
Another by study nor experiens
I shall the never advance
But in the world thou shalt dure than
Dyspysed of every wise man
Like this rude best ygnoraunce
