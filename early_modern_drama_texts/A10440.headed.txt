A dyaloge between the Merchant the Knight and the plowman dysputyng who is a
verey Gentleman who is a Noble man and how men should come to auctoryte /
compilid in manner of an enterlude with divers toys geftis addyd thereto to make
merry pastime and disport.

O what a great wealth and prosperyte
It is to any reme where merchants be
Having fre lyberte and entercours also
All marchaundyse to covey to and fro
Which thing I have used and the verey fet found
And thereby gotton many a thousand pound
Wherefore now be cause of my great riches
Thoroughowt this land in every place doubtless
I am magnyfyed and greatly regardyd
And for a wise and noble man estemyd

Master merchant I here you right well
But now in presumpsion me thynk ye excel
To call yourself noble in presence here
I wis men know what your ancestors were
And of what great stock descendid ye be
Your fadyr was but a black smyth perde

Why sir what than what be you I pray you

Mary I am a gentleman I wold ye know
And may dispend yearly v.C. mark land
And I am sure all that ye have in hand
Of yearly rent is not worth v. markys

But I wold thou knewist for all thy krakkys
I am able to bye now all the land
That thou hast and pay for it out of hand
Which I have got by mine own labour and wit

Yet art thou but a chorle and I have a skorn
Thou shuldist compare with me a gentleman born

Why what callyst thou a gentleman tel me

Mary I call them gentylmen that be
Born to great landys by inherytaunce
As mine ancestors by cotynuaunce
Have had this v.C. year of whom now I
Am desendid and commyn lynyally
Beryng the same name and armies also
That they bare this v.C. year agoo
Mine ancestors also have ever be
Lords Knights and in great auctoryte
Capteyns in the war and governors
And also in time of peas great rulers
And thyn were never but artysycers
As smyth{is} mason{is} carpentars or weuars

All that is trewth I will not deny now
Yet I am more gentleman born than thou
For I call him a gentleman that gentilly
Doth gyf unto other men lovingly
Such thing as he hath of his own pper
But he that takith ought away from a another
And doth gyf him no thing again therefore
Owght to be called a chorle evermore
But mine ancestors have giffyn alwey
To thyn ancestors such thing as they
By their labours did trewly get and wyn
For mine ancestors bildid howsis wherein
Thine ancestors have had their dwelling place
Also mine ancestors have made tolis
To all manner crafti men belonging
Whereby clothis and every other thing
Where of thyn ancestors need have had
With the same tolys have ever be made
So mine ancestors have gyffin their labours
Ever to comfort and help thyn ancestors

I deny that ever thauncestours of thine
Did ever gif to the ancestors of mine
At any time any thing except that they
Gafe some what therefore other ware or money

Mary god a mercy Iohn for that now
That is euyn a pyg of our own sow
How can lords estatis have ought in store
Except thartyfycers do get it before
For all metalis be dyggyd first by myners
And after wrought by the artyfycers
woll fell and every other thing
That is necessary to mannys covering
And all other thyngis that men use were
Is al wey made by the artyfycer

I grant that the artyfycers do make it
But be cause comenly they have little wit
Gentylmen that have landys domynyon
Of all such riches have most possession
For reason will ever it should so be
wise men to have folys in captyuyte

Mary as for wit subtell inuencyou
Mine ancestors with thine may make co{per}ison
For though my fader were a smyth what than
yet was he a marvelous quyk wyttyd man
And could work as well for his {per}t
As any in this land using that art
And deuyse new fassyons in chynges that he made
That every man to bye his ware was glad
And carve grave in iron steal
Both Image letters marvelously wele
And there on ley gold gilt it also
Fine pure as any gold smyth could do
My grauntfader also was a mason
Of great wit as any in this regyon
And could byld a castle tour right well
In which some of thy kynnys men now do dwell
where in aperyth right good masonry
with Immagys armies wrought curyously
My great graundfadyr lo was a weuer
Of wollyn yarn of other ger
And made marvelous pleasant workis to be hold
Lynyn dya{per} sylk cloth of gold
All such subtell thyngis as I have rehersyd lo
Mine ancestors by their wyttis could work do
And as for thine ancestors I know no thing
They could do bi their wittis worth of praising
But use occupi wast ever more
Such thyngis as mine ancestors (...) before
And thou thie ancestors (...)
Of such thingis wrought (...)
Of other men oughtist not be praised therefore
But the praise ought to be given ever more
To the artyfycer which by his wit
It deuysyd and so conyngly wrought it
wherefore if thou sey that wit polesy
Be the thing{is} perteynyng to gentry
Thyn ancestors may never compare with, mine
For their act{is} prove them wiser than thine
For thyn did never no thing in their days
Concerning quyk wit that was worthy prays

yes I wis lewd Iauell I wold thou knewist it
Mine ancestors have had more wisdom wit
Than thine have had could do also
Many things that thine could never do
for in the country at sessyons and syse
They have be elect to be Justice
And for theyer wit and great discretion
They have Iuggyd and donne correccyon
Upon thine ancestors artyfycers
That have made false warys ben dysseyuers
And help for to maynteyn every thing
That is to the comyn weith pteynyng
They have ben also in time of war
Both in this land other courreys far
Dukrs leders of the hole army
And by their wyttis warly polycy
Study forecast diligent travail
Have won many a great fyld battle
And thine ancestors that were there
were never able to bear shyld nor sphere
And were never but soldyars pyoners
Nor never had wisdom to be rulers
But because mine ancestors have ever be
Discrete wise they have had anctoryte

Nay nay thine ancestors cam never all
To auctoryte for wisdom pncypall
For though so were wise yet some of the again
Had small discression little wit or brayn
But because of the long cotynuannce
Of their great possessions by enherytaunce
By the folysh manner of the world we see
For that cause ever they have had auctorite

And I say that good reason agreth to it
For though the fader have no great wit
The soon that is wise should never the more
Lose his land or auctoryte therefore
For he that by study dylygens pain
Great landys or possessyons doth attain
His own life is to short to lyte
For to take the fruit of his meryte
Reason would therefore that after his life
His heyrs before strangers have progatyfe
And the cotynuaunce of such possessyons
Makyth noble men gentle conditions
And they whose blode hath long continued
As gentylmen so they should be honoured
And so mine ancestors long time have be
Great possyssyoners and in auctoryte
Therefore considering my great lynage
My blode my noble birth and parentage
Thou art not able to compare with me
Another in gentylnes nor in nobylyte

Nowhere is bybbyll babbyll clytter clatter
I hard never of so folysh a matter
But by goddess body to speak the troth
I am better than other of you both

Avaunt kanker de chorle fro whens comyst thou

Mary folysh peuysh daw even fro my plow
Now say would any thing there wtall

ye mary thou lewyd villain rud rascal
It is for the full ill besemyng
To {per}turb any gentylmens talking

Gentylmen ye gentylmen Iak hearing
Put your shone in your bosom for weryng
I account myself by goddess body
Better than you both and more worthy

Avaunt knave get the out of the gate
Or I shall lay my sword on thy pate

That shall I prove I make god avow
Never in better time have at the now

Now hold thy hand fellow I the pray
And harkyn what I shall to the say

Sey knave say what can sey

Hold thy hand I pray the com no narr
I am a merchant no man of war

Thou art not honest I tell the plainly
To make any quarrel here so suddenly
To {per}turb our comunycacyon

Here ye may se sirs by goddess passion
Two proud folys make a crakkyng
And when it comes to point dare do no thing

Our coming hyder our intent
is not to fight but by way of argument
Every man to show his oppinyon
To see who could show the best reason
To prove him self noble most gentleman

By god all the reasons sith ye began
That ye have made thereof be not worth a fly

No sir I pray the than tell me why

First as touching nobleness I say
There is another of you both did {pro}ue or lay
Any of your acts whereby that ye
Shulde in reason {pro}ue you noble to be
Or thereby deserve any manner praysyng
But all the effect of your arguing
To prove your nobleness was but only
Of the deddys act{is} of your ancestry
And of the act{is} that your ancestors did before
ye at the nobler never the more

As touching my self I dare make compison
Of as noble deeds as he hath any done
For I am have ben one of the cheualry
At the commandment of my prince euerredy
And every time of war have be captain
And leder of a.M. men or twain
And with horse harnes sphere and sheld
Have Ioydyd my body in every field
The rent{is} of my landys have spend liberally
And kept a great house continually
And help to ponyssh theuys brybers alwey
To the great tranqaylyte of my contrary
And you master merchaut wit never take labour
Except it be for your {pro}ffet and lucoure

Go to go to now master merchant
There is a reason that gyuyth you a taunt
I trow more than you can answer well

Nay I wis pyvysh rude Iak Iauell
I can make an answer so substancyally
where to another of you is able to reply

If thou can answer my reason do

That can I well do. P. Then go to foal go to

I say the comyn well of every land
In fete of marchauntdyse doth pryncypally stand
For if our comoditees be vtteryd for nought
In to strange landis and no riches brought
Hydyr therefore / we should come to beggary
And all men dryffyn to lyf in mysery
The we noble marchauntis that in this reame be
what a great wealth to this land do we
we utter our warys by theyrs good chepe
And bring them hyder that great {pro}ffet
And pleasure daily comes to this regyon
Too all manner people that here do won
Forthermore ye see well with your eyes
That of straynge landis the comodytees
we have such need of them that be there
That in no wise we may them for bear
As oil sylkis frutis spices also
Gold silver yryn other metal is moo
All dramys druggys longing to physyke
which men must needs have when they be seek
which in this reame can not well grow
Our cotrey is to cold not hot I now
with out which thyngis we shulde life in mysery
And oft times for lak of them we shulde dye
And I spend my studi labour continually
And cause such thyngis to come hyder daily
For the comfort of this land come wealth
And to all the people great, pffer health
And for such noble deeds reason will than
That I ought to be called a noble man
And another of you both that here now be
In nobleness may accompare with me

Now well hit by gods body well hit
Of one that hath but lyttyll wit
Answer me one word first I pray the
what is the noblest thing that can be

what say thou thereto thy self let see

Is not yt the noblyst thing in dede
That of all other thyngis hath lest need
As god which beynith etern in bliss
Is not he the noblest thing yt is

yes mary no man in reason can that deny

well than there is no reason thereof why
But because he is the thing omnipotent
And is in hun self so suffycyent
And nedyth the help of no nothyr thing
To the help of his glorious being
But every other thing hath need of his aid

Mary that is very trough well said

And lykwyse yt thing that hath most need
Is the thing that is most wretched
So suffycyency is ever nobleness
And necessyte is ever wrechydnes
And he that hath more need of that thing
For the pteruacyon of his living
Then his fellow hath his fellow must ned{is} be
By this same reason more noble than he
what than.P. by the same reason it {pro}uith lo
ye be but caytyff{is} wrechis both two
And by the same reason {pro}ue I shall
That I am the noblyst man of us all
For I have need of no manner thing
That ye can do to help of my lyffyng
For every thing whereby ye do lyf
I noryss it to you both do gyf
I plow I till I ster the ground
whereby I make the corn to habounde
whereof there is made both drink bred
wych the which daily ye must nedis be fed
I noryss the catell fowlys also
Fyssh herbis other thyngie mo
Fell herr woll which the bestis do bear
I noryssh preserve which ye do were
which if ye had not no dowt ye should
Starve for sak of clothis because of cold
So both you shulde die or live in necessite
If ye had not comfort help of me
And as for your fine cloth costly array
I cannot see whi ye ought or my
Call your self noble because ye were it
which was made bi other menis labour wit
And also your delicate drinkis viand
Bi other menis labours be made so pleasand
Therefore master merchant now to you I sei
I can not see but I am able my
Lyf without you or your purueaunce
Live without you or your purveyance
For of fode cloth I have suffisaunce
Of my self for lyffing necessary
And now sir knight to you I sey plainly
I see not that ye can any thing do
For the comyn well or ought longing thereto
But each man being in auctoryte
Having wit may do it as well as ye
Therefore to spek now of necessyte
There is another of you both but ye be
In more need than I therefore I sey plain
I am more noble than other of you twain
Now that is a folysh reason so god me save
For by the same reason thou would have
Every best fyssh other foul than
To be more noble of birth than a man
For man hath more need of bodily covering
Than they have for they need no thing
The best{is} have herr also a thik skin
The fish skalis or shelis to keep their bodies in
The foulis fethirs so every thing
Bi nature hath his {pro}per covering
Save man himself which is born all nakyd
And therefore he should be than most wrechyd

Mary no man can make a better reason
For that is a sure a true conclusion
For if a child when he is first born
were not help coueryd he were soon lorn
He hath no strenght to help him never a dell
yet bestis have power to help them self well
So cosideryng mans body in dede
A best is more noble man more wrechyd
Be cause he hath need of many mo thyngis
Than bestis have to help of theyer lyffyngis
Also man must daily labour sweet
To get him sustynaunce as drink mete
The ground he must dig the bestis kill
For breed and mete his body to fill
Grapis frutis and herbis norssh diligently
To make good drynkis to refressh his body
But all brut bestis have covering natural
Sufficyent to cover their bodies with all
And find their fode ever on the ground ready
with out any pain labour or study
So every man by reason of his body
Is more wrechyd in more mysery
Than best{is} be / yet thus not wythstandyng
Man is most noble of creature{is} living
Not by his body for that is impotent
But by his soul being so excellent
For by reason of his soul intyllectyue
He subde with all other best{is} alive
And copellyth all other bestis that be
By his wit to releue his necessyte
But bestis have no wit them self to defend
Nor can get no more than god hath them send
For take any best that weryth heer
And do clyp it of bare a gayns winter
That best hath no manner of polecy
To get other covering for his body
Of cloth nor skyns nor hath no wit
To put it upon him though one have made it
Nor can byld no house nor kyndyl no fire
To warm his body if need should require
But yet a man hath wit understanding
For to help him self in every such thing
So man for his soul intellectual
Is most noble creature of bestis all

That is a verey good preguant reason
yet me thynkith thou makist a degression
From the argument that we first began
which was to {pro}ue who was most gentleman
which we disputyd I wold thou haddist hard it

Tussh I hard what ye said everi whit

Then show thy reason therein or thou go

Nay be god I have some what ells to do
I must go by me a halporth of gresse
The spokes of my cart therewith to dress
Trow ye that I will leave my bysynes
For your babelyng pomp folysshnes
Nay by sent mary I will not do so
For I can now to the market goo
And for an haipeny as much gresse by
As shall cost me in our town a penny
And I tell the plainly with out any bost
A halpeny is as well sauid as lost

Straw for an halpeny therein is no wast
Tarry with us a while phapps thou mast
By our acquaintance now here get more
Than thou gatist with thy cart this monyth before

Straw for thy council torde a fart
Trowist I will gyf up my plow or cart
And follow thy foolish appityte and mind
Nay I am not yet so mad nor so blind
For when I am at my cart of plow
I am more meryer than other of you
I wold not change my lyf nor my lyffyng
For to be made a great lord or a king
There is no joy nor pleasure in this world here
But hill belly fill and make good chere
Be if prince lord gentleman or knave
Hit is all the joy that here be can have
But these covetous and ambitious wretches
They set there myndys in honour and riches
So much that they be never content
So they lyf ever in pain and torment
But a man that can this means find
To have fode and cloth and a merry mind
And to desire no more than is needful
That is in this world the lyf most joyful
Which life in this world no man shall acquire
Till he subdew his insaciat desire

I see well thou has a cursed apysh wit
Then if thou will depart I pray the yet
Come again when thy bisines is do

For what intent now should I do so

For we will in owre old argument prosede
Who shulde be called a gentleman in dede
And we would be glade to here thy reason

I will come again upon a condition
That ye will wait upon me both twain
And be not out of the way when I come again

We will not be far hens P. then I will not fail

Then I pray the let not the pmise quail

Lo here is my finger now trust me well
I will come again if I have my heal
For by god I promise you one thing
I am as true of my word as the King
But if I find you not here then by my trough
I shall call you oppenly false knauys both

Thou shalt find us true in every thing

I thynk so / except lying and stelyng

Then far well for a season a dew
Then fare ye well both I dare say as true
As some that be tyede in newgate

well now he is gone god speed well his gate
But what shall we do now the mean season

Let us take now some recreation
And come again here and keep our poyntment

Now thereto I am right well content
And in the meayn while good lord of thy grace
Preserve all the people here in this place

Here I may walk and wander to and fro
But I se not them which I wold speak to

Yes by rode here we be both twain
To whom thou dydyst promys to mete here again
To dyspute the questyon that we began
which of us could prove him most gentleman

Thou seydest thou hardyst our arguments all

so did I another good nor substancy all
For thy folysh and pyuysh oppynyon
was because of the great domynyon
Of the landis and rentis where to thou wast bore
which thyn ancestors had long time before
Thou thynkyst thy self a gentleman to be
Ant that is a folysh reason semyth no
For when adam dolf and eve span
who was then a gentleman
But then cam the churl and gederyd good
And there began first the gentle blood
And I thynk verily ye do believe
That we cam all of adam and eve
Then to speak by reason great possessions
Make no gentylmen but gentle conditions
That is the cause and best reason why
One should be called a gentleman truly
And forthermor mark well this reason then
If a manis ancestors have be gentylmen
And virtuous and good to commyn well
That ought to be reputyd never adell
To the praise of the child which doth refuse
Such good codycyons the contrary use
But he ought to be dyspraysyd the more
Because his ancestors hath shewid him before
A precedent of gentylnes vertew
which good example he doth not infew
For the gentylnes of hysblode clery
In him doth decay utterly dye
So he that vsyth codycyons virtuous
Though that his ancestors were vicious
Ought not to be dyspraysyd therefore
But ought to be honoryd praysyd the more

yet me thynkyth more honour shulde be gyffyn
To him which is of noble blood kin

Then if thou will loke honoured to be
Be cause of thy blod then mark well see
The vylyst beggar that goth by the door
Had ye not both one god creature
ye cam of one first stok {pro}genye
Both of adam eve ye will not deny
The beggar thou were both do wtles
Lonseyuyd born infylth uncleanness
Thy blood the beggars of one colour be
Thou art as apt to take seknes as he
if thou be in the body woundyd
Thy flessh is as ill as his to be helyd
Alas I have known many or this
So proud of their birth that all theyrlyffys
wold gyf them to no labour nor lernyng
which brought them to miserable ending
That in pouerte wrechydly did dye
Or fallyn to theft hangyd therefore full hye
So I sey vertew good codycyons than
Is that which makyth the very gentleman
And though the fadyr may bequeth to his son
Hyts riches his land his possess yon
yet may he nothyr gyf nor vequeth
Unto him in no wise after his death
His vertew nor his gentle codyeyons
They can not descend as other possessyons
And if thou will be a gentleman needs
Thou must than use vertew gentle deeds

Why desire men then praise evermore
Of the actis of their ancestors done before

One cause there of is for lak of lernyng
They {per}seyue not the reason of the thing
Another is be cause there be many
That call them self gentylmen unworthy
which life voluptuously bestyall
And do no good in the world at all
But lyse in pride sloth vnthrystynes
And be cause they have no manner goodness
Nor {pro}pert nor vertew in them where by
Any man shulde thynk them any praise worthy
Therefore they seek for comendacyon
Of the act{is} that their ancestors have done

Then Imeruell men desire to be called
Of the blode of them that excellyd
In worldly honour as king{is} em{per}ours
where some were tyrant{is} some were coquerours
And few desire to be called of their blod
which have ben called Just me virtuous good
And used indifferent Justice equyte
Mekenes abstynens or wilful pouerte

if I should tell the the verey cause true
It is because they love no such vertew
which vertew gentle codycyons should be
Longing to gentylmen of {pro}pert

If gentle codycyons be the cause lo
Tken will I compare with both you two
For I have used ever gentle manner
And so have mine ancestors that before were
For fursto: all when this world began
Long after there were but few people than
Men had suffycyent of every thing
with out great labour for fode clothing
All thing was in comyn among them doutles
But after ward when people did increse
Ich man to increse his pleasure volupte
Of good{is} lands desired {pro}pert
wereof great sttyf debate did arise
The such as my aucestours were that werewyse
Did studi to make laws how the people might be
Lyssyng to gedyr in peas vnyte
And agayns enmiys alwey defendyd
The people that tyllyd the ground laboryd
The people pseyuyng than their goodness
Their great wit discretion gentylnes
were content to gyfe them {per}t of the {pro}ffet
Coming of their land{is} which they did get
As corn catell such thyn{is} as they wan
But after when that coin of money began
They chaugid those seuenuse were content
To gyfe them in money an anyell rent
So for their good vetteous codycyons
They cam first to lad{is} possessyons
So possessyons began were first found
Upon a good reasonable ground

By gogg{is} sweet body thou lie falsely
All possessions began trust of tyranny
For when people began first to encrese
Some gafe them self all to Idylnes
And wold not labour but take by violence
That other men gat by labour dylygence
Than they that labouryd were fain to gyfe
Them {per}t of their getting{is} in peas of life
Or ell{is} for their landis money a porcyon
So possessyons began by extorcyon
And when such extorsyoners had oppressyd
The laboring people than they ordeynyd
And made laws marvelous strayte hard
That their heir{is} might enjoy it afterward
So the law of inhetyaunce was first begone
which is a thing agayns all good reason
That any inherytaunce in the world should be

That is a shameful opynyon semyth me
For when I have labouryd by great study
Gat purcheysyd landys truly
It is good reason that I have lyberte
To gyfe those landis to whom it likes me
Or ell{is} to let them descend lynyyally
To my child or cosyn of my blod most ny
For inherytaunce must needs be a good thing
Because so much good thereof is {pro}cedyng
Every man to his blod such love doth bear
Because the land shall descend to his heir
Be will byld thereon the land improw
And make corn grass to encrese grow
Graft fruit set trecs norysh timber
And to incresse fyssh make pondys with water
Stok busshis wedes which dystroy herbage
And all baren ground bring to tyllage
And amend the hye ways that be there about
And do many other good dedis no dowt
For the {pro}fet of his heyrys that shall be
And for the comyn wealth of his country
which thing{is} surely he wold never intend
if the land should not to his heir descend

By thy reason no nothyr thing is meant
But a good dede upon an yuell intent
when men for love or pryd do such good dedis
The devil therefore shall quyt the their medys

whyder god or the devil quyt them therefore
Is now to our purpose never the more
For their mind{is} intent{is} no man can tell
But touching in herytaunce this I wot well
Much good comes thereof dayli doth grow

Nay much Ill comes thereof I shall prove how
For these men that be of great possessyons
Unto their blod have such affeccyons
If any land like them that lies ny them
Of their pore neghbors they will destroy them
Or by extort means they will them compel
The land for half the worth to them to sell
And when they lake money they will alwey
Ever borrow never willing to pay
And when they shall dye ye see the ex{per}ience
Few of them have remors of cosyens
To make any manner restytucyon
Of any land so wrongfully gotton

Thou hast spoke fore agayns gentylmen
But what seyst thou of marchaund{is} then

Many be good and worshipful also
And many charitable dedis they do
Byld churchys amend the hye ways
Make almys howsys help many decays
But some be couerous full falsely
Get their good is by dysseyt usury
And when they have a.M. li. in their confers
They will rathyr suffer their neyghbers
To starve for hunger cold to dye
Or they will gyfe to help them a penny
And yet more over when any of them be
Promotyd to rule or auctoryte
They dysdayn all lernyng law reason
And Jug all by will affection

Thou art but a rayler to speak so sore
Again gentylmen merchant{is} evermore
Be not ploughmen other that dryfe the cart
And such rustical felows as thou art
Falls shrews life as vycyously also
As gentylmen of land{is} merchant{is} do

yes this vylleyn carters almost echon
Have another coscyens nor devotion
For bribe steal every thing they will
If they may secretly come theruntyll
And as for prayer dyuyne service
They love them in no manner wise
Nor neuyr would labour nor work do
If need of lyffyng drofe them not thereto

yet gentylmen the rich merchant{is} that be
Use much more vice iniquyte

why thynkyst all merchant{is} gentylmen nought

Nay I sey not so that is not my thought
I am not yet so folysh nor so mad
For I know many good though some be bad
yet some will suffer his dett{is} vnpayd to be
And dye and Ieo{per}d his soul rather than he
wyil any of his land{is} mynysh and empayre
That should after his death come to his heir
And some of them so proud be of their blod
And use small vertew and do little good
But gyfe all their myndys and their study
To opprese the pore people by tyrrany
And some of them thynk this for a surete
It is the most honour to them that can be
To the able for to do extorcyon
And to mayntayn it without punycyon

Bi goggrs sweat body thou art a stark knave
Noble men and gentylmen so to deprave

what thou proud horeso foal who dost thou knave
I trow thou woldist a good blow or two have
with a good whypstoke to tech the courtesy

Avaunt beggarly knave I the defy

what will thou wage battle by by now
That shall I prove straight I make god avow

Keep the peace masters hold your hadys for shame
To make this besynes ye be gretely to blame
ye will dysturb all this hole company

Nay mary it is a cause to make them merry
To walk such a proud fool is but sport ga

By cokkys body were not for wordly shame
I should cut thy flesh or ell{is} see thy heart blode

Sir hold your tog your wordis be nothing good
we lose here with this lewyd alteration
Much good pastime and recreation

why what better pastime her can thou have
Then to here one to call an other knave
And see such a proud fool walked with a whyp

But I love it not therefore of felyshyp
Leave this brablyng and with good argument
Try the matter that is nost couenyent

Nay I will try it how so ever he will
Be it with words or ded{is} I will answer him styll
For be god if he will not be content
To be cocludyd by good argument
I will coclud him one way or that I goo
Or I shall {pro}ue it on his pate that shall I do

Thow spekyst lyk a clerk that hath lyttyll wit
when a case is put if he can not soil it
By no manner reason that he can ley
Then will he answer him this wise sey
Beware what ye sey sir now I advise you
for it is treason or herysy that ye spek now
To thentent to rebuke him opynly
Before the vnlernyd people that stand thereby
And if he can no colour of such thing find
Then will he vex and chafe in his mind
And cast owt some lewd word{is} of quarelyng
To torn the hole matter to chydyng fighting
And so dost thou now like one that were mad

Nay I wold thou knewist thou folysh lad
I am another mad nor drunken yet
For mine oppynyon I have well {pro}uyd it
By substancyall reason and argument
That enherytaunce is not convenient
And showed better reasons than thou can do

Nay thy reasons may soon be answered unto
For god defend that estates of enherytaunce
Should be destroyed for by that good ordynaunce
Gentylmen of lands vndoutydly
Bring up their children full honourably
Some put to the scole to learn conynge
To instruct the people in virtuous living
Some made to be actyfe in marcyall ded{is}
Able to defend the land when need is
And the rustycall people that have no land
Such thing{is} be not able to take in hand
wherefore if we should dystroy enherytaunce
we shulde destroy all good rule and ordynaunce

But such men as have great rent{is} and land{is}
And no estate but term of their lives
And every thing thereon will norysh and save
For the great zele love that they only have
To the comyn wealth of their country
And for god sake lo these people be they
That be worthy to have possessyons
And such people of vertuouse conditions
And no another should be chosyn governors
they should have lad{is} to maintain their honours
Term of their lives as long as they take pain
For the comyn wealth this is good reason plain
So that noman owght to have any land
But such as be apt and have charge in hand
For the comyn wealth as pryncys and rulers
Bysshopp{is} curat{is} prechers and techers
Jugs mynysters and other offycers
That of the comyn wealth be executers
And valiant men of the chyualry
That be bound to defend the people daily
Such men as be apt to all such thing{is}
Should have land{is} to maintain their lyffyng{is}
So enherytaunce is not besemynge
To let them have land{is} that ca do no such thing
Nor I thynk it not reasonable another
One man to lyf by labour of an another
For ych man is borne to labour truly
As a bird is to fl naturally
Nor a man ought not to have such lyberte
To lefe land{is} to his child where by that he
Shall lust for to life in sloth gloteny
Compellyd to do nought but life voluptuously

There is always good remedy for that
That is to compel them to do some what
So that ych man having enherytaunce
Have some auctoryce and governance
wherein he shulde take payne and besynes
To coustrayn him to eschew Idelnes

Then this great myschef should follow of hit
Oft times they should rule that have lyttyll wit
Or disposyd to be proud covetous
Or to life after their lustis voluptuous
which if such men had auctoryte
Many thing{is} no dowte mys orderyd should be
where Justice should be / there wold be tyranny
where peas should be war debat envy
So there is no good reason that I can se
To prove that any enherytaunce should be

yes that shall I prove by good auctoryte
For rede in the bible and thou shalt therein see
God said to abraham tibi dabo
Terram hanc et semine tuo
which is as much to say to expound yt true
I shall gyfe this land to the and thyn yssew
Here is a good prove that it was gods will.
That Abraha and his blode shulde continue still
As possessyoners and have the governance
Of that land as their propre enherytaunce

Thou answer me now even like a foal
As some of these fond clarks that go to scole
when one puts of them a subtle questyon
Of phylozophy to be provide by reason
when they have all their wits reason spend
And can not tell how their part to defend
Than they will aledge some auctoryte
Of the laws or else of deuynite
which in no wise men may deny
And yet ye know well that of phylozophy
The pryncyples oft contraryant be
Unto the very ground{is} of deuynite
For the phylozophers agree here unto
Quod mudus fuit semper ab eterno
And deuynys quod in la oim
Creauit deus terram et celum
But thou dydest promise openly even now
Only by natural reason to prove how
That enherytaunce ought for to be had

By gogges body sirs I hold you both mad
ye be like some woman that I know well
when they would any matter unto a man tell
They will tell.xx. talys by the way
Nothing to purpose to the matter that they
Did first intend to tell and declare
And in like manner now both ye do fare
For ye dyspute now whytheyr enherytaunce
Be a reasonable thing or a good ordynaunce
which is a matter no thing {per}teynyng
To the questyon moved at the begynnying
For the questyon was which of us all three
Could prove himself most gentleman to be

As touching that we have all spoke said
Ich man for his {per}t as much as can be said

Nay I have yet reasons last whereby I can
{pro}ue my self of us all most gentleman
That another of you both can void by reason

If thou have ought ell{is} to say now speak on

Then to you both answer me this short clause
Is not getyll codycyons the most pricypall cause
To make one to be a gentleman

Peradventure it may be so what than
{per}adventure quoth a
Nay I shall {pro}ue that by examples many on
For musyke makyth one a musycyon
Gramer to be good gramareon
And also geomytry a godd geometryeyon
And chorlysh conditions a chorle for to be
And so of every other estate degre
And where gentle conditions be doutles
In any {per}son there is gentyllnes
Than as vertew makyth a good man
So gentle conditions a gentleman

All those point{is} I thynk must needs grautyd be
what arguyst more therot forth let us see

How seyst than to pride wrath envy

They be nought evil I thynk verily

what is mekenes pacyens charity

Euerychone a gentle good {pro}{per}te

what is covetous lyberalyte

The first good the other nought for surete

what is gloteny sloth lechery

They be nought all who can that deny

what abstynens good besynes chastyte

Uerteous gentle {pro}pertees they be

Sith ye have grauytyd this I shall prove plain
I am a gentleman so is none of your ^ayn
First for pride your raymet shewyth what ye be
L. i.
For ye will never be content except that ye
Have the finest cloth sylke for to were
Of oryent colours all your ger
So costly / your housys gilt gloryously
As though ye wold therein your self deyfy
ye covet evermore good{is} land{is} rent
what so ever ye get yet never content
wrathful ye be moved to anger anon
And enuyous dysdaynyng every man
And as for me I am content alwey
with a pore cottage simple array
I dysdayn no man yet pacyently
Can suffer to be called knave and not angry
Sometime I call him knave again in hast
And when I have said my anger is past
ye have your beds so pleasant soft
wherein ye ease your self to long and to oft
which makyth your bodies so tender to be
that ye can not endure labour like me
with no manner course fode ye will be fed
But with pleasand wynys most whytest breed
with flesh fysh most dylycate fat
All frut{is} spices that can be gat
And when ye have had such pleasant refeccyons
To aswage your carnal insurreccyons
what so ever she be wife wedow or maid
If she come in the way she shall be assayd

Thou lie skladerours chorle for I thik of troth
Thou vsyst sych vyse more then we both

Nay by cokk{is} body I use no sych life
For I am content with blak maud my wife
Trow ye yt I care for these nise proud primys
These paityd popagays that hold up their chynn{is}
And loke so smoterly as who say they wold
Have every ma woo them that doth them behold
Tote man for all sych venereal werk
As good is the foul as the fair in the derk

Thou say true / drafe is good Enough for swyne

yet thou answer to no reason of mine

Thy reasons all right well answer I can
For I sey it be comes a noble man
To have rich ap{per}ell clothing
And goodly housys of costly byldyng
And that ych man according to his degre
Be knowyn from other and what they be
For if such costly thing{is} were not made
work for pore peple could never be hade
And many folk{is} than should fall to Idylnes
which is the moder of vice and wretchydnes

ye but I delyte no such vanytese worldly
I delyte another in sloth nor gloteny
I dig and delfe labour for my lyvyng
Never ydyll but somewhat ever doyng
Daily I ren and go bear sweet swynk
I ete broun breed and drink small drink
Content with course meat what so ever it be
so it quench the hunger it suffysyth me
These points I use which I have rehersyd now
Be not these gentle conditions I pray you

If thou use them need compellyth the thereto
For if thou coudist hardli thou wold other wise do

what I wold do then ye can not tell
It is not to purpose but this I wot well
Sith that I use my life in such good manner
whyth such gentle conditions expssyd here
More than ye both do styll contynuyng
And sith that gentle conditions is the thing
To make a gentleman the cause pryncypall
wherein I use my life most of us all
who can by any reason deny than
But that I am of us all most gentleman

In feith if thou be gentleman therefore
Thou art a gentleman agaynt thy will full sore

Sith I se he stadyth in his own cosait so well
That opynyon we shall never expel
From him by no argument nor reason
Therefore now for a little season
Let us de{per}t from him I hold it best
Then we shall have with him some rest

I agree thereto for caton saith this
Contra verbosas noli cotendere verbis
Contend nor argue never in no matter
with him that is full of words and clatter

wherefore for a season let us both de{per}t

I am agreid thereto with all mine hart

why sirs than will ye de{per}t be gon

ye that we will farewell for a season
For to tarry here longer we see no great cause
Then fare ye well as wise as two dawys
And I pray god send you such grace both twain
To be stark cockcold{is} or ye come again
Now masters they be both gone away
Therefore one word now hark what I sey
we see well now by plain ex{per}ience
when a man is set in a wyllfull credens
All to fortefye his own opynyon
If god him self than wold with him reason
In effect it shall no more avail
Than with a whyp to dryfe a snail
Therefore no remedy is that I can see
For yuell men that be in auctoryte
But let them alone till god will send
A time till our governors may intend
of all enormytes the reformacyon
And bring in their handis the rod of coreccyon
And the reforming of injuries them self see
And will say pcysely thus it shall be
For exortacyons techyng and pchyng
Jesting and raylyng they mend no thing
For the amendment of the world is not in me
Nor all the great arguments that we three
Have made sith we resonyd here to gedyr
Do not puayle the weight of a feather
For the helping of any thing that is amys
we can not help it then sith it so is
I will let the world wagg home will I goo
And dryf the plowgh as I was wont to do
And pray god send us peas I will no far mell
Therefore masters all now fare ye well

Now by my troth I am glad that is he gon

And so am I by sweet saint Iohn
I hard not a chorll this seuyn year
Show so cursed reasons as he hath done here
For the maintenance of his oppynyon
yet he his desseuyd for all his reason
For it is necessary that rulers be
To have posseyons to mayntayn their degre
And those few to dryfe the multitude all
of the other people to labour to fall
For if the rulers drof them not thereto
The peple wold be ydyll nothing do
And most reason is that governance
Should come to such rulers by inherytaunce
Rather than to have them chose by eleccyon
Oft tymys by dread mede and affection
Men of evil conscyens that great tyrants be
Rede old cronyclys the prove ye shall see
And though they have great wit and lernyng
Yet so proud they be thereof they fere nothing
Another god nor man but evermore styll
with out council or advise follow their own will
But they that by inherytaunce rulers be
Though they have no great lernyng yet we see
yet makyth them more ferefull better content
To follow wise men's council and aduysement
And sith that yt hath ben so long cotynned
Enherytours to have rule and so long usyd
And that they have ruled by as discretion
As the other that have be chose by eleccyon
If that order of rule by successyon of blode
Should be dystroyd it should do hurt no good

That reason is so great no man can debarr
Nevertheless that churllysh knave that carter
After his fond oppynyon thynkyth thus
Himself more gentleman than us

And therein he lies for by expiens we see
That gentle codycyons most comenly be
In them that be of noble blode borne
For take.xx. carters which never were beforne
Aquayntyd let them be to gyder
Take.xx. straynge gentylmen in like manner
These churlysh carters I dare well say
will not agree to gyder scant one day
with out chydyng quarrellyng or fighting
ychone will steal from other and be pykyng
And strife which of them at the scot shall pay lest
And indeuer them who can play the knave best
But these gentylmen I warrant you will study
who can show to other most courtesy
And of their gentylnes will pfer to pay
For the other and show what pleasurs they may
So touching gentylnes I say surely
Men of great birth use it most comynly

There can be no truer saying nor sentence
And the cause thereof we see by expience
For these pore wretches that have no thing
Must be nygardys churlyth and spayryng
But gentylmen be taught to be liberal
And so they may be for they have where with all

And as touching nobleness that argument
which the plowman made late puyth evident
That gentylmen borne to land must needs be
For suffyency of most nobylyte
For beside goddess gifts of grace of nature
As wit and bodily stryngh yet they be sure
Of other riches as of land and rent
To avoid need so they be more suffycyent
of them self than other pore people doutles
Then if need of strange help cause wrechydnes
And suffysauns be cause wrechydnes

A better reason no man can deuyse
And yet farther I thynk likewise
He that hath great haboundance of riches
May use lyberalyte and gentylnes
And also it is ever necessary
That some life in wealth and some in mysery
And let churllys babble and say what they will
Hit hath ben so ever and will be so styll
For it is almighty goddess purueaunce
wise men of folys to have the governance
And they that rule well I beseech Ihesu
Send them good life long to contynew

ye soferayns all discrete excellent
Before whom this dyalog showed hath be
Touching iii. points by wey of argument
First what is gentylnes what nobylyte
And who shulde be chose to hye auctoryte
This questyons they be so hye and sottell
Few dare psume to dyffyne them well
Yet I thynk now under your coreccyons
The thing that makyth a gentleman to be
is but vertew gentle conditions
which as well in pore men oft tymys we se
As in men of great birth of hye degre
And also vycious churlyssh codycyons
May be in men born to great possessyons
And forther as touching nobylyte
yet stands much {per}t I thynk doutles
An suffycyencye reason doth agree
But that suffysaunce making nobleness
Must needs he anexid unto goodness
For suffysauns is not the cause pryncypall
That god his noble but his goodness withal
So virtue is ever the thing pryncypall
That gentylnes nobleness doth ensue
Then these hedys rulers governors all
Should come thereto be cause of their virtue
And in auctoryte they ought not continue
Except they be good men discrete wise
And have a love zele unto Justice
wherefore souereyns all that here present be
Now mark well these reasons here brought in
Both agayns men of hye of low degre
For this intent only to rebuke syn
For the best wey that is for one to begin
To covert the people by exortacyon
is to {per}swade them by natural reason
For when that a man by his own reason
Iuggyth himself for to offend
That grudgyth his coscyens gyffyth copuncyon
Into his heart to cause him amend
But such blind best{is} that will not intend
To here no good council nor reason
Ought by thee law to have sharp coreccyon
But then if the laws be not suffycyent
which have be made ordeynyd before
To gyfe there fore codygne ponyshment
The pryncys governors be bound evermore
To cause new laws to be made therefore
And to put such men in auctocyte
That good men Just indyfferent be
But because that men of nature evermore
Be frail following sensualyte
yt is impossible in a manner therefore
For any gouernouss that be in auctoryte
At all tymys Just indyfferent to be
Except these be brydelyd thereto compellyd
By some strayt laws for them deuysyd
As thus that no man such rome ocupye
But certain yerys than to be removed
yet that while bound to attend diligently
And if he offend surely provide
with out any favour that he be ponyhysshyd
For the ponysshment of a Jug or offycer
Doth more good than of thousand other
And until that such orders be deuysyd
Substauncyally / and put in execucyon
Loke never to see the world amended
Nor of the great myschefes the reformation
But they that be bound to see the thing{is} done
I pray god of his grace put in their myndys
To reform shortly such things amys
And though that I my self now prase
Thus mine oppynyon have publysshed
Or any of my fellows hare in this place
In any point here have us abused
we beseech you to hold us excused
And so the auctour hereof requires you all
And thus I comyt you to god eternal.
