SEparting from ye darkened dens
which Ditis low doth keep,
Lo here I am sent out again
from Tartar dungeon ^pe,
Thy^stes I, that whether coast
to shun do stand in doubt,
Thinfernall fe^ndes I fly, the ^oalke
of earth I chase about.
My conscience lo abhors, that I
should heth^r passage make,
Appalled sore with fear and dread
my trembling sine w^ shake:
My fathers house, or rather yet
my brothers I espy,
This is the old and antique porch^
of Pelops progenye.
Here first the Greeks on p^nces hedds
do place the royal crown,
And here in throne aloft they lye,
that lets up and down,
With stately Sceptre in their hand,
eake here their courts do lye,
This is their place of banqueting,
return therefore will I.
Nay: better were it not to haunt
the loathsome Limbo lakes,
Where as the stygion porter doth
advance with lusty crakes
His triple gorge be hong with mane
shagg hearye, rusty, black:
Where Ixions carcass linked fa^,
the whyrlyng whele doth rack,
And rowleth styll upon him self:
whear as full oft in vain
Much toil is lost, (the tottryng stone
down tomblyng back again)
Whear growing guts the greedy gripe
do gnaw with ravening bitts.
Where parched up with burning thur^
amydd the waives he ^ytts,
And gapes to catch the fletyng flood
with hungry chapps beguylde,
That pays his painful punyshment,
whose fea^ the gods defylde:
Yet that old man so step^ in years
at length by tract of time,
How great a part belonges to me
and portion of his crime?
Account we all the grisly ghosts,
whom gyltie found of ill,
The Gnosian judge in plutoes pytts
^oth t^sse in torments styll:
Thyestes I in dryrye deeds
will far surmount the rest,
Yet to my brother yield I, (though
I gorged my blooddye breast,
And stuffed have my pawmpred panche
even with my children three,
That crammedly with in my rybbes,
and have their tomb in me,
The bowels of my swalowed babes,
devoured up I have,
Nor fyckle fortune me alone
the father doth deprave,
But enterprysyng greater gilt
then that is put in ur,
To fyle my daughters bawdye bed,
my lust she doth allure.
To speak these words I do not spare,
I wrought the heinous dede,
That therefore I through all my stock,
might parent styll procead.
My daughter driven by force of ^a^es
and destinies deuyne,
Doth breed young bones, lades her womb,
w^ sinful ^eede of mine.
Lo nature changed vpsyde down,
and out of order turned
This myngle mangle hath she made,
(O fact to be forlorn^.)
A father and a grandsyre lo,
confusedlye I am,
My daughters husband both become,
and father to the ^ame.
Those babes yt should my nephews be,
when nature ryghtlye runs,
She being jumbled doth confound,
and myngle with my sons.
The crystal clearness of the day,
and Phoebus beams so bright,
Are myxed with the foggye clouds,
and darkness dim of night.
When wyckednes had wearied us,
to late truce taken was,
Even when our detestable deeds
were done and brought to pass.
But valiant Agamem^on he
grand captain of the o^te
Who bare the sway among the kings,
and ruled all the roast,
Whose flaunting flag, banner bra^,
displayed in royal sort,
A thousand sail of sowsyng shypps
did guard to Phrygian port,
And with their swelling shatling s^iles:
the surging seas did hyde,
That heats on the banks of Tr^ye,
and flows ^y her side:
When Phoebus cart the Zodiac
ten times had over run,
And wa^te the battered walls do lye
of Troye destroyed and won,
Retournd he is to yield his throat
unto his traitoress wife,
That shall with force of bloody blade
beryue him of his life.
The glytering swerd, the hewing axe,
and wounding weapons mo,
With blood for blood new set a brooch
shall make the floor to flow.
With sturdy stroke, boysteous blow,
of pythye Pollar given
His beaten brains are pasht abroad,
his cracked skull is reuen.
Now myschiefe marches on a pace,
Now falshod doth appear,
Now butchers slaughter doth approach,
and murder draws near.
In honowr of thy natyue day
Aegisthus they prepare
The solemn feast with i^n^ketyng,
and dainty tothsom fare.
Fie, what doth shame abash thee so,
and cause thy courage quail?
Why doubts thy right hand what to do?
to smite why doth it fail?
What he forecastyng might suspect,
why should thou take advise?
Why fret^est thou, demanding if
thou may it enterpryse^
Nay: if amother it beseme,
thou rather may surmyse.
What now? how happens it that thus
the smiling summers night,
When Phoebus from Thantipodes
should render soon the light,
On sudden chaug their turns with nights
that last and lyng^r lunge,
When wynters bore as bitter blasts,
doth puff the trees among?
Or what doth cause the glydyng ^tarrs
to stay styll in the sky?
We wayght for Phoebus: to the world
bring day now by and by.

O Fortune, that dost fail
the great estate of kings,
on slyppery slydyng seat
thou placest lofty things
And syt^t on tottring sort,
where peryls do abound
yet never kingdom calm,
nor quiet could be found:
No day to scepters sure,
doth shyne, that they might say,
To morrow shall we rule,
as we have don to day.
One clod of crooked care
another brings in,
One hurly burly done,
another doth begin:
Not so the raging sea
doth boyle upon the sand,
Whear as the southern wynd
that blows in Affryck land,
One wave upon another
doth heap with sturdy blast:
Not so doth Euxine sea,
his swelling waives up cast:
Nor so his belchyng stream
from shallow bottom roll,
That borders hard upon
the ysye frozen poall:
Whear as Boots bright
doth twyne his wayne about,
And of the marble seas
doth nothing stand in doubt.
O how doth fortune toss
and tomble in her whele
The staggring states of kings,
that reddy be to rele?
Fay^e wold they dreded be,
and yet not settled so
When as they feared are,
they fear and live in woe.
The sylent Lady night
so sweet to man and beast,
Can not bestow on them
h^r safe and quiet rest:
Sleep that doth overcome
and break the bond^s of grief,
I cannot ease their har^es,
nor minister relief:
What castle strongly built,
what Bulwark, tower, or town,
Is not by mischyfes means,
brought topsye tur^ey down?
What ramperd walls are not
made weak by wicked war?
From stately courts of kings
doth justice fly afar:
In pryncelye pallacies,
of honesty the lore,
And wedlock now devout,
is set by little store.
The bloody Bellon th^se
doth ha^nt with gorye hand,
Whose light and vain conceit
in painted pomp doth stand.
And those Erinnys wood
turmoils with frensyes fits,
That ever more in proud
and haughty howses sitts,
Which fycle fortunes hand
in twynklyng of an eye,
From high and proud degre
dryues down in dust to lye.
Although that skyrmish ^eace,
no banners be displayed
And though no wiles be wrought
and pollecye be stayed,
Down paysed with their wayght
the massy things do synke,
And from her burden doth
unstable fortune shrynke.
The swelling Sails pu^t up
with gale of western wind,
Do yet mystrust thereof
a tempest in their mind:
The threatening tops (that touche
the clouds) of lofty towers
Be soonest paid and bett
with south wynd raynye showers:
The darksome wood doth see
his tough and sturdy Oak,
Well waynd in years to be
clean overthrown and broke:
The lyghtnyngs flashing flame
out breaking in the sky,
First lights on the mounts,
and hylls that are most hye.
The bodies corpule^t
and of the largest syese
Are ryfest styll to catch
deseases when they rise.
When as the flock to g^ase,
in pasture fat is putt,
Whose neck is larded best,
his throat shall first be cut:
What f^rtune doth advance,
and hoists up on hy^,
She setes it up to fall
again more greuouslye.
The things of middle sort,
and of a mean degree,
Endure above the rest
and longest days do see:
The man of mean estate
most happy is of all,
Who pleased with the lot
that doth to him befall,
Doth sail on sylent shore.
with calm and quiet tide,
And dreads with bruised barge
on swelling seas to ride:
Nor lawncyng to the deep
where bottom none is found,
may with his rudder search,
and reach the shallow ground.
O Drowsy dreaming dotyng soul,
what comes in thy brain,
To seek about for thy defence
what way thou may attain?
What aiels thy skittish waiward wits,
to waver up and down?
The fittest shyft prevented is,
the best path overgrown:
Thou myghtest ons maintained have
thy wedl^ck chamber chaste,
And eak have ruled with majesty,
by faith conjoined fast:
Now nurtures lore neglected is,
all right doth clean decay,
Relygion and dygnitie
with faith are worn away:
And ruddy sha^e with blushing cheeks
so far god ^ot is past,
That when it would it cannot now
com home again at last.
O let me now at random run
with bridle at my will:
The safest path to myschyfe is
by myschef open styll.
Now put in practyss^, seek about,
search out and learn to find
The wily traynes, and crafty guyles
of wicked woman kind:
What any dyuelysh tray^erous dame
durst do in working woe,
Or any wounded in her wits
by shot of Cupids bow:
What ever rygorous stepdame could
committ with desperate hand,
Or as the wench who flaming fast
by Venus poysonyng brand,
Was dreuen by lewd vncesteous love
in shypp of thessail land,
To flytt away from Cholchos I'll,
where Ph^sis channel deep
With silver stream down from y^ hills
of Armenie doth swepe.
Get weapons good, get bylbow blades,
or temper poison strong,
Or with some yonker trudge fro Greece
by theft the seas along:
Why dost thou faint to talk of theft,
exile, or privy flight?
These came by hap: thou therefore must
on greater myschife light.
(O worthy queen) among ye Greeks
that bears the swinging ^waye
And borne of Ledas royal blood,
what mut^r^ng dost thou say^?
What fury fell enforces the,
bereaved of thy wits,
To rage rave with bedlam brains,
to fret with frantic fits?
Though madam thou do counsel keep,
and not complain thy case,
Thine anguish plain appears in
thy pale and wanny face:
Reueal therefore what is thy grefe,
take leisure good and staye,
What reason could not remedy,
oft eured hath delay.

So grievous is my careful case
which plun^eth me so sore^
That deal I cannot with delay,
nor linger ^nye more.
The flashing flames, and furious force
of fyrye fervent heat,
Outragyng in my boylyng breast,
my burning bones doth beat:
It sucks the sappye marowe out,
the joyce it doth convey,
It frets, it tears, it rents, it gnawes,
my guts and gall away.
Now feeble fear still eggs me on
(with dolor being pressed)
And cankered hate with thwacking thumps
doth bounce upon my breast:
The blinded boy that lovers hearts
doth reave with deadly stroke,
Entangled hath my linked mind
with lewd and wanton yoke:
Refusing styll to take afoyle,
or clean to be confound,
Among these broils, and agonies
my mind besegyng round,
Lo feeble, wery^ battered down,
and under trodden shame,
That wrests, strives, strugleth hard,
and fyghteth with the same.
Thus am I driven to divers shores,
and beat from bank to bank^,
And tossed in the fomye floods,
that strive with courage crancke.
As when here wynd, there ye stream
when both their force will try,
From sands allow, doth hoist rear
the seas with surges hye,
The waltryng wave doth staggrynge stand,
not wetyng what to do,
But (houeryng) doubts, whose furious force
he best may yield him to.
My kingdom therefore I cast of,
my sceptre I ^orsake
As anger, sorrow, hope, me lead,
that way I mean to take.
At all adventure to the seas
I yield my beten Barge,
At random careless will I ron,
now will I rove at large.
Whear as my mind to fancy fond
doth gad, and ron astray,
It is the best to choose that chance,
and follow on that way.

This desperate dotage doth declare,
and rashness rude and blind,
To choose out chance to be the guide
and ruler of thy mind.

He that is driven to utter pynche,
and furthest shyft of all,
What neade he doubt his doubtful lot,
or how his luck be fall?
In sylent shore thou saylest yet,
thy trespass we may hyde,
If thou thy self detect it not,
nor cause it be dyscryde.

Alas it is more blasd abroad,
and further is it blown,
Then any crime that ever in
this pryncelye court was sown.

Thy former fault with pensive heart
and sorrow thou dost few,
And fondly yet thou go about,
to set abroche anew,

It is auery folyshnes
to keep a mean therein,

The thing he fears he doth augmet,
who heaps syn to syn.

But fire sword to cure the same,
the place of salve supply.

There is no man who at the first
extremytie will try.

In working myschyfe men do take
the redyest way they find.

The sacred name of wedlock once
revoke and have in mind,

Ten years have I bin desolate,
and led a wydowes life.
Yet shalt I enter^ay^e anew
my husband as his wife?

Consydor yet thy son and ha^e
whom he of the begot^

And eke my daughters wedding blase
as yet forget I not.
Achilles eke my son in law
to mind I do not spare,
Howe well he kept his vow that he
to me his mother swear.

When as our nauye might not pass
by wynd, nor yet by stream,
Thy daughters blood in sacryfyce
their passage did redeem:
She stirred and brake the sluggysh seas,
whose water styll did stand,
Whose feeble force might not hoise up,
the vessels from the land.

I am ashamed herewith all,
it makes me repyne,
That Tyndaris (who from the gods
doth fetch her noble lygne)
Should give the ghost tasswage ye wrath
of gods and them appease,
Whereby the grekyshe nauye might
have passage free by seas.
My grudging mind styll harps upon
my daughters wedding day,
Whom he hath made for Pelops stock
the blooddye rawnsam paye.
When as with cruel countenance
embrewd with gorye blood,
As at a wedding alter side
thunpy^yfull parent stood,
It erk^d Calchas woeful heart,
who did abhor the same,
His Oracle he rewd, and eake
the back reflyctyng flame.
O wicked and vngracyous stock
that winnest ill with ill,
Tryumphyng in thy fylthy feats,
encreasyng lewdness styll.
By blood we win ye wavering winds,
By death we purchase war.

But by this means a thousand ships
at once released are:

With lucky fate attempt the seas
did not the losed rowt?
For Aulis I'll, thungracious flete,
from port did tumble out:
As with alewd unlucky hand
the war he did begin,
So fortune favoured his su^ces
to thryue nomore therein.
Her love as capty^e holds him
whom captyue he did take.
Not moved with the ernest suit
that could Achilles make,
Of Phoebus prelat Sminthicall
he did retain the spoil:
When for the sacred virgins love
his furious breast doth boyle:
Achilles rough and thundering threats
could not him ^ualyfye,
Nor he that doth dir^t the fa^es
above the starry sky.
To us he is an Augur just,
and kepes his promys dewe^
But while he threats his captive truls
of word he is not tr^w.
The savage people fearce in wrath
once might not move his spright,
Who did purloyne the kindled tents
with fire blasyng bright:
When slaughter great on Greeks was made
in most extremest fight
Without a foe he conquered.
with leanes pines away
In lewd and wanton chamber tricks
he spends the idle day,
And freshly (...) he ^e^des his lust,
least that some other while
His chamber chaste should wat a stews,
that might the ^ame defile.
On Lady Brises love again
his faneye fond doth stand,
Whom he hath got, tha^ wrested was
out of Achilles hand.
And carnal copulation
to have he doth not shame,,
Though from her husbands bosom he
hath snatched the wicked dame,
Tush, he that doth at Paris grudge,
With wound but newly stroke
Eflamd with Phrygian Prophets love,
his boiling breast doth smoke.
Now after Troyan boties brave,
and Troy ouerwhelmd he saw,
Retournd he is a prisoners spouse,
and Priams son in law.
Now hart be bold, take courage good,
of stomach now bestowt,
A field that easily is not fought,
to pytche thou go about.
In practys myschife thou must put,
why hopste thou for a day,
While Priams daughter com from Troy
in Greece do bear the swaye?
But as for the poor selye wretch,
a wayteth at thy place
Thy wyddow, virgyns, and Orest
his fatherlyke in face,
Consider their calamytyes,
to com, and eake their cares,
Whom all the peril of the broil
doth threat in thy affairs.
O cursed captyue, woeful wretch,
why doest thou loiter so?
Thy little brats a stepdame have,
whose wrath will work their wo.
With gasshing swerd (and if thou can
none other way provide)
Nor thrust it through an ^thers ribs,
then launch thy gory side.
So murder twain with brew^d blood,
let blood immixed be,
And by destroyeng of thy self
destroy thy spouse with thee.
Death is not saw with sops of sorrow
if some man else I have,
Whose breathl^sse corse I wish to pass
with me to deadly grave.

Queen, bridle thine affections,
and wyselye rule ^y rage,
Thy swelling mood now myt^igate,
thy chollure eke assuage.
Way well the wayghtye enterprise
that thou doest take in hand,
Triumphant victor be retournes
of mighty Asia land
Auengyng Europs injury,
with him he bryngs away
The spoils of sacked Pargamie,
a huge and mighty pray.
In bondage eake he leads the foalke
of long assaulted Troy^,
Yet dare thou by pollecye
attempt him to annoy?
Whom with the dynt of glittryng swerd
Achilles durst not harm,
Although his rash and desperate dick^
The froward knight did arme^
Nor Aiax yet more hardy man
up yielding vital breath,
Whom frantycke jury fell enforste
to wound him self to death:
Nor Hector, he, whose only life
procuerd the Greeks delay,
And long in war for victory
enforced them to staye
Nor Paris shaft, whose conning hand
with shot so sure did aim:
Nor mighty Memnon swart and black,
had power to hurt the same:
Nor Xan^hus flood, where to and fro
dead ca^kasis did swyme,
With armour hewd and there with all
some maimed broken lyme:
Nor Simois, that purple wawmes
with slaughter died doth steer.
Nor Cygnus Lylly whyght, the sonn^
of fenny god so dear:
Nor yet the mu^teryng Thracian host:
nor warlyke Re^sus king:
Nor Amazons, who to the wars
did painted Quivers bring,
And bare their har^hets in their hands,
with target, and with sheylde,
Yet had no power with ghastly wound
to foil him in the feylde.
Sith he such scourynges hath escapte,
and plunge of peryls paste,
Entendest thou to murder him,
returning home at last?
And sacred alters to profane
with slaughter so v^ure?
Shall Greece thaduenger, let this wroug
lunge unrevenged endure?
The g^ym and fearce coragious horse,
the battles shou^es and cries,
The swelling seas which brus^d barks
do dread, when storms arise,
Behold the fields with streams of blood
overflown and deeply dro^d,
And all the Cheualrie of Troy
in servile bondage bound,
Which Greeks have writ in registers.
thy stubburne stomach bind,
Subdue thy ^onde affections,
and pacyfie thy mynd^.

THe cursed time that evermore
my mind did most detest,
The dais that I abhorred have
and hated in my breast,
Are come, are come, that mine estate
will bring to utter wrack:
Alas my heart, why doest thou fail,
and fainting fly back?
What doest thou mean at first assalt^
from armour thus to fly?
Trust this, the cruel gods intend^
thy dolfull destiny,
To wrap thee in with peryls round,
and catch thee in a band:
Endeuer drudge with all thy power
their plagues for to wythstand:
With stomach stout rebellious,
to fire and swerd appeal.
It is no plague, if such a death
thy natyue destnies deal.

(O partners of my peryls all,
begot of Leda thou)
Direct thy doings a^ter mine,
and unto thee I vow,
This drosell, fluggysh ryngleader,
this stout strong har^ed ^yre,
Shall pay the so much blo^d again
as shed he hath in fire.
How haps it that his trebling cheeks
to be so pale and whyght,
Lyenge aghast, as in a trance,
with fainting face upright?

His cosciece wedlo^k vow doth prick
and brynges him home again.
Let us return the self same ^rade
a new for to retain,
To which at first we should have stuck
and ought not to forsake,
To covenant continent a new
let us our selves betake:
To take the trade of honesty
at no time is to late:
He purged is from punyshment
whose heart the crime doth hate.

Why whether wilt thou gad (o rash
and vnaduysed dame?)
What doest thou earnestly believe,
and fyrmly trust the same,
That Agamemnons spousal bed
will loyal be to thee,
That nought doth underprop thy mind
which might thy terror be?
His proud success pufte up to high
wi^h lucky blast of wind,
Might make so crank, and set aloft
his hawty swelling mind:
Among his pears he stately was,
er Trojan turrets torn,
How ^hynk ye then his stomach stout
by nature given to scorn,
In haughtynes agmented is
more in him self to joy,
Through this triumphant victory
and conquest got of Troye?
Before his voyage miceane king
most myl^ly did he reygne,
But now a Tyrant truculent
returned he is again.
Good luck and proud prosperytie
do make his heart so rise.
With what great preparation
prepared solemn wise,
A rabblement of strumpets come
that clonge about him all?
But yet the prophetess of Phaebe,
(whom god of truth we call)
Appears above the rest: she kepes
the king, she doth him guide:
Wyl^ thou in wedlock have a mate
and not for it provide?
So would not she, the great^st grief
this is unto a wit,
Her husbands minion in her house
to lead an open life.
A queenes estate can not abide
her pear with her to reygne,
And Jealous wedlock will not her
companion sustain.

Aeg^st in desprat mode again
why se^st thou me a flote?
Why kyndlest thou the sparks of ire
in imbers covered hot?
If that the vyctors own free will
releas his captyues care,
Why may not I his lady spouse
have hope as well to fare?
One law doth rule in royal throne,
and pompous pryncely towers,
Among the vulgar sort, another
in pryuate simple bowers.
what though my grudging fancy force
that at my husbands hand,
Sharpe execution of the law
I s^ubbernly withstand?
^ecordyng this that haynous^ye
offended him I have:
^gently will me pardon grant
who need the same to crave?

Even so? on this condition
thou may with him compound,
To pardon him, if he again
to pardon thee be bound.
The subtle science of the law,
The statutes of our land,
(That lunge ago decreed were)
thou doest not understand.
The Judges be malicious men,
they spy^hte and envy us,
But he shall have them partial
his causes to dyscns.
This is the chiefest pryuiledge
that doth to kings belong,
What laws forbyddeth other men
they do, and do no wrong.

He pardned Helen, she is wed
to Menela again,
Which Europ all, with Asia
did plonge alike in payne.

No Ladies lust hath rauyshte yet
Atrides in his life,
Nor pryuelie purloynd his heart,
betr^thed to his wife.
To pick a quarrel he begyns,
and matter thee to blame,
Suppose thou nothing hast comyt^
that worthy is of shame?
What ^oteth him whom princes hate
an honest life to frame?
He never doth complain his wrong,
but ever bears the blame.
Will thou repair to Spart, and to
thy country trudge aright?
Will thou become a ronagate,
from such a worthy wight?
Deuorcement made from kings, will not
so let the matter escape,
Thou easest fear, by fyckle hope,
that falsely thou doest shape:

My trespass is dysclosd to none,
but to a trusty wight.

At princes gates fydelytye
yet never enter might.

I will corrupt and fe^de him s^
with silver and with gould,
That I by brybyng bind him shall
no secrets to vnfould:

The trust that hired is and bought
by bribes and moneys fee,
Thy counsel to bewray a gain
with bribes entyste will be,

The remnant left of shamfa^nes
of those vngracyous ^ryckes,
Wherein of late I did delight,
my concience freshly prycks.
Why kepest thou such a busy stur,
and with thy flattryng speech
Enst ructyng me with lewd advise
dost wicked counsel preach?
Shall I forsooth of royal blood
with all the speed I can,
Refuse the king of kings, and wed
an outcast banysht man?

Why should you think in that Thyest
was father unto me,
And Agamemnon Atreus son
he should my better be?

If that be but a tryfle small
Ad Nephew to the same,

I am of Phoebus linage borne,
whereof I do not shame.
Why makste thou Phoebus author of
thy wicked pedagrew,
Whom out of heaven ye forste to fly
when bridle back he drew?
When lady night with mantle black
did spread her sudden shade,
Why make thou the gods till such
reproach fulness to wade?
Whose father hath thee conning made
by fleyght and subtle guile
To make thy kinsman Cockold, while
his wife thou do defile.
What man is he whom we do know
to be thy fathers mate,
Abusing lust of lecherye
in such unlawful rate?
Avaunt, go pack the hence in ha^e,
dispatch, out of my sight
This infamy, whose blemish staines
this blood of worthy wight.

This is no new exile to me
that wyckednes do haunt,
But if that thou (o worthy queen)
cammaund me to a^aunt
I will not only straight avoid
the house, the town, and field,
My life on swerd at thy request
I ready am to yield.

This heinous dede permit shall I
(most churlesh cruel drab)
Against my will though I offend,
the fault I should not blab:
Nay, rather come apart with me,
and let us join our wyts,
To wrap our selves out of this wo,
and parlous threatening fyts.

NOw chant it lusty lads.
Apollos praise suborn,
To thee the frolyke flock
their crowned heads adorn.
To thee king Inachs stock
of wedlock chamber void,
Braid out their virgyns locks
and thereon have employed,
Their savoury garlands green
It wy^t of Laurel bow.
Draw ne'er with us o Thebes,
our daunsyng follow thou.
Come also ye, that dryncke
of Ismen bublyng flood,
Whereas the Laurel tree
full thycke on banks doth bood.
Eke ye whom Man do mild,
the Prophetess diuyne,
(Foreseenge fate) and borne
of high Tiresias lygne,
Hath styrd to celebrate
with sacred use and right
Appollo and Dian
borne of Latona bright.
O victor Phaebe vnbend
thy nocked ^owe again,
Sith quyetnes and peace
anew we do retain.
And let thy twackling harp
make melody so sh^yll,
While that thy nymble hand
stryke quauers with thy quill.
No curious descant I
nor lus^ie music cr^ue,
No jolly rumbling note,
nor trowlyng tune to have.
But on thy treble Lute
(according to thy use)
St^yke up a plain song note,
as when thy learned Muse
Thy lessons do record,
though yet on baser string
It likes thee to play
the songe that thou did singe:
As when from fyry heaven
the dynt of lyghtnyng flew,
Sent down by wrath of gods,
the Titans overthrew.
Or else when moutains were
on mountains heaped hye
That raise for G^auntes fell
their steppes into the sky,
The mountain Ossa stood
on top of Pelion laid,
Olymp (whereon the Pines
their buddyng branches brayd)
Down paised both: draw ne'er
o Iun^ noble dame,
Both spouse of mighty Jove
and sister to the same:
Thou that doest r^le with him
made jointer of his mace,
Thy people we of Greece
give ^onour to thy grace:
Thou only dost protect
from peryls Argos land,
That ever careful was
to have thine honour stand,
(Most supplient there unto)
thou also with thy might
Dost order joyful peace
and battles fearce of fight,
Accept o conquering queen
these branches of the bays,
That Agamemnon here
doth yield unto thy praise:
The hollow boxen pipe
(that doth with holes abound)
In syngyng unto thee
doth give a solemn sound:
To thee the damsels ek^
that play upon the strings,
With conning harmony
m^lodious music synges.
The ma^rons eke of Gr^c^
by ryper years more grave,
To thee the ^aper paye,
that vowed oft they have,
The beyferd yonge whit^
companion of the Full
Unskilful, yet by proof
the painful pl^in to pull,
whose neck was never worn^
nor gald with prynt of yoke,
Is in thy temple slain
receiving deadly stroke.
O laid Pallas thou
of mo^t renoumned hap
Bred of the brain of Jove
that smytes with thonder clap.
Thou lofty Trojan ^owres
of craggy knotty flint
Hast bet with battryng blade,
and struck with iauelyng dyn^
The elder matrons with
the dames that younger be
Together in mingled heaps
do hono^r due to thee.
when tho^ approaching nigh
thy coming is espyde,
The preiste vnbarrs the gate
and opes the Temple wide:
By clustering thronges the flocks
thine altars haunt apace,
Bedecte with twysted crowns
so trym with comely grace.
The old and auncyent men
well stepped and grown in years,
Whose feeble trembling age
precureth horye hear^s,
Obteyning their request
craved of thy grace deuyne,
Do offer up to thee
their sacryficed wine,
O bright Dian whose blase
sheds light three sundry ways,
We myn^full are of thee,
and render thankful praise,
Delon thy natyue soil
thou did fyrmly bind,
That to and fro was wont
to wander with the wind:
Which with foundation sure
mayn ground for byd^ to pass:
For Navies (after which
to swim it wonted was)
It is become a Road
defyenge force of wind,
The mothers funerals
of Tantalus his kind.
The daughters seven by death
thou victresse doest account,
Whose mother Niobe
abides on Sipill mount
A lamentable rock,
and yet unto this howre
Her tears new gusshyng, out
the marble old doth power.
The godhead of the twins
in sumpteous solemn wise,
Both man and wife adore
with savoury sacryfyse.
But thee above the rest,
o father great and guide,
Whose mighty force is b^
the burning lightning tryde^
Who when thou gave a beek
and did thy head but shake,
At once the^tremest poales
of heaven and earth did quake.
O Iupiter the rote
that of our lynage art,
Accept these offered gifts
and take them in good part:
And thou o grandsire great
^o thy posterity
Have some remors, that do
not swarne in chyual^ye.
But yonder ^o with stiuing steps
the soldi^r comes a mayne
In all post hast, with token that
good news declares plain
A laurel branch, that hangs on
his spear head he doth bring:
Eurybates is come, who hath
ben trusty to the king.
SOre tyred after many years
with travail with toil
Scant credityng my self, the Gods
of this my natyue soil,
The temple, and the alters of
the saints that rule the sky,
In humble sort with reverence
devoutly worship I.
Now pay your vows unto the Gods:
returned is again
Unto his countr^y court, where wont
he was to rule, and reygne,
Prince Agamemnon, victor he,
of Greece the great r^n^um^.
The tidings of a message good
unto mine ears is blown.
Where stays my spouse who longing for
ten years I have out scand?
What doth he yet sail on the seas,
or is he come a land?
Yet hath he fyxt and set his foot
back stepping home again
Upon the sandy shore, that lunge
he wished to artayne?
And doth he still enjoy his health
enhaunc^e in glory great,
And painted out in pomp of prays
whose fame the sky doth beat?

Bless we with burning sacryfyce,
at length this lucky day.

And eke the gods though gracious
Yet dealing long delay:
Declare if that my brothers wife
enjoy the vital air,
And tel me, to what kind of Coast
my sister doth repair.

God grant give us better news
then this that thou doest crave:
The heavy hap of fighting floods
^orbyddes the truth to have.
Our scat^red fleet the swelling seas
attempts in such a plyght,
That ship from ship was taken clean
out of each others sight.
Atrides in the waters wide
turmoyld and strayeng far,
More violence by seas sustained
then by the bloody war.
And as it were a conquered man
escaping home all weet
Now brings in his company
of such a mighty fleet,
A sort of bruised broken barks,
beshaken, torn, and rent.

Show what unlucky chance it is
that hath our Nauye spent,
What storm of seas dispersed hath
our Captains hear and theare?

Thou willest me to make report
of heavy woeful gear.
Thou bid me most grievous news
with tidings good to part:
For vttryng of this woeful hap
my feeble mind doth start.
And horrybly appalled is
with this so monstrous ill.

Speak out, and utter it: him self
with terror he doth fill,
Whose heart his own calamytie
and cark, doth loathe to know:
The heart whom doubted damage dulls
with greater grief doth glow.

When Trojan buildings blazing bright
did burn away, and broil,
Kindled first by Grekish brand,
they fall to part the spoil:
Repairing fast unto the seas
again we come a board,
And now the soldiers weary loins
were eased of his sword,
Their bucklers cast aside upon
the hatches lie above:
Their warlike hands in practise put,
and Oers learn to move:
Each little hyndraunce seems to much
to them in hasty plyght,
When of recourse the Admiral,
gave watchword by his light,
And trumpet blast began to call
our army from delay,
The painted Pup with gilded snout
did first guide on the way:
And cut the course, which fol^ing on
a thousand ships did ryue,
Then first a wind with p^pling puffs
our launcing ships did drive:
Which glided down upon our sails:
the water being calm
With breath of western wind so mild
scant moved any walme.
The shynyng seas bespred about
with ships, doth glitter bright,
And also covered with the same,
lay hyd fro Phoebus light:
It doth us good, to case upon
the nak^d shore of Troy:
The desert Phrygian plots so bar^
to view, we hopp for joy:
The youth echone besturrs the selves,
and strykyng altogether
They tough their ores, with their toyl^
they help the wind and weather.
They tug, and cheerly row by course,
the spyrtyng seas up dash,
Against the ratlyng rybs of ships
The flapping floods do flash^
The hory froth of wrestling waives
which ores alo^t doth raise,
Do draw and trace a furrow through
the marble faced seas.
When stroger blast with belly swollen
our hoisted sails did fill,
They row no more, but let the Pup
to go with wind at will,
Their sheryng Ore^ laid aside
our Pilot doth espy,
How far from any land aloof
our sails reculyng fly.
Or bloody batells doth display,
the threats of Hector stout,
Or of his ratlyng Waggins tells,
wherein he rode about:
Or how his gasshed carckas slain
and trained about the fylde,
To funeral flames, and obit ryghtes
for coin again was yield.
How Iupiter embathed was
all in his royal blood.
The frolyck fyshe desposed was
to mirth in Tyrren flood,
And fetching fryskes both in and out
plays on the waters brym,
And on his broad and fynny back^
about the seas doth swym,
With gamballs quick in rings aroud,
and side to side enclynd,
Erwhyle he sports afront the pup,
and whyps again behind,
Now fydlyng on the snout before,
the dalyeng wanton rowt
With iocundarye jolly tryckes
doth skyp the flete about.
Sometime he stands gasyng on
and eyes the vessels bright,
Now every shore is covered clean,
and land is out of sight,
The parlous poynct of Ida rock
in sight doth open lye,
And that alone espy we could
with fyrm^ly fixed eye,
A dusky cloud of sti^lyng smoke
from Troy did smolter black,
When Titan from the weary necks
the heavy yokes did slack.
The fading light did grovelling bend,
and down the day did shroud,
Against the stars amounting up
a little mystie cloud,
Came belchyng out in irksome lompe,
and Phoebus galland beams
He spewd upon, bestayning them
duet down in western streams.
The Sun set swaruyng in such sort
with diverse change of face
Did give us cause, to have mistrust
of Neptunes doubted grace.
The evening first did bun^nish bright,
and paint with stars the sky,
The wynds were laid, clean forsook
our sails, that quiet lye.
when cracking, rattling, rumbling noise,
rushed down wi^h thundering swaye
From top of hyls, which greater stur
doth threaten and bewray.
With belowinges, yellynges loud,
the shores do grunt an^ groan,
The craggy clyues, roryng rocks,
do howl in hollow stone.
The bublyng wa^ers swells vpreard
before the wrestling wind,
When suddenly the lowryng light
of moon is hid and blind.
The glymsyng stars do go to glade,
the surgyng seas are tossed
Even to the skies, among the clowde^
the light of heaven is lost^
More nyghtes in one compacted are,
with shadow dim and black,
One shade upon another doth
more darkness heape^ and pack,
And every spark of light consumd
the waives and skies do mete.
The ruflyng wynds range on the seas^
through every coast they ^lytt.
They heave it up with violence.
ouerturnd from bottom low,
The western wind flat in the face
of eastern wynd doth blow.
With hurly burley Boreas
set open his blastyng mouth,
And gyroeth out his boysteous breath,
against the stormy south,
Each wind with all his might doth blow,
and works dangers deep,
They shake the floods, a sturdy blast
along the seas doth swepe.
That rowles, ^ubles wave on wave,
a northern tempest strong
Abundance great of flackye snow^
doth hurl our ships among.
The south wind out of Lybia
doth rage upon a should,
And with the puissant force thereof
the quycke sands up be rolled,
Nor bids in the south, which doth
with tempest lump and lower,
And force the flowing floods to rise
by powryng out a shower.
The stubbern E^r^s erthquakes made,
and shoke the countries eas^,
And E^s cost, where Phoebus first
arises from his test.
How violent Corus stretched and tare
his yawnyng mouth ^ull wide?
A man wold sure have thought y^ world
did from his center flyde,
And that the frames of heaven broke ^p
the gods adown wold fall,
And Chaos dark confused heap
wold shade and cover all.
The stream strove with the wind, y^ wynd
did beat it back again,
The springing sea within his banks
can not it self contain,
The raging shower his tryllyng drops
doth myngle with the seas,
And yet in all this misery
they find not so much eas,
To see and know what ill^ it is,
that works their decay.
The darkness dim oppresses styll
and kepes the light away:
The black facst night with hellicke hew
was clad of stygian lake
And yet full oft with glimsyng beams
the sparklyng fire out brake.
The cloud doth crack, and being rent
the lyghtnyng leaps out,
The wretches like the same so well
it shining them about,
That still they wysh such light to hau^.
(although god wo^ but ill)
The navy swaying down it self
doth cast away, and spyll.
One side with other side is cracked,
and helm is rent with helm,
The shypp it self the gulpyng seas
do headlong over whelm.
Erwhyle a grydie gaping gulf
doth sup it up amain,
Then by an by tossed up aloft
it spewes it out again,
She with her swaggyng full of sea
to bottom low doth sink,
And drenches deep aside in floods
her tottryng broken brynke.
That underneath a dozen waives
lay drowned out of sight,
Her broken planks swym 'vp down,
spoiled is her tackle quyght,
Both sail and Ores clean are lest,
the mayn mast cake is gon.
That wonted was to bea^e upright
the sail yard thereupon,
The timber and the broken bordes
lye on the waters brym,
When cold shivering fear in us
doth stryke through every lym^
The wisest wy^ts entocksycate
dare nothing enterprise,
And conning practise nought auayle^,
When fearful storms arise,
The mareners letting duty slyppe
stand staring al aghast,
Their scoopyng ores suddenly
out of their hands are wrast.
To prayer then apace we fall,
when others hope is none,
The Greeks Troyans to the Gods
alike do make their moan.
Alack what succour of the fates
may we poor wretches find?
Against his father Pyrrhus bears
a spytefull cankered ^ynde,
At Aiax grudge Vlysses doth,
king Menela doth hate
Great Hector: Agamemnon is
with Priam at debate.
O happy man is he, that doth
lye slain in Troyan ground,
And hath deserved by handy stroke,
to take his fatal wound,
Whom fame preserves, taking up
his tomb in conquered land.
Those momes whose melting cowards hart
durst never take in hand,
Or enterprise no noble act,
those force of floods shall drown,
But fate forbearing long, will take
stout brutes of high rename,
Full well we may ashamed be,
in such a sort to dye,
If any man his spytefull mind
yet can not satysfie,
with these ou^ragious pluging plages
That down from gods are sent,
Appeace at length thy wrathful god
again, and eke relent.
Even Troy for pity wold have wept,
to see our woeful case,
But if that in thy boylyng breast
black rancour styll have place,
And that the Greeks to ruin run,
it be thy purpose bent,
Why do these Troyans go to wrack?
for whom thus are we spent?
Assuage the rigour of the sea
that threa^nyng hyls up reares:
This drenched fleet the Troyan folk
and Greeks together bears.
Then from their prayers are they put,
their foultryng tongues do stay,
the roaring seas doth drown their voice
and cares their cries away.
Then mighty Pallas armed with
the leppyng lightning fire,
That testy Jove doth use to hurl
prouokte to swelling ire,
With thretning Iaueling in her hand,
her prowe^ means to try,
And eke her force whoes boiling breast
with Gorgon^ fyts doth fry,
Or what with target she can do,
and with her fathers fire.
Then from the skies another storm
begynnes abroad to spyre,
But Aiax nothing yet dysmayd
all force withstands stout,
who when he spread his swelling sails
with cable stretched out,
She lyghtyng down did wryng him hard,
wrapped him in her ^ame,
And flange another flasshyng dint
of lyghtnyng on the same,
With all her force and violence
her h^nd brought back again,
She tossed him out, as late that feat
her ^ather tought her plain.
Both over Aiax and his Pup
she slyeth overthwart,
And renting man and ship, of both
she bears away a part,
His courage nought abated yet
he al to syngde doth ^eme,
Even like a stubberne ragged rock
amid the striving stream,
He traynes along the roaring seas
and eke the waltryng wave
By shouyng on his bourly breast
in sonder quyte he drove,
The Bark with hand he caught, on
it self did type it over,
Yet Aiax shines in the flood
which darkness blind doth cover.
At length attaining to a rock
his thundering crakes were these,
I conquered have the force of fire
and rage of fighting seas,
It doth me good, to master thus
the anger of the sky,
with Pallas wrath, the lightning flames
and floods tumultyng hye.
The terror of the warlyck god
once could not make me fly,
The force of Mars and Hector both
at once sustaynd have I.
Nor Phoebus darts could me costrayne,
from him one foot to shoon,
All these beside the Phrygians
subdued we have, and won:
when other Mecocks flings his darts
shall I not them withstand?
Yea, what if Phoebus came him self,
to pytche them with his hand?
When in his melancholy mood
He boasted without mean.
Then father Neptune lift his head
above the waters clean.
The beaten rock with forked mace
he vndermynyng pluckte
From bottom loose, sunk it down,
when down him self he duckte.
Theare Aiax lay, by land, by sire,
and storm of seas destroyed,
But we by suffering shypwrack, are
with greater plagues anoyd.
A subtyle shallow flood thear is
flown on a stony should,
Where crafty Caphar out of sight
the lurkyng rocks doth hold,
Upon whose sharpe and ragged top^
the swelling tide doth flow,
The boylyng waives do beat thereon
styll sweaing to and fro:
A turret noddyng over it
doth hang with falling swaye,
From whence on either side fro height
prospect espy we may
Two seas: and on this hand the coast
where P^lops ons did reygne,
And Istmus flood in narrow creek,
reculyng back again,
Doth stop Ionian sea, lest in
to Hellespont it run,
On tother part is Lemnon flood
that fame by blodshed won.
On tother side Calcedon town
doth stand against this forte,
A^d Aulis I'll that stayed our shyps
that thither did resort.
This Castle here inhabyte doth
our Palimedes sier,
Whose cursed hand held in the top
a brand o^ flaming fire,
That did allure our fleet, to turn
on lurkyng rocks a right,
Entysyng them with wily blase
to come unto the light.
All into fitters shaken are
the ve^sels on the should,
But other some do swym, and some
upon the rocks are roulde.
And other slyppyng back agayn^
so to eschew the rocks,
His bruised rybbes and ratlyng sides
against each other knocks,
Whereby the other he doth brea^e,
and broken is him self,
Then would they lance int^ the deep,
for now they dr^ad the shelf,
This peck of ^roubles chaun^t to hap
in dawning of the day.
But when the Gods (besought of us)
began the rage to staye,
And Phoebus golden beams began
a fresh to render light,
The dolfull day dys^ryed all
the damage done by night.

O whether may I now lame^t,
and weep with wailing sad,
Or shall I else in that my spous
returned is be glad?
I do rejoice, and yet I am
compelled to bewail
My countries great calamytie
that doth the same assail.
O father great whose majesty
doth thundering sep^ers shake,
The lowryng Gods unto the Gr^kes
now favourable make,
With garlands green let every head
rejoicing now be cround.
To to thee the pipe in sacryfice
m^lodiously doth sound,
And on thine alter lies slain
an Heyferdlyly white,
Before the same do present stand
with hanging locks vndyght,
A car^full Troyan company
in heavy woeful plyght,
On whom fro heygh the Laurel tree
with spredding branch doth shyne,
Whose virtue hath inspired them
with Phoebus grace divine,

ALas the cruel stynge of love
how sweetly doth it taste,
A misery to mortal man
annexed while life doth last?
The path of myscheife for to fly,
now sith there is a gap,
And wretched souls be frankly called
from every woeful hap
By death, a pleasant port, for aye
in rest them selves to shroud,
Where dredfull tumults never dwell
nor storms of Fortune proud:
Nor yet the burning fyry flakes
of Jove the same doth doubt,
when wrongfully with twacking thupes
he rappes his thunder out:
Hear lady peace thinhabitours
doth never put in flight,
Nor yet the victors threatny^g wrath
approaching nyg^ to fight,
No whyrling western wynd doth ^rge
the ramping seas to prance,
No dustye cloud that raised is
by savage Dimilaunce,
On horseback riding rank by rank,
no ferse and cruel ho^t,
No people slaughtered, with their towns
clean topsy tur^ey tossed:
While that the foe with flaming fire
doth spoil and wast the wall,
Untamed and unbridled Mars
destroys and batters all:
That man alone who forces not
the ficle fates a straw,
The visage grym of Acheront
whose eyes yet never saw,
Who never vewd with heavy chear^
the vgsome Limbo lake,
And putting life in hazard dare
to death him self betake.
That parson is a princes pear,
and like the gods in might,
Who knows not what death doth mean
is in a piteous plight
The ruthful ruin of our natyue
country we beheld:
That woeful night, in which the roofe^
of howses ouerqueld,
In Dardans City blazing bright
with flasshyng fiery flames.
when as the Greeks with burning brands
enkindle did the frames,
That Troy who war deeds of arms
might not subdue and take,
As ons did mighty Hercules,
whose quyuer ca^sde it quake,
Which neither he that Peleus son,
and son to Thetis was,
Nor whom Achilles loved to well,
could ever bring to pass,
When glyteryng bright in filled he ware
false armour on his back,
And counterfayting fearse Achill
the Troyans drove to wrack.
Nor when Achilles he him self
his mind from sorrow wrast,
And Troyan women to the walls
did scuddyng leap in hast.
In misery she lost her proud
estate, and last rename,
By being stoutly overcome,
and hardly pulled down.
Years five five did Troy resist,
that yet hereafter must,
In one nyghts space by destiny
be laid in the dust.
Their fained gifts well have we tri^
that huge and fatal gin:
We light of credit with our own
right hand have haled in,
That fatal gift of Greeks: what time
at entry of the gap
The ^gye horse did shyueringe stand,
where in them selves did wrap
The captains close, in hollow vautes
with bloody war yfreight.
When lawfully we might have tried,
and searched their deceight:
So by their own contryned snares
the greeks had bin confound:
The braseen buclers being shoke
did gy^e a clattryng sound.
A privy whysperyng often times
came tycklyng in our ear.
And Pyrrhus (in a murreynes name
so ready for to heate.
The crafty council picked out
of false Vlisses brain,)
Did jangle in the hollow vautes,
that rang thereof again.
But fearing and suspecting nought
the heddy youth of Troy
Laid hands upon the sacred ropes,
to hale and pull with joy,
On this side young A^styanax
came guarded with his train,
On tother part Pollixena
disponsed to be slain
Upoon Achilles tomb, she com^
with maids, and he with men,
A jolly flock with equal years
as young as they were then.
Their vowed oblations to the gods
in holiday attire,
The matrons bring and so to church
repairs every sire.
And all the city did alike,
yea Hecuba our queen
(That since the woeful Hectors death
or now was never scene)
She merry is: o grefe accursed,
a^ all thy sorrows deep
For which that first, or last befell,
entendest thou to weep?
Our battered walls which heuenly hands
erected have and framed?
Or else the burning temples which
upon their Idolls flamd?
Lamenting these calamities
we have not time and space,
O mighty parent Priam we
poor Troyans whale thy case.
The old mans thratlyng throt I saw,
(alas) I saw yborde
With cruel Pirrhus blade, that scante
with any blood was gord.
Refrain your tears y^ down your chekes
should tricle evermore
With woeful waylynges piteously
your pryuate friends deplore
My miseries refuse a mate,
so much accursed as I:
To few my careful case, refrain
your lamentable cry.
As for mine own distress to murne,
I shall suffyce alone.

To mingle tears with other tears
it doth us good to moan:
In those the burning teary streams
more ardently do boyle,
Who secret thoughts of lurking ^ares
in pryuy breast ^urmoyle:
Though that thou were a gossop stout,
that brooke much sorrow may
I warrant the, thou myghtest well,
lament this sore decay.
Not sad and solemn A^don
that in the woods doth singe
Her sugared ditties fynelye tunde
on sweet and pleasant string:
Recording ^tys woeful hap
in divers kind of note,
whom Progne though he were her child
and of her womb begot,
For to revenge his fathers fault,
she did not spare to kill:
And gave his flesh and blood for food
the fathers maw to fill.
Nor Progne who in swallows shape^
upon the rydges hye,
Of houses sitts in Biston town
bewailing peteou^lye,
With chatteryng throat, of Tereus
her spouse the cruel act,
(Who did by strength force of arms
a shamfull brutyshe fact.
Defile the sister of his wife,
fair Philomel by name,
And ^ake cut out her tongue, least she
should blab it to his shame)
Though Progne this her husbands rape
lamenting very sore
Do wail, and weep with piteous plaint,
yet can she not deplore
Sufycientlye, though that she would
our contreys petious plyght:
Though he him self among the swans
sir Cygnus lyllye whight.
who dwells in stream of Ister ^ood,
and Tanais channel could,
His weeping voice most ernestlye
though utter out he would:
Although the morning Halcyons
with doleful sighs do whale,
At such time as the fighting floods
their Cyex did assail,
Or rashly weryng bold attempt
the seas now laid at rest,
Or being very fearful fed
their brood in tottryng nest,
Although as sqeimysh hearted men
those preistes in bedlam rage,
Whom mother Cyble being borne
^n high in lofty stage,
Doth move, so play on shalmes, Atys
the Phrygian to lament,
Yet can not they this lot bewail,
though brawn fro arms they rent.
Cassandra in our tears there is,
no mesure to refrain,
Those miseries all mesure pa^se,
that plunged us in payne.
The sacred fillets from thy heads,
why doest thou hale and pull?
They chyflye ought to worship god,
whose hearts with grefe be dull.

My fear by this aflyction
is clean abated al,
Nor prayeng to the heavenly ghosts
for mercy will I call.
Although they were disposed to chafe
and fret in fustien fumes:
They nothing have me to displease,
fortune her force consumes.
Her spyte is worn unto the stumps,
what country have I left?
Where is my sire? am I of all
my systers quyt bereft.
The sacred tombs and alter stones
our blood have drunk and swyld,
Where are my bretherne blessed knot?
destroyed in the fylde.
All wyddow wives of Priams sons
may easly now behold,
The palace void and cast of court
of syllye Priam old.
And by so many marriages
so many wyddows are,
But only Hellen coming from
the coast of Lacon far.
That Hecuba the mother of
so many a pryncelye wight,
whose frutful womb did breed y^ brand,
of fire blasyng bright:
Who also bare the swinge in Troy,
by practis now doth learn,
New laws and guise of destynie
in bondage to discern.
On her she takes hart of grace
with looks so sterne and wild,
And barks as a bedlam bitch
about her strangled child
Dear Polidor, the remnant left,
and only hope of Troy,
Hector and Priam to revenge,
and to restore her joy.

The sacred Phoebus prophet is
with sudden sylence husht:
A quaking trembling shivering fear
throughout her limbs hath rushed:
Her face as pale as ashes is,
her fillits stand upright,
The soft and gentle goldilocks
start up of her affrigyt.
Her panting breathing breast stuffed up
within doth grunt and groan.
Her glaring bright and steaming eyes
are hither and thither throwne^
Now glaucyng up down they roll:
now standing styffe they stare.
she stretches up her head more straight
then commenly she bare,
Bolt up she goes, her wrestling jaws
that fast together clinge,
She doth attempt by divers means,
on sonder how to wring.
Her mobling words in gabling mouth
shut up she doth assuage,
As Menas mad that Bacchus ares
doth serve in furious rage.

How doth it hap (o sacred tops
of high Parnassus hill)
That me be rapt of sens, with pricks
of fury fresh ye fill?
Why do you me with ghost inspyre,
that am beside my wits?
O Phoebus none of thine I am,
releas me from the fyts:
Infixed in my burning breasts
the flames extinguysh out,
Who forces me with fury fell
to gad and trot about?
Or for whose sake inspird with spryte
mad momblyng make must I?
Why play I now the prophet cold,
sith Troy in dust doth lye?
The day doth shrink for dread of war,
the night doth dim mine eyes.
With mantle black of darkness deep
clean covered is the skies:
But lo two shynyng Suns at one^
in heaven appears bright,
Two Grecian howses muster do
their armies twain to fight.
Among the mighty Goddesis
in Ida woods I see,
The fatal shepherd in his throne
as vmpier placed to be:
I do advise you to beware,
beware (I say) of kings,
(A kindred in whose cankered hearts
old pryuy grudges sprynges)
That cuntrey clown Aegisthus he
this stock shall overthrow,
What doth this foolish despret dame
her naked wepons show?
Whose crown entende^h she to crack
in weed of Lacon land,
With hatchet (by the Amazons
invented first) in hand?
What face of mighty majesty
bewitched hath mine eyes?
The conqueror of salvage beasts
Marmarick Lyon lies,
Whose noble neck is wurried
with currysh fange and tooth
The churlysh snappes of eager Lioness
abide he doth.
Alac ye gostes of all my friends
why should ye say that I,
Among the rest am onl^e safe,
from perils far to lye?
Fain father follow thee I wold,
Troy being laid in dust.
O brother terror of the Greeks,
O Troyans aid and trust.
Our ancient pomp I do not see,
nor yet thy warmed hands,
(That ferce on grekish flaminge flete
did flyng the fyry brands)
But magled mebers, schorched corps,
and eake thy valiant arms,
Harde piniond and bound in bands
sustaynyng grievous harms:
O Troylus, a match unfit
encounteryng with Achill
(That mighty man of arms) to soon
com unto the I will.
I do delight, to sail with them
on stynkyng Stygian flood.
To view the churlyshe mastyfe cu^
of hell, it doth me good.
And gaping mou^hed kingdom dark
of greedy Ditis raygne.
The barge of fylthy Phlegethon
this day shall entertain,
Me conqueryng, and conquered,
and princes souls with all.
You flyteryng shades I you beseech,
and eake on the I call,
O Stygian poole (whereon the gods
their solemn oaths do take
Unbolt a while the brazen bars
of darksome lymbo lake.
Whereby the Phrygian folk in hell
may Micean state be hold.
Loke up ye sellye wretched souls,
the fates are backward roulde.
The sqallye sisters do approach,
and deal their bloody strokes,
Their smultring faggots in their hands
half burnt to ashes smokes.
Their visages so pale do burn,
with fyrye flaming eyes:
A garment black their gnawed guts
doth gyrde in morning guise.
Dire dred of night begins to howl,
the bones of body vast
With lieng long do rot corrupt
in miry pudle cast.
Behold, the weary aged man
his burning thirst forgot,
The waters dalyeng at his lypps
to catch endeavours not:
But murneth for the funeral,
that shall ensue anon.
The Troyan prince his royal robes
triumphant puts on.

The furious rage clean overpassed
begyns it self to slake,
And flyps away, even as a Bull
that deadly wound doth take
On gasshed neck afront the ares:
come let us ease at last
Her limbs, that of the spryte of god
hath felt the mighty blast.
Returning home again at length
and cround with Laurel bow
(A sign of worthy victory)
is Agamemnon now.
The wit to mete her husband, doth
her spedy passage ply,
Returning hand in hand, and foot
by foot most lovingly.

AT length I do aryue again
upon my natyue soyle^
God save the o dear loved land,
to thee is huge a spoil
So many barbarous people yeilde:
the flower of Asia Troy
To bear thy yoke submyts her self,
that lunge did live in joy.
Why doth this prophet (on the ground
her sprawling body laid)
Thus rele and stagger on her neck,
all trembling and dismayed?
Sirs, take her up, with lycour warm
let her be cherished.
Now peepes she up again, with drooping
eyes sonke in her head:
Pluck up thy spryte, here is the port
wished for in misery:
This day is festival.
At Troy
so was it wont to be.

Let us to Chalters worship gy^e.

At Chalters dyed my syer:

Pray we to Jove.

To Jove whose grace
divine doth me inspire?

Dost thou suppose that Troy you seist?

And Priam eke I see.

Troy is not here.

where Helen is
there take I Troy to be.

Fear not as maid to serve thy dame.

Nay freedom draws ny.

take thou no thought how you shalt live:

All cares for to defy
Death gyves a courage unto me.

Yet say I once again
There is no danger left, whereby
thou myghtest hurt sustain.

But yet much troublous danger doth
hang over thy head I wot.

What mischief may a victor dread?

Even that he dreads not.

Ye trusty meny of my men
come cary her away,
Till of the spryte she rid her self,
lest fury force her say
That may be preiudicall,
her to^ge she can not frame.
To thee o father flyngyng furth
the lightnings flashing flame,
That dost disperse the clouds, rule
the course of every star,
And guide the Globe of earth, to whom
the booties won by war
With triumph victors dedicate:
to thee o Iuno hight
The sister dear of doughty Jove,
(thy husband full of myht)
Both I and Greece with flesh blood
and eke our vowed beast
And gorgyou^ gifts of Arabie
give worship to thy hest.

O Greece by noble Gentlemen
in honour shining clear,
O Greece to wrathful Iuno thou
that art the darling dear,
Some jolly worthy lusty blood
thou fosters evermore,
Thou hast made even the gods, yt were
a number od before.
That puyssant mighty Hercules
a noble imp of thine
Deserved by his travels twelve,
rapt up in heaven to shyne.
For whom the heavens did alter course,
and Iupiter with all
Did iterate the hours of night,
when dampish dew doth fall.
And charged Phoebus chariot swyfte,
to trot with slower pace,
And leisurely bright lady moon
thy homward wayne to trace,
Bright Lucifer that year by year
his name a new doth change,
Came back again, to whom the name
of Hesper seemed strange.
Aurora to her comm^n course
her reared head addressed,
And cowchyng backward down again
the same she did arest,
Upon the shoulder of her spouse,
whose years with age are worn
The east did feel, so felt the west,
that Hercules was borne.
Dame nature could not clean dispatch,
to utter in one night,
That boystous lad: the whyrling world
did wayght for such awyght.
O babe whose sholders underprop,
the ample spacious sky,
In clasped arms thy prowes did
the crusshed Lion try.
Who from his fyrye yawnyng throat
spewes out his broiling brand,
The nimble hynd in Menall mount
hath known thy heavy hand.
The Bore hath felt thy fist, which di^
Arcadia destroy.
The monstrous conquered Bull hath rord
that Creta did annoy.
The Dragon dire that bredyng beast
in Lerna poole he slew,
And choppyng of one head forbadd
thereof to rise anew.
Wtih cloobbed bruising battring bat
he cranckly did subdew.
(The bretherne twins y^ tewd on teat)
whereof.iii. monsters grew.
Of triple formed Gerion
the spoil into the east,
A drove of cattle Hercules
did fetch out of the west.
Away from tyrant Diomede
the Thracian horse he led
Which nether with the grass that grew
by Styrmon flood he fed,
Nor yet on Heber banks, but them
the villain did refresh
His greedy mounching cramming jade
with aliantes blood and flesh.
Their rawfed jaws imbrewd were with
the carmans blood at last,
The spoils and shaftes Hipolyte
saw from her bosom wrast
As soon as he with clatryng shaft
the dusky cloud did smite,
The Stymphal bird that shadowed
the sun, did take her flight.
The fertyll tree that apples bears
of gould, did fear him sore,
Which never yet acquaintance had
with ^asters toth before.
But whipping up with lively twygges
into the air she flies,
And while the chinking plate doth soud
then Argos full of eyes,
The watchman shrinking close for cold
that sleep yet never knew,
Doth here the noise while Hercules
with mettle of yellow hew
Well laden packs away, and left
the grove befylched clean.
The hound of hell did hold his tongue
drawn up in triple cheane,
Nor barked with any boughing throat,
nor could abide the hew,
Or colour of the heavenly light,
whose beams he never knew.
When thou were captain general,
and did conduct our Host,
(They that) of Dardans lygne, to come
their stock do falsely boast,
Were vanquished by force of arms
and since they felt again
thy gray goose winge, whose bitterness
to fear might them constrain.
WIthin a revel rexe is kept,
as sore as ever was
Eve at ye.x. years seige of Troy:
What thing is this? (alas)
Get up my soul, and of the rage
auengment worthy crave:
Though Phrygians we be vanquished,
the victory we have.
The matter well is brought abought:
up Troy thou rysest now,
Thou flat on floor haste pulled down Greece,
to lye as low as thou.
Thy conqerour doth turn his face:
my propheseing spryght
Did never yet disclose to me
so notable a sight:
I see the same, and am thearat,
and busied in the broil,
No vision fond fantastical
my senses doth beguile:
Such fare as Phrygians feasted with
on last unhappy night
At Agamemnons royal court
full dayntyly they dight:
With purple hangings al adorned
the brodred beds do shyne,
In old Assaracks goblets gilt
they swinck and swill the wine.
The king in gorgyous royal robes
on chair of state doth sit,
And pranckt with pride of Priams pomp
of whom he conquered it.
Put of this hostile wed, to him
(the queen his wife began say)
And of thy loving lady wrought
wear rather this array,
This garment knit. It makes me loathe,
that shivering here Island.
O shall a king be murdered, by
a banysht wretches hand?
Out, shall Thadulterer destroy
the husband of the wife?
The dreadful destynies approcht.
the food that last in life
He tast^d of before his death,
their masters blood shall see,
The gubs of blood down dropping on
the wynd shall powered be.
By traytrous tryck of trapping wed
his death is brought about,
Which being put upon his head
his hands could not get out,
The stopped poake with mouth set op^
his muffled head doth hyde,
The mankynd dame with trembling hand
the sword drew from her side,
Nor to the utmost of her might
it in his f^esh she thrast,
But in the giving of the stroke
she stayed all aghast,
He as it were a brystled Bore
entangled in the net
Among the brears in busshy woods
yet tries out to get.
with struggling much the shrinking bands
more streyghtly he doth bind.
He stryues in vain, and wold slip of
the snare that doth him blind.
Which catches hold on every side.
but yet then tangled wreatch
Doth grope about, his subtle foes
with grypyng hand to catch.
But furious Tyndaris prepared
the pollax in her hand,
And as the preyst to sacryfyce
at Thalter side doth stand,
And views with eye the bullocks neck,
ear that with axe he smite,
So to and fro she heaves her hand
to stryke and level right.
He hath the stroke: dispatcht it is:
not quyte chopped of the head
It hangs by a little crop:
here from the carcass ded
The spoutyng blood cam gusshing out:
and there the head doth lye,
With waloing bobling mubling tong:
nor they do by and bye
Forsake him so: the breathless coors
Aegist doth all to coil:
And mangled hath the gasshed corpse:
while thus he doth him spoil,
She puts to her helping hand:
by detestable dede
They both accord unto the kind,
whereof they do proceade.
Dame Helens sister right she is,
and he Thyestes son:
Lo doutfull Titan stands styll
the day now being don,
Not knowing whether best to keep
styll on his wonted way
Or turn his wheles unto the path
of dire Thiestes day.

O Thou whom of our fathers death
the only help we have,
Fly, fly, fro force of furious foes,
make hast my self to save:
Our house is topsey turuey tossed,
our stocke^ is cast away,
Our ruthful realms to ruin run,
our kingdoms do decay.
Who comes here in Chariot swyft
this galloping a mayne?
Brother, dysguysed in thy wed
let me thy person fain.
O bussard blind what dost thou mean
from forayn folk to fly?
Whom dost thou shun? it doth behove
to fear this famylie.
Orestes now be bold, and set
all shivering fear a side,
The certain succour of a trusty
friend I h^ue espyde.

WIth solemn pomp I Strophilus
forsaking Phocis land,
Bearing a brauche of palm, yt grows
at Elis in my hand,
Returned back I am, the cause
that wyld me hither wend,
Is with these gifts to gratefie
and welcome home my freynd,
Whose valiyent army scald, shook
the tattryd Troyan walls,
Who wearied with the ten years war
now flat on floor she falls.
What woeful wight is this that staines
her mourning face with tears,
And drowned deep in drowsy dumps
oppressed is with fears?
I know full well this damsel i^
of princes lynage borne.
What cause Electra hath this joyful
family to morn?
By treason that mi mother wrought
my father lies slain,
And drinking of their fathers cup
the children do complain.
Aegist engroceth Castles got
by fornication.

Alack that of so lunge a tyme^
fylicitie is none.

I thee request even for the love
my father thou doest owe,
And for the honour of the crown,
whose brute abroad doth grow
In every coast: and by the gods
that dyuersly do ^eal,
Take into thy tuition,
convey away, and steal,
This poor Orest: such kind of theft
is piety indeed.

Although that Agamemn^n^ death
doth teach me to take heed,
Yet will I vnder^ake the same,
and with all diligence
Orestes shall I go about
with strength to have thee hence.
Prosperytie requires faith,
but troble exacts the same,
Have here a price for those that do
contend and wage in game.
An ornament with comely grace
ordaynd to deck the brow,
And let thy head be ^ouerde with
this green and pleasant bow.
And cary this victorious
triumphant branch in hand.
God grant this palm yt planted was
in fertile Pisa land,
(where solemn games were celebrate
Ioues honour to express)
May both a safeguard be to to thee
and bring thee good success.
Thou that bestryds thy fathers steeds,
as he before hath done,
Go stryke a league of amytie
with Pylades my son.
Now nimble nagges let Greece hereof
recording testify,
With headlong scouring course amain
this traytrous country fly.

He is escaped and gone, and with
vnmesurable might
The Chariot horse with rain at will
do send out of my sight.
Now free from peril on my foes
attendance will I make.
And offer willingly my head
the deadly wound to take.
The cruel conqueress of her spouse
is come, whose spotted wed
With sprynkels (sign of slaughter) do
bear record of her dede.
Her gory hands new bathed in blood
as yet they be not dry,
Her rough churlish rigorous looks
the fact do notyfye.
Unto the temple will I trudge.
Cassandra suffer me,
Oppressed with eagle grief, take part
of sacryfyce with thee.

O Thou thy mothers enemy,
ungracious saucy face,
After what sort dost thou a maid
appear in public place?
I have with my vyrgynitie
the bowers of bawds forsook.

What man is he, that ever thee
to be a vyrgyn took?

what your own daughter?

with thy mother
more modest should you be.

Do you at length begin to preach,
such godlynes to me.

A manly stomach stout thou hast
with swelling hawtye hart.
Subdued with sorrow learn thou shall
to play a woman's part.

A swerd and buckler very well
a woman doth beseme
(Except I dote)

^hy self doe^ you
haylefelow with us esteem?

What Agamemnon new is this,
whom thou hast got ^f late?

Hereafter shall I tame, and teach
thy gyrlysh tong to prate.
And make the know, how to a queen
^hy taunting ^o for bear.

The whilst (you widow) answer me
directly to this gear.
Thy husband is ^ereued quyght
of breath, his life is don.

Enquier where thy brother is,
So seek about my son.

He is departed out of Gre^e.

Go fetch him out of hand.

Fetch thou my father unto me.

Give me to understand,
Where doth he lurking hyde his head?
where is he shrunk away?

All plonge of perils past he is,
a^d at a quiet staye.
And in another kingdom where
no harm he doth mistrust,
This answer were sufficient,
to please a parent just.
But one whose breast dothboil in wrath,
it cannot satesfye.

To day by death thou shalt receive
thy fatal destynye.

On this condition am I pleased,
the Alter to forsake.
If that this hand shall do the dead,
my death when I shall take.
Or else if in my throat to bathe
thy blade, thou do delight,
Most willynglye I yield my throat,
and give the leave to smy^e.
Or if thou will chop of my head
in brutysh beastly guise,
My neck a waytyng for the wound
out stretched ready lies.
Thou hast committed synfully
a great and grievous guylt.
Go purge thy hardened hands, y^ which
thy husbands blood have spil^.

O thou that of my perylls all
doest suffer part with me,
And in my realm doest also rule
with eagle dignity,
Aegisthus art thou glad at this?
(as doth her not behove,)
With checks taunts y^ daughter doth
her mothers malice move.
She kepes her brothers counsel close
Conveyed out of the way.

Thou malipert and wi^les wench
thine eluysh pra^yng staye,
Refrain those words vnfytt thy mothers
glowing ears to vex.

What shall the breder of this broil
control me with his checks,
Whose fathers gilt hath caused him
to have a doubtful name,
Who both is to his sister son,
and nephew to the same?

To snap her head of with thy swerd
Aegist doest thou refrain?
Let her give up the ghost: or bring
Her brother straight again:
Let her be locked in dungeon dark,
and let her spend her days,
In Caves Rocks, with painful pangs,
torment her every ways.
I hope him whom she hidden hath,
she will again discrye,
Through being clapped in prison strong
and suffering poverty
With earksom and unsavoury smells
on every side annoyed,
En^orst to wear a widows wed,
er wedding day enioyde:
Put in exile and banyshment
when each man doth her hate:
So shall she be by misery
compelled to yield to late,
Prohibyted of holsom air
fruision to have.

Grant me mi dome bi means of death
to pass unto my grave.

I would have granted it to the,
if thou should it deny.
Unskilful is the tyrant, who
by suffering wretches dye^
Doth end their pains.

what after death
doth any thing remain?

And if thou do desire to dye,
the same se you refrain.
Lay hands ^irs on this wodrous wretch,
whom being carried on,
Even to the furthest corner of
my jurisdiction
Far out beyond Mycenas land
in bonds let her be bound,
With darkness dim in hiddious hold
let her be closed round.
This captive spous wicked queen,
the trull of princes bed
Shall pay her pains, and suffer death
by losing of her head.
Com hale her on, that she may follow,
that way my spouse is gon,
Whose love ^rom me enticed was.

Do not thus hale me on.
I will before you take the way,
these tidings first to tell
Unto my country men of Troy
beneath in lowest hell.
How ouerquelmed shypps each whea^
are spread the sea^ vppon^
And Micoene country conquered is
brought in subjection.
He that of thousand captains was
grand captain general,
Com to as great calamytie
as Troy it self did fall,
Entrapped was by treaytrus train,
and whordom of his wife,
And by a gift received of her
depreued of his life.
Let us not linger: on with me,
and thanks I do you give.
I joy, that it might be my hap,
thus after Troy to live.

Go to, prepare thy self to dye
thou frantyque raging wight.

The fransy fyts of fury fell
on you shall also light.

ALas ye hateful ^ellysh hags
ye furies foul and fell,
Why cause ye rusty rancours rage
in noble hearts to dwell^
And cankered hate in boylynge breasts
to grow from age to age?
Cold not the graudsyres painful pages
the childrens wrath assuage?
Nor ^a^yne faint of pynyng paunch,
with burning thurste of hell,
Amid the blackest stream of styckes
where poysnyng breathes do well.
Where vapors vile parbrakyng out
from dam^ysh miry mud,
Increase the pains of Tantalus
deserved by gyltles blood.
Could not thine own offence suffyce
Thyestes in thy life,
To fyle thy brothers spousal bed,
and to abuse his wife?
But after breath from body fled,
and life thy limbs hath left,
Can not remembrance of revenge
out of thy breast be reft?
What, yet hast thou not laid thy lips,
to cast of Lethes flood?
Now after death why dost thou come
to move thy son to blood?
Could cruel Ditis grant to thee
thy pasporte back again?
To work this wo upon the world,
and make such rigour reygne,
That Clytemnestr^ is become
the fyfty sister dire
Of Danaus daughters, that did once
their husbands death conspyre.
Lo here how ^icle fortune gyves
but brytle fading joy.
Lo, be who late a Conqueror
triumphed over Troy.
Enduring many sturdy Forms
with m^ghty toil and payne
To sow the seed of fame, hath reant
small fruit thereof again.
When as his honour budding furth
with flower began to bloom,
(Alas) the stock was hewed down
and sent to deadly doom.
And they that of his vyctorie
and coming home were glad,
to sudden murning change their mirth
with heauynes bestad.
The lusty pomp of royal court
is dead: (O dolfull day)
The people moan their princes death
with wo and weal away:
with howling, crieng, wringing hands
with sobs with sighs, and tears,
And with their ^ists they beat their bre^tes
they pull and hale their hears.
And as the sheep amassed run,
and ramp about the field,
When as their shepherd to the wolf
his gory throat doth ye^lde:
Even so as mad they rage and rave
throughout Micaenas land,
Depriued of their prince, they fear
the bloody Tyrants hand.
While thus were woeful wailings hard
in every place about,
The good Cassandra (come from Troy)
to death is haled out.
Like as the Swan, who when the time
of death approaches ny,
By nature warned is thereof,
and pleased well to dye,
Doth celebrate her ^unerall
with dirge and solemn songe:
Even so the noble vyrgyn who
in wo hath lived lunge,
Most joyful goes she to her death
with mild and pleasant face,
Stout boulst ring out her bourly breast
with pryncely port grace.
Nothing dysma^de with courage bold,
and cheerful countenance,
On stage ordained for her death
she began her self advance,
As though she had not thither come,
to leave her loathsome life,
As though she had not come, to taste
the stroke of fatal knife.
But even as if in brydale bed
her iurney were to meet
Corebus dear, not having mind
of death, nor wyndyng sheet,
When looking round on every side
she toke her leave of all,
From vapourd eyes of yonge and ol^
the tryclyng tears do fall.
The Greeks them selves to grief a^ moved
to see this heavy sight,
So pity pearest the headmans hart,
that thryse about to ^myte
He staide the smote: with shivering hand
yet once again he tried.
And fro her shoulders stroke her head.
and thus the vyrgyn dyed.
But now the Greeks another cause
of murnyng have in hand:
Orestes Agamemnons son,
is for^st to fly the land.
Among old rotten ragged rocks
^hear lies an ugly place,
A dungeon dep^, as dark as hell,
unknown to Phoebus face.
An hollow huge wide gaping hole,
with way styll bending down,
whose mouth with venomous withered weeds
is hid over grown,
where stinking smells com belching out
from filthy dirty dyke,
where verment vile do crepe craule,
in bell is not the like.
Il favoured, foul mysshapen ^ugges,
do lurk about this cave,
With dreadful sounds^ roryng noise
within the pyt they rave.
Even hither is Electra sent,
in darkness deep to lye,
In poverty, and comfortless
without the light of sky,
Fast clogd with iron boultes chains,
thus by her mother laid
In torments, till by her to death
Orestes be betrayed:
Who (as Cassandra tells) shall
revenge his fathers death,
Depryue with swerd thadulterour,
and mother both of breath.
So after all these bloody broils,
Greece never shall be free:
But blood for blood, and death by turns,
the after age shall see.
