O Gods whose grace doth guide their gob^les
that joy in wedlock pure,
O Iuno thou Lucina hight,
on whom the chary cure
Allotted is of those, that groan
in painful chyldbed ^andes,
O Pallas by whose heavenly art
Sir Typhis conning hands
Have learned to bridle with his helm
his newly framed boat,
Wherewith the force of fighting fluddes
he brekynge rides a flote.
O God whose forked Mace doth storms
in rigour rough appease,
And cause the ruffling surges couch
amid the ramping Seas:
O Titan who upon the swift
and wherlinge Hemisphaer
D^uides the cheerful day and night
by eagle turns tappere.
O threfolde shapen Hec^te
that send furthe thy light,
Unto thy sylent Sacryfyse
that offered is by night,
By whom my Iason swear to me
o heavenly powers all,
And ye on whom Medea ^aye
with safer conscience call,
O Dungeon dark^, most dredfull den
of everlasting night,
O dampned gohstes: o kingdom set
against the gods aryghte:
O Lord of sad and lowrynge lakes,
o Lady dire of Hell,
(Whom though that Pluto stale biforce
yet did his ^roth excel
The ficle faith of Iasons love,
that he to me doth bear,)
With cursed throat I conjure you,
o grys^ye gohstes appear.
Come out, come out, ye hellish hags,
revenge this deed so dire,
Bring in your scratting paws a burning
brand of deadly fire.
Rise up ye hiddiuos devilish feendes,
as dreadful as ye wear,
When unto me in wedlock state
ye did sometime appear.
Work ye, work ye, the dole full death
of this new wedded wife.
And martyr ye this father in law:
depryue of breath and life
King Creons ruthful famylie:
in plunge of passing payne
Torment ye me, that on my spouse
do wish this woe to reyne:
Preserve my Iasons life, but yet
let him be baited out
A mychyng, rogyng, runagate,
in foreign towns about.
To pass from door to door, with care
to beg his nedy bread.
Not knowing in what harbryng place
to couch his cursed head:
A banysht wretch, dysdaynd of all,
and styll in fear of life,
Then let him wish ten thousand times
for me again his wife:
This famous gest whom every man
will entertain and have,
Let him be drive at strangers gates
the table crumes to crave.
And that my bitter bannynges may
with myschefe most abound,
God grant in gulf of like distress
his children may be drounde,
To synke in sorrows storms, that do
there mother overflow:
Now, now, I have, I have the full
revenge of all my woe.
I have dispatcht: my piteous plaint
and words in vain I lose:
What shall not I with violence
get up against my foes?
And wryng out of their wrested hades
the wedding torch so bright?
Shall I not force the firmament
to lose his shrynkyng light?
What doth my grandsirs Phoebus face
this heuie hap behold?
And standing gasyng at this gear
yet westward is he rolde,
On glystrynge chariot hoisted high,
and kepes his beaten race,
Amid the crystal colourde sky,
why turns he not his face,
Retyringe fast into the East
back up the day to twyne?
O father Phaebe to me, to me,
thy Chariot reygnes resygne,
That I advanced up, about
the marble skies may ride,
Bequeath thy bridle unto me,
and give me grace to guide
Thy yoked prauncyng team, with yerkyng
lasshe of burning whyp,
That with thy fervent fyry beams
on purple poale do skyp.
Let Corinthe cuntrey burnt to dust
by force of flame and fire
Give place, that both the ^umbled seas
may join: whom to retire
It doth compel, and dassheth of
from bank on either side,
Least mete in one their channels might,
whose streams he doth deuyde.
No way to work their deadly woe
I have but this at hand,
That to the wedding I should bear
a ruthful bridal brand,
Anoyenge Creons careless Court:
when finished I have
Such solemn s^ruyce, as that ryght^
of sacrafyce do the crave,
Then at the Alters of the Gods
my chyldr^n shall be slain,
With crimsen coloured bl^od of babes heart,
their alters will I stain.
Through livers, lounges the lights
through every gut and gall,
For vengeance break away perforce,
and spare no blood at all:
If any lusty life as yet
within thy soul do rest,
I fought of ancient courage styll
do dwell within my breast,
Exile all folysh female fear,
and py^ye from thy mind,
And as thuntamed Tigers use
to rage and rave unkind,
that haunt the crokyng combrus caves
and clumpred frozen cliues,
And craggy rocks of Caucasus,
whose bitter cold depryues
The soil of all inhabytours,
permyt to lodge and rest,
Such sa^uage brutysh tyranny
within thy brazen breast.
What ever hurly burly wrought
doth Phasis understand,
What mighty moustrous blody feat
I wrought by sea or land:
The like in Corinth shall be seen
in most outragyous guise,
Most hiddious^ hateful, horrible,
to hear, or see with eyes.
Most d^uelysh, desperate dredful dede,
yet never known before,
Whose rage shall force heaven, earth hell
to quake and tremble sore.
my burning breast that rowles in wrath
and doth in rancour boyle,
Sore thrysteth after blood, wounds
with slaughter, death and spoil,
By renting racked lyms from lyms
to drive them down to grave:
^ush, these be but as Fleabytynges,
that mentioned I have:
As weyghtie things as these I did
in greener girlysh age,
Now sorrows smart doth rub the gall
and frets with sharper rage.
But since my womb hath yellded fruit,
it doth me well behove,
The strength and parlous pu^ssaunce
of weyghtier ills to ^roue.
Be ready wrath, with all thy might
that fury kindle may,
Thy foes to their dystruction
be ready to assay:
Of thy deuorsement let the Price
to match, and counterpayse
The proud precious pryncely pomp
of these new wedding days.
How wilt thou fro thy spouse depart?
as him thou followed hast
In blood to ^athe thy blody hands
and traytrous lives to wast.
Break of in time these long delays,
abanden now again,
This lewd alliance, got by gylte,
with greater gilt refrain,

WHo hath not wist that windy words be ^ain^,
A^d that in talk of trust is not the g^ounde,
Here in a mirror may he see it plain,
Medea so by ^ro^fe the same hath found.
Who being blind by blinded Venus boy,
Her bleared eyes could not behold her bliss:
Nor spy the present poysen of her ioy^,
While in the gr^sse the Serpent lurked is.
The shaft that flew from Cupids golden bow,
With feathers so hath dy^d her daseld eyes,
That can not see to shun the way of woe:
The rancklyng head in dent^d ha^te that lies,
So dulles the same, that can not understand
The cause that brought false Iason out of Greec^
To come unto her fathers fertile land,
Is not her love, but love of golden Fleece.
Yet was his speech so pleasant and so mild,
His tongue so fylde, his promyses so fair,
Sweet was the fowlers songe that hath beguylde
The selye bird, brought to the limed snare.
Faith, in his face, trust shy^ed in his eyes,
The blusshyng brow plain m^nynge seemed to show,
In double ha^te black treason hidden lies,
Dissembling thoughts that weave the web of woe.
The honeyed lyppes, the tongue in sugar depte
Do^ sweet the poison rank within the breast,
In subtle show of painted sheath is kept,
The rustye knife of treason deemed least,
Life seems the bait to sight that lies brym,
Death is the hooke that vnderlyes the same,
The candle blase delights with burning trym,
The Fly, till ^e be burned in the flame,
Who in such shows least dem^d any ills.
The hungry fysshe fears not the bait to Brooke,
Till up the lyne do pluck him by the gylles,
And fast in throat he feles the deadly hooke.
Woe Iason, woe to thee most wretched man,
Or rather wretch Medea woe to thee,
Woe to the one that thus dyssem^le can,
Woe to the other that trained so might be.
Thoughst thou Medea his eyes to be the glass
Whe^in thou might the face of thoughts behold,
That in his breast with words so covered was,
As cankered brass with gloss of yelow gold?
Did thou suppose that nature (more then kind)
Had placed his heart his ly^nge lyppes between,
His looks to be the mirror of his mind?
Faith in fair face hath ^ldome yet ben seen.
Who lyst^eth to the flateryng Maremaides note,
Must needs commit his tyred eyes to sleep,
Ye^lding to her the ^aking of his boat,
That means vnware to drown him in the deep.
What boteth the^ Medea to betraye
The golden Fleece, to fawning Iasons hand,
From Dragons teethe him safely to convey,
And fyrye Bulls the warders of the land?
Why for his sake from father hast thou fled,
And thrust thy self out from thy natyue soil?
Thy brothers blood what ay^d thee to shed,
With Iason thus to travel and to ^oyle?
Behold the mead of this thy good de^a^te,
The recompense that he to thee doth gy^e.
For pleasure, payne, for joy, most eager smart,
With cloggyng ca^es in banyshment to ly^e.
Tho^, and thy babes, are like to ^egge and ^ar^e,
In Nation stra^nge, (o miserable life)
While Iason from his promyses do ^wa^u^,
And takes delight in his new wedded wife.
O ground vngrate, that when the husband man
Hath tilled it, to recompense his toil
No corn, but weeds, and ^h^stles cendder can,
To ^ynge dys hands, that truyte seeks of his soil.
Such venom grows of pleasaut coloured flower:
Lo^, princes lo, what deadly poison sup
Of ba^e, erst sweet, now turned into sowe^,
Mede^ dranc^ out of a golden c^p.
AYe me alas I am undone,
for at the bridal cheer
The warble note of wedding songe
resouded in mine ear.
Yet for all this scant I my self,
yet scant believe I can,
That Iason would play such a prank,
amoste vnthanckfull man,
Both of my country, and my sire,
and kingdom me to spoil,
And yet forsake me wretch forlorn,
to straye in forreyn soil.
O hath he su^h such a stony heart,
that doth no more esteem,
The great good turns, and benefits
that I employed on him?
Who knows, that I have lewdly used
enchauntmentes for his sake,
The rigour rough, and stormy rage,
of swelling seas to slake.
The grunting fyryefomyng Bulls
whose smokyng guts were stufte
With smoltering fumes, y^ from their jaws,
nostrils out they puffed
I stopped their gnasshing mouching mouths
I quecht their burning breath,
And vapors hot of stewyng paunch,
that else had wrought his death.
Or fedes he thus his fansye fond,
to think my skill of charm
Abated is, and that I have
no power to do him harm?
Bestract of wits, with wavering mind
perplexed on every part,
I tossed, and turmoiled am,
with way ward crazy heart.
Now this, now that, and neither now,
but now another way,
By divers means I toil, that so
my wrong revenge I may.
I would the wreatche a brother had:
but what? he hath a wife.
Go cut her throat, with ghastly woudes
bereave her of her life.
On her i'll work my deadly spyte,
her, her alone I crave,
To quit such bitter sowsyng storms,
as I sustained have.
If any grand notoryus gilt
in all Pelasga land
Be put in practyse yet unknown
unto thy harmyng hand,
Thereof to get experience
the time doth now begin:
Thy former feats do bid thee tak^
good hope^ to thryue herein:
Let al thy gyltes with thronging thic^
assemble thee to aid,
The golden Fleece (the chief novel)
of Colchis I'll betrayed.
My tender brother eke, that with
my sier did me pursue,
Whom with his secrete parts cut of
I wicked virgin slew,
Whose shreaded dismembered corps,
with swerd in gobbits hewd,
(A woeful coarse toth fathers heart)
on Pontus ground I strewd.
How horye he added P^lias
his withered age to shyfte
To grener years, for longer life,
his daughters by my dryfte
His members all and mangled flesh
with lycour scalding hot
Ysodden, and parboiled have,
in seething brazen pot.
How oft in heinous blood have these
my cruel hands ben dyed?
And never any gylte as yet
by wrath inflamed I tried.
But now the parlous poysnyng would
of Cupids piercing dart
Doth boyle and rage within my breast,
it rancles at my heart.
But how could Ias^n it redress,
whom fortunes froward will
Hath ye^ld unto another hand,
at lust to save or spyll?
O rage of rusty cankered mind
this sclaundrous talk amend,
If fortunes grace will grant it thus,
let him unto his end
Live styll my Iason as he was,
but if not Iason mine,
Yet caitiff suffer Iason live,
though Iason none of thine:
Who being mindful styll of us
some favour let him show,
For these good turns yt our good will
could erst on him bestow:
King Creon is in all the fault,
and only worthy blame,
Who puffed up with sceptre proud,
unable for to frame
His tyckle mind to modesty,
made breach tw^xt us again,
Whom Hymens bands, and link of love
had made but one of twain,
By whom eke from her ^ender brats
the mother (wreatche) is drawn,
He breaks the vow, that gaged is
with such a precious pawn.
Seek after such a vyllaynes blood,
in daun^ynge pangs of smart
Let him alone be surely dowst,
such is his due desert,
A dungell heaped of Cinders burnt
his Pallayce make I shall,
that Malea where in winding strightes,
the lyngryng ships do crall,
Shall case on smolthryng turrets tops
turmoylde in cracklyng flame.
For godsake madame I you pray
your tongue to sylence frame.
Eke hyde your pryuye languyshyng
and grief in secret vain:
Who with a modest mind abides
the spurs of pryckyng payne,
And suffers sorrows patiently,
may it repay again.
Who bears a privy grudge in breast,
and kepes his malice close,
When least suspection is thereof
may most annoy his foes.
He leases oportunytie
who vengeance doth require,
That shows by open sparks the flame
the heate of kindled fire.

Small is the grype of grief that can
to reasons lore obey,
And snekyng down with steling steps
can stylie slyppe away.
But they that thoroughly sowsed are
with showers of greater payne,
Can not digest such corsyes sharpe,
but cast it up again:
Fain would I give them trouncyng girds.

Good daughter dere assuage
Thunbrydled swaye, and boiling heat
of this thy gyddie rage:
Scant may thou purchase quietness
although thou hold thy tongue.

The valiant heart dame Fortune yet
durst never harm with wrong
But dreading dastards down she drives.

If any courage dure,
And harbred be in noble breast,
now put the same in ur.

The show of sturdy valiant heart
at any time doth shyne.

No hope doth in aduersytye
the way to escape assygne.

He that ha^h none affiance lefts,
nor any hope at all,
Yet let him not mystrust the luck
of ought that may befall.

Thy Cuntrey clean hath cast thee of
to let thee synke or swym,
As for thy husband Iason he,
there is no trust in him:
Of all the wealth, and worldly muck
wherwyth thou did abound:
No portion remaynes at all,
whereby some help is found.

Medea yet is left, (to much.)
and here thou may espy
The Seas to succour us in flight,
and lands aloof that lye:
Yea iron tools, with burning brands
we have to work them woe,
And Gods that with the thunder dynt
shall ouerquell our foe:

who wears y^ goldecrested crown
him dread with awe ye should.

My father was a king, yet I
betrayed his Fleece of gould:

Can not the deadly violence
of weapons make the fear?

No though such grisly lads they were
as meanwhile did appear,
That bred of gargell dragons teethe
in hollow gaping ground,
When mutually in blody fight
each other did confound.

Then will thou cast thy self to death,

Would God that I were dead.

Fly, fly to save thy life.

w^ worth the time that once I fled.

What o Medea.

Why shall I fly?

A mother dere art thou,
Fly therefore for thy childrens sake.

Ye see by wh^m, and how,
A wretched mother I am made.

Thy life by flight to save
dost thou mistrust?

Nay, fly I will,
but vengeance first i'll have.

Then some shall thee at heals pursue,
to wreck the same again

Perhap i'll make his coming short.

Be still, and now refrain.
O despret dame thy thondring threats,
and slake your raging ire.
Apply, and frame thy froward will
as time and tides require.

Full well may fortues weltyng whele
to beggynge bring my state,
As for my worthy courage that
she never shall abate.
Who bowncing at ye gates, doth cause
the creakinge doors to jar?
It is the wreatche Creon his self,
whom princely power far
Hath lift aloft, with lordly look,
paft up with powncinge pride,
That he may Corinth contry with
the swaye of sceptre guide.

MEdea that ungracious imp
king Aetas wicked child
Yet hath not from our carfull realm
her lingrynge foot exild.
Some noughtie dryft she goes about,
her knackes of old we know,
Her juggling arts, her harming hands
are known well lunge ago.
From who will she with hold her harm?
whom will this cruel beast
Permit to live from peril fre
in quietness and rest?
Clean to cut of this parlous plauge
it was our purpose bent,
But Iason by ^ntreting hard
did cause us to relent.
At his request we granted have
her life she shall enjoy,
Let her acquit our contrye fre
from fear of all annoy:
Yea safely let her pack her hence,
in eager gyddye fit
With lompish lowering look she coms
in talk with me to knitt:
Sirs keep her of, and set her hence,
lest us she touche per hap,
And drive her back from coming nigh
command her keep her clap.
And let her learn at length, how that
her self submit she may,
The puissant payse and majesty
of princes to obey.
Run, hie the quickelye, trudge apace,
have hence out of my sight
This horible, most odious quean,
this monstrous wicked wight.
My soueraygne liege, what greater crime
have I or less offence
Commit against thy majesty,
to be exiled hence?

Alas the gyltles woman doth
demand a reason why:

If thou be judge indifferent,
ordaynd my cause to try,
Consider then my doubtful case,
and wey the ground of it:
If thou b^ king, command a Judge
for ^uch a matter fit.

The princes power thou shalt obey,
bit either right or wrong.

The prosperus pride of wrongynge crowns
cannot endeuer lunge.

Avaunt, yell out thy complaints
at Colchis, get thee hence.

Full gladly will I get me home,
if he that brought me thence
Vouchsafe to b^are me back again.

Alas to la^e arise
Entreatyng words, when as decree
is taken otherwise.

He that not hearing either part
pronounces his decree,
Unryghteous man accounted is,
though right his sentence be.

While Pelias trusted to thy talk,
from life to death be fell.
Go to, begin, we give you leave
your goodly tale to tell.

That type of regal maiesty^
that erst by Fortunes hand^
Advanced to I did attain,
hath taught me understand,
How harde a thing it is of wrath
the rigour to assuage,
When burning heat o^ boylyng breast
in flames begyns to rage.
Eke for thaduaucement of their power
more to dysplay in sight
Their kyngly courage bolstred out
with mai^stie of might.
They d^me it doth import aswaye,
and hath a ^reater grace,
Whom stately sceptre caused to climb
aloft to prouder place.
To persevere with fansye fond,
in that to reasons spyght,
Whose greedy choice attainted first
his mind with vain del^ght.
For though in pytyous plyght I lye,
thrown down to great decay,
With heau^ hap, and ruthful chance,
to miserable staye,
Thus hunted out from place to place,
forsook and left alone,
A wyddow while my husband live,
with cause to wa^le and moan,
Perplexed in maze of misery,
with cloyenge cares so r^se,
Yet whysom I in golden trone
have led in happy life.
By high and noble parentage
my bright renoune doth shine.
From Phebus eak my grandsire great
deryued is my ligne.
Whear silver streamed Phasis flood
his wasshyng waives doth shed,
Or with contrary crokyng ways
his bathing channel spread.
what ever wandering coast stretched out
is left aloof behind,
From whence the roaming Scithyan sea
his channel furthe doth find,
Where as Meotis fenny plasshe
with pure fresh water sprynges
Doth season sweet the bryny sea,
that tide in thither brynges.
Eke all the coasts enuyroned
and kept within the banks
Of Thermodon, where warlyke troupes,
and armed wyddowes ranks,
with painted bucklers on their arms
hold all the land in fear,
with rigour rough of threatening swerd
with force of dentyng spear.
So far to al these wandering coasts
and cuntreyes round about,
My fathers ample regiment
at large is stretched out.
I being thus of noble race
and in an happy plyght,
With glorious gloss of princely pomp
in honour shynyng bright,
Then pearlesse pears my spousal bed
did sek^ and sew to have,
But those to be their loving feres
now other Ladies crave,
Rash, tickle, peuysh, vndyscrete,
and waueryug fortunes wheel,
Hath cast me out the crusshyng cares
of banyshment to feel.
In sceptre proud and hautye crown
f^r thine affyance ^aste.
Sith vpsydowne with welkyn wheel
whole mounts of wealth is caste.
This princes do possess, that should
their royaltye dysplay,
Whose fame shall never ra^ed be
with storm of lowryng day,
To succour those whom misery
in pyt of pains do the ^ouse,
To sheylde and harber supplyantes
in roof of loyal house.
This only brought I from my realm
the precious golden Fleece,
That jewel chief, and eke the flower
of Chyualry in Greece,
The sturdy prop, the rampir strong
the bulwark of your wealth,
And Hercul^s the boystrus Imp
of ^oue I kept in health.
It was by means of my good will
that Orpheus did escape,
Whose harmony the lyu^le^se rocks
with such delight did rape,
That forced even the clottred lumps
with hoblyng pryckt to prance,
And eke the ioconde nodding woods
with fotyng fine to dance.
And that those heavenly twyns Castor
and Pollux did not dye,
My dew desert is doubled twyse,
sith them preserved I.
Of Boreas blustryng out with puffed
cheeks his blastyng breath
His wynged sons I kept alive
both Calais and Zeth.
And Linceus that with piercing beams
and sharper sight of eye
Could Nauyes on the farther banks
of Sicill shore espy.
And all the Minians that did come
the golden Fleece to wyn^
As for the Prince of Princes all
I will not bring him in.
With sylence Iason will I pa^se,
for whom though him I save,
Yet is not Greece in d^bt to me,
no recompense I crave
To no man him I do impute,
the rest I brough ^ again
For your avail, that you thereby
some profyt might attain.
But only on my Iason dear,
him for my own loves sake
I kept in store, that he of me
his wedded wife should make.
None other fault (God wot) ye have
to charge me with but this,
That Argo Ship by means of me
returned safely is.
If I a shame fast maid had not
with Cupids bait ben caught^
If more my fathers health to have
then Iasons I had sought,
Pelasga land had been undone,
and fallen to great decay,
The lusty valiant Capytaynes
had clean been cast away:
And iolye Iason first of all
this now thy son in law,
The Bulls had rent his swalowed limbs
in fyery chompyng jaw.
Let Fortune fight against my case
as list her eluysh will,
Yet never shall it grieve my heart,
repent my dede I nyll,
That I should for so many kings
their relynge honour save,
The guerden due that I for this
my crime comyt must have,
It lies Creon in thy hand,
if thus it likes thee,
Condemn my gyltye gohste to death,
but render first to me,
My fault that forced me offend,
then Creon grant I this,
Receauyng Ias^n (cause of crime)
I gyltye did amysse.
Thou know that I was such an one
when courynge low I lay,
Before thy fete in humble wise
and did intreatynge pray,
Thy gracious goodness me to grant
some succour at thy hand.
For me a wreache and wreached babes
I ask within this land
Some cottage base, in outcast hole,
some couching corner vile,
If from the town thou drive us out
to wander in exile,
Then some bye place aloof within
this realm let us obtain.

How I am none that tyrant like
with churlysh septer raygne,
Nor proudly or dysdaynfullye,
with hawtie courage hye,
with vauting foot do stamp the down
that vndertroden lye,
And daunted are in careful bale,
this playnlye doth disclose,
In that to me of late I such
a son in law have chose,
Who was a wandering pylgrim poor,
with sore afflyctyons freight,
Dysmayde with terror of his foe,
that lay for him in wayght.
Because Acastus having got
the crown of Thessail land,
Requires in thy gylty blood
to bathe his wreackfull hand.
He doth bewail that good old man
his fyble father slain,
Whom wayght of years with bowing back
to stoop allow constraine^
The godly minded systers, all
yblynde with mystye vale
And clokyng colour o^ thy craft
dared ventrusly a^sayle.
That mount of myfcheife merueylus,
to mangle^ ^eaw, and cut,
Their fathers dere anointed lym^
In boylyng cald^on put.
But for thy open gyl^ynes
if thou can purge the same,
Straight ^ason can dyscharge him self
from blot of gyltye blame.
His gentle hands were never staind^
with gore of any blood.
Aloof from your con^pyracie
refraynyng far he stood.
His harmless hands put not in ^r^
with gorye tools to mell.
But thou that se^st on fire first
th^se mighty myscheifs fell,
Who shameless woman's wil^e brain^
and manly stomach stout
Do ^et a gog, for to a tempt
to bring all ils about.
And no regard at all thou hast,
how scundyng trump of fame
With ryngyng blast of good or ill
do blow abroad thy name:
Get out and cleanse my ^yled realme^
away tog^ther b^are
Thine herbs vnmylde of sorcery,
my Lyeges rid fro fear.
Transport thee to some other land,
whereas thou may at ease
With odious noys^ of diu^lish charm,
the troubled Gods disease.

If needs thou will have me avoid,
my ship to me restore,
Or else my mate with whom I first
arrived on this shore:
Why dost thou bid that by my self
I only should be gone?
I came not hither at first without
my company alone.
If this do thee aggryese, that brunt
of wars thou shalt sustain,
Command us bot^ the cause thereof
to shu^ thy realm again:
Sith both are gyltye of one act,
w^y dost thou partte us twain?
For Iasons sake, not for mine own,
poor P^lias was slain.
Annex unto my traytrous flight
the conquered booty brave,
My horye headded natural si^r,
whow I forsaken have,
With brothers blody flesh that mangled
was with caruynge knife,
Or ought of Iasons forged lies
he gabbes unto his wife.
These dreary deeds are none of mine,
so oft as I offend,
Not for mine own comodytie,
to come thereby in the end.

time is expierd, by which thou ought
to have been gone away,
With keeping such a cha^ why dost
thou make so lunge delay?

Yet of thy bounty ere I go.
this one boon will I crave.
Although the mother banished
so sore offended have,
Let not the vengeance of my fault
through wrathful deadly hate,
Mine innocent and gyltlesse babes
torment in wreached state.

Away: with loving fryndely grype
thy children I embrace,
And as a father natural
take pity on their case.

Even for the prosperus good encrece
of fertile spousal bed,
Of Glauce bright thy daughter dear,
whom Iason late hath wed.
And by the hope of fruytfull seed,
whose flower in time shall bloom.
By thonour of thy glystryng crowne^
ythralde to fo^tu^es doom,
Which she so full of chop and change
with tycle turning wheel
Whirls up down, in staggring state
makes to and fro to reel.
I thee beseech, (sith to exile
I am departing now)
O Creon but a little pause
for mercy me allow,
While of my morning brats with kiss
my last farewell I take.
While gasp of faylyng breath perhap
my shyueryng lyms forsake.

With craft entendyng some deceit
thou craves this delay.

What falsehood for so little time
be cause of terror may?

No jot of time is short enough
dysplesure to prevent.

Can not one jot to weeping eyes
and tryllyng tears be lent?

Although against thy ernest suit
unlucky dread do strive,
One day to settle thee away
content I am to give.

This is to much, and of the same
somewhat abrydge ye may.

Make speed apace if from our land
thou get thee not away,
Ere Phoebus horse with golden glede
their streamyng beams do shed,
Of dawnyng lamp, thou art condemned
to less thy wretched head.
The holy day and bridal both
do call me hence away:
And wyls me at the sacred aare
of Hym^neus to pray.

LAui^n of life and dreadlesse was the wight,
Attemp^yng first in slender tot^ryng Barge
With slyuyng Ore the slyced wave to smite,
A^d durst commit the dainty tender charge
Of hazered life to inconstant course of wind,
That turns with change of chances evermore,
To view the land for^oke aloof behynd^,
And shouyng furthe the s^yp from s^fer shore,
And glancing through the fomy channel deep
On sund^r c^t wych slender stem the wave,
Twy^ hope o^ life, and dread of death to sweep,
In narrow gut him self to ^pyll or save:
Expery^nc^ yet of Planets no man had,
Th^y n^ded not the wandering cours^ to know
Of Sta^s, (wherwyth ^he painted sky is clad,)
Not ^l^a^s, (which return of saylyng ^w)
Nor Hyads ^that with showrs th^ Seas do b^a^e)
No nor the st^rne Amaltheas h^rned ^ead
(Who gave the ^yppes of luckyng Jove the t^ate)
Were wont to put the blunde^yug shyps in dread.
They feared not the northern ysye wayne,
which lazy old boot^s w^lds behind,
A^d twynes about, no name yet could they fain
For Boreas rough, nor smother western wind.
Yet Typhys bold on open seas durst sh^we
His hoisted sayl^s, and for the wynds decree
New laws: as now full gale aloof to blow,
Now tackle turned to take side wind alee,
Now up to fa^le the crossayle on the mast,
Theare safe to hang, the topsayle now to spread,
Now missel sayl^, and drabler out to cast,
When daglyng hanges his sha^tryng tackle red
while st^a^sman stur, and busy^ ne^r blyn,
With pyth to pull all sails eke to dysplay,
with tooth and nail all forc^ of wind to wyn,
To shear the seas, and quyck to scud away.
Th^ golden world our fathers have possessed,
where ^anysht fra^de durst n^u^r come in place,
All were content to live at home in r^st,
with horye head, gray^ ^eard, and surrowed face.
which tract of time within his con^rey brought,
Rich having little, f^r more they did not toy^,
No vent for wares, nor Traficque far they sought,
No wealth that sprang beyond th^yr naty^e soil,
The Thessail ship together now hath set,
Th^ world that w^ll with seas dysseuered lay,
It bydd^s the floods with oats to be bet,
And stream^s unknown with shypwrack us to fray
That wyck^d R^le was lost ^y ruthful wrack
Ytossed through such perylles passing great,
where Cyanes rocks began roar as thunde^ crack,
whos^ bouncyng bolt th^ shaken soil doth bea^,
The sowsyng surges dasshed eue^y star,
The pe^t^rd seas the clouds alo^te be^ayd,
This scufflyng did boule Typhis mind detar,
His h^lme did slyp f^om tr^mblynge hand dismayed.
Then Orpheus with his drowp^ng Ha^p was mum
Dead in h^r dumps the ^launtyng Argos glee,
All hus^t in rest with sylence, w^xed dum,
what hardy heart astound here would no^ bee^
To see at once each yawnyng mouth to gape,
Of Syllas gulf compact in wa^loyng paunch,
Of dogs, who doth not loth^ her mong^ell shape,
H^e visage, br^st, and hyddyous ugly ^aunche^
whom erketh not the scoulde with barking styll?
To her^ the Mermaids di^e who do^h not quail,
T^at lure the ears with pleasant syngyng ^ryll
Of such as on ^nsonius sea do sail?
when Orpheus on his twancklyng Harp did play,
That carst the Muse Calliop gave to him
Almost those Nymphs that wonted was to staye
The shypp^s, he caused fast following him to swym.
How ^earely was that wyck^d journey bought?
Medea accursed, and eke the golden Flecce,
That greater harm the storm of s^as hath wrought
Rewarded well that vo^age ^rst of Gre^ce.
Now seas controulde do suffer passage free,
The ^rgo proud erected by the hand
Of Pallas first, doth not com^layne that she,
Conue^d hath back^ t^e kings unto their land,
Each whirty ^o^t now scuddes about the deep,
All stynts and waares are taken clean away,
The Cities frame new walls them selves to keep,
The open world lets nought res^ where it lay:
The ^oyes of Ind Arexes luckwarme leake,
The Pers^ans stout in Rhene and Albis stream
Do bathe ^heyr barks, ^yme ^all in fine out break
when Ocean wave shall open every realm.
The wandrynge world at w^ll shall open lye.
And Typhis will some new found land suruaye.
Some trauelers shall the Co^tre^es far escry^,
Beyond small Thule, known furthest at this day^.
WHy tro^st thou fysking in out
so rash from place to place?
Stand styll, and of ^hyne eager wrath
suppress the ruth^ull race,
The rigour rough of ramping rage
from burning breast out cast,
As Bacchus bedlam preystes that of
his spryte have felt the blast,
Run frantyck hoytyng up and down
with scytysh wayward wits,
Not knowing any place of rest,
so prycte with froward fyttes,
On cloudye top of Pindus mount
all hyd with snow so chyll:
Or else upon the lofty ridge
of branched Nisa hill:
Thus starting still with frouced mind
she walters to and fro,
the signs pronoucyng proof of pangs
her frenzy face doth show.
with glowing cheeks, blood red face
with short and gaspyng breath,
She fetches deep ascendyng sighs
from sobbing heart beneath.
Now blithe she smiles, each ^obled thought
in pondering brain she beats,
Now stands she in a mammeryng^
now myscheyfe sore she threats.
w^ chaufing fume she burns in wrath,
and now she doth complain,
With blubbering tears a fresh biliue
she weeps and wayles again.
Where will this lumpish load of cares
with headlong swaye allighte?
On whom entendethe she to work
the threats of her despite?
Where will this huge tepestious surge
slake down it self again?
Kindled fury new in breast
begins to boyle a mayne.
She secretly entendes no misschife
small nor mean of syse
To pass her self in wickedness
her busy brains devise.
The token old of pinching ire
full well er this know I:
Sum heinous houge, outrageous great
and dredfull storm is nie:
Her fiery, scowling, steaming eyes,
her hanging groyne I se,
Her pouting, puffed, frowning face,
that signs of freating be.
O mighty Ione beguile my fear:
O wretch if thou desire,
What measure ought to paise thy wrath
then learn by Cupids fire,
To hate as sore as thou did love,
shall I not them annoy
That do unite in spousal bed,
their want on lust enjoy?
Shall Phoebus fiery footed horse
go lodge in western wave
The drdwping day, that la^ I did
with humble crowchinge crave,
And with such ernest busy suit
so hardly granted was,
Shall it depart er I can bring
my deuylishe dryfte to pass?
While houeryng heaven doth counter paised
hang with eagle space,
Amid the marble hemispheares,
while round with stinted race,
The gorgeous sky above the earth
doth spinning roll about,
Whiles that the number of the sands,
lies hid vnserched out.
While dawninge day doth keep his course
with Phoebus blase so bright,
While twinkling stars in golden trains
do guard the s^ombrie night,
While I sie under propping poale
with whyrlyng swyng so swyft
The shining bears vnbathed about
The frozen sky do lift,
While flushing ^loodes y^ frothy streams
to rustling seas do send,
To gird them gript with plonging pangs
my rage shall never end.
With greater heat it shall reboyle,
like as the brutyshe beast,
Whose tyranye most horrible,
excedeth al the rest,
What gredye gapynge whyrle poole wide
what parlous gulf vnmild,
What Sylla couched in roryng rocks
or what Charybdes wild,
(That Sicil and Ioinum sea
by frothy waives doth sup)
What Aetna bolking stifling flames,
and dusky vapours up,
(Whose heavy payse with stewyng heat
doth smoldryng crushe beneath
Encelades, that fiery flakes
from choked throat doth breath)
Can with such dreadful menaces
In swetyng fury fry?
No river swift no trowbled surge
Of stormy sea so hye,
Nor sturdy seas (whom rufling winds
with raging force to roar)
Nor puissant flash of fire, whose might
By boysteous blast is more,
May bide my angers violence:
my fury shall it foil:
His court I le over hourl, and lay
it level with the soil.
My Iasons heart did quake for fear
of Creon cruel kyng^
And lest the king of Thessalye
would war upon him bring.
But loyal love that hardens hearts
makes no man be afrighte.
But beet, that he conui^t hath yeilde
him self to Creons might.
Yet once he might have vysyted^
and come to me his w^fe,
To talk, and take his last farewell.
if danger o^ his life
In doing this (harde hearted wretch
most cruel) he should fear,
He being Creons sonn^ in law,
for him it le^u^l were,
To have prorogued somewhat yet
my heavy banishment,
To take my leave of ch^ldren twain
one only day is lent:
Yet do I not complain, as though
the time to short I thought^
As proof shall plain pronouce, to day,
to day, it shall be wrought,
The memory whereof no tract
of time shall wipe away.
With malice bent against the gods
my wrath shall them assay:
And rifling every thing, both good,
and bad, I will turmoil.

Madame thy mind that troubled is,
and ^ost with such abroyle
Of swarming ills, thy vexed breast
now set at rest again,
The peuyshe fond affeccions all
of troubled mind refrain.

Then only can I be at rest,
when every thing I see
Thrown headlong topsy turuey down
to ruthful end with me.
With me let al things clean decay:
thy self if thou do spyll,
Thou may drive to destruction
what else with the thou will:

If in this folly styff thou stand
behold what after clappes
Are to be feared, none dare contryue
for princes training trappes.

O Luckless lot of froward fates
o cruel fortunes hap,
Both when she list to smite, or spare,
in woe she doth us wrapp
A like, the salve that God hath given
so oft, to cure our grefe,
More noyeth then the sore it self,
and sends less relief:
If for her good desar^es to me
amendment I should make,
I hazard should my venturous life
to less it for her sake.
If I will shun my dismal day
and will not for her die,
Then want the love of loyalty
O wretched man must I.
No dastards dread my stomak^ stout
can cause to droop and shrynke,
But mere remorse appaulleth me,
when on my babes I think.
For why? when carfull parents are
ons reft of life and breath,
Soon after them there wretched seed
are drawn to dolfull death.
O Sacred ryghteousnes (if thou
enjoy thy worthy place
In perfect bliss of happy heaven)
I call upon thy grace,
And the for witness here allege,
how for my childrens part
With pit pryckte I have committ
these things against my heart.
And so I think Medea her self
the mother rather had,
(Though francticklye as now she fares
with rage of hart so mad
And doth abhor with painful yoke
of combrous cares to toil)
Her spousal bed, then that her seed
should take the plonging foil.
I did determine in my mind,
to go her to entreat
With gentle words, pray her cease,
in fervent wrath to freate.
And lo^on me when ons she kaste
the beams of glancing eye,
Full blithe she leaps, she iumpes for joy,
in fits she gins to fry.
Deep deadly blackish hate she seems
in out ward brow to bear,
And wholly in her frowning face
doth glutting grefe appear.
I packing, packing, Iason am:
this still to chopp, and change
The fletynge soil of my abode,
to me it is not strange.
The cause of my departure yet
(to me is strange) and new.
I wonted was in following the
all places to eschew:
I will depart, and get me hence,
to whom for helping hand
Entendest thou to send us furthe,
whom hence so fly the land
Thou dost compel with thine alies?
shall I repair again
To Phasis flood, to Colchis Isle,
or to my fathers raygne?
Or gorye swetyng feldes, that with
my brothers blood do reeke?
What harbring lands aloufe dost tho^
command us out to seek?
What seas appoint ye me to pa^se?
shall I my i^urney drive,
Upon the parlous hateful jaws
of Pontus to aryue,
By which I did sauf conduct home
kings valaunt armies great,
Where roaring rocks with thundrynge noise
the flapping waives do beat,
Or on the naro^ wrackful shore,
of Simplegades twain?
Or else to small Hiolcos town
can I return again?
Or toil, y^ gladsome pleasant lauds
Of Tempe to attain?
All places that I opened have
Unto thy passage free,
I shut them up against my self,
now whether send thou me?
A banysht wretch to banyshment
thou would have enclyne,
Yet to the place of her exile
thou can not her assygne.
Yet for all that without delay
I must depart and go:
And why? for sothe the king his son
in law comaundeth so.
Well: nothing will I stand against,
with gripes of passing payne
Let me be scourgde, of my deserts
such is the gotten gain.
Let Creon in his pryncely ruff
lay to his heavy hands,
To whyp an whore, in torments sharp,
with iron gyves, and bands
Let her be chaynd, in hydiouse hole
of night for aye her locke:
Let her be cloyed with pestryng payse
of restless rolling rock.
Yet less^ than I deserved have,
in all this shall I find:
O thou discourteous Gentleman,
consider in thy mind
The flamye puffs, and fyrye gaspes
of ghastly gaping bull,
And Aetas catell rich with Fleece
of gorgeous golden wool,
That went to graze amid so great
and mighty fears in feylde,
Of uncontrolled nacyon,
whose soil doth armies yeilde.
Revoke to mind the deadly darts
of sudden startynge foe,
when ghastly warriors ( Tellus brood)
to ground again did go
through slaughter red of mutual lauce,
to this yet further pass,
The lurched Fleece of Phrixes Ram,
that all thine errand was.
And vgsome Argos slumberlesse,
whom fast I caused to keep
His weary watching wynkyng eyes
with vnaquaynted sleep.
My brother eke, whose fatal twyst
of feeble life I shred,
And gilt that wrought so many gyltes
when as with thee I fled.
The daughters whom I set on work
entrapte in wylye train,
To slay their sire, that shall not rise
to quyckned life again.
And how to travel other realms,
I set mine own at nought.
By that good hope which of thy seed
conceived is in thought,
Eake by thy stable mention place,
and mighty monsters, that
Down beaten for thy health, I caused
before thy feet to squat,
And by these drudgyng hands of mine
vnspared for thy sake,
For dread of dangers ouerpas^
that caused thee to quake,
By heavens above, and seas below,
that wytnesse bearers be,
To knyttyng of our marriage up,
thy mercy veil to me.
Of all the heaps of treasure great
so far of being fet,
Which A^tas savage Scythians
did travel for to get,
From Ind^ where Phoebus scorching blase
doth dye the people black.
Of all this gold which in our bowers
we could not well compack,
But tryck and trym we garnished
our groves with gold so gay,
I banysht wretch of all this stuff
gat nought with me away,
Except my brothers flaughtred flesh,
yet I employed the same
On thee: the cares of cuntreys health
my honesty and shame.
My father, and my brother both
hath yielded place to ^hee,
This is the dowry that thou had
my wedded spouse ^o be.
To her whom thou d^est abrogate
restore her goods again.

When Cr^on in malycyous mood
had thought thee to have slain,
Entreated with my tear^s exile,
and life he gave to thee.

I toke it for a ponyshment,
but surely as I see
This banyshment is now become
a freyndly good reward.

While thou hast time to go be gone,
for most seueare, and harde
The kings displeasure ever is.

Thus woldste thou dodge me out?
Thy hated trull cast of thou doest
that please Creuse thou mought.

Doest thou Medea upbraid me with
the breach vnkynd of love?

And slaughter vile with treachery
where thou did me move.

When al is done what can thou say
my gyltynes to stain?

Even whatsoever I have done.

Yet more this doth remain:
That thy vngra^yous wyckednes
of harm should ^e accuse.

Thine, thine, they are, they are al thine
what ever I did use.
Who yt of lewdness reapes the fruit,
is grafter of the same.
Let every one with infamy
thy wretched spouse defame,
Yet do thou only take her part,
her only do thou call
A just and vndefyled wight,
without offence at all.
If any man shall for thy sake
polute his hand with ill,
To thee let him an innocent
yet be accounted styll.

The life is loathsome that doth work
his shame who hath it chose.

the life whose choice doth werke thy shame
thou ought again to lose.

Let reason rule thy eager mind
so vexed with crabbed ire
And for thy tender childrens ease
to be at rest req^yre

I do defy it, wholly I
detest it, I forswear,
That brethren bred unto my barnes
Creusas womb shall bear.

It will be trym, when as a Queen
of majesty and might
Hath issue, kinn unto the seed
of the a banished wight.

So cursed day shall neu^r on
my wretched children shyne
To myngle base borne basterdes with
the blood of noble lygne.
Shall Ph^bus stock (that bears y^ lamp
of heaven in starry throne)
Be macht with drudginge Sisi^hus
that roules in hell the stone?

What meanest you wretch both the m^
in banishement to yoke?
I pray the hence:

When humbly I
my mind to Creon broke,
He gave an ear unto my suit,

What lies in my might
To do for the?

If no good turn
then do thy worst dispyght.

On this side with his swerd in hand
King Creon doth me scar:
On other part with armed host
Acast doth me detarr.

Medea eke to coape with these,
that more apaull us may:
Go to, to skyrmyshe let us fall
Let Ias^n be the pray:

I yield whom sore aduersyties
have tyerd with heavy swaye.
Learn thou to dred thy luclesse lost
that oft doth thee assay.

I evermore have ruled the swinge
of fortunes waueryng will.

Achastus is at hand and nygh
is Creon the to spyll:

Take y^ thy heles to escape them both,
I do not the advise,
That thou against thy father in law
In traytrous arms should rise.
Nor in Achas^ thy c^sens blood
thy wounding hands to gore,
The vol^es unto Medea made,
do trowble the so ^ore.
While yet y^ hast not spylt there blood
yet, fly, with me a way.

when armies twain their banners o^
Defiance shall dysplaye,
And marching ^urthe in fylde to fight
s^ke battle at my hand,
Who then for us encounter shall
their puyssa^ce to wythstand?

If Cr^on and Acastus king
encamp to gether shall^
Admit that these in one with them
should join there powers all
My Contreymen of Cholchis I'll,
and A^tas lusty king,
Suppose the Scythians join with Greeks,
to ground I will them bring,
Clean put to foil.

The puissant power
of hawty mace I fear

Take heed, lest more thou do affec^e
the same, then for to clear,
Thy self of Creons servile yoke,

Least some suspicion grow.
Of this our tatlynge long here let
us make an end and go.

Now Jove hurl out thy flames and
thy thundering ^olts to fly,
With fiery drakes bright brandishing force
disparst in burning sky:
Strain furth thy dreadful thretning arm,
dispose in due array
The tossing dynt of lyghtnyng flash,
that wreck our quarrel may.
With rumblynge crack of rentynge cloud
cause all ye world to quake,
And level not thy houeryng hand
to stryke with fyrye flake
Upon my pasht and crushed corpse,
or Iasons carcass slain:
For whether of us thou smite to death
his dew reward shall gain,
thy thumps of thwacking bolts on us
amiss they cannot lyghte.

Fie, let thy mind on matters run
that seem a modest wyghte.
And use to have more cherfull talk,
if any thing thou crave,
Within my fathers house to ease
thy flight, thou shalt it have.

thou know my mind both can, eke
is wont, to do no less,
Then to contemn the bryttell wealth
that Princes do possess.
This, this shall be the only boon
that at thy hand I crave,
As mates with me in banyshmente,
my children let me have,
That resting on their syghing breasts
my careful morning head,
I may my crystal ^arye streams
into their bosoms shed.
But as for thee, new gotten sons
of wife new wed do staye.

I grant that unto thy request
I wysh I might obeye:
But nature me with pytye pryckes,
that needs I must deny.
For though both Creon and Achast,
in torments force me lye,
I could not yield unto their wills:
on this my life doth rest:
In times of tears, this is the joy
of dull afflycted breast
For better far I can abide
the want of vital breath,
And succour of my lymmes, or loose,
the light of world by death.

What love unto his selye babes
is deeply graft in him?
This works well I have him trypt^
lo now there lies brymme.
An open place whearbie receive
a vennye soon he may.
Let me or I depart, unto
my selye children say.
These lessons of my last adieu,
and grant to me the space,
With tender grype of collyng last
their loving lymmes ^embrace:
This will be comfort to my heart:
yet at the latter wo^rde
I ask nomore but only that
you should me this afoorde.
If eager anguish cause my tongue
to cast out words unkind,
Let al thing fly, let nothing be
Engraved in your mind
But let rem^mbrau^ce otherwhyle
of me to touche your thought,
Let other things be wypte away
that boil of wrath hath wrought.

I have forgotten every whit
god grant thou may of shake
These surging qualms of frownced mind
mylder may it make:
For quyetnes doth work their ease
that dented are with woe:

What is he slyl^e slypt and gon?
falls out the matter so?
O Iason doest thou sneak away,
not having mind of me,
Nor of those former great good turns
that I have done for the?
With the now am I clean forgot:
but I will bring about
That from thy careful sighing mind
shall not be banysht out:
Apply to bring this to effect,
call home thy wits again,
And all thy wily fetches far,
each artifycyall train.
This is the perfect fruyt that may
to the of myschefe spring,
To presuppose that myschefe is
not graft in any thing.
Scante have I oportunyt^e
for my pretensed guile,
Because we are mystrusted sore,
But try I will the while
To set upon them in such sort,
as none can deem my sleyghte:
Marche furth, now venture on, fall to,
both what lies in thy might,
And also what doth pass thy power.
O faith full nurse and mate.
Of all my heavy hart breaking,
and divers cursed fate,
Come help our simple mean device.
remaining yet I have
A robe of Pall the present that
our heavenly graundsyre gave,
Chief monument of Cholchis I'll,
which Phoebus did bestow
On Etas for a pledge, that him
his father h^ might know.
A precious fulgent gorget eake,
that bravely glytters bright,
And with a seamlye shynyng seam
of golden thrydes is dyght,
Through wrought between the row of pirles
do stand in borders round
Wherwyth my golden crispen locks
is wonted to be crounde.
My little children they shall bear
these presents to the Bryde,
That first with slybber ^abbar sosse
of chauntmentes shall be tried.
Request the aid of Hecate
in redynes prepare
The lamentable sacryfyce,
upon the bla^dye Aare.
Enforce the fyers catching houlde
upon the rafters hye
With crackling nois of flamie sparks
rebound in azure sky.

NO fyers force, nor rumb^yng cage
of boysteous blustryng wind,
No dart shot why^ling in the skyes^
such terror to the mind
Can drive, as when the ^re^ull wife
doth boyle in burning hate,
Depryued of her spo^sall bed,
and comfort of her mate,
Nor where the stormy southern wind
with dankysh dabbye face,
Of horye winter sends out
the gusshyng shooores apace.
where veighment Isters waumbling stream
comes walterynge down amayn,
Forbyddyng both the banks to me^e,
and canno^ oft contain
Him self w^thin his channels scou^e,
but further breaks his way,
Nor Rodanus who^e russhyng stream
doth launch into the sea,
Or when amid the floured spring
with hotter burning son,
The wynters snowes disolued with heate
down to the ryuers run:
The clottred top of Haemus hill
to water thynne doth turn,
Such desperate gogyn flame is wrath
that inwardly doth burn,
And modest rule regards not,
nor brydels can abide,
Nor dreading death, doth wysh on di^te
of naked blade to slyde.
O Gods be gracious unto us,
for pardon we do crave,
That him who tamed the scuffling waives,
vouchsafe ye would to save.
But Neptune yet the Lord of S^as
with frowning face will lower,
That over his second sceptre men
to triumph have the power.
The boy that rashly dared att^mpt
that great v^weldye charge
Of Phoebus everlasting carte,
and ^ouyng out at large,
Not bearing in his reckless breast
his fathers warnynges wise
Was burned with the flames which he
did scatter in the skies.
None knew the costly glymsyng glades,
where stragglynge Phaeton rode,
Pass not the path, where people safe
In formar ^yme have trod.
O fond^ynge, wilful, wanton boy,
do not dyssolue the frame
Of heaven, sith Jove with sacred hand
hath halowed the ^rame.
Who rowed with valiant oa^es tough^,
that were for Argo made,
Hath powled na^ed Pel^on mount
of thycke compacted shade.
Who entered has the flerynge rocks
and s^rched o^t the t^yle

MY shyuerynge mind amazed is,
agaste, and sore dysmayde:
My chyllysh lyms with quaking cold
do tremble all afraid.
Such plagues vengeance is at hand
in what exceeding wise
Do sharpe assaults of gredye grief
styll more and more arise,
And of it self in smotheryng breast
enkyndles greater heate?
Oft have I seen how ramping rage
hath forced her to freate.
With frantickfyts, mad, bedlam wise
against the Gods to rail,
And eke bewytched gohstes of heaven
in plunging plagues to trail:
But now Medea beats her busy
brain to bring to pass
A myscheyfe greater, greater far,
then ever any was.
Ere while when hence she trypt away
astonished so sore,
And of her poison closet close
she entered had the door:
She powers out her jewels all,
abroad to light she brynges
That which she dreading loathed long,
most irksome ugly things:
She mumblyng conjures up by names
of ills the rabble rowte,
In hugger mugger cowched lunge,
kept close, vnserched out:
All pestlent plagues she calls upon,
what ever Libie land,
In frothy boylyng stream doth work,
or muddye belchynge sand:
What teryng torments Taurus bredes,
with snowes vnthawed styll
Where winter flaws, and hory frost
knyt harde the craggy hill,
She lays her crossynge hands upon
each monstrus coniurd thing,
And over it her magic verse
with charmyng doth she singe:
A mowsye, rowsye, rustye route
with cankered scales y^lad
From mustye, fusty, dustye dens
where lurked lunge they had,
Do ^raull: a walowing ^arpent houge
his combrous corps out draggs,
In fiery fomyng blaryng mouth
his forked tongue he wags.
He stares about with sparklyng eyes,
if some he might espy,
Whom snapping at with stinging spit
he might constrain to dye:
But hearing once the magycke uerse
he husht as all a gast,
His body boalne byg, wrapped in lumps
^n twynyng knotes he cast.
And wamblynge to and fro his tail
in lynkes he row^es it round.
Not sharp enough (quoth she) y^ plages
and tools that hollow ground
Engenders for my purpose are,
to heaven up will I call,
To reach me stronger poison down,
to frame my fea^ with all.
Now is it at the very point,
Medea thou assay.
To bring about sum farther fetch,
then common wyches may.
Let down, Let down, that sprawlyng snake
that doth his body spread,
As doth a running broke abroad
his mighty channel shed.
Whose swelling knobes of wondrous sis
boysteus bobbing bumps
Doth thumpe the great lesser bear
that feel his heavy lumps.
The bigger bear with golden glede
the greekishe fleet doth guide:
But by the less the Sidon shypps
their passage have espied.
He that with pinch of griping fist
doth bruise the adders twain,
His strenyng harde clasping hand,
let him vnknitt again.
And crushe thair squeased venom out,
com further thou our charm
O flymie serpent Python, whom
dame Iuno sent to harm
Diana and Apollo both,
(those heavenly spyrytes twain)
With whom Latona trauelynge
did groan with pynchyng payne.
O Hydra whom in Lerna poole
Alcides gave the foil,
And all the noysom vermen vile
that Hercules did spoil.
Which when on sunder they were cut
with slysyng deadly knife,
Can knyt again there sodred parts,
and so recover life.
Help wakeful Dragon Argos^ whom
first magic words of mine
Made Morpheus locke thy sleppe lids
and shut thy slurgynge even.
Then having brought above the ground
of serpents all the row^e,
Of fylthy wedes the ranckest bane
she pyckes. and gathers out,
That spring on kno^tye Eryx hill
where passage none is found,
Among the ragged rocks, or what
on Caucasus his ground
Doth grow that styll is clad in cote
of horye morye frost.
That evermore vnmelt abides,
whose spattred fylde is soste
With g^bbs of blood, yt spowteth from
Prometheus gaping maw,
Whose guts with twitching talet out
the gastlye grype doth draw.
Or any other venomous herb
among the Medes that grows,
that with their sheaf of arrows sharp
in fylde do scar their foes.
Or what the light held Parthian
to serve her turn can send,
Or else the rich Arabians,
that dyp their arrows end
In poison ^tronge: the joyce of all
Medea o^t doth wrynge,
That vnderneth the frozen poale
In swe^ia land doth spring.
Whose noble state Hircinus wood
do the high enhance and rear.
Or what the plea^aute soil doth yield
in pryme of smiling vere,
When nature byddes the bird begin
her shrowdyng nest to build,
Or when the chursyshe Boreas blast
sharpe winter hath exild,
The trym array of branch and bough
to cloth the naked tree,
And every thing with bitter could
of snow con^ealed be.
In any pestylent flower on stalk
of any herb doth grow,
Or noisome joyce doth lie in rotten
writhen rotes allow,
Hath any force in breadyng bane,
those takes she in her hand.
Sum plagye herbs did Athos yeald
that mount of Thessayle land.
And other Pindus roches hye
and sum upon the top
Of Pingeus, but tender twyggs
the cruel since did l^pp:
These Tigris river noryshte up,
that chokes his whyrlpoale deep
With stronger stream. Danubius those
in fostryng wave did keep.
Those did Hidaspus minister,
who by the parching zone
With luke warm silver chanel runes,
so rich with precious stone.
And Bethis son, who gave the name
unto his country great,
And with his shallow fourd against
the Spanyshe seas doth beat
This herb abode the edge af knife
in danwnynge of the day
Or Phebus face began pepe, bedecte
with glyttryng golden spraye
His slender stalk was snepped of
in deep of sylent night,
His corn was cropped, while she with charm
her po^sned nailes did dight.
She chops the dedlie herbs, wrings
the squesed clottered blood
Of serpents out: fylthye byrds
of irksome mirye mud:
She tempers with the same and eake:
She brays the heart of owl
Foreshewing death with glaring eyes
and moapyng visage foul
Of shr^ke oule hoarce alive she takes
the dirty stynkyng guts,
Al these the framer of this feat
in divers percels puts.
This hath in it deuouryng force
of gredye spoylynge flame,
The frozen eysye dullyng could
engenders by the same.
She chantes on those ye magic verse,
that works no lesser harm,
With bustling fratickelie she stamps,
and cease not to charm.

O Flittring flocks of grisly gostes
that sit in sylent seat
O ougsum buggs o gobblyns grym
of hell I you entreat:
O lowryng Chaos dungeon blind,
and dredfull darkened pytt,
Whear Ditis muffled up in clouds
of blackest shades doth sytt,
O wretched woeful wawlyng souls
your ayed I do implore,
That linked lie with ginglyng chains
on wailing Limbo shore,
O mo^sye den where death doth couch
his ghastly carrayn face:
Releas your pangs o spryghtes, to
this wedding hye apace.
Cause ye the snaggye whele to pause
that rentes the carcass bound,
Permit Ixions racked lymmes
to rest upon the ground:
Let hungry bytten Tantalus
with gawnt and pined panch^
Soup up Pirenes gulped stream
his swelling thyrst to stawnche.
Let burning Creon bide the brunt
and gyrdes of greater payne,
Let payse of slypperye slydyng stone
type over back again
His moylynge father Sisyphus,
amongst the craggy rocks.
Ye daughters dire of Danaus
Whom pierced pychers morkes
So oft with labour lost in vain
this day doth long for you
That in your life with bloody blade
at once your husband slew.
And thou whose aares I honoured have
o torch and lamp of night,
Approach o lady mine with most
deformed visage dyght:
O three fold shapen dame that knitst
more threatening brows then on,
Acco^dyng to the country guise
with daglyng locks undone
And naked foot, the secrete grove
about I halowed have,
From dusky dry vnmoystye clouds
the showers of rain I crave.
Through me ye chinked gaping ground
the soked seas hath drunk,
And mayner stream of thocian flood
beneth the earth is sunk,
that swelteth out through hollow gulf
with stronger gushyng rage.
The were his suddy wamblyng waives
whose power it doth assuage
the heavens with wrong disturbed course
and out of order quyte,
The darkened son, glimering stars
at once hath showed their light,
and dreched Charles his straggling wane
hath ducte in dasshyng wave,
The framed course of roamyng time
racte out of frame I have.
So my enchautments have it wrough^
that when the flaming son
In somer bakes the parched soil
then hath the twygges begone,
with sprowting blossom fresh to blome'
and hasty winter corn
Hath out of harvest scene the fruit
to barnes on suddeyn borne.
Into a shallow ford his stur
dystreame hath Phasis wast
And Isters channel being in
so many branches cast,
Abated hath his wrackful waives,
on every sylent shore
He lies calm: The jumbled flooddes
with th^ndryng noise did roar,
When couched close the wyndes were
not moving pipp^ing soft,
With working wave the prauncynge seas
have swollen leapt aloft,
Whereas the wood in alder time
with thyck and branched bow
did spread his shade on gladsome soil
no shade remains now.
I rollynge up the magic verse
at noone time Phaebu^ staye,
Amid the darkened sky, when fled
was light of drowsye day
Eke at my charm the watery flocks
of H^yads went to glade.
Time is it Phaeba to respect
the service to thee made:
To thee with cruel blooddye hands
these garlands grene were twinned
Which with his folding circles nine
the serpent rowgh did bind.
Have here Tipho^as flesh, that doth
In Etnas furnace groan,
That shake with battery violent
king Ioues assalted trone.
This is the Centaurs poysened blood
which Nessus vylia^ne vile
Who made a rape of Dianire
entendynge her to fyle,
Bequethed her when newly woude
he gaspynge lay for breath,
While Hercles shaft stack in his ribbs,
whose lawnce did work his death:
B^holde the funeral cinders hear
which up the poison dried
Of Hercul^s who in his fire
on Oeta mountain dyed:
Lo here the fatal brand, which late
the fatal systers three
Conspired at Mel^agers birth,
such shulde his destnye be,
To save alive his brethyng corpse,
while tha^ might hole remain,
Wh^che safe his mother Alte kept,
till he his uncles twain,
(That from Atlanta would have had
the head of Conquered Bore,)
Had reft of life whose spytefull death
Althea toke so sore,
That both she showed her feruentnes
in systers godly lous,
When to revenge her brothers death
mere nature did her move,
But yet as mother most unkind
of nature most vnmylde,
To hasten the vntymely grave
of her beloved child,
While Mel^ages ^atall brand
she wasted in the flame,
Whose swelting guts bowels moult
consumed as the same,
These plumes the Harpies ravening fowls
for hast did leave behind,
In hidden hole whose close access
no mortal wight can find.
When fast from Zethes chasing them
with spedye flight they fled.
Put unto these the feathers which
the Stymphall bird did shed,
Whom duskyng Phoebus dymned light
sir Hercules did stynge,
And galled with the shaft, that he
in Hydraes hyde did fling.
You Aares have yield a clattryng noise
I know, I know of old,
How unto me my Oracles
are wonted to be could,
That when the trembling flower doth shake
then hath my Goddess great,
Uouchfafe to grant me my request
as I did her entreat.
I see Dianas waggyn swyfe,
not that whereon she glydes
When all the night in darkened sky
with face full open she rides:
with coutenauce bright blandishyng
but when with heavy cheer,
With dusky shimering wannie globe,
her lamp doth pale appear.
Or when she trots about the heauens^
with horsehead rayned strait,
When Thessayle wytches with the threats
of c^armynge her do bait.
So with thy dumpysh dulled blase,
thy clowdye fainting lyghte,
Send out, amid the lowryng sky,
the heart of people smite
With agonies of suddeine dread,
in strange and fearful wise,
Compel the precious brazen pannes
with iarryng noise to rise
Through Corinth contrye every where,
to shield the from this harm,
lest headlong drawn thou be fro h^auen
to earth by force of charm.
An holy solemn sacryfyce
to worship the we make,
Imbrewed with a blooddye turphe
the kindled torch doth take
Thy sacred burning night fire at
the dampishe mori grave.
Sore charged with thy trowbled ghost
my head I shaken have,
And du^kyng down my neck allow
with shrykyng load have shright,
And groueling flat on floor in trauce
have lain in dead mans plight.
My tuffled locks about mine ears
down daglyng have ben bownde
Tuckt up about my temples twain
with gladsome garland ^rownd:
A drerye branch is offred the
from fylthye stigis flood.
As is the guise of Bacchus prestes
the Coribanthes wood,
With naked breast and dugs laid out
I'll prycke with sacred blade
Mine arm, that for the bubbling blood
an issue may be made,
with trilling streams my purple blood
let drop on Thalter stones:
My tender childrens crusshed flesh
and broken broosed bones
Learn how to brooke with hardened harte^
in practyse put the ^rade
To florysh fearce, and keep a coil,
with naked glyttrynge blade:
I spryncl^d holy water have,
the lance once being made,
If tyred thou complain that
my cries thee ouerlade,
Give pardon to my ernest suit,
o Perceus sister dear,
Styll Iason is the only cause
that urges me to rear
with squeking voice thy noisome beams,
that stynge like shot of bow.
So season thou those sawced robes
to work Creusas woe,
Wherwt when she shall prank her self^
the poison by and by
To rot her in ward mary out,
within her bones may fry,
The secret fire bleares their eyes
with gloss of yellow gold,
The which Prometheus gave to me
that fire fylcher bold.
On whom for robbery that he did
in heavens above commit,
With massy payse great Caucasus
thunweldye hill doth sit,
Where under with vnwasted womb
he lies, and pays his pain,
To feed the cramyng foul with gubbes
of guts that grows again.
He taught me with a pretty sleyght
of conning, how to hyde
The strength of fire close kept in,
that may not be espied,
This lively tinder Mulciber
hath forged for my sake,
That tempered is with brymston quick
at first touche and take.
Eke of my cousin Phacton
a wyld fire flake I have
His flames the monstrous stagharde rough^
Chimera to me gave,
In head and breast a Lyon grymme,
and from the rump behind
He swepes the flower with laggyng tail
of Serpent force by kind.
In rybbes loins along his paunch
yshaped like a Got.
these fumes that out the bull perbrakt^
from fyrye spewing throat,
I gotten have and brayd it with
Medusas bitter gall
Comaundyng it in secret sort
to dusk and cover all:
Breath on these venoms Hecate
with deadly might inspyre,
Preserve the touching poulder of
my secret covert fire,
O grant that these my cloaked crafts
so may bewytch their eyes,
That lykelyhood of treason none
that may herein surmyse:
So work that they in handling it
may feel no kind of heate:
Her stewing breast, her sethyng veins,
let fervent fire freate
And force her roasted pynyg lymmes,
to drop and melt away,
Let smoke her rotten broiling bones:
inflame this bryde to day
To caste a light with greater glede
on fryseled blasynge hear
Then is the shynyng flame that doth
the wedding torches bear.
My suit is harde, thryse Hecate
a dreadful barking gave
From doleful cloud a sacred flash
of flamye sparks she drove.
Each poisons pride fulfilled is:
Call furthe my children dear,
By whom unto the cursed Bryde
these presents you may bear:
Go furthe, go furthe my little babes,
your mothers cursed fruit,
Go, go, employ your pains with bribe
and earnest humble suit
To purchase grace, and eke to earn
you favour in her sight.
That both a mother is to you,
and rules with Ladies might.
Go on, apply your charge apace
and hye you home again,
That with embracing you I may
my last farewell attain.

WHat ^arpe assaults of cru^ll Cupydes flam^
With gyddie heed thus tosses to and fro,
This bedlam wight, and dyuelysh des^ret dame
what rouyng rage b^e pryckes to work this woe?
Rough rancours boil con^eales h^r trosen face,
Her hawtie brest^ bombasted is with pride,
She shakes her head, she stalks with stately pace,
She threats our king more then doth he betide.
who would her deem to be a banysht wight,
whose ska^let cheeks do glow with rosye red?
In fainting face with pale and wannye whyght
The sa^guy^ hew exiled thence is f^ed.
H^r chaungyng lok^s no colour lo^g^ can hold,
Her s^iftyng^ fete styll trauasse to ^nd ^oe.
Even as the f^arce and t^nyng T^ge^ old^
That dot^ vnware his sucking whe^es fo^goe,
Doth ramp, and rage, most eager f^ce and ^ood,
Among the shrubb^s and bu^shes t^at do ^ ^owe
On Ganges st^onde that goldensanded ^lood,
whose silver str^ame through India doth flow^.
Eu^n s^ M^dea sometime wants her wytt^s
To rule the rage of her vnbrydeled ^e,
Now Venus son wyt^ ^usye frowa^d fyts,
Now wrath and l^u^, enkyndle both the fire.
what sha^l she do? when will this heinous wight
with fo^worde fo^e be packing hence away,
From Gre^c^? to ea^e our realm of ter^our quyght,
And princes twai^ whom she so sore doth fray:
Now ^haebus lodge thy Chariot in the w^ste,
Let nether rains nor bridle staye thy race,
L^t groue^ing lyg^t with dul^e at night oppreste
In clokyng cloud^s wrapped up his muffled fac^,
Let H^sperus the la^desman of the night,
In western flood drenche deep the day so bright.
ALl things are ^opsy turuy turned,
and wasted clean to nought
To passing great calamy^ye
our kingdom state is brought
The syer and daughter burnt to dust
in blendred cinders lye.

what train ha^h the entrapt?

such as
are made for kings to dye,
False tra^trusse gifts.

what privy guile
could wrapped be in those?

And I do marvel at this thing
and scant I can suppose
that such a mischief might be wrought
by any such deuyce

Report how this dystruction
and ruin should arise

The fyzzinge ^lame most egerlye
dath scour with swepynge swaye
Each corner of the princes court,
as though it should obey
Commanded thereunto so f^at
on flower the pallayce falls:
We are in dread least further it
will take the townysh walls.

Cast quenchyng water on it then
to slake the gredye ^lame.

And this that seems very strange
do happen in the same,
The water fedes the fire fast,
the more that we do toil
It to suppress, with hotter rage
the heate begyngs to boyle:
Those things that we have gotten for
our help it doth enjoy.

Medea thou that doest so sore
king Pelops land annoy,
Twine hence in hast thy forward foot,
at all assays depart
To any other kind of coast.

can I find in my hart
To shun this land? if hence I had
first fallen away by flight,
I would have travelled back again,
to case at such a sight.
To stand and se this wedding new
why stayest thou dotyng mind?
Apply, apply, thy sore attempt,
that good sucesse doth find.
What great exploit is this, that thou
of vengeance dost enjoy?
Styll art thou blinded witless wench
with vale of Venus boy?
Is this suffisaunce for thy grefe?
is root of rancour ded,
If Iason lead a single life
in solytary bed?
Some netling, thorny, stinging plages
vnpractysed deuyse:
Prepare thy self in redynes
and fall to on this wise:
Let all be fyshe that comes to net,
have no respect of right,
From mind on myschefe fixed fast
let shame be banysht quyt:
The vengeance they received at
my little childrens hand,
Is nothing worth: in ernest ire
ententyue must thou stand.
When heat of wrath begins to cool
cheer up thy self again:
Raise up those touches old that wonted
were in the to raygne,
That buried deep in breast do lye:
and as for all the same
That yet is wrought. of godlyn^sse
let it usurp the name^
Do this I shall teach them learn,
what tryflyng cast it was,
And common practised flymflam tryck
that erst I brought to pass.
By this my raging malady
a preamble hath made,
To show what howgier heaps of harms
shall shortly them invade
What durst my rude vnskillfull hand
assay that was of wayght?
What could the malice of a girl
invent her foes to bait?
Styll conversant with wicked feats
Medea am I made.
My blunt and dulled brains hath so
ben beat about this trade:
O so I joy, I joy, that I smote of
my brothers head,
And slashed his members of^eak that
from parents ^and I fled:
And filched have the privy fleece
lo Mars that sacred was.
It glads my hart that I to bring
old Pelias death to pass.
Have set his douggters all on work,
O grief pick out away
Not any guilt thou shalt with vnacqueinted
hand assay
Against whom wrath entendest thou
to bend thine Ireful might?
Or with what weapon dost thou mean
thy traitorous foes to smite?
I know not what my wrathful mind
consulted hath within
And to bewraie it to him self,
I dare not yet begin.
O rash and unadvised fool,
I make to hasty speed:
O that my foe had gotten of
his harlots body seed:
But what so ever thou by him
enioyest, suppose the same
To be Creusas babes of them
let her euioy the name.
This vengeance this doth like me well
good reason is their why
The last attempt of yls, thou must
with stomach stout apply.
Alas ye little sly fools
that erst my children were,
The plaging price of fathers fault
submyt your selves to bear
O, horror huge with sudden stroke
my hart doth overcome
with ysie dullynge cold conieald
my members all benum.
My shivering limbs appalled sore
for ghastly fear do quake,
A^d banished rage of malice hot
begins it self to flake:
The hateful hart of wife against
her Spouse hath yielded place,
And pityous mothers mercy mild
restores natures face.
O shall I shed their guiltless blood?
shall I the frame vnfould
Of that, which loving natures hand
hath wrought in me her mould?
O doty^g fury change thy mind,
conceive a better thought,
Let not this heinous savage dede
by means of me be wrought.
What crime have they (poor fools) commit
for which they should aby?
Upon their father Iason right
all blott of blame should lye.
Medea yet their mother I
am worser far then he
Tush let them frankly go to wrack,
no kith nor kin to me
They a^: dispache them out of hand
hold, hould^ my babes they be
God wot most harmless lambs they are,
no crime nor fault have they
Alas they be mere innocents
I do not this denay:
So was my brother whom I slew:
o falce reuoltyng mind
Why doest thou staggryng to and fro
such change of fancies find?
Why is my face be sprent with tears
what makes me falter so,
That wrath love with striving thoughts
do lead me to and fro?
Such fighting fancies bickering storms
my swaruyng mind detar,
As when between ye wrestling winds
is raised wrangling war,
Each where the tumbling walloinge waives,
are hoist and reared hye
Amid the iustlyng swolues of seas
that what in ^urye fry:
Even so my hart with struggling thoughts
now synkes, now swells ama^n,
Wrath sometime chase virtue out
and virtue wrath again.
O yield the yield, a grysyng grefe,
to virtue yield th^ place:
Thou only comfort of our stock
in this afflicted case,
Come hither comdere loved imp
with collyng me embrace,
While that by me your mother dere
sweet Boys ye are enjoyed
So lunge god grant your father may
you keep from harm vncloyd
Exile and flight approach on me,
And they shall by and by
Be pulled perforce out of mine arms,
with vapourd weeping eye
Sore languishing with moorning hart
yet let them go to grave
Before ^heir fathers face as they
before their mothers have:
Now rancorus grefe with fiery fits
begins to boyle again,
The quenched coals of dedly hate
do fressher force attain.
The rustye rancour harbred lunge
within my cankered breast
Startes up, and stirs my hand anew
in myscheife to be pressed.
O that the rabblement of brattes
which swarmde about the side
Of Niobe that scornful dame
who perysht by her pride
Had taken life out of his lymmes.
o that the fates of heaven
A fruytefull mother had me made
of children seven and seven.
My barreyne womb ^or my revenge
hath yielded little store
Yet for my sire and brother, twain
I have, their needs no more:
who seek this ruffling rowt of feendes
with gargell visage dyght;
Where will they deal their stripes, or whom
with whyps of fire smite?
Or whom with cruel scorching brand
and Stygian faggot fell,
with mischief great to cloy, entendes
this army black of hell?
A choppyng Adder began to hiss
with wrethynges wrapped round,
As soon as did the lasshyng whyp
^erte out with yerkyng sound.
whom bumping with thy rapping post
Megeta wilt thou crush?
whose ghost doth here mishapt fro hell
with scattered members rush?
My slautred brothers ghost it is
that vengeance coms to crave:
According to his dire request
due vengeance shall he have.
But flap thou fearce the fierbrandes
full dasshed in mine eyes,
Dig, rent, scrape, burn, squea^ the out
lo open my breast it lies,
To fighting furies bobbyng strokes
O brother, brother bid
These royles, y^ press to worrey me,
them selves away to rid.
Down to the silent souls allow
Not taking any care:
Let me be left hear by my self
alone, and do not spare.
To bast, and capperclaw these arms
that drew the blody blade:
To quench the furies of thy sprite,
that thus do me invade,
With this rig^t hand the sacrifyce
on thalter shall be made.
What means this sudden tramplyng noise?
a band of men in Arms
Come bustlyng toward us, that m^
will cloy with ^eadly harms.
To end this slaughter set ^ppon
I will my self convey
Up to the garrets of our house,
come Nurse with me away,
Bestow thy body hence with me
from danger of our foes.
Now thus my mind on myscheife set
thou must thy self dyspose,
Let not the flyckeryng fame praise
in darkness be exiled
Of stomach stoute^ that you did use
in murtherynge of thy child.
Proclaim in peoples ears the praise
of cruel blodye hand.

If any faithful man here be,
whom ruin of his land,
And slaughter of his prince do cause
in pensyue heart to bleed,
step furth that ye may take the wretch
that wrought this deadly dede.
Hear, hear, ye iolye champions
lay lode with weapons hear,
Have now, hoist up this house, fro low
foundacyon up it rear.

Now, now my sceptre guilt I have
recovered once again:
My fathers wrongs revenged are,
and eke my brother slain:
The gouldens cattels Fleece returned
is to my natyue land,
Possession of my realm I have
reclaimed to my hand:
Come home is my vi^gynitie,
that meanwhile went a straye.
O Gods as good as I could wysshe,
o joyful wedding day,
Go shroud thy self in darkness dim
dyspacht I have this feat:
Yet vengeance is not done enough,
to cool our thrystye heate.
O soul why dost thou make delay?
why dost thou doubting stand?
Go foreward with it yet thou may,
while doing is thy hand:
The wrath that might should minister
doth qualefye his flame:
The pryckes of sorrow twitch my heart
attaint with blusshyng shame:
Through rigour of thy heinous gore
o wreatche what hast thou done?
Though I repent a caytyfe vile
I am, to slay my son:
Alas I have committed it,
importunate delight,
Styll egged on my froward mind
that did against it fight:
And lo the vain coniecte of this
delight increases styll,
This only is the thing, that wants
unto my wicked will,
That Iasons eyes should see this sight
as yet I do suppose
Nothing it is that I have done,
my travel all I lose,
That I employde in dyry deeds,
unless he see the same.

Lo hear she looks out, and leanes
upon the houses frame,
That pitchlong hanges with falling sway:
hear heap your fyers fast,
Whereby the flames that she her self
enkyndled, may her wast.

Go Iason, go the o^ ryghtes
the wyndynge sheet and grave
Make ready for thy sons, as last
behooves him to have,
Thy spouse and eke thy father in law
that are entomde by me
Received have the duties that
to ded men's ghosts agree.
This child hath felt the dedly stroke
and lance of fatal knife,
And this with wal^some murder like
shall lose her tender life.

By all the sacred ghosts of heaven,
and by thy oft exile,
And spousal bed, with breach of love
in me did not defile,
Now spare, and sa^e the life of him
my child and also thine:
What ever crime committed is,
I grant it to be myne^
Make me a blodie sacri^ice
to dew deserved death,
Take from my synful guilty head
the use of vital breath.

Nay since thou will not have it so
as grieves thy pynched mind,
Here way to wreck my vengeance ^ell
my burning blade shall find.
Anaunt, now hence thou peasant proud
employ thy busy payne,
To reap the fruits of virgins bed,
and cast them of again
when mothers they are made.

let one
for dew revenge suffyce.
If gredye thryste of hungry hands
that still for vengeance cries,
Might quenched be with blood of one
then ask I none at all,
And yet to stanch my hongry grief
the number is to small,
If only twain I slay, if pleadge
of love lye secret made,
My bowels I'll vnbreste and search
my womb with pokynge blade.

Now fynysh out thy deadly deed,
that enterprised is,
No more entrea^aunce will I use,
yet only grant me this,
Delay a while his doleful death,
that I may take my flight.
Least that mine ^yes with bledyng heart
should view that heavy sight.

Yet linger eager anguish yet
to slay this child of thine.
Run not to rash with hasty speed
this doleful day is mine:
The ^yme that we obtained have
of Creon, we enjoy.

O vile malycyous minded wreache
my loathsome life destroy.

In craving this thou speak, that I
should show thee some relief,
Well goodynough, all this is done:
o ruthful gyddye grief,
This is the only sacryfyce
that I can thee provide,
Unthankful Iason hither caste
thy coyesh looks aside.
Lo hear dost thou behold thy wife?
thus ever wonted I,
When murder I had made, to escape,
my way doth open lye
That I may spring into the skyes^
the flyeng serpents twain
Submytted have their s^aly necks
to y^ke of ratlyng wayne,
Thou father have thy sons again
I in the wandering sky,
In nymble wheled waggyn swyfte
will ride advanced hye.

Go through the ample spaces wide,
infect the poisoned ayr^,
Bear wytnesse grace of God is none
in place of thy repair.
