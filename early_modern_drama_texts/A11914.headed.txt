WHat fury fell enforces me to flee thunhappie seat,
That gape and gasp with greedy jaw, the fleeing food to eat?
What god to Tantalus the bowers where breathing bodies dwell
Doth show again? is ought found worse then burning thirst of hell
In lakes allow? or yet worse plague then hunger is there one,
In vain that ever gapes for food? shall Sisyphus his stone,
That slipper restless rolling payse upon my back be borne?
Or shall my lymm{is} with swy^er swing of whirling wheel be torn?
Or shall my pains be Tityus pang{is} thencreasyng liver styll,
Whose growing gut{is} the gnawyng gripes and fylthie fowls do fill?
That sryll by night repair the panche that was deuowrde by day,
And wondrows womb vnwasted lythe a new prepared pray.
What ill am I appointed for? O cruel judge of syrights,
Who so thou be that torments new among the souls delights
Styll to dyspose, add what thou can to all my deadly woe,
That keeper even of dungeon dark would sore abhor to knot,
Or hell it self it quake to see: for dread wheroflykewyse
I tremble would, that plague seek out: Lo now there doth arise
My brood, that shall in mischief far the grandsiers gilt out go,
And gyltles make: that first shall dare vnuentred ylls to do.
What ever place remains yet of all this wicked land,
I will fill up: and never once while Pelops house doth stand
Shall Minos idle be.
go forth thou de^estable spright,
And vex the godd{is} of wicked house with rage of furies might.
Let them contend with all o^fence, by turns and one by one
Let swoordes be drawn: and mean of ire procure there may be none,
Nor shame: let fury blind inflame their minds and wrathful will,
Let yet the parent{is} rage endure, and longer lasting ill,
Through childerns childern spread: nor ye^ let any leisure be
The former fawte to hate, but styll more mischief new to see,
Nor one in one: but ere the gilt with vengeante be acquyt,
Increase the crime: from brethern proud let rule of hyngdome flyt,
To runagat^s: and swaruyng state of all unstable things,
Let it by doubtful dome be toste, between thuncertayne kings.
Let mighty fall to misery, and miser climb to might,
Let chance turn thempyre up so down both give and take the right.
The banished for gilt, wh^n god restore their country shall,
Let them to mischief fall a fresh: as hateful then to all,
As to them selves: let Ire think nought unlawful to be done.
Let brother dread the brothers wrath, and father fear the soon,
And eke the soon his parent{is} power. let babes be murdered ill,
But worse begot: her spouse betrapped in treasons train to kill,
Let hateful wife await. and let them bear through seas their war,
Let blood shed lye the land{is} about and every field afar:
And over conqueryng captains great, of countries far to see,
Let lust triumph: in wicked house let whoordome coun^d be
The lightst offense: let trust that in the breast{is} of bre^hern breeds,
And truth be gone: let not from sight of your so heinous deeds
The heavens be hyd, about the poale when shyne the startes on hye,
And flames with wonted beams oflight do deck the painted sky.
Let darkest night be made, and let the day the heavens forsake.
Dysturbe the godd{is} of wicked house, hate, slaughter, murder make.
Fill up the house of Tantalus with mischiefs and debates.
Idorned be the pyllers high, with bay and let the gates
Be garnysht green: and worthy there for thy return to sight,
Be kindled fire: let myschiefe done in Thracia onse, there light
More manyfolde. wherefore doth yet the uncles hand delay?
Doth yet Tyestes not be whale his childerns fatal day?
Shall he not find them where with heate of fires that under glow
The cawdern boils? their lymm{is} each one a pieces let them go
Dysperste: let fathers fires, with blood of childern fyled be:
Let deynties such be dreste: it is no myschiefe new to thee,
To banquet so: behold, this day we have to the releaste,
And hunger starved womb of thine we send to such a feast.
With foulest food thy famine fill, let blood in wine be drowned,
And droonke in sight of thee: lo now such dyshes have I found,
^s thou wou^st shone. stay whither dost thou ^dlong way now take?

To pooles and flood{is} of hell again, and styll declynyng lake,
And flight of ^ree full freight with fruit that from the lyppes doth flee,
To dungeon dark of hateful hell Let leefull be for me
To g^: or if to light be thought the pains that there I have,
Remove me from those lakes again: in midst of worser wave
Of Phleghethon to stand, in seas of fire beset to be.
Who so beneath thy pointed pains by destinies decree
Dooste styll endure, who so thou be that vnderliest allow
The hollow den, or ruin who that fears and overthrow
Of falling hill, or cruel cries that sound in caves of hell
Of greedy roaring lyons throats, or flock of furies fell
Who quakes to know, or who the brand{is} of fire, in dyrest payne
Half burnt throws of, hark to the voice of Tantalus: again
That hastes to hell. and (whom the truth hath taught) bel^ue well me
Love well your pains, they are but small. when shall my hap so be
To flee the light?

disturb thou first this house with dire discord:
Debates and battles bring with thee, and of the unhappy sword
Ill love to kings: the cruel breast stryke through and hateful heart,
With tumult mad.

To suffer payne^ it seems well my part,
Not woes to work: I am sent forth like vapour dire to rise,
That breaks the ground, or poison like the plague, in wondrowse wise
That slaughter makes. shall I to such detested ^rymes, apply
My nephews hearts? o parent{is} great of godd{is} above the sky,
And mine, (though shamde I be to grant,) although with greatter payne
My tongue be vexte, yet this to speak I may no whit refrain,
Nor hold my peace: I warn you this, least sacred hand with blood
Of slaughter dire, or fransie fell of (...) fury wood
The aulters stain, I will resyste: And guard such gilt away.
With strypes why dooste thou me affryght? why threaist thou me to fray
Those crallyng ^uakes? or famine fyxt in empty womb, wherefore
Dooste thou reuyue? now fryes within with thyrst enkyndled sore
My hart: and in the bowels burnt, the boylyng flames do glow.

I follow thee: through all this house now rage and fury throw.
Let them be driven so, and so let either thyrst to see
Each others blood. full well has ^elte the cummyng in of thee
This house: and all with wicked touche of the begun to quake.
Enough it is. repair again to denns and loathsome lake,
Of flood well known. the sadde^ soil with heavy foot of thine
Aggrieved is. see thou from spryngs howe waters do decline
And inward synke? or howe the banks lye void by droughtie heate?
And whotter blast of fury wind the fewer clouds doth beat?
The treese be spoyllde, and naked stand to sight in withered woodds,
The barayne bows whose fruit are fled: the land between the floodds,
With surge of seas on either syd^ that wonted to resound,
And nearer foordes to separate sometime with lesser ground,
Now broader spread, it hears howe aloof the waters rise.
Now Lerna turns against the stream, Phoronides likewise,
His poares be stopp^e. with customde course Alpheus drives not still,
His holly wau^s. the trembling topps of high Cithaeron hill,
They stand not sure: from height down they shake their silver snow,
And noble fields of Argos fear, their former drought to know.
Yea Titan doubts him self, to roll the world his wonted way,
And drive by force to former course The backward drawing day.

THis Argos town if any God be found, and Pisey bowers that famous yet
remain,
Or kingdoms else to love of Corinth{is} ground, the double havens, or
soondred seas in twain,
If any love Taygetus his snowes, (by winter which when they on hill{is} be
cast,
By Boreas blasts that from Sarmatia blows, with yearly breathe the summer
melts as fast,)
Where clear Alpheus roons, with floude so cold, By plays well known that
there olimpik{is} hight:
Let pleasant power of his from hens withhold such turns of strife, that
here they may not light:
Nor nephew worse then grandsier spring from us, or dyrer deeds delight the
younger age.
Let wicked stock of thyrstie Tantalus, at length leave of, and weary be of
rage.
Enough is done, and nought prevailed the just, or wrong: b^trayde is
Myrtilus and drowned,
That did betray his dame: and with like trust borne as he bare, himself hath
made renounde
With changed name the sea: and better known to mariners thereof no fable is.
On wicked sword the little infant thrown, as ran the child to take his
fathers his,
^nripe for thaulters offering fell down dead: and with thy hand (o Tantalus)
was rent,
With such a meat for gods thy boards to spread. eternal famine for such
food is sent,
And thyrst: nor for those deyntie meates vnmilde, might meeter p^ne appointed
ever be.
With empty throat stands Tantalus beguiled, above thy wicked head there
leanes to thee,
Then Phineys fowls in flight a swifter pray. with burdened bows declined on
every side,
And of his fruits all bent to bear the sway, the tree deludes the gapes of
hunger wide.
Though he full greedy, feed thereon would fain, so oft disceyude neglects
to touche them yet:
He turn^s his eyes, his jaws he doth refrain, and famine fi^ in closed gumms
doth shet.
But then each branch his plenteous riches all, letts lower down: and apples
from on hie
With lither leaves they flatter like to fall, and famine stir: in vain that
bidds to try
His hands: which when he has rought forth anon to be beguiled, in higher
air again
The harvest hangs, and fickle fruit is gone. then thirst him grieves no less
then hungers payne:
Wherewith when kindled is his boylyng blood like fire, the wretch the waives to
him doth call,
That meet his mouth: which straight the fleeing flood withdraws, and from
the dried ford doth fall:
And him forsakes that follows them. He drinks the dust so deep of gulf
that from him shrinks.
O Dastard, cowrde, o wretch, and (which the greatest yet of all
To tyrants check, I count that may in weighty things befall,)
O unrevenged: after gilts so great, and brothers guile,
And truth tr^de down, dooste thou provoke with vain complaints the while
Thy wrath? already now to rage all Argos town through out
In armour ought of thine, and all the double seas about
Thy fleet to ride: now all the fields with fervent flames of thine,
And towns to flasshe it well beseemde: and every where to shyne,
The bright drawn sword: all under foot of horse let every side
Of Argos land^ resound: and let the woods not serve to hyde
Our foes, nor yet in haughty top of hills and mountains hie,
The builded towers. The people all let them to battle cry,
And clear forsake Mycenas town. who so his hateful head
Hydes and defends, with slaughter dire let blood of him be shed.
This pryncely Pelops palace proud and bowers of high renown,
On me so on my brother too, let them be beaten down.
Go to, do that which never shall no after age allow,
Nor none it whisht: some mischefe great there must be ventured now,
Both fierce and bloody: such as would my brother rather long
To have bin his. Thou never dooste enough revenge the wrong,
Except thou pass. And feercer fact what may be done so dire,
That his exceeds? doothe ever he lay down his hateful ire?
Doothe ever he the modest mean in time of welthe regard?
Or quiet in aduersitee? I know his nature harde
^ntractable, that ^roke may be, but never will it bend.
For which ere he prepare him self, or force to fight entende,
Se^ first on him: least while I rest he should on me arise.
He will destroy or be destroyed, in midst the mischief lies,
Prepared to him that takes it first.
Doothe fame of people nought
Adverse thee fear?

The greatest good of kingdom may be thought,
That stil^ the people are constrained their princes deeds as well
To praise, as them to suffer all.

Whom feat^ doth so compel
To praise, the same his foes to be, doothe fear enforce again:
But who in deed the glory seeks of favour true tobtayne,
He rather would with harts of ^che be praysde, then tongues of all.

The tr^ praise full oft has hapt^ to meaner men to fall:
The false but unto mighty man. what ^ill they, let them will.

Let first the king will honest things, and no^ the same dare nyll.

Where leefull are to him that rules but honest things ^lone,
There raygnes the king by others leave.

And where that shame is none,
Nor care of right, faith, (...), nor holiness none staythe,
That kingdom swarues.

Such holiness, such p^tie, and fay the,
Are private goods: let kings run on in that that likes their will.

The brothers hurt a myschiefe count, though he be near so ill.

It is but right to do to him, that wrong to brother were.
What heinous hurt has his offense let pass to prove? or where
Refraynde the gilt? my spouse he stale away for ^echerie,
And raygne by stelthe: the ancient note and sign of impetie,
By fraud he got: my house by fraud to vex he never ceaste.
In Pelops house there fostered is a noble worthy beast,
The close kept R^mme: the goodly guide of r^tche and fairest flocks.
By whom through out on every side depend a down the locks
Of glittryng gold, with fleece of which the new kings wonted wear
Of Tantalls ^locke their sceptors guil^ and mace of might to bear.
Of this the owner reigns he: with him of house so great
The fortune fleethe: this sacred Ra^ a aloof in safety shet,
In secret mead is wont to grase, which stone on every side
With rocky wall encloses round the fatal beast to hyde.
This beast (aduentryng mischi^fe great) adjoining yet for pray
My spoused mate, the traitor false has hens conuayde awa^e.
From hens the wrongs of mutual hate, and mischefe all up sprung:
In exile wandered he, through out my kingdoms all a long:
No part of mine remains safe to me, from traynes of ^is.
My feerce deflourde, and loyalty of empire broken is:
My house all vexed, my blood in doubt, and nought that trust is in,
But brother foe. What staiest thou yet? at length l^ now begin,
Take hart of Tantalus to th^, to Pelops ca^t thine eye:
To such examples well beseems, I should my hands apply.
Tell thou which way were best to (...) that cruel head to death.

Through perste with sword let him be (...) and yield his hateful breathe.

Thou speak of the end: but I him would oppress with greater payne.
Let tyrant{is} vex with torment more: should ever in my rain
Be gentle death?

Doth (...) in thee preua^ no whit?

Depart thou hens all piety, if in this house as yet
Thou ever weary: and now let all the flock of furies dire,
And full of strife Erinnys come, and double brand{is} of fire
Megaeta shaking: for not yet enough with fury great
And rage doth burn my boylyng breast: it ought to be replete,
With monster more.

What mischefe new
(...) thou in ^age provide?

Not such a one as may the mean of wonted gree^ abide.
No gilt will I forbear, nor none may be enough despite.

What sword?

To little that.

what fire?

And that is yet to light.

What weapon then shall sorrow such find fit to work thy will?

Thyestes self.

Then ire it self yet that's a greater ill.

I grant: a tomblyng tumult quakes, within my bosoms lo,
And round it rolls: I moved am and wot not whereunto.
But drawn I am: from botome deep the roryng soil doth ^rie
The day so fair with thounder sounds, and house as all from hie
Were rent, from roof, and rafters craks: and lares turned abought
Have wryde their sight: so beete, so beete, let mischief such be sought,
As ye O gods would fear.

What thing see^e thou to bring to pas?
I note what greater thing my mind, and more then wont it was
Above the reatche that men are wont to work, begyns to swell:
And staythe with slothful hands. What thing it is I can not tell:
But great it is. Beete so, my mind now in this feat proceed,
For Atreus and Thyestes both, it were a worthy deed.
Let each of us the crime commit. The Thracian house did se
Such wicked tables once: I graunt^ the mischief great to be,
But done ere this: some greater gilt and mischief more, let ire
Find out. The stomach of thy son o father thou e^spyre,
And sister e^e, like is the cause: assist me with your power,
And drive my hand: let greedy parents all his babes devour,
And glad to rent his children be: and on their lyms to feed.
Enough, and well it is deuysde: this pleases me in deed.
In mean time where is he? so long and innocent wherefore
Doth Atreus walk? before mine eyes already more and more
The shade of such a slaughter walks: the want of children cast,
In fathers jaws. But why my mind, ^et dreadst thou so at last,
And fayn^st before thou enterprise? it must be done, let be.
That which in all this mischefe is the greatest gilt to se,
Let him commit.

but what disceyte may we for him prepare,
Whereby be^rapt he may be drawn, to fall into the snare?
He wotes f^ll well we are his foes.

He could not taken be,
Except him self would take: but now my kingdoms hops he.
For hope of this he would not fear to meet the mighty Jove,
Though him he thretned to destroy, with lightning from above.
For hope of this to pass the threat{is} of waives he will not fail,
Nor dread no whit by doubteull shelves, of Lybike seas to sail.
For hope of this (which thing he doth the worst of all believe,)
He will his brother see.

Who shall of peace the promise geeue?
Whom will he trust?

His evil hop^ will soon believe it well.
Yet to my sons the charge which they shall to their uncle tell,
We will commit: that home he would from exple come again,
And miseries for kingdom change, and o^er Argos raygne
A king of half: and though to harde of hart our prayers all
Him self despise, his children yet nought w^tyng what may fall,
With travels ^ierde, and apt to be e^tysde from misery,
Request{is} will move: on the one side his desire of Imperie,
On ^hother side his poverty, and labour harde to see,
Will him subdue and make to yield, although full stout he be.

His travels now the time hath made to seem to him but small.

Not so: for day by day the grief of ill increases all.
Tys light to suffer miseries, but ^euy them t'endure.

Yet other messengers to s^nde, in such affairs procure.

The younger sort the worse precept{is} do easelie harken to.

What thing against their uncle now, you them enstru^te to do,
Perhaps with you to work the like, they will not be a dred.
Such mischie^e wrought hath of^e returned upon the workers head.

Though neu^r man to them the ways of guil^ and gil^ have taught,
Yet kingdom will. Fear thou they should be made by counsel ^aught?
They are so borne. That which thou (...) a cruel en^erpryse,
And dyrely deem do^ne to be, and wickedly likewyse,
Pe^haps is wrought against me there.

And shall your soons of this
(...) be ware that work you will? no secretnes there is
In their so g^eene and tender ye^es: they will your traynes disclose.

A privy counsel close to keep, is lea^nde with many woes.

And will ye them, by whom ye would he should beguiled be,
Them selves beguiled?

Nay let the both from fault and blame be free.
For what shall need in mischiefs such as I to work entende,
To myngle them? let all my hat^ by me alone take end.
Thou leauste thy purpose ill my mind: if thou thine own forbear,
Thou sparest him. Wherefore of this let Agamemnon hear
Be minister: and client eke of mine for such a deed,
Let Menelau^ present be: truth of (...) seed,
By such a pracktise may be tried: if it refuse they shall,
Nor of debate will bearers be, if they him uncle call,
He is their father: let them go. but much the fearful face
Betrays it self: even him that faynes the secret wayghtie case,
Doth oft betray: let them therefore not know, how great a guyl^
They go about. And thou these thy^gs in secret keep the while.

I need not warned be, for these within my bosom deep,
Both faith, and fear, but chiefly ^aythe, doth shet and closely keep.

THe noble house at length of high renown, the famous stock of ancient
Inathus,
Appeasoe and laid the threats of brethern down. but now what fury (...) and
(...) you thus,
Each one to thyrst the o^hers blood again, or get by gyl^ the golden ma^ in
hand?
Ye little wo^e that so desire to ^ne, in what estate or place doth kingdom
stand.
Not (...) make a king or high renown, not (...) weed with purple ^an ^ie,
Not (...) looks, or head (...) with crown, not g^yng (...) with gold and
(...).
(...) king he is, that fear hath laid aside, and all (...) that in the breast
are bred:
^home impotent ambition doth not guide, nor fickle favour ^he of people led.
Nor all that west in metalls mines hath found, or ^hanell (...) of golden
Tagus shows,
Nor all the grain that (...) is on ground, that with the heate of (...)
^uest glowes.
Nor whom the (...) of lightning flame shall beat, nor eastern wind that
(...) upon the seas,
Nor swelling surge with rage of wind replete, or gr^edie (...) of (...)
displease.
Whom not the prick of soldiers sharpest spear, or pointed pike in hand
hath made to ^ue,
Nor whom the glimpse of sword might cause to fear, or bright drawn blade
of glyttryng steel subdue.
Who in the seat of (...) his feet, beholds all happs how under him they
lye,
And gladly runs his fatal day to meet, nor ought complains or grudges
for to dye.
Though present were the princes every chone, the scattered Dakes to chase that
wonted be,
That shynyng seas beset with precious stone, and red sea coasts do hold,
like blood to see:
Or they which else the ^an mountains hye, from Sarmats strong with all their
power withhold:
Or he that on the floude of Danubye. in frost a foot to travail dare be
bold:
Or Seres in what ever place they lye, renounde with fleece that there of sylke
doth spring,
They never might the truth hereof deny, it is the mind that only makes a
king.
There is no need of sturdy steeds in war, no need with arms or arrows
else to fight,
That Parthus wont{is} with bow to fling from far, while from the field he
falsely fayneth flight.
Nor yet to siege no need it is to bring, great goons in cart{is} to ouer^ we
the wall,
That from far of the yr battryng pellettes (...). a king he is that fears
nought at all.
(...) man him self this kingdom geeues at hand. let who so list with
mighty mace to ^ygne,
In ^yckle top of court delight to stand. let me the sweet and quiet rest
obtain.
So set in place obscure and lowe degree, of pleasant rest I shall the
sweetness kno^.
My life unknown to them that noble be, shall in the steppe of secret sylence
go.
Thus when my da^es at length are (...), and time without all troublous tumult
spent,
An aged man I shall depart at l^, In mean estate, to dye ^ull well content.
But grievous is to him the death, that when so farr^ abroad the ^ruyte of him
is blown,
That known he is to much to other men: departs yet vnt^ him self
unknown.
MY country bowers so long wysht for, and Argos riches all,
Chief good that unto banysh^ me^, and misers may b^ll,
The touche of soil where borne I was, and godd{is} of natyu^ land,
(If godd{is} they be,) and sacred towr^ I see of (...) h^nde:
That represent then all mans work, a greater majesty.
Renowned stadies to my youth, where noble sometime I
Have not so seelde as onse, the palm^ in fathers chariot won.
All Argos now to meet with me, and people fast will roon:
But A^eus to. yet rather lead in woods again thy flight,
And bushes thick, and hyd among the brutyshe beasts from sight,
Like life to theyrs: where splendent pomp of court and princely pride,
May not with flattryng fulgent face, allure thine eyes aside.
With whom the kingdom given is, behold, and well regard,
Bese^ but late with such mishaps, as all men count full harde,
I stout and joyful was: but now again thus into fear
I am returned. my mind mysdontes, and backward seeks to bear
My body hens: and forth I draw my pace against my will.
With slothful steppe (what (...) this?) my father stands still,
And turns his face and holds him self, in dout what thing to do.

What thing (my mind) consyderst thou? or else so long whert^
Dooste thou so easy counsel wrest? will thou to things unsure
Thy brother and the kingdom trust? fear thou those ils tendure
Now overcome, and mield^ made? and trauayls dooste thou flee
That well were plaste? it the ^yles, a miser now to be.
Turn hens thy pace while leefull is, and keep thee from his hand.

What cause the dryues (o father dear) thus from thy native land,
Now seen to shrynke? what makes thee thu^ from things so good at last
Withdraw thy self? thy brother comes whose ^res be overpassed,
And half the kingdom geues, and of the house ^ylacerate,
Repair the parts: and thee restores again to former state.

The cause of fear that I know not, thou dooste require to hear.
I see nothing that makes me dread, and yet I greatly fear.
I would go on, but yet my lymm{is} with we^y leg{is} do slack:
And other way then I would pass, I am withholden back.
So oft the ship that driven is with wind and eke with ore,
The swelling surge resistyng both, beats back upon the shore.

Yet overcome what ever stays, and thus doth let your mind,
And see what are at your return, prepared for you to find.
You may o father reign.

I may but then when die I mought.

^heefe thing is power.

nought worth at all, if thou desire it nought.

You shall it to your children leave.

the kingdom takes not twain.

Who may be happy, rather would he miser yet remain?

Believe me well, with titles false the great thing{is} v^ delight:
And heavy hap{is} in vain are feared, while high I stood in sight,
I never styn^ed then to quake, and self same sword to fe^re,
That hanged by mine own side wa^, Oh how great good it were,
With none to strive, but careless food to e^te and rest to know?
The greater gylts they enter not in cottage set allow:
And safer ^oode is fed upon, at narrow board always,
While droonke in gold the poison is: by proof well taught I say,
That evil happs before the good to love it likes my will.
Of haughty house that stands aloft in tickle top of hill,
And sways aside, the cite lowe need never be affryght:
Nor in the top of roof above, there shynes no Iuery bright,
Nor watcheman none defendes my sleeps by night, or guards my rest:
With fle^te I fyshe not, nor the se^ I have not backward pressed,
Nor turned to flight with builded wall: nor wicked belly I
With taxes of the people fed: nor parcel none doth lie,
Of ground of mine beyond the Getes: and Parthians fa^ about:
Nor worshipped with francausence I am, nor (Jove she^ out)
My Aulters decked are: nor none in top of house doth stand
In garden treese, nor kindled yet with help of each mans hand,
The bathes do smoke: nor yet are days in slothful slumbers led,
Nor nights paste forth in watch and wine, without the rest of bed.
We nothing fear, the house is safe without the hidden knife,
And poor estate the sweetness feels, of rest and quiet life.
Great kingdom is to be content, without the same to live.

Yet should it not refused be, if god the kingdom give.

Not yet desyerd it ought to be.

your brother bydd{is} you rain.

Bydds he? the more is to be feared: there lurks there some train.

From whens it fell, yet piety is woonte to turn at length:
And love vnfaynde, repair agayn^ his erst omitted strength.

Doth Atreus then his brother love? each Ursa first on hye,
The seas shall wash, and swelling surge of seas of S^ylye
Shall rest and all assuaged be, and corn to rypenes grow
In botome of Ionian seas, and darkest night shall show
And spread the light about the soil: the waters with the fire,
The life with death, the wind with seas, shall frendshyp first require,
And be at league.

of what deceit are you so dreadful here?

Of every chone: what end at length might I provide of fear?
In all he can he hates me.

to you what hurt can he?

As for my self I nothing dread: you little babes make me
Afraid of him.

dread ye to be beguylde when caught ye are?
To late it is to shoon the train in middle of the snare.
But go we on, this (father) is to you my last request.

I follow you. I lead you not.

god turn it to the best,
That well devised is for good, pass forth with cherefull pace.

ENtrapt in train the beast is taught and in the snare doth fall:
Both him, and eke of ha^d sto^ with him the offspring all,
About the fathers side I ^e: and now in safety stands
And surest ground my wrathful hate: now comes into my han^
At length Thyestes: ye he comes and all at ones to me.
I scant refrain my self, and scant may anger bridled be.
So when the bloodhound seeks the beast, by steppe and quycke of sent
Draws in the lame, and pace by pace to wind the ways he went,
With nose to soil doth hunt, while he the boar aloof hath found
Far of by sent, he yet refraynes and wanders through the grounds
With sylent mouth: but when at hand he once perceives the pray,
With al the strength he hath he strives, with voice and calls away
His lyng^ing master, and from him by force out breaks he.
When Ire doth hope the present blood, it may not hidden be.
Yet let it hidden be. behold, with ugly hear to sight
How yrkesomely defourmde with fylthe his foulest face is dyght,
How loathsome lies his beard unkempt: but let us friendship fain.
To see my brother me delight{is}: give now to me again
Embrasyng long desired for: what ever strife there was
Before this time between us twain, forget and let it pas:
Fro this day forth let brothers love, let blood, and law of kind
Regarded be, let all debate be slakte in eythers mind.
I could excuse my self, except thou werte as now thou art.
But Atreus) now I grant, the fault (...) mine in ^uery part:
And I offended have in all. my cause the worse to be,
Your this days kindness makes: in deed a gyltie wight (...) he,
That would so good a brother hurt as you, in any whyt.
But now with tears I must entreat, and first I me submit.
These hands that at thy feet do lye, do thee beseech and pray,
That ire an^ hate be laid aside, and from thy bosom may
Be scraped out: and clear forgot. for pledges take thou these
O brother dear, these gyltles babes.

thy hands yet from my kneese
Remove, and rather me to take in arms, upon me fall.
And ye o aids of elders age, ye little infant{is} all.
Me clyppe and coll ^bout the neck: this foul ^yre forsake,
And spare mine eyes that pity it, and fresher vesture take
Like mine to see. and you with joy, the half of empery
Dear brother take: the greater praise shall come to me thereby,
Our fathers seat to yield to you, and brother to relieve.
To have a kingdom is but chance, but virtue it to geeue.

A lust reward for such desert{is}, the godd{is} (o brother dear)
Repay to the: but on my head a regal crown to wear,
My loathsome life denies: and far doth from the sceptor flee
My hand unhappy: in the midst let leefull be for me
Of men to lurke^

this kindome can with ^wayne full well agree.

What ever is (o brother) yours,
I count it mine to be.

Who would dame fortunes gyfi{is} refuse, if she him raise to raygne?

The gifts of her each man it wotes, how soon they pass again.

ye me depry^ of glory great, except ye th^ ^mpyre take.

You have your praise in offering (...), and I it to forsake.
And full persuaded to refuse the kingdom, am I still.

Except your part ye will sustain mine own forsake I will.

I take it then. and bear I will the name thereof alone:
The ryghts and arms, as well as mine they shall be yours each one.

The regal crown as you besemes upon your head then take:
And I thappointed sacrifice for gods, will now go make.

Would any man it wean? that cruel wight Atreus, of mind so impotent to see
Was soon astonished with his brothers sight. no greater force then pietee may
be:
Where kynred is not, lasts every threat, whom true love holds, it holds
eternallye.
The wrath but late with causes kindled great all favour brake, and did to
battle cry,
When horsemen did resound on every side, the swoordes each where, then
glystred more and more:
Which raging Mars with often stroke did guide the fresher blood to shed yet
thyrstyng sore.
But love the sword against their wills doth swag, and them to peace
persuades with hand in hand.
So sodeyn^ rest, amid so grea^e a rage what god hath made? throughout Mycenas
land
The harnes clynkt, but late of cyuill strife: and for their babes did
fearful mothers quake,
Her armed spou^e to leese much feared the wife. when sword was made the
scabberd^ to forsake,
That now by ^est with rust was overgrown. come to re^ayre the walls that did
decay,
And some to strength the ^owres half overthrown, and some the gates with
gyns of yrne to staye
Full busy were, and dreadful watch by night from turret high did overlook
the town.
Worse is then wart it self the fear of fight. now are the threats of
cruel sword laid down,
And now the rumour (...) of battayles sown, the noise of crooked trumpet
sylent lies,
And quiet peace returns to loyfull town. so when the waives of swelling
surge arise,
While Corus wind the Brutian seas doth smight, and Scylla sounds from
hollow caves within,
And shipmen are with waftyng waives affryght, Charybdis casts that erst it had
droonke in:
And Cyclops fierce his father yet doth dred, in Actna bank that fervent is
with heates,
Lest quenched be with waives that ouershed the fire that from eternal fornace
beats:
And poor Laertes thinks his kingdoms all may drowned be, and Ithaca doth
quake:
If once the force of wyndes begin to fall, the sea lythe down more myide then
standing lake.
The deep, where ships so wide full dreadful were to pass, with sails on
either side out spread
Now fallne down, the lesser boat doth bear: and leisure is to view the
fyshes ded
Even there, where late with tempest bett vppone the shaken Cyclades were with
seas aghast.
No state endures, the payne and pleasure, one to other yields, and joys be
soonest past.
One howre set{is} up the things that lowest be. he that the crowns to
princes doth deuyde,
Whom people please with bending of the knee, and at whose beck their
battayles lay aside
The Meads, and Indians eke to Phebus ny, and Dakes that Parthians do with
horsemen threat,
Him self yet holds his sceptors doutfullye, and men of might he fears and
chances great
(That each estate may turn) and doutfull howre. o ye, whom lord of land and
waters wide,
Of life and death grant{is} here to have the power, lay ye your proud and
lofty looks aside:
What your inferior fears of you amys, that your superior threats to you
again.
To greater king, each king a subject is. whom dawn of day hath scene in pride
to raygne,
Him over thrown hath seen the evening late. let none rejoice to much that
good hath got,
Let none despair of best in worst estate. for Clothos myngles all, and
suffers not
Fortune to stand: but fates about doth drive. such friendship find with
godd{is} yet no man might,
That he the morrow might be sure to live. the god our thing{is} all tossed and
turned quite
Rolls with a whirl wind.
WHat whirlwind my me headlong drive and up in air me flyng,
And wrap in darkest cloud, whereby it might so heinous thing,
Take from mine eyes? o wicked house that even of Pelops ought
And Tantalus abhor^ed be.
what new thing hast thou brought?

What land is this? lythe Sparta here, and Arges, that hath bred
So wicked brethern? and the ground of Corinth lying spread
Between the seas? or Ister ells where wont to take their flight,
Are people wild? or that which wont{is} with snow to shyne so bright
Hircana laud? or else do here the wandering Srythians dwell?

What monstrous mischefe is this place then guilty of? that tell,
And this declare to us at large what ever be the ill.

If once my mind may stay itself, and quaking limm{is} I will.
But yet of such a cruel deed before mine eyes the fear
And Image walks: ye raging storms now far from hens me ^eare
And to that place me drive, to which now driven is the day
Thus drawn from hens.

Our minds ye hold yet still in doubtful stay.
Tell what it is ye so abhorte. The author thereof show.
I acke not who, but which of them: that quickly let us know.

In Pelopp{is} Turret high, a part there is of palace wide
That to ward the southe erected leanes, of which the utter side
With equal top to mountain stands, and on the city ^es,
And people proud against their prince if once the traitors rise
Hath vnderneathe his battryng stroke: there shines the place in sight
Where wont the people to frequent, whose golden beams so bright
The noble spotted pillars gray, of marble do support.
Within this place well known to men, where they so oft resort,
To many other rooms about the noble court doth go.
The privy Palace vnderlieth in secret place aloe,
With ditch full deep that doth (...) the wood of priuetee,
And hidden parts of kingdom old: where never grew no tree
That cherefull bows is wont to bear, with knife or lopped be,
But Tax, and Cypress, and with tree of holm^ full black to se
Doth beck and bend the wood so (...) aloft above all these
The higher oak doth overlook, surmounting all the treese.
From hens with luck the ^ne to take, accustomed are the kings,
From hens in danger aid to ask, and doom in doubtful things.
To this affixed are the gifts, the sounding (...) bright,
The Chariots broke, and spoils of sea that now Myrtoon hight,
There hang the wheels once won by craft of falset axell tree,
And every other conquests note: here leefull is to see
The (...) tyre of Pelops head: the spoil of enmies here,
And of Barbarian triumph left, the painted gorgeous geere.
A loathsome spring stands under shade, and slothful course doth take,
With water black: even such as is, of ^some Stygian lake
The ugly wave, whereby are wo^, to swear the gods on hie.
Here all the night the grisly ghosts and gods of death to cry
The fame reports: with clinkyng chains resounds the wood each where,
The sprights (...) out: and every thing that dredfull is to hear,
May there be seen: of ugly shapes from old Sepulchres sent
A fearful flock doth wander there, and in that place frequen^
Worse things then ever yet were known: ye all the wood full oft
With flame is wont to flas^e, and all the higher trees aloft
Without a fire do burn: and oft the wood beside all this
With triple barking roars at once: full oft the palace is
Affright with shapes, nor light of day may once the terror quell.
Eternal night doth hold the place, and darkness there of hell
In mid day reigns: from hens to them that pray, out of the ground
The certain answers given are, what time with dredfull sound
From secret place the fates be told, and dungeon roars within
While of the God breaks out the voice: where when entered in
Fierce Atreus was, that did with him his brothers children trail,
Dekt are the ^ultets: who (alas) may it enough bewail?
Behind the infants back{is} anon he knyt their noble hands,
And eke their heavy heads about he bound with purple bands:
There wanted there no Frankincense, nor yet the holy wine,
Nor knife to cut the sacrifice, besprinkt with leuens fine.
Kept is in all the order due, least such a mischief grette
Should not be ordered well.

who doth his hand on sword then set?

He is him self the priest, and he him self the dedly verse
With prayer dire from fervent mouth doth sing and oft rehearse.
And he at thaulters stand{is} him self, he them assygnde to die
Doth handle, and in order set, and to the knife apply,
He light{is} the fires, no rights were lefts of sacryfice undone.
The wood tken quakte, and all at ones from trembling ground anon
The Palace beckte, in doubt which way the payse thereof would fall,
And shaking as in waives it stood: from thayre and therewithal
A blasyng star that foulest train drew after him doth go:
The wynes that in the fires were cast, with changed licourfloe,
And turn to blood: and twyse or thryse that tyre fell from his head,
The Iucrie bright in Temples seemed to weep and tears to shed.
The sights amazed all other men, but steadfast yet always
Of mind, vnmoued Atreus stands, and even the gods doth fray
That threaten him, and all delay forsaken by and bye
To thaulters turns, and therewithal a side he looks awry.
As hungry tiger woonts that doth in gangey woods remain
With doubtful pace to range and roam between the bullocks twain,
Of either pray full covetous, and yet uncertain where
She first may bite, and roryng throat now turns the tone to tear
And then to ^hother straight returns, and doubtful famine holds:
So Atreus dire, between the babes doth stand and them beholds
On whom he points to slake his ire: first slaughter where to make,
He doubts: or whom he should again for second offering take,
Yet skylls it nought, but yet he doubts, and such a cruelty
It him deligths to order well.

Whom take he first to die?

First place, least in him think ye might no piete to remain
To grandsier dedicated is, first Tantalus is slain.

With what a mind and countnaunce, could the boy his death sustain?

All careless of him self he stood, nor once he would in vain
His prayers leese. But Atreus fierce the sword in him at last
In deep and deadly wound doth hide to hilts, and griping fast
His throat in hand, he thrust him through. The sword then drawn away
When long the body had upheld it self in doubtful staye,
Which way to fall, at length upon the uncle down it falls.
And then to thaulters cruelly Philisthenes he tralles,
And on his brother throws: and straygh^ his neck of cutteth he.
The carcase headlong falls to ground: apite^us thing to see,
The morning head, with murmure yet uncertain doth complain.

What after double death doth h^ and slaughter then of twain?
Spares he the child? or gilt on gilt again yet heaps he?

As long maend Lyon feerce amid the wood of Armenie,
The drove pursues and conquest makes of slaughter many one,
Though now defiled be his jaws with blood, and hunger gone
Yet slakes not his Ireful rage, with blood of bulls so great,
But slothful now, with weary tooth the lesser calves doth threat:
None other wise doth Atreus rage, and swells with anger straynde,
And holding now the sword in hand^ with double slaughter stained,
Regarding not where fell his rage, with cursed hand vnmilde
He struck it through his body quite: at bosom of the child
The blade gothe in, and at the back again out went the same.
He falls, and quenchyng with his blood the aulters sacred flame,
Of either wound at length he dies.

O heinous hateful act.

Abhor ye this? ye hear not yet the end of all the fact,
There follows more.

A fiercer thing, or worse then this to see
^ould nature bear?

why think ye thi^ of gilt the end to be?
It is but part.

what could he more? to cruel beast^ he cast
Perhaps their bodies to be torn, and kept from tyres at last.

Would god he had: that never tomb^ the dead might over hyde,
Nor flames dissolve, though them for food to fowls in pastures wide
He had out thrown, or them for pray to cruel beasts would flyng.
That which the worst was wont to be, were here a wished thing,
That them their father saw ^utombde, but oh more cursed crime
Uncredible, the which deny will men of after time:
From bosoms yet alive out drawn the trembling ^owells shake,
The veins yet breathe, the fearful heart doth yet both pant and quake:
But he the stryngs doth turn in h^nde, and destinies behold,
And of the guts the signs each one doth view no^ fully cold.
When h^ the sacrifice had pleased, his diligence he putts
To dress his brothers banquet now: and straight a s^onder cutts
The bodies into quarters all, and by the stoompes anon
The shoulders wide, and brawns of arms, he strikes of every ^hone.
He la^es abroad their naked lymms, and cutts away the bones:
The only heads he keeps, and hands to him committed ones.
Some of the gutt^ are broachte, and in the fires that burn full sloe
They drop: the boylyng liccout some doth tomble to and f^oe
In moornyng cawdern: from the fless^ that over stands (...)
The fire doth f^. and scatter out, and into chimney of^e
Up heaped again, and there (...) by force to ^ary yet
Unwillyng burns: the lyuet makes grea^ noise upon the spit,
Nor easily wot I, if the fless^, or flames they be that cry,
But cry they do: the fire like pitc^ it fumes by and by:
Nor yet the smoke it self so sad, like (...) mist in sight
Ascends up as wont it is, nor takes his way upright,
But even the Gods and house it doth with filthy fume defile.
O patient Phoebus though from henc^ thou backward flee the while,
And in the midst of heaven above dooste drown the broken day,
Thou fleeste to la^: the father eats his children well away,
And lymm{is} to which he onse gave life, with cursed jaw do^he tear^.
He shynes with ointment shed full sweet all round about his heate,
Replete with wine: and often times so cursed ^ynde of food
His mouth hath held that would not down^ but yet this one thing good
In all thy ylls (Thyestes) is, that them thou dooste not (...).
And yet shall that not long endure, though Titan backward go
^nd chariots turn against him self, to meet the ways he went,
And heavy night so heinous deed to keep from sight be sent,
And out of time from east arise, so foul a fact to hide,
Yet shall the whole at length be seen: thy ills shall all be spied.

Which way O prince of lands and gods on hie, at whose uprise eftsoon of
shadowde night
All beauty fleethe, which way turnst thou awry? and drawste y^ day in midst
of heaven to flight?
Why dooste thou (Phebus) hide from us thy sight? not yet the watch that later
howre bryng^ in,
Doth ^esper warn the stars to kindle light. not yet doth turn of Hespers
wheel begin
To loase thy chare his well deserved way. the Trumpet third not yet hath
blown his blast
While toward the night begins to ^elde the day. great wonder hath of sudden
suppers haste
The Ploweman, yet whose oxen are vntierde. from wonted course of heaven what
draws thee back?
What causes have from certain race conspi^de to turn thy horse? do yet from
dungeon black
Of hollow Hell, the conquered Giants prove a (...) assault? doth Tityus yet
assay
With trenched hart and wounded womb to move the former yres? or from the hill
away
Hath now Typhoeus wound his side by might? is up to heaven the way ^rected
hie
Of phlegrey ^oes by mountains set upright? and now doth Ossa Pelion ouerlie?
The wonted turns are gone of day and night. the rise of sun, nor fall shall be
no more.
Aurora dewysh mother of the light that woonts to send the horses out before,
Doth wonder much again returned to see her dawnyng light: she wott{is} not
how to ease
The weary wheels, nor manes that smokyng be of horse with sweat, to bathe
amid the seas.
Him self unwanted there to lodge likewise, doth setting Sun again the
morning see,
And now commands the darkness up to rise, before the night to come prepared
be.
About the poale yet glowthe no fire in sight: nor light of Moon the shades
doth comfort yet.
What so it be, God grant it be the night. our hart{is} do quake with fear
oppressed great,
And dredfull are least heaven and earth and all with ^atall ruin shaken shall
decay:
And least on gods again, and men shall fall disfigurde (...): and the land
away
The ^eas, and ^yres, and of the glorious (...) the wandering lamps, least
nature yet shall hide.
Now shall no more with blase of his uprise, the lord of stars that leads
the world so wide,
Of Summer both and winter give the marks. nor yet the Moon with (...) ^ames
that burns,
Shall take from us by night the dredfull carkes, with swyfter course or pass
her brothers turns,
While compass less she fetts in crooked race: the Gods on heaps shall out
of order fall
And each with other mingled be in place. the wr^ed way of holly planetts all,
With path a sloape that doth divide the Zones, that bears the signs and
years in course doth bryns,
Shall see the stars with him fall down at ones. and he that first not yet
with gentle spring,
The temper^te gale doth give to sails, the Ram shall he^long fall a down
to seas again,
Through which he once with ^atfull hellen swam. next him the Bull that
doth with horne sustain
The systers seven, with him shall ou^rturne the (...), and arms of crooked
cancer all.
The Lyon what, (that woonts the soil to burn) of Hercul^s, again from
heaven shall fall.
To lands once left the virgin shall be thrown, and leveled payse of balance
sway allow,
And drowe with them the styngyng Scorpion down. so likewyse he that holds in
Thassale bow
His swift well fethred arrows Chiron old, shall break the same and eke
shall leess his shot.
And Capricorne that brynges the winter cold shall overturn, and break thy
water pot
Who so thou be: and down with thee to ground, the last of all the signs
shall Pisces fall.
And monsters eke in seas yet never drounde, the water gulf shall over whelm
them all.
And he which doth between each Ursa glyde, like croaked flood, the slipper
serpent twynde:
And lesser Beat by greater Dragons side, full cold with frost congealed
harde by kind,
And carter dull that slowly guides his wayne, unstable shall boots fall
from hie,
We are thought meet of all men whom again, should hugy heap of Chaos over
lie,
And world oppress with over turned mas. the latest age now falls us upon.
With evil hap we are begot alas, if wretches we have lost the sight of
son,
Or him by fought enforced have to fly. let our complaints yet go, and fear
be past:
He greedy is of life, that will not die when all the world shall end with
him at last.
Now equal with the starr^ I go, beyond each other wight, with haugh^ie h^d
the heavens about, and highest Poa^ I smight.
The kingdom now ^eate I held, where once my father raynde.
I now let go the gods: for all my will I have obtained.
Enough and well, ye even enough for me I am a^quit.
But why enough? I will proceed, and fill the father yet
With blood of his: least any shame should me restrain at all,
The day is gone: go to therefore, wh^e thee the heaven doth call.
^o (...) god I could against their wills (...) hold the gods that flee,
^nd of revenging disshe, constrain them witnesses to be:
But yet (which well enough is wrought,) let it the father see.
In spite of all the drowned day, I will remove from thee
The darkness all, in shade whereof do luck^ thy miseries.
And guest at such a banquet now to long he careless lies,
With merry face: now eat and drunk enough he hath: at last
Tys best him self should know his ylls. ye servant all, in haste
Und^ the temple doors: and let the house be open all:
^ayne would I see, when look upon his childrens heads he shall
What countenance he then would make: or in what words break out
Would first his grief, or how would quake his body round about
With spright amassed sore: of all my work the fruit were this.
I would him not a miser see, but while so made he is.
Behold the temple opened now, doth shyne with many a light:
In gly^ryng gold and purple seats he sytt^ him self upright,
And staiyng up his heavy head with wine, upon his hand,

Why calste thou me ^backe, and hyndrest me this happy day to celebrate?

LEt us this day with one consen^ (o brother) celebrate.
This day my steptor^ may confyrme and stablyshe my estate,
And faythf^ll bond of peace and lo^e between us (...).
Enough with meat and eke with wine, now satysfyde am I.
But yet of all my joys it were (...) great increase to me,
If now abou^ my side I might my little children see.

Believe that here even in thine arme^ thy children present be.
For here they are, and shall be here, no part of them fro thee
Shall be withheld: their loved looke^ now give to the I will,
And with the heap of all his babes, the father fully fill.
Thou shalt be glutted, fear thou not: they with my boys as yet
The joyful sacrifyces make at board where children sit.
They shall be called: the friendly cup now take of courtesy
With wine vpfylde.

of brothers feast I take full wyllyngly
The final gyfte, shed some to god{is} of this our fathers land,
Then let the rest be droonke. what{is} thi^? in no wise will my hand
Obeye: the payse incre^seth sore, and down mine arm doth swaye.
And from my lypps the waftyng wynt it self doth fi^e away,
And in deceived mouth, about my jaws it runs round:
The table to, it self doth shake, and leap from trembling ground.
Scant burns the fire: the air it self with heavy ^here to sight
Forsook of sun amassed is between the day and night.
What means this? yet more and more of backward beaten sky
The compass falls: and thicker mist the world doth ouerlye
Then blackest darkness, and the night in night it self doth hyde.
^ll stars be fled: what so it be, my brother god provide
And soons to spare: the god{is} so grant that all this tempest fall
On this vile head. but now restore to me my children all.

I will, and never day again shall them from the withdraw.

What tu^ulte tumbles so my gut{is}, and doth my bowels gnaw?
What quakes within? with heavy payse I feel my self oppressed,
And with an other voice then mine ^wayles my dole^ull breast.
Come near my soons, for you now doth th'unhappie father call:
Come near, for you once seen, this grief would soon assuage and fall.
Whence murmure they?

with fathers ^rmes embrace them quickly now,
For here they are lo come to thee: dooste thou thy children know?

I know my brother: such a gilt yet can thou suffer well
o earth to bear? nor yet from hens to Stygian lake of hell
Dooste thou both drown thy self and us? nor yet with broken ground
Dooste thou these kingdoms and their king with Chaos rude confound?
Nor yet vprentyng from the soil the bowers of wicked land
Dooste thou Mycenas overturn? with Tantalus to stand,
And auncyters of ours, if there in hell be any one,
Now ought we both. now from the frames on either side anon
Of ground, all here and there rent up, out of thy bosom deep
Thy dens and dungeons set abroad, and us enclosed keep,
In botome lowe of Acheront: above our head{is} aloft
Let wander all the gyltie ghosts, with burning fret full oft
Let fyry Phlegethon that dryues his sands both to and fro,
To our confusion ouetroon, and violently floe.
O slothful soil unshaken payse, vnmoued yet art thou?
The god{is} are fled.

but take to thee with joy thy children now,
And rather them embrace: at length thy children all, of thee
So long wy^ for, (for no delay there stands now in me,)
Enjoy and kiss, embracing arms deuyde thou unto three.

Is this thy league? may this thy lous and faith of brother be?
And dooste thou so repose thy hate? the father doth not crave
His soons alive (which might have been without the gilt,) to have:
And eke without thy hate, but this doth brother brother pray:
That them he may ent^mbe, restore, whom see thou shalt straight way
Be burnt: the father nought requyres, of the that have he shall,
But soon forgo.

what ever part yet of thy children all
Remaynes, he^e shalt thou have: and what remains not, thou haste.

Lye they in fields, a food out flung for fleeing fowls to waste?
Or are they kept a pray, for wild and brutyshe beasts to eat?

Thou hast deuou^de thy soons, and fyld^ thy self with wick^d meat.

Oh this is it that shamde the godd{is}: and day from hens did drive
Turned back to east. alas I wretch what waylynges may I give?
Or what complaints? what woeful words may be enough for me?
The^r heads cu^e of, and hands of torn, I from the^r bodies see,
And wrenched fe^te from broken thyghe^, I here behold again.
^ys this that greedy father could not suffer to sustain.
In belly roll my ^owels round, and closed crime so great
Without a passage stryues within, and seeks away to get.
Thy sword (o brother) lend to me: much of my blood alas
It has: let us therewith make way for all my soons to pas.
Is yet the sword fro me withheld? thy self thy bosoms tear.
And let thy breasts resound with strokes: yet wretch thy hand forbear,
And spare the dead. who ever saw such mischief put in proof?
What rude Heniochus, that dwells by ragged coast aloof,
Of Caucasus unapt for men? or frare to Athens, who
Procustes wild? the father I oppress my children do
And am oppressed, is any means of gilt or mischief yet?

A mean in myschiefe ought to be, when gilt thou dooste commit,
Not when thou quytst: for yet even this, to little seems to me.
The blood yet warm even from the wound I should in sight of thee
Even in thy saws have shed, that thou the blood of them might drink
That lived yet: but while to much to haste my hate I think,
My wrath beguiled is. my self with sword the wounds them gave,
I struck them down, the sacred fires with slaugh^er vowed I have
Well pleased, the carcase cutting th^ and lyutles lymms on ground
I have in little parcels chopped, and some of them I drowned
In boylyng cawderns, some to ^yres that burnt full slow I put,
And made to drop: their synewes all and lymms atoo I cut
Even yet alive, and on the spit that thrust was through the same
I harde the liver whale and cr^e, and with my hand the flame
I oft kept in: but every wh^ the father might of this
Have better done, but now my wrath to lightly ended is.
He rent his soons with wicked gum, him self yet wotyng nought,
Nor they thereof.

o ye, encloa^ with bending banks abought
All seas me hear, and to this (...) ye gods now harken well
What ever pla^ ye fl^dde are to: ^eare all ye sprights of hell,
^nd here ye lands, and night so (...), that them dooste ouerlye
With cloud so black, to my complaints do thou thy self apply.
To thee now left I am, thou dooste alone me miser see,
And thou art left without thy startes: I will nut make for me
P^ions yet. nor ought for me r^quyre, may ought yet be
That me should veil? for you shall all my wyshes now fo^esee.
Thou guyder great of skies above, and prince of highest might,
Of he (...) place, now all with clouds full hortible to sight,
Enwrappe the world, and let the wyndes on every syd^ break out,
And send the dredfull thunder clap, through all the world about.
Not with what hand thou gyltles hous^ and undeserved wall
With lesser volte art wont to beat, but with the which did fall
The three vpheaped mountains once, and (...) to hylls in height
Stood equal up, the ^yant{is} huge: throweout such weapons straight,
^nd flyng thy ^yres, and therewithal revenge the drowned day.
^et flee thy flames, the light thus lost and hyd from heaven away,
With flashes fill: the cause, (least long thou should douts whom to hit,)
Of each of us is ill: if not at least let mine be it,
Me stryke: with triple edged soole thy brand of flaming fire
Beat through this breast: if father I my children do desire
To lay in tomb, or corpses cast to fire as doth be hove,
I must be burnt: i^ nothing now the gods to wrath (...) move,
Nor power from skies with thunder bolt none strykes the wyched men.
Let yet eternal night remain, and hyde with darkness then
The world about: I (Titan) nought complain, as now it stands,
If still thou hyde thee thus away.

now praise I well my hands,
Now got I have the palm: I had been overcome of thee,
Except thou sorowdst so: but now even children borne to me
I count, and now of brydebed cha^e the faith I do repeat.

In what offended have my soons?

In that, that thine they wear.

Set thou the soons for fathers food?

I do, and (which is best)
The certain soons.

the gods that guide a ^infantes, I protest.

what wedlock god{is}?

who would the gilt with gilt so ^yght again?

I know thy grief prevented now with wrong, thou dooste complain:
Nor this thee yrkes, that fed thou art with food of cursed kind,
But that thou had not it prepared: for so it was thy mind,
Such meates as these to ^ette before thy brother wo^yng nought,
And by the mothers help, to have likewise my children caught,
And them with such like death to slay: this one thing l^tted thee,
Thou thoughtst them thine.

the gods shall all of this reuenge^s be:
^nd unto them for vengeance due, my vows thee render shall.

But vexed to be I thee the while, ^eeue to thy children all.

O King of Dytis dungeon dark, and grisly ghosts of hell,
That in the deep and dredfull denns, of blackest Tartare dwell,
Where lean and pale diseases lye where fear and famine are,
Where discord stands with bleedyng brows, where every kind of care,
Where furies fight in beds of steel, and hears of crallyng snakes,
Where Gorgon grymme, where Harpies are, and loathsome Lymbo lakes,
Where most prodigious ugly things, the hollow hell doth hyde,
If yet a monster more myschapte then all that there do bide,
That makes his brood his cursed food, ye all abhor to see,
Nor yet the deep Auerne it self, may bide to cover me,
Nor grisly gates of Plutoes place, yet dare them selves to spread,
Nor gaping ground to swallow him, whom gods and day have fled:
Yet break ye out from cursed seats, and here remain with me,
Ye need not now to be afraid, the air and heaven to se.
Nor triple headid Cerberus, thou need not be affright,
The day unknown to thee to see, or else the loathsome light.
They both be fled: and now doth dwell none oth^r countnaunce here,
Then doth beneathe the foulest face, of hateful hell appear.
Come see a meetest match for thee, a more then monstrous womb,
That is of his unhappy brood, become a cursed tomb.
Flock here ye foulest feendes of hell, and thou O grandsier great,
Come see the glutted guts of mine, with such a kind of meat,
As thou did once for gods prepare let torments all of hell
Now fall upon this hateful head, that has deserude them well.
Ye all be plagued wrongfully, your gylts be small, in sight
Of mine, and meet it were your pangs on me alone should light.
Now thou O grandsier giltles art, and meeter were for me,
With fleeing flood to be beguiled, and fruit of fickle tree.
Thou slewst thy son, but I my sons, alas have made my meat.
I could thy famine better bear, my panche is now replete
With food: and with my children three, my belly is extent.
O filthy fowls and gnawyng gripes, that Tityus bosom reut
Behold a fitter pray for you, to fill your selves vppone
Then are the growing guts of him: four wombs enwrapt in one.
This panche at ones shall fill you all: yfye abhor the food,
Nor may your selves abide to bathe, in such a cursed blood:
Yet lend to me your clinchyng claws, your pray a while forbear,
And with your tallons suffer me, this monstrous maw to tear.
Or whirling wheels, with swing of which
Ixion still is rolde, Your hooks upon this glutted gorge, would catch a
surer hold.
Thou filthy flood of Lymb^ lake, and Stygian poole so dire,
From choked channel belch abroad. thou ferfull freate of fire,
Spue out thy flames O Phlegethon: and over shed the ground.
With vomit of thy fyrye stream, let me and earth be drowned.
Break up thou soil from botome deep, and give thou room to hell,
That night, where day, that ghosts, were gods were wont to reign, may dwell.
Why gapste thou not? Why do you not O gates of hell unfold?
Why do ye thus thynfernall feendes, so long from hens withhold?
Are you likewyse afraid to see, and know so wretched wight,
From whom the gods have wryde their looks, and turned are to flight?
O hateful head, whom heaven and hell, have shoonde and left alone,
The Sun, the Starts, the light, the day, the Gods, the ghosts be gone.
Yet turn again ye Skies a while, ere quite ye go fro me,
Take vengeance first on him, whose fault enforces you to f^.
If needs ye must yo^ flight prepare, and may no lenget bide,
But roll ye must with you forth with, the Gods and Sun a side,
Yet slowly flee: that I at length, may you yet overtake,
While wandering ways I after you, and speedy journey make.
By seas, by lands, by woods, by rock{is}, in dark I wander shall:
And on your wrath, for right reward^ to due deserts, will call. ye escape not
fro me so ye Gods, still after you I go,
And vengeance ask on wicked wight, your thunder bolt to throe.
