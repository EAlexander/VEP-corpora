Have in a ruffler forth of the greek land
Called Thersites, if ye will me know
aback, give me room, in my way do ye not stand
For if ye do, I will soon lay you lowe
In Homere of my acts ye have red I trow
Neither Agamenon nor Ulysses, I spared to check
They could not bring me to be at their beck
Of late frome the sege of Troye I returned
Where all my harnes except this club I lost
In an old house there it was quyte burned
While I was preparing vytayles for the host
I must needs get me new, what so euerit cost
I Will go seek adventures, for I cannot be idle
I will hamper some of the knaves in a bridle
It grieves me to hear howe the knaves do brag
But by supreme Iupiter, when I am harnessed well
I shall make the dasters to run in to a bag
To hyde them fro me, as from the devil of hell
I doubt not but hereafter, of me ye shall hear tell
Howe I have made the knaves for to play couch quail
But now to the shop of Mulciber, to go I will not fail
Mulciber must have a shop made in the place and
Thersites comethe before it saying a loud
Mulciber, whom the Poets doth call the god of fire
Smith unto Iupiter king over all
Come forth, of thy office I the desire
and grant me my petiction, I ask a thing but small
I will none of thy lightning, that thou art wont to make
for the gods supernal for ire when they do shake
With which they thrust the gyauntes down to hell
That were at a conuention heaven to bye and sell
But I would have some help of Lemnos and Ilua
That of their steal, by thy craft, condatur nuhi galea.
What fellow Thersites, do ye speak latin now?
Nay, then farewell, I make god a vow
I do not you understand, no latin is in my pallet
And then he must do as he would go away.

I say abide good Mulciber, I pray you make me a sallet

Why Thersites hast thou any wit in thy head?
Would thou have a sallet now, all the herbs are dead
Beside that it is not mete for a smyth
To gether herbs and sallettes to meddle with
Go get the to my lover venus
She hath sallettes enough for all us
I eat none such sallettes for now I wax old
and for my stomach they are very could

Now I pray to Iupiter that thou dye a cuckold
I mean a sallet with which men do fight

It is a small tastinge of a man might
That he should for any matter
Fight with a few herbs in a platter
No great laud should follow that victory

Gods passion Mulciber where is thy wit memory
I would have a sallet made of steal

Why sir* in your stomach lunge you shall it feel
For steal is harde for to digest

Mans bones and sides he is worse then a be
I would have a sallet to were on my head
Which under my chyn with a thonge red
Buckeled shall be
Doest thou yet parceyue me

your mind now I se
Why thou peuysshe lad
Art thou almost mad
Or well in thy wit
Get the a wallette
Would thou have a sallette
What would thou do with it

I pray the good Mulciber make no mo bones
But let me have a sallet made at ones.

I must do somewhat for this knave
What manner of fallet sir would ye have.

I wold have such a one that another might nor mayne
should perse it thorough, or part it in twain
Which another gonst one, nor sharpe spear
Should be able other to hurt or tear
I would have it also for to save my head
if Iupiter him self would have me dead
And if he in a fume, would cast at me his fire
This sallet I would have to keep me from his ire.

I perceive your mind.
ye shall find me kind
I will for you prepare
Here Thersites do this sallet wear
And on thy head it bear
And none shall work the care

Now would I not fear with any bull to fight
Or with a raumpinge lyon another by day nor night
O What great strength is in my body so lusty
Which for lack of exercise, is now almost rustye
Hercules in comparison to me was but a boy
When the bandogge Cerberus from hell he bare away
When he killed the lyons, hydra, and the bear so wild
Compare him to me and he was but a child
Why Sampson I say, hast thou no more wit
would you be as strong as I? come suck thy mothers tytte
Wene you that Dauid that little eluyshe boy
Should with his slinge have take my life away
Nay ywys Golyath, for all his five stones
I would have quashed his little boysshe bones
O howe it would do my heart much good
To se some of the giant before Noes flood
I would make the knaves to cryecreke
Or else with my club their brains I will break
But Mulciber, yet I have not with the do
My head is armed, my neck I would have to
And also my shoulders with some good habergyn
That the devil if he shot at me could not enter in
For I am determined great battle to make
Except my fumishenes, by some means may assake.

Bokell on this habergyn as fast as thou canne
And fear for the metinge of another beast nor manne
if it were possible for one too shot an oak
This habergyn will defend thee frome the stroke
Let them throw mylstones at the as thick as hail
yet the to kill they shall their purpose fail
if Maluerue hills should on thy shoulders light
They shall not hurt the, nor suppress thy might
If Beues of Hampton, Colburne and Guy
Will the assay, set not by them a fly
To be brief, this habergyn shall the save
Both by land and water, now play the lusty knave

When I consider my shoulders that so broad be
When the other parts of my body I do behold
I verily think that none in chrystente
With me to medele dare be so bold
Now have at the lyons on cotsolde
I will neither spare for heate nor for cold
Where art thou king Arthur, the knights of the round table
Come, bring forth your horses out of the stable
Lo with me to mete they be not able
By the mass they had rather were a babble
Where art thou Gawyn the curtesse and Cay the crabed
Here be a couple of knights cowardishe and scabbed
Appear in thy likeness sir Libeus disconius
If thou wilt have my club lyghte onthy hedibus
Lo ye may see he hears not the face
With me to try a blow in this place
Howe syrray, approthe sir Launcelot de lake
What? run ye away and for fear quake
Now he that did the a knight make
Thought never that thou any battle shouldest take
if you wilt not come thy self, some other of thy fellows send
To battle I provoke them, them self let them defend
To, for all the good that ever they se
They will not ones set hand to fight with me
O good lord howe broad is my breast
And strong with all for hole is my chest
He that should meddle with me shall have shrewd rest
Behold you my hands, my legs and my feet
Every part is strong proportionable and mete
Think you that I am not feared in field and street
Yes yes god wot, they give me the wall
Or else with my club, I make them to fall
Back knaves I say to them, then for fear they quake
And take me then to the tavern and good chere me make
The proctor and his men I made to run their ways
And some went to hide them in broken hays
I tell you at a word
I set not a torde
By none of them al
Early and late I will walk
And London streets stalk
Spyte of them great and small
For I think verily
That none in heaven so hye
Nor yet in hell so lowe
While I have this club in my hand
Can be able me to withstand
Or me to overthrow
But Mulciber, yet I must the desire
To make me briggen irons for mine arms
And then I will love the as mine own sire
For without them, I can not be safe frome all harms
Those once had, I will not set a straw
by all the world, for then I will by awe
Have all my mind, or else by the holy rood
I will make them think, the devil carries them to the wood
if no man will with me battle take
A voyage to hell quickly I will make.
And there I will beat the devil and his dame
And bring the souls away, I fully entende the same
After that in hell I have ruffled so
Sreyghte to old purgatory will I go
I will clean that so purge round about
That we shall need no pardons to help them out
if I have not fight enough this ways
I will climb to heaven and fet away Peters kayes
I will keep them my self, and let in a great route
What should such a fysher keep good fellows out

Have here Thersites briggen irons bright
and fear thou no man manly to fight
Though he be stronger then Hercules or Sampson
Be thou pressed and bold to set him upon
Another Amazon nor xerxes with their hole rabble
the to assail shall find it profytable
I warrant the they will fl fro thy face
as doth an Hare from the dogs in a chase
Would not thy black and rustye grym berde
Now thou art so armed, make any man aferde
Surely if Iupiter did see the in this ger
He would run away and hyde him for fear
He wold think that Typhoeus the giant were alive
And his brother Enceladus, again with him to strive
If that Mars of battle the god stout and bold
In this array should chance the to behold
He would yield up his sword unto the
And god of battle (he would say) thou shouldest be
Now fare thou well go the world through
And seek aduenturus thou art man good enough.

Mulciber, while the stars shall shyne in the sky
And Phaetons horses with the sons charret shall fly
While the morning shall go before none
And cause the darkennesse to vanysshe away soon
While that the cat shall love well milk
And while that women shalloue to go in sylke
While beggars have lice
And cockneys are nice
While pardoners can lye
Merchants can by
And children cry
While all these last and more
Which I keep in store
I do me faithfully bind
Thy kyndnes to bear in mind
but yet Mulciber one thing I ask more
Haste thou ever a sword now in store?
I would have such a one that would cut stones
And pare a great oak down at once
That were a sword lo, even for the nones.

Truly I have such a one in my shop
that will pare iron as it were a rope
have, here it is, gyrde it to thy side
Now fare thou well, Iupiter be thy guide

Gramercy Mulciber with my hole heart
Give me thy hand and let us depart
Now I go hence, and put my self in press
I will seek adventures, yea and that I will not cease
If there be any present here this night
that will take upon them with me to fight
Let them come quickly, and the battle shall be pyghte
Where is Cacus that knave? not worth a groat
that was wont to blow clouds out of his throat
Which stale Hercules kine and hyd them in his cave
Come hither Cacus, thou lubber and false knave
I will teach all wretches by the to beware
If thou come hither I trappe the in a snare
thou shalt have knocked bread and ill fare
how say you good godfather that loke so stale
ye seem a man to be borne in the vale
Dare ye adventure with me a stripe or two
Go coward go hide the as thou wast wont to do
What a sort of dasterdes have we here
None of you to battle with me dare appear
What say you hart of gold, of countenance so demure?
Will you fight with me? no, I am right sure
Fie blusshe not woman, I will do you no harm
Except I had you sooner to keep my back warm
Alas little pums why are ye so sore afraid?
I pray you show how lunge it is? sense ye were a maid
Tell me in mine ear, sirs, she has me told
That gone was her mydenhead, at thrustene year old
Byr lady she was loathe to keep it to lunge
And I were a maid again, now may be here songe
Do after my connsel of maidens the whole beuye
Quickly red your maydehed, for they are vegeauce heavy
Well, let all go, why? will none come in
With me to fight that I may pare his skyn

What say you my son will ye fight? god it defend
For what cause to war do you now pretend
Will ye commit to battayles dangerous
your life that is to me so precious.

I will go, I will go. stop not my way
Hold me not good mother I heartily you pray
If there be any lyons, or other wild be
That will not suffer the husband man in rest
I will go seeche them and bid them to afeest
They shall aby bitterly the coming of such a gest
I will search for them both in busshe and shrubbe
And lay on a lode with this lusty club

O my sweet son, I am thy mother
Will thou kill me and thou hast none other

No mother no, I am not of such iniquity
That I will defile my hands upon the.
But be content mother, for I will not rest
Till I have fought with some man or wild beast
Truly my son if that ye take this way
This shall be the conclusion, mark what I shall say
Other I will drown my self for sorrow
And fed fyshes with my body before to morrow
Or with a sharpe sword, surely I will me kill
Now thou may save me, if it be thy will
I will also cut my paps away
That gave the suck so many a day
And so in all the world it shall be known
That by my own son I was overthrown
Therefore if my life be to the pleasant
That which I desire good son do me grant

Mother thou spend thy wind but in wast
The gods of battle her fury on me hath cast
I am fully fixed battle for to taste
O how many to death I shall drive in haste
I will ruffle this club about my head
Or else I pray god I never dye in my bed
There shall never a stroke be stricken with my hand
But they shall think yt Iupiter doth thonder in ye land

My own sweet son I knelynge on my knee
And both my hands holding up to the
Desire the to cease and no battle make
Call to the patience and Better ways take

Tusshe mother, I am deaf I will the not hear
No no, if Iupiter here him self now were
And all the gods, and Iuno his wife
And loving Minerua that abhors all strife
if all these I say, would desire me to be content
They did their wind but in vain spent
I will have battle in wayles or in kente
and some of the kuaues I will all to rent
where is the valiant knight sir Isenbrase?
Appear sir I pray you, dare ye not show your face
where is Robin Iohn and little hod
approach hither quickly if ye think it good
I will teach such outlaws with Chrystes curses
How they take hereafter away abbottes purses
why will no adventure appear in this place
where is Hercules with his great maze
where is Buspris, that fed his horses
Full like a tyrant, with dead men's corses
Come any of you both
And I make an other
That yer I eat any bread
I will drive a wayne
ye for need twain
Between your body and your head
Thus passes my brains
will none take the pains
To try with me a blow?
O what a fellow am I
whom every man doth fly
That doth me but once know

Son all do you fear
That be present here
They will not with you fight
you, as you be worthy
Have now the victory
without tastynge of your might
Here is none I trow
that proffers you a blow
Man woman nor child
Do not set your mind
To fight with the wind
be not so mad nor wild

I say arise who so ever will fight
I am to battle here ready dyghte
Come hither other swain or knight
Let me see who dare present him to my syghte
Here with my club ready I stand
if any will come to take them in hand

There is no hope left in my breast
To bring my son unto better rest
He will do nothing at my request
He regards me no more the a best
I see no remedy, but styll I will pray
To god, my son to gyde in his way
That he may have a prasperous iournynge
And to be save at his returning
Son, god above grant this my oration
That when in battle thou shalt have concertacion
with your ennemies, other fare or ne'er
No wound in them nor in you may appear
So that ye another kill nor be killed

Mother thy petition I pray god be fulfilled
For then no knaves blood shall be spilled
Fellows keep my counsel, by the mass I do but crake
I will be gentle enough and no busenesse make
But yet I will make her believe that I am a man
think you that I will fight? no no but with the can
Except I find my enemy on this wise
that he be a sleep or else can not arise
If his arms and his fete be not fast bound
I will not profer a stripe for a thousand pound
Fare well mother and tarry here no longer
For after proves of chivalry I do both thyrste honger
I will hear the knaves as flat as a conger
What how long shall I tarry? be your hearts in your hose
will there none of you in battayl me appose
Come prove me why stand you so in doubt
have you any wild blood, that ye would have let out
A lack that a mans strength can not be knwen
Because that he lacks ennemies to be ouerthowen
But what a monster do I see now
Coming hetherwarde with an armed brow
what is it? ah it is a sow
No by gods body it is but a grestle
And on the back it hath never a brystle
It is not a cow, ah there I fail
For then it should have a long tail.
What the devil I was blind, it is but a snail
I was never so afraid in east nor in south
My heart at the first sight was at my mouth
Mary sir fie, fie, fie, I do sweat for fear
I thought I had craked but to timely here
Hens thou be and pluck in thy horns
Or I swear by him that crowned was with thorns
I will make the drink worse than good ale in yt corns
Haste thou nothing else to do
But come with horns and face me so
Howe, how my servants, get you shield and sphere
And let us weary and kill this monster here

Is not this a worthy knight
that with a snail dares not fight
Except he have his servants aid
Is this the chaumpyon that makes al me afraid
I am a pore soldier come of late fro Calice
I trust or I go to debate some of his malice
I will tarry my time tell I do see
Betwixt him and the snail what the end will be

Why ye horeson knauys, regard ye not my calling
why do ye not come and with you weapons bring
why shall this monster so escape kyllinge
No that he shall not and god be willing

I promise you, this is as worthy a knight
as ever shall breed out of a bottle byte
I think he be Dares of whom Uirgyll doth write
That would not let entellus alone
But ever provoked and ever called on
But yet at the last he took a fall
And so within a while, I trow I make the shall

By Gods passion knaves, if I come I will you fetter
Regard ye my calling and crying no better
why horesons I say, will ye not come
By the mass the knaves be all from home
They had better have fette me an etrande at Rome

By my troth, I think that very scant
This lubber dare adventure to fight with an ant

Well saying my servants come to me will not
I must take heed that this monster me spyll not
I will ioparde with it a joint
And other with my club or my sweardes point
I will reche it such wounds
As I would not have for. xl. M. pounds
Pluck in thy horns thou unhappy beast
what facest thou me? wilt not thou be in rest
Why? will not thou thy horns in hold
Think thou that I am a cocklode
Gods arms the monster comes toward me styll
Except I fight manfully, it will me surely kill

O Iupiter Lord doest thou not see and hear
How he fears the snail as it were a bear

Well with my club I have had good-lucke
Now with my sword have at the a pluck
I will make the or I go, for to duck
And thou were as tale a man as friar suck
I say yet again thy horns in draw
Or else I will make the to have wounds raw
Art not thou a ferde
To have thy beard
Pared with my swore
Ah well, now no more
Thou might have done so before
I laid at it so sore
That it thought it should have be lore
And it had not drawn in his horns again
Surely I would the monstet have slain
But now farewell, I will work the no more payne
Now my fume is paste
And doth no longer last
That I did to the monster cast
Now in other countries both far and near
Mo deeds of chyualtye I will go inquere

Thou needs not seek any further for ready I am here
I will debate anon I trow thy bragginge chere

Now where is any mo that will me assail
I will turn him and toss him both top and tail
if he be stronger then Sampson was
who with his bare hands kylde lyons apas

What needs this booste? I am here at hand
That with the will fight keep the head and stand
Surely for al thy hye words I will not fear
To assay the a towche till some blood appear
I will give the somewhat for the gift of a new year

O mother mother I pray the me hyde
Throw some thing over me and cover me every side

O my son what thing eldyth the?

Mother a thousand horsemen do persecute me

Mary son then it was time to fly
I blame the not then, though afraid thou be
A deadly wound thou might there soon catch
One against so many, is no indyfferente match

No mother but if they had bent but ten to one
I would not have avoided but set them upon
But saying they be so many I ran away
Hyde me mother hyde me, I heartily the pray
For if they come hither and here me find
To their horses tails they will me bind
And after that fasshyon hall me and kill me
And though I were never so bold and stout
To fight against so many, I should stand in doubt

Thou that doest seek giant to conquer
Come forth if thou dare, and in this place appear
Fie for shame doest thou so soon take flight
Come forth and show somewhat of thy might

Hyde me mother, hyde me, and never word say

Thou old trot, seyst thou any man come this way
well armed and weaponed and ready to fight

No forsothe Master, there came none in my sight

He did avoid in time, for without doubts
I would have set on his back some clowtes
Yt I may take him I will make all slowches
To beware by him, that they come not in my clowches

Come forth my son, your enemy is gone
Be not afraid for hurt thou can have none

ywys thou did wisely who so ever thou be
To tarry no longer to fight with me
For with my club I would have broken thy skull
if thou were as big as Hercules bull
why thou cowardely knave, no stronger then a duck
Dare thou try maystries with me a pluck
which fere another giant nor Iupiters fire bolt
Nor Beelzebub the master devil as ragged as a colt
I would thou would come hither ones again
I think thou had rather alive to be flayne
Come again and I swear by my mothers womb
I will pull the in pieces no more then my thombe
and thy brains abroad, I will so scatter
That all knaves shall fear, against me to clatter
what? little Telemachus
what make thou here among us?

Sir my father Ulysses doth him commend
To you most heartily, here he hath you send
Of his mind a letter
which show you better
Every thing shall
Then I can make rehearsal

Lo friends ye may see
what great men write to me
As entyrely as heart can thyncke
Or scryuener can write with yucke
I send you loving gretynge
Thersytes mine own swetynge
I am very sorry
when I cast in memory
The great vnkyndnes
And also the blyndnes
That hath be in my breast
Against you ever pressed
I have be prompt and dylygent
Ever to make you shent
To appal your good name
And To mynysshe your fame
In that I was to blame
But well al this is gone
And remedy there is none
But only repentance
Of all my old greuaunce
with which I did you molest
And gave you sorry reast
The cause was thereof truly
Nothing but very envy
wherefore now gentle esquier
Forgive me I you desire
And help I you beseech
Telemachus to a leche
That him may wyselye charm
From the worms that do him harm
In that ye may do me pleasure
For he is my chyefe treasure
I have heard men say
That come by the way
That better charmer is no other
then is your own dear mother
I pray you of her obtain
To charm away his pain
Fare ye well, and come to my house
To dryncke wine and eat a piece of sows
And we will have minstrelsy
that shall pipe hankyn boby
My wife penelobe
Doth great you well by me
wrytinge at my house on Candelmasse day
Mydsomer month, the calenders of may
By me Ulissed being very glad
That the victory of late of the monster ye had
Ah syrraye quod he? how say you friends all
Ulisses is glad for my favour to call
well, though we oft have swerued
And he small love deserved
Yet I am well content
Saying he doth repent
To let old matters go
And to take him no more so
As I have do hither to
For my mortal fo
Come go with me Telemachus, I will the bring
Unto my mother to have her cherminge
I doubt not, but by that time that she has done
Thou shalt be the better seven years agone
Mother Christ thee save and see
Ulysses has send his son to thee
That thou shouldest him charm
From the worms that him harm

Son ye be wife keep ye warm
why should I for Ulysses do
That never was kind us to
He was ready in war
Ever the, son, to mar
Then had been all my joy
Exiled cleave away

Well mother all that is past
Wroth may not always last
And saying we be mortal all
Let not our wroth be immortal

Charm that charm will, he shall not be charmed of me

Charm or by the mass with my club I will charm the

why son art thou so wicked to beat thy mother

ye that I will, by gods dear brother
Charm old witche in the devils name
Or I will send the to him, to be his dame

Alas what a son have I
That thus doth order me spitefullye
Cursed be the time that ever I him fed
I would in my belly he had be dead

Cursest thou old whore? bless me again
Or I will bless the, that shall be to thy payne

He will kill me
He will spyll me
He will brose me
He will lose me
He will prick me
He will stycke me

The devil stycke the old wytherde witch
For I will stick another the, nor none such.
But come of give me thy blessing again
I say let me have it, or else certain
With my club I will lay the on the brain

Well saying thou threaten to me affliction
Spite of my heart have now my benediction
Now christ's sweet blessing and mine
Light above and beneath the body of thine
And I beseech with all my devotion
That thou may come to A mans promotion
He that forgive Mary Mawdalene her sin
Make the highest of all thy kin

In this words is double intellimente
Would thou have me hanged mother veramente

No son no, but too have you hye
In promotion, is my mind verelye

Well then mother let all this goo
and charm this child that you is send to
and loke hereafter to curse ye be not gredye
Curse me no more, I am cursed enough all ready

Well son I will curse you no more
Except ye provoke me to to sore
But I marvel why ye do me move
To do for Ulisses that doth not us love

Mother by his son he has send me a letter
Promising heareafter to be to us better
And you and I with my great club
Must walk to him and eat a solybubbe
and we shall make merry
and singe tyrle on the berye
With Simkyn sydnam somner

Proud perts pykethancke, that pykid pernels purse

Rough Robyn rover rufflinge in right rate

Mercolfe mouylts moreninge for mad Mary

Hop will with holy hockes harken humfreys harp
It is to to mother the pastime and good chere
That we shall see and have, when that we come there
Wherefore gentle mother I the heartily pray
That thou will charm for worms this pretty boy

Well son, saying the case and matter stands so
I am content all thy request to do
Come hither pretty child
I will the charm frome the worms wild
but first do thou me thy name tell

I am called Telemachus there as I dwell

Telemachus lye down upright on the ground
And stir not ones for a thousand pound

I am ready here pressed
To do all your request

The cowherd of Comertowne with his crooked spade
Cause frome the, the worms soon to vade
And iolye Jack iumbler that iuggleth with a horne
Grant that thy worms soon be all to torn
Good graundsyre Abraham godmother to Eve
Grant that this worms no longer this child grieve
All the court of conscience in cockoldst yres

Tyttyfylles, tryfullers, turners and trumpers
Tempters, traitors, travailers and thumpers
Thryftlesse, theuyshe, thycke and thereto thynne

The virtue of the tail of Isaackes cow
That before Adam in paradyse did lowe
Also the ioyste of Moses rod
In the mount of caluarye that spake with God
Facie ad faciem, turning tail to tail
Cause all these worms quickly to fail
The bottom of the ship of No
And also the leg of ye horse of Troe
The piece of the tongue of Balaams ass
the chawbone of the Ox that at Christ's birth was
the eye to the of the dog that went on pylgremage
with yonge Thobye, these worms soon may swag
the butterfly of Bromemycham yt was borne blind
The blast of the bottle that blowed Aelous wind
The buttock of the bitter bought at Buckyngame
the body of the bear that with Beuis came
the backster of Balockburye with her bakinge pele
Child fro thy worms I pray, may soon the heal
The tapper of tauyestocke and the tapsters pot
The tothe of the tytmus, the torde of the got
In the tower of tenysballes tostyd by the fire
the table of Tantalus turned trym in mire
yt tomb of Tom threadbare yt thrusle tyb through yt smock
Make al thy worms child, to come forth at thy dock
Sem Cam and Iaphat and coll the myllars mare
the five stones of Dauyd: that made goliath stare
the wing with which seit Mychaell did fly to his mout
the counters wherewith cherubyn, did cheristones count
The hawke with which Issuerus kylde she wild bore
Help that these worms my child, hurt the no more
the maw of the morecocke that made mawd to mow
when martylmas at moreton morened for the snow
the sphere of spanysshe spylbery sprente with spiteful spots
the lights of the lauerocke laid at London lots
the shynbon of saint Samuell shyninge so as the sun
Grant child of the worms that soon thy pains be don
Mother bryce of oxforde and great Gyb of hynxey
Also mawde of thrutton and mable of chartesey
And all other wytches that walk in dymminges dale
Clytteringe and clattering there your pots with ale
Incline your ears, and hear this my petition
and grant this child, of health to have fruition
the blessing that Iorden to his Godsonne gave
Light on my child and from the worms him save
Now stand up little Telemachus anon
I warrant the by to morrow, thy worms will be gone

I thank you mother in my most heartily wise
will ye sir to my father command me any service

No pretty boy, but do thou us two commend
to thy father and mother, tell them that we entende
Both my mother and I
to see them shortelye

Ye shall be heartily welcome to them I dare well say
Fare ye well, by your leave, now I will depart away

Son, give me thy hand, fare well

I pray god keep the from apparel
Ywys it is a proper child
and in behaviour nothing wild
Ye may see what is good education
I would every man after this fashion
Had their children up brought
then many of them would not have been so nonghte
A child is better unborn then vntaughte

Ye say truth mother, well let all this go
and make you ready Ulisses to go to
with me anon, be ye so content

I am well pleased to your will I assent
For all though that I love him but very evil
It is good to set a candle before the devil
Of most part of great men I swear by this fire
Lyghte is the thank but heavy is the ire
Fare well son, I will go me to prepare

Mother God be with you and keep you frome care
What soever I say sirs, I thyncke ill might she care
I care not if the old wytche were dead
It were an almoys dede to knock byr in the head
And say on the worms that she did dye
For there be many that my lands would bye
By gods blessed brother
If I were not seek of the mother
this totheles trot keep the me harde
And suffers no money in my ward
But by the blessed trinitye
If she will no sooner ded be
I will with a coyshiou stop her breath
till she have forgot new makes heth
Ill might I fare
If that I care
Nyr to spare
About the house she hoppeth
and her nose oft drops
When the wortes she choppeth
When that she doth brew
I may say to you
I am ready to spew
the drops to see down run
By all Christen men
Frome her nose to her knen
Fie Gods body, it makes me to spit
to remember howe that she doth sit
By the fire brallynge
Scratching and scrallynge
and in every place
Leyenge oysters apase
She doth but lack shells
the devil have they whytte, else
At night when to bed she goys
and pluicketh of her hose
She knappeth me in the nose
with typpe, tap
Flyppe, flap
that an ill hap
Come to that tap
that vents so
Where so ever she go
So much she daily dryncketh
That her breath at both ends styncketh
That a horsecombe and an halter
Her soon up talter
till I say Dauydes psalter
That shall be at neuermas
Which never shall be, nor never was
By this ten bones
She served me ones
A touche for the nones
I was sick and lay in my bed
She brought me a kerchyfe to wrap on my head
And I pray God that I be dead
If that I lye any whytte
when she was about the kerchefe to knit
Break did one of the forms fete
that she did stand on
And down fell she anon
And forth withal
As she did fall
She girded out a fart
That me made to start
I thyncke her buttocks did smart
Except it bad be a mare in a carte
I have not harde such a blast
I cried and bid her hold fast
with that she nothing aghast
said to me yt no woman in this land
Could hold fast that which was not in her hand
Now sirs, in that hole pitch and fire brand
Of that bag so fustye
So stale and so mustye
So cankered and so rustye
So stinckynge and so dustye
God send her as much joy
as my nose has always
Of her vnsauerye spice
If that I be not wise
and stop my nose quickelye
When she lets goo merely
But let all this go, I had almost forget
The knave that here yerewhyles did jet
Before that Telemachus did come in
I will go seeche him, I will not blynne
Untyll that I have him
Then so god save him
I will so be knave him
That I will make to rave him
With this swore I will shave him
And strypes when I have gave him
Better I will deprave him
That you shall know for a slave him

will thou so in deed?
Hye the make good speed
I am at hand here pressed
Put away tongue shaking
and this foolish crakynge
Let us try for the best
Cowards make speak a pace
Srypes prouethe manne
Have now at thy face
Keep of if thou canne
Why thou lubber run thou away
and leave thy swore and thy club thee behind
Now this is a sure card, now I may well say
That a coward crakinge here I did find
Masters ye may see by this play in sight
That great barking dogs, do not most byte
And oft it is scene that the best men in the host
Be not such, that use to brag most
If ye will avoid the danger of confusion
Print my words in heart and mark this conclusion
Such gifts of god that ye excelle in most
Use them with sobernesse and your self never bow
Seek the laud of God in all that ye do
So shall virtue and honour come you too
But if you give your minds, to the sin of pride
Uanisshe shall your virtue, your honour away will slide
For pride is hated of God above
And meekness soonest obtains his love
to your rulers and parents, be you obedient
Never transgressinge their lawefull commandment
Be ye merry and joyful at board and at bed
Imagine no traitourye against your prince and head
Love God and fear him and after him your king
Which is as victorious as any is living
Pray for his grace, with hearts that doth not fain
that lunge he may rule us without grefe or pain
beseech ye also that God may save his queen
Lovely Lady Iane, the prince that he hath send them between
to augment their joy and the commons felicity
Fare ye well sweet audiece, god grant you al prosperite
