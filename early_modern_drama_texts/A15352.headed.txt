But Frank, Frank, now we are come to the house, what shall we make to be
our business?


Tut, let us be Impudent enough, and good enough.


We have no acquaintance here, but young Scarborrow.


How no acquaintance: Angels guard me from thy company. I tel thee Wentloe thou
art not worthy to wear guilte Spurs, clean Linen, nor good Clothes.


Why for Gods sake?


By this hand thou art not a man fit to Table at an Ordinary, keep Knights
company to Bawdy houses, nor Beggar thy Taylor.


Why then I am free from Cheaters, clear from the Pox, and escape Curses?


Why dost thou think there is any Christians in the world?


I and Iewes too, Brokers, Puritans, and Sergiants.


Or dost thou mean to beg after Charity, that goes in a cold suit already,
that thou talk thou hast no acquaintance here. I tel thee Wentloe thou can
not live on this side of the world: feed well, drink Tobacco, and be honoured
into the presence, but thou must be acquainted with all sorts of men, I and so
far in to, till they desire to be more acquainted with thee.


True, and then you shall be accounted a gallant of good credit.


But stay, here is a Scrape-trencher arrived: How now blew bottle, are you of
the house?


I have heard of many black Jacks Sir, but never of a blew Bottle.


Well Sir, are you of the house?


No Sir, I am twenty yards without, and the house stands without me.


Prithee tells who owes this building.


He that dwells in it Sir.


Who dwells in it then.


He that owes it.


Whats his name.


I was none of his God-father.


Dus master Scarberow lie here,


I'll give you a rime for that Sir,
Sick men may lie, and dead men in their Graves,
Few else do lie abed at noone, but Drunkards, Punks, knaves.

What am I the better for thy answer?


What am I the better for thy question?


Why nothing.


Why then of nothing comes nothing.


Sblud this is a philosophical fool.


Then I that am a fool by Art, am better then you that are fools by nature.


Gentlemen, welcome to Yorkshire.


And well encountered my little Villain of fifteen hundred a year, S^ut what
make thou here in this barren soil of the North, when thy honest friends
miss thee at London?


Faith Gallants tis the Country where my Father lived, where first I saw the
light, and where I am loved,


Loved, I as Courtiers love Usurers, that is just as long as they lend them
money. Now dare I lay.


None of your Land good Knight, for that is laid to mortgage already?


I dare lay with any man that will take me up.


Who list to have a Lubberly load.


Sirrah wag, this Rogue was son and heir to Antony Now, Now, and Blind Moon.
And he must needs be a scurvy Musician, that hath two Fiddlers to his Fathers:
but tel me in faith, art thou not, nay I know thou art called down into the
country here, by some hoary Knight or other, who knowing thee a young Gentleman
of good parts, and a great living* hath desired thee to see some pitiful
piece of his Workmanship, a Daughter I mean, Is't not, so?


About some such preferment I came down.


Preferment, a good word: And when do you commence into the Cuckolds order, the
Preferment you speak of when shall we have Gloves: when, when?


Faith gallants
I have bin guest here but since last night.

Why, and that is time enough to make up a dozen marriages, as marriages are
made up now adays. For look you Sir: the father according to the fashion,
being sure you have a good living, and without Encumbrance, comes to you thus:
-- takes you by the hand thus: -- wipes his long beard thus: -- or turn svp his
Muchacho thus: -- Walks some turn or two thus: -- to show his comely Gravity
thus: -- And having washed his foul mouth thus: -- it last breaksout thus. --


O God: Let us hear more of this?


Master Scarborrow, you are a young Gentleman, I knew your father well, he
was my worshipful good Neighbour, for our Demeans lay near together. Then
Sir, -- you and I must be of more ne'er acquaintance. -- At which, you must make
an eruption thus: -- O God (sweet Sir)


Sfut, the Knight would have made an excellent Zany, in an Italian Comedy.


Then he goes forward thus: Sir, my self am Lord of some thousand a year, a
Widower, (master Scarberrow) I have a couple of young Gentlewomen to my
Daughters, a thousand a year will do well divided among them? Ha, wilt not
Master Scarborrow, -- At which you out of your education must reply thus. --
The Portion will deserve them worthy husbands: on which Tinder he soones takes
fire and swears you are the Man his hopes shot at, and one of them shall be
yours.


If I did not like her, should he swear to the devil, I would make him
forsworn.


Then putting you and the young Puggs to in a close room together.


If he should lie with her there, is not the father partly the Bawd?


Where the young puppet, having the Lesson before from old Fox, give the son
half a dozen warm kisses, which after her fathers oths, takes such Impression
in thee, thou straight call by Iesu Mistress, I love you: -- When she has the
wit to ask, but Sir, will you marry me, and thou in thy Cox-sparrow-humor
replyest, I (before God) as I am a Gentleman will I, which the Father
ouer-hearing, leaps in, takes you at your word, swears he is glad to see
this; nay he will have you contracted straight, and for a need makes the priest
of himself.

Thus in one hour, from a quiet life,
Thou art sworn in debt, and troubled with a wife.

But can they Love one another so soon?


Oh, it is no matter now adays for love, tis well, and they can but make shift
to lie together.


But will your father do this too, if he know the gallant breaths himself at
some two or three Bawdy houses in a morning.


Oh the sooner, for that and the Land together, tell the old lad, he will
know the better how to deal with his Daughter?

The Wise and Ancient Fathers know this Rule,
Should both wed Maids, the Child would be a Fool.
Come Wag, if thou hast gone no further then into the Ordinary fashion, meet,
see, and kiss, give over: Mary not a Wife to have a hundred plagues for one
pleasure: lets to London, there's variety: and change of pasture makes fat
Calves.


But change of women bawld Knaves, Sir Knight.


Wag and thou be a Lover but three days, thou wilt be Hartles, Sleeplesse,
witless, Mad, Wretched, Miserable, and indeed, a stark Fool. And by that, thou
hast been married but three weeks, tho thou should wed a Cynthia rara avis,
thou would be a man monstrous: A Cuckold, a Cuckold.


And why is a Cuckold monstrous, Knight?


Why, because a man is made a Beast by being married? Take but example thy
self from the Moon, as soon as she is delivered of her great belly, doth
she not point at the world with a pair of horns, as who should say, married
men, some of ye are Cuckolds.


I construe more Divinely of their sex,
Being Maids, methinkes they are Angels: and being Wives,
They are Sovereigns: Cordials that preserve our Lives,
They are like our hands that feed us, this is clear,
They renew man, as spring renews the year.

There's ne'er a wanton Wench that hears thee, but thinks thee a Coxcom for
saying so: Marry none of them, if thou wilt have their true Characters, I'll
give it thee, -- Women are the Purgatory of men's Purses, the Paradise of their
bodies, and the Hell of their minds; Marry none of them. Women are in Churches
Saints, abroad Angels, at home Devils.

Here are married men inow, know this: Marry none of them.


Men that traduce by custom, show sharpe wit
Only in speaking Ill, and practise it:
Against the best of Creatures, divine women
Who are Gods Agents here, and the Heavenly eye
By which this Orb hath her Maturity;
Beauty in women, get the world with Child,
Without whom, she were barren, faint, and wild.
They are the stems on which do Angels grow,
From whence Virtue is stild, and Arts do flow.

Let them be what Flowers they will, and they were Roses, I will pluck none of
them for pricking my fingers. But soft, here comes a voider for us: and I see,
do what I can, as long as the world lasts, there will be Cuckolds in it. Do you
hear Child, here's one come to blend you together: he has brought you a
kneading-tub, if thou dost take her at his hands,

Tho thou had Argus eyes, be sure of this,
Women have sworn with more then one to kiss.

Nay no parting Gentlemen: Hem.

Sfut dus he make Punkes of us, that he Hems already?

Gallants,
Know old Iohn Harcop keeps a Wineseller,
Has Travelled, bin at Court, known Fashions,
And unto all bears habit like your selves,
The shapes of Gentlemen and men of sort.
I have a health to give them ere they part.

Health Knight, not as Drunkards give their healths I hope, to go together by
the ears when they have done?


My healths are welcome: welcome Gentlemen.


Are we welcome Knight, Infayth.


Welcome infayth Sir.


Preethee tell me hast not thou bin a Whoremaister.


In youth I swild my fill at Venus cup,
In sted of full draughts now I am fain to sup.

Why then thou art a man fit for my company:
Dost thou hear that he is a good fellow of our stamp,
Make much of his ^ather.

The Father, and the Gallants have left me hear with a Gentlewoman, and if I
know what to say to her I am a villen, heaven grant her life hath borrowed so
much Impudence of her sex, but to speak to me first: for by this hand, I have
not so much steel of Immodesty in my face, to Parle to a Wench without
blushing. I'll walk by her, in hope she can open her teeth. -- Not a word? --
Is it not strange a man should be in a woman's company all this while and not
hear her tongue. -- I'll go further? -- God of his goodness: not a Syllable. I
think if I should take up her Clothes to, she would say nothing to me. -- With
what words trow dus a man begin to woe. Gentlewoman pray you what Is't a Clockc?


Troth Sir, carrying no watch about me but mine eyes, I answer you: I cannot
tell.


And if you cannot tell, Beauty I take the Addage for my reply: You are nought
to keep sheep.


Yet I am big enough to keep my sclfe.


Prithee tell me: Are you not a Woman?


I know not that neither, till I am better acquainted with a man.


And how would you be acquainted with a man?


To distinguish betwixt himself and my self.


Why I am a Man.


That's more then I know Sir.


To approve I am no less: thus I kiss thee.


And by that proof I am a man too, for I have kissed you.


Prithee tell me can you love?


O Lord Sir, three or four things: I Love my meat, choice of Suitors:
Clothes in the Fashion: and like a right woman I love to have my will.


What think you of me for a Husband?


Let me first know, what you think of me for a wife?


Troth I think you are a proper Gentlewoman.


Do you but think so?


Nay I see you are a very perfect proper Gentlewoman.


It is great pity then I should be alone without a proper man.


Your father says I shall marry you.


And I say God forbid Sir: I am a great deal to young.


I love thee by my troth.


O pray you do not so, for then you stray from the steps of Gentility, the
fashion among them is to marry first, and love after by leisure.


That I do love thee, here by heaven I swear, and cal it as a witness to this
kiss.


You will not enforce me I hope Sir?


Makes me this woman's husband, thou art my Clare,
Accept my hart, and prove as Chaste, as fair.

O God, you are too hot in your gifts, should I accept them, we should have
you plead nonage, some half a year hence: sue for reuersement, say the deed
was done under age.


Prithee do not Jest?


No (God is my record) I speak in earnest: desire to know Whether ye mean to
marry me, yea or no.


This hand thus takes thee as my loving wife,


For better, for worse.


I, till death us depart love.


Why then I thank you Sir, and now I am like to have that I long looked for: A
Husband.

How soon from our own tongues is the word sed,
Captives our maiden-freedome to a head.

Clare your are now mine, and I must let you know,
What every wise doth to her husband owe,
To be a wise, is to be Dedicate
Not to a youthful course, wild, and vnstedy,
But to the soul of virtue, obedience,
Studying to please, and never to offend.
Wives, have two eyes created, not like Birds
To rome about at pleasure, but for two sentinels,
To watch their husbands safety as their own,
Two hands, ones to feed him, the other her self:
Two feet, and one of them is their husbands,
They have two of every thing, only of one,
Their Chastity, that should be his alone.
Their very thoughts they cannot term them one,
Maids being once made wives, can nothing call
Rightly their own; they are their husbands all:
If such a wife you can prepare to be,
Clare I am yours: and you are fit for me.

We being thus subdued, pray you know then,
As women owe a duty, so do men.
Men must be like the branch and bark to trees,
Which doth defend them from tempestuous rage,
Cloth them in Winter, tender them in age,
Or as Ewes love unto their Eanlings lives,
Such should be husbands custom to their wives.
If it appear to them they have strayed amiss,
They only must rebuke them with a kiss,
Or Clock them, as Hens Chickens, with kind call,
Cover them under their wing, and pardon all:
No jars must make two beds, no strife divide them,
Those betwixt whom a faith and troth is given,
Death only parts, since they are knit by heaven:
If such a husband you intend to be,
I am your Clare, and you are fit for me.

By heaven.

Advise before you swear, let me remember you,
Men never give their faith, and promise marriage,
But heaven records their oath: If they prove true,
Heaven smiles for joy, if not it weeps for you,
Unless your hart, then with your words agree,
Yet let us part, and less us both be free.

If ever man in swearing love, swore true,
My words are like to his: Here comes your father.

Now master Scarborrow.


Prepared to ask how you like that we have done,
your daughters made my wife, and I your son.

And both agreed so.


We are Sir,


Then long may you live together, have store of sons.


Tis no matter who is the father.


But son here is a man of yours is come from London.


And brought you Letters Sir.


What news from London Butler.


The old news Sir, the Ordinaries are full, some Citizens are bankerouts, and
many Gentlemen beggars.


Clare here is an unwelcome Pursiuant,
My Lord and Guardian writes to me with speed,
I must return to London.

And you being Ward to him son Scarborrow,
And know him great, it fits that you obey him.

It dus it dus, for by an ancient law,
We are borne free heirs, but kept like slaves in awe,
Who are for London Gallants?

Switch and Spur we will bear you company.

Clare I must leave thee, with what vnwillingnes
Witness this dwelling kiss upon thy lip,
And tho I must be absent from thine eye,
Be sure my hart doth in thy bosom lie,
Three years I am yet a ward, which time I'll pass,
Making thy faith my constant Looking-glasse,
Till when.

Till when you please, where ere you live or lie,
Your loves here worn, your presence in my eye.

Sir William,
How old say you is your kinsman Scarborrow.

Eighteen my Lord, next Pentecost.

Bethink you good Sir William,
I reckon thereabout my self, so by that account
There's full three Winters yet he must attend,
Under our awe, before he sue his Livery:
Is't not so?

Not a day less my Lord.

Sir William you are his Uncle, and I must speak
That am his Guardian, would I had a son
Might merit commendations even with him.
I'll tetl you what he is, he is a youth,
A Noble branch, increasing blessed fruit.
Where Caterpillar vice dare not to touch,
He is himself with so much gravity,
Praise cannot praise him with Hypperbole:
He is one whom older look upon, as one a book,
Wherein are Printed Noble sentences
For them to rule their lives by. Indeed he is one
All Emulate his virtues, hate him none.

His friends are proud, to hear this good of him.

And yet Sir William being as he is,
Young, and unsettled, tho of virtuous thoughts,
By Genuine disposition, yet our eyes
See daily presidents, hopeful Gentlemen,
Being trusted in the world with their own will,
Divert the good is looked from them to Ill,
Make their old names forgot, or not worth note
With company they keep, such Revelling
With Panders, Parasites, Podigies of Knaves,
That they sell all, even their old fathers graves.
Which to prevent, we'll match him to a wife,
Marriage Restrains the scope of single life.

My Lord speaks like a father for my Kinsman.

And I have found him one of Noble parentage,
A Niece of mine, nay I have broke with her,
Know thus much of her mind, what for my pleasure
As also for the good appears in him,
She is pleased of all that's hers to make him King.

Our name is blessed in such an honoured marriage


Also I have appointed Doctor Baxter,
Chansellor of Oxford to attend me here
And see he is come. Good master Doctor.

My honourable Lord.

I have possessed you with this business master Doctor

To see the contract twixt you honoured Niece and master Scarborrow.


Tis so, and I did look for him by this.


I saw him leave his horse as I came up.


So, so.
Then he will be here forthwith: you Master Baxter
Go Usher hither straight young Katherine,
Sir William, here and I will keep this room till you return.

My honourable Lord.

Tis well done Scarborrow.

Kind Uncle.

Thanks my good Couz.

You have bin welcome in your Country Yorkshire.

The time that I spent there my Lord was merry.

Twas well, twas very well, and in your absence,
your Uncle here and I, have bin bethinking
what gift betwixt us we might bestow on you,
That to your house large dignity might bring,
With fair increase, as from a Crystal spring.

My name is bound to your beneficence,
your hands hath bin to me like bounties purse,
Never shut up, your self my foster-Nurse:
Nothing can from your honour come; prove me so rude,
But I'll accept to shun Ingratitude.

We accept thy promise, now return thee this,
A virtuous wife, accept her with a kiss.

My honourable Lord.

Fear not to take her man, she will fear neither,
Do what thou can being both abed together.

O but my Lord.

But me a Dog of wax, come kiss, and agree,
Your friends have thought it fit, and it must be.

I have no hands to take her to my wife.

How Sawce-box.

O pardon me my Lord the vnripenes of my years,
Too green for government, is old in fears
To undertake that charge.

Sir, sir, I and sir knave, then here is a mellowed experience knows how to
teach you,


O God.


O Jack.
How both our cares, your Uncle and my self,
Sought, studied, found out, and for your good,
A maid, a Niece of mine, both fair and chaste,
And must we stand at your discretion.

O Good my Lord
Had I two souls, then might I have two wives,
Had I two faiths, then had I one for her,
Having of both but one, that one is given
To Sir Iohn Harcops daughter.

Ha, ha, whats that, let me hear that again?

To Sir Iohn Harcops Clare I have made an oath,
Part me in twain, yet she's one half of both.
This hand the which I wear it is half hers,
Such power hath faith and troth twixt couples young,
Death only cuts that knot tide with the tongue.

And have you knit that knot Sir.

I have done so much, that if I wed not her,
My marriage makes me an Adulterer,
In which black sheets, I wallow all my life,
My babes being Bastards, and a whore my wife.

Ha, is't even so, My secretary there,
Write me a Letter straight to Sir Iohn Harcop,
I'll see Sir Jack and if that Harcop dare,
Being my Ward, contract you to his daughter.
My steward too, post you to Yorkshire,
Where lies my youngsters Land, and sirrah,
Fell me his wood, make havoc, spoil and wast.
Sir you shall know that you are Ward to me,
I'll make you poor enough: then mend your self.

O Cozen.

O Uncle.

Contract your self and where you list,
I'll make you know me Sir to be your guard.

World now thou see what tis to be a ward.

And where I meant my self to have disbursed
Four thousand pound, upon this marriage
Surrendered up your land to your own use,
And compassed other portions to your hands,
Sir I'll now yoke you still.

A yoke indeed.

And spite of they dare contradict my will,
I'll make thee marry to my Chambermaid. Comecouz.

Faith Sir it fits you to be more advised.

Do not you flatter for preferment sir

O but good Coze.

O but good uncle could I command my love,
Or cancel oaths out of heavens brazen book,
Engrossed by Gods own finger, then you might speak.
Had men that law to love as most have tongues
To love a thousand women with, then you might speak.
Were love like dust lawful for every Wind,
To bear from place to place, were oaths but puffs,
Men might forswear themselves, but I do know,
Tho sin being past with us, the acts forgot,
The poor soul groans, and she forgets it not.

Yet hear your own case?

O tis to miserable:
That I a Gentleman should be thus torn
From mine own right, and forest to be sorsworne.

Yet being as it is, it must be your care,
To salve it with advice, not with despair,
you are his ward, being so, the Law intends,
He is to have your duty, and in his rule
Is both your marriage, and your heritage,
If you rebel against these Injunctions,
The penalty takes hold on you, which for himself,
He straight thus prosecutes, he wastes your land,
Weds you where he thinks fit, but if your self
Have of some violent humour matched your self,
Without his knowledge, then hath he power
To Merce your purse, and in a sum so great,
That shall for ever keep your fortunes weak,
Where otherwise if you be ruled by him
Your house is raised by matching to his kin.

Now death of me, shall I be crossed by such a Jack, he wed
himself, and where he list: Sirrha Malapart, I'll hamper you,
You that will have your will, come get you in:
I'll make thee shape thy thoughts to marry her,
Or wish thy birth had bin thy murderer.

Fare pity me, because I am enforced,
For I have heard those matches have cost blood,
Where love is once begun and then withstood,

Boy, hast thou delivered my Letter?


I Sir, I saw him open the lips ont.


He had not a new suit on, had he?


I am not so well acquainted with his Wardrobe Sir, but I saw a lean fellow,
with sunk eyes, and shamble legs, sigh pitifully at his chamber door, and
entreat his man to put his master in mind of him.


O, that was his Taylor, I see now he will be blessed he profits by my counsel,
he will pay no debts before he be arrested, nor then neither, if he can find
ere a beast that dare but be bail for him, but he will seal in the afternoon.


Yes Sir, he will imprint for you as deep as he can.


Good, good, now have I a Parsons Nose, and smell tithe coming in then. Now let
me number how many rooks I have half undone already this Term by the first
return: four by Dice, six by being bound with me, and ten by queens, of
which some be Courtiers, some Country Gentlemen, and some Citizens Sons.
Thou art a good Frank, if thou pe^gest thus, thou art still a Companion for
Gallants, may keep a Caramite, take Physic, at the Spring and the fall.


Frank, news that will make thee fat Frank.


Prithee rather give me somewhat will keep me lean,
I ha no mind yet to take Physic.

Master Scarberrow is a married man.


Then heaven grant he may, as few married men do, make much of his wife.


Why? would have him love her, let her command al, and make her his master?


No no, they that do so, make not much of their wives, but give them their
will, and its the marring of em.


Honest Frank, valorous Frank, a portion of thy wit, but to help us in
this enterprise, and we may walk London street and cry pish at the Sergiants.


You may shift out one term, and yet die in the Counter, these are the scabs
now that hang upon honest Iob, I am Iob, and these art the scurvy scabs, but
whats this your pot seeths over withal?


Master Scarborrow is a married man.


He has all his land in his own hand.


His brothers and sisters portions.


Besides four thousand pound in ready money with his wife.


A good talent by my faith, it might help many Gentlemen to pay their
Tailors, and I might be one of them.


Nay, honest Frank, hast thou found a trick for him, if thou hast not, look
here's a line to direct thee. First draw him into bands for money, then to dice
for it: Then take up stuff at the Mercers, straight to a punk with it: Then
mortgage his Land, and be drunk with that: so with them and the rest, from an
Ancient Gentleman, make him a young beggar.


What a Rog is this, to read a lecture to me, and mine own lesson too, which
he knows I ha made perfect to 9 hundred fourscore and nineteen. A cheating
Rascal will teach me that ha made them that have worn a spacious Park, Lodge
and all of their backs this morning: bin fain to pawn it before night, and
they that ha stauked like a huge Elephant, with a Castle on their necks, and
removed yt to their own shoulders in one day which their fathers built up in
seven year, bin glad by my means, in so much time as a child sucks, to
drink bottle Ale, tho a punk pay fort. And shall this Parat instruct me?


Nay but Frank.


A rog that hath fed upon me, the fruit of my wit like Pullen from a Pantlers
chipings, and now I put him into good cloths to shift two suits in a day, that
could scare shift a patched shirt once in a year, and says prayers when he had
it: hark, how he prates.


Besides Frank, since his marriage, he stawkes me like a cashierd Captain
discontent, in which Melancholy, the least drop of mirth, of which thou hast
an Ocean, will make him, and all his ours for ever.


Says mine own Rog so, give me thy hand then, we'll doot, and there's
earnest. Strikes him. Sfut you Chitrtiface, that looks worse then a Collier
thorough a wooden window, an Ape afraid of a whip, or a Knaves head, shook
seven years in the weather upon London-bridge. Do you Catechize me?


Nay but valorous Frank, he that knows the secrets of al harts, knows I did
it in kindness.


Know your seasons: besides, I am not of that Species for you to instruct. Then
know your seasons.


Sfut friends, friends, al friends: Here comes young Scarborrow, should he knew
of this, all our disseignes were prevented.


What, melancholy my young master, my young married man, God give your worship
joy.


Joy, of what Frank?


Of thy wealth, for I hear of few that ha joy of heir wives


Who weds as I have to enforced sheets,
His care increases, but his comfort fleets.

Thou having so much wit, what a Devil meantst thou to marry?


O speak not of it,
Marriage sounds in mine care like a Bell,
Not rung for pleasure, but a doleful knell.

A common course, those men that are married in the Morning, to wish themselves
buried ere night.


I cannot love her.


No news neither, wives know that's a general fault amongst their Husbands.


I will not lie with her.


Cetera volunt sheele say still, if you will not, another will.


Why did she marry me, knowing I did not love her.


As other women do, either to be maintained by you, or to make you a Cuckold.
Now sir, what come you for?


As men do in hast, to make an end of their business.


Whats your business?


My business is this Sir, this Sir, and this Sir,


The meaning of al this Sir. Cl. By this is as much as to say Sir, may My. has
sent unto you. By this is as much as to say Sir, my master has him humbly
commended unto you, and by this is as much as to say, my master craves your
answer.


Give me your Letter. And you shall have this Sir, this Sir, and this Sir.


No Sir.


Why Sir?


Because as the learned have very well instructed me, Qui supranos, nihil ad
nos, and tho many Gentlemen will have to do with other men's business, yet from
me know, the most part of them prove knaves for their labour.


You ha the Knave in faith Frank.


Long may he live to enjoy it. From Sir Iohn Harcop of Harcop, in the County
of York Knight, by me his man, to your self my young master, by these
presents greeting.


How came thou by these good words?


As you by your good clothes, took them upon trust, swore I would never pay
for em.


Thy master Sir Iohn Harcop writes to me,
That I should entertain thee for my man,
His wish is acceptable, thou art welcome fellow.
Oh but thy masters Daughter, sends an Article
Which makes me think upon my present sin,
Here she remembers me to keep in mind
My promised faith to her, which I ha broke.
Here she remembers me I am a man,
Black tore with perjury, whose sinful breast,
Is Charactred like those cursed of the blessed.

How now my young Bully, like a young wench forty weeks after the loss of her
Mayden-head, crying out.


Trouble me not,
Give me Pen, Ink, and Paper, I will write to her,
O? but what shall I write?
Mine own excuse, why no excuse can serve
For him that swears, and from his oath doth swerve?
Or shall I say, my marriage was info rest,
Twas bad in them, not well in me to yield.
Wretched thee to whose marriage was compelled,
I'll only write that which my grave hath bred,
Forgive me Clare, for I am married:
Tis soon set down, but not so soon forgot, or worn from hence.
Deliver it unto her, there's for thy pains,
Would I as soon could cleanse these periurd staines.

Well, I could alter mine eyes from filthy mud into fair water: you have paid
for my tears, and mine eyes shall prove bankerouts, and break out for you, let
no man persuade me, I will cry, and every Town betwixt Shoreditch-church and
York bridge, shall bear me witness.


Gentlemen, I'll take my leave of you,
She that I am married to but not my wife,
Will London leave, in Yorkshire lead our life.

We must not leave you so my young Gallant,
We three are sick in state, and your wealth must help to make us whole
again.
For this saying, is as true as old:
Strife nursed twixt man and wife, makes such a flaw,
How great so eres their wealth, twil have a thaw,

Brothers to him ere long shall be my son,
By wedding this young girl: You are welcome both,
Nay kiss her, kiss, tho that she shall
Be your Brothers wife, to kiss the cheek is free.

Kiss, Sfut what else? thou art a good plump wench, I like you well, prithee
make hast and bring store of boys, but be sure they have good faces, that
they may call me vnck^e.


Glad of so fair a sister, I salute you.


Good, good y faith, this kissings good y faith,
I loved to smack it too when I was young,
But Mum: they have felt thy cheek Clare, let them hear thy tongue.

Such welcome as befits my Scarborrows brothers,
From me his troth-plight wife be sure to have,
And tho my tongue prove scant in any part,
The bounds be sure are large, full in my hart.

Tut, that's not that we dout on wench, but do you hear Sir Iohn, what do you
think drew me from London, and the Innes of Court, thus far into Yorkshire?


I guess to see this girl, shall be your sister.


Faith, and I guess partly so too, but the maine was, and I will not lie to
you, that your coming now in this wise into our kindred, I might be
acquainted with you aforehand, that after my brother had married your daughter,
I his brother might borrow some money of you.


What? Do you borrow of your kindred Sir?


Sfut what else, they having interrest in my blood, why should not I have
interrest in their coin. Besides Sir, I being a younger brother, would be
ashamed of my generation if I would not borrow of any man that would lend,
especially of my affinity, of whom I keep a Calendar. And look you Sir, thus
I go over them. Frst ore my Uncles, often ore mine Aunts, then up to my
Nephews, straight down to my Nieces, to this Cousin Thomas, and that Cousin
Ieffrey, leaving the courteous claw given to none of their elbows, even unto
the third and fourth remove of any that hath interest in our blood. Al which
do upon their summons made by me, duly and faithfully provide for appearance,
and so as they are, I hope we shall be, more indeerd, entirely, better, and
more feelingly acquainted.


you are a merry Gentleman.


Tis the hope of money makes me so, and I know none but fools use to be sad
with it.


From Oxford am I drawn, from serious studies
Expecting that my brother still had soiournd
With you his best of choice, and this good Knight.

His absence shall not make our harts less merry
Then if we had his presence. A day ere long,
Will bring him back, when one the other meets,
At nooneith Church, at night between the sheets.
We'll wash this chat with wine. Some wine: fill up,
The sharpner of the wit, is a full cup.
And so to you Sir.

Do, and I'll drink, to my new sister, but upon this condition, that she may
have quiet days, little rest a nights, hapleasant afternoones, be pliant to
my brother, and lend me money when soere I'll borrow it.


Nay, nay, nay,
Women are weak and we must bear with them,
Your frolic healths, are only fit for men,

Well, I am contented, women must to the wall, tho it be to a feather-bed. Fill
up then.


From London am I come, tho not with pipe and Drum,
Yet I bring matter, in this poor paper,
Will make my young mistress, delighting in kisses,
Do as all Maidens will, hearing of such an ill,
As to have lost, the thing they wished most,
A Husband, a Husband, a pretty sweet Husband,
Cry oh, oh, oh, and alas, And at last ho, ho, ho, as I do.

Returned so soon from London? Whats the news?

O mistress, if ever you have seen Demoniceacleare look into mine eyes, mine
eyes are Seuerne, plain Seuerne, the Thamee, nor the River of Tweed are
nothing to em: Nay all the rain that fell at Noahs flood, had not the
discretion that my eyes have: that drunk but up the whole world, and I ha
drowned all the way betwixt this and London.


Thy news good Robbin.


My news mistres, I'll tell you strange news, the dust upon London way, being
so great, that not a Lord, Gentleman, Knight, or Knave could travel, least
his eyes should be blown out: At last, they all agreed to hire me to go
before them, when I looking but upon this Letter, did with this water, this
very water, lay the dust, as well as if it had raind from the beginning of
April to the last of May.


A Letter from my Scarborrow, give it thy mistress.


But Mistress.


Prithee be gon,
I would not have my father nor this Gentlemen,
Be witness of the comfort it doth bring.

Oh but mistress.

Prithee begone,
With this, and the glad news, leave me alone.

Tis your turn Knight, take your licquor, know I am bountiful, I'll forgive
any man any thing that he owes me, but his drink, and that I'll be paid for.


May Gentlemen the honesty of mirth
Consists not in Carousing with excess,
My father hath more welcomes then in wine:
Pray you no more.

Says my sister so, I'll be ruled by thoe then. Do you hear, in hope hereafter
you'll lend me some money, now we are half drunk lets go to dinner. Come Knight.


I am glad your gone,
Shall I now opent: no, I'll kiss it first,
Because his outside last did kiss his hand.
Within this fouled, I'll calt a sacred sheet,
Are writ black lines, when our white harts shall meet,
Before I open this door of my delight,
Methinkes I guess how kindly he doth write,
Of his true Love to me, as Chuck, Sweet-hart,
I prithee do not think the time too long,
That keeps us from the sweets of marriage rites,
And then he sets my name and kisses it,
Wishing my lips his sheet to write upon,
With like desire methinkes as mine own thoughts,
Ask him now here for me to look upon,
Yet at the last thinking his love too slack,
Ere it arrive at my desired eyes,
He hastens up his message with like speed,
Even as I break this open, wishing to read:
Oh: whats hear? Mine eyes are not mine own? sure they are not,
Tho you ha bin my lamps this sixteen years,
You do belie, my Scarborrow reading so;
Forgive him, he is married, that were Ill:
What lying lights are these. Look I ha no such Letter,
No wedded syllable of the least wrong
Done to a Troth-plight-Virgin like my self*
Beshrow you for your blindness: Forgive him, he is married.
I know my Scarborrowes constancy to me,
Is as firm knit, as faith to Charity,
That I shall kiss him often, hug him thus,
Be made a happy and a fruitful Mother
Of many prosperous children like to him,
And read I, he was married? Asked forgiveness?
What a blind Foolo was I? yet here's a Letter
To whom directed trow? To my beloved Clare.
Why Law?
Women will read, and read not that they saw,
Twas but my fervent love misled mine eyes,
I'll once again to the Inside, Forgive me, I am married:
william Scarborrow. He has set his name too't to,
O perjury? within the harts of men
Thy feasts are kept, their tongues proclaims them.

Sister, Gods precious, the cloths laid, the meat cools, we all stay, and
your father calls for you.


Kind Sir, excuse me I pray you a little,
I'll but peruse this Letter and come straight.

Pray you make hast, the meat stays for us, and our stomach*
Ready for the meat, for believe this,
Drink makes men hungry, or it makes them lie,
And he that's drunk ore night, ith mornings dry,
Seen and approved.

He was contracted mine, yet he unjust
Hath married to another: whats my estate then?
A wretched maid, not fit for any man,
For being united his with plighted faiths,
Who ever sues to me commits a sin,
Besiedgeth me, and who shall marry me:
Is like my self, lives in Adultery, (O God)
That such hard Fortune, should betide my youth.
I am Young, Fair, Rich, Honest, Virtuous,
yet for all this, who ere shall marry me
I am but his where, live in Adultery.
I cannot step into the path of pleasure
For which I was created, borne unto,
Let me live ne'er so honest, rich or poor,
If I once wed, yet I must live a whore.
I must be made a strumpet against my will,
A name I have abhord, a shameful Ill
I have eschewed, and now cannot withstand it
In my self. I am my fathers only child,
In me he hath a hope, tho not his name
Can be increased, yet by my Issue
His land shall be possessed, his age delighted.
And tho that I should vow a single life
To keep my soul unspotted, yet will he
Enforce me to a marriage:
So that my grief doth of that weight consist,
It helps me not to yield, nor to resist:
And was I then created for a Whore? A whore,
Bad name, bad act, Bad man makes me a scorn:
Then live a Strumpet? Better be unborn.
Sister, Pray you will you come,
Your father and the whole meeting stays for you.

I come, I come, I pray return: I come.

I must not go without you.

Be thou my Usher, sooth I'll follow you

He writes here to forgive him, he is married:
False Gentleman: I do forgive thee with my hart,
Yet will I send an answer to thy letter,
And in so short words thou shalt weep to read them,
And hears my agent ready: Forgive me, I am dead.
Tis writ, and I will act it: Be judge you Maids
Have trusted the false promises of men.
Be judge you wives, the which have been enforced
From the white sheets you loved, to them ye loathed:
Whether this Axiom may not be assured,
Better one sin, then many be endured.
My arms embracings, Kisses, Chastity,
Were his possessions: and whilst I live
He doth but steal those pleasures he enjoys,
Is an Adulterer in his married arms,
And never goes to his defiled bed,
But God writes sin upon the Teasters head.
I'll be a Wife now, help to save his soul
Tho I have lost his body, give a slake
To his iniquities, and with one sin
Done by this hand, end many done by him.
Farewell the world, then farewell the wedded joys
Till this I have hoped for, from that Gentleman,
Scarborrow, forgive me: thus thou hast lost thy wife,
Yet record would, though by an act too foul,
A wife thus did to cleanse her husbands soul.
Gods precious, for his mercy, wheres this wench?
Must all my friends and guests attend on you?
Where are you Minion?

Scarborrow come close mine eyes, for I am dead.

That sad voice was not hers I hope:
Whose this, my daughter?

Your daughter,
That begs of you to see her buried,
Prays Scarborrow to forgive her: she is dead.

Patience good tears, and let my words have way
Clare, my daughter, help my servants there:
Lift up thine eyes, and look upon thy father,
They were not borne to loose their light so soon,
I did beget thee for my comforter,
And not to be the Author of my care.
Why speak thou not? Some help my Servants there:
What hand hath made thee pale? Or if thine own,
What cause had thou that were thy fathers Joy,
The Treasure of his age, the Cradle of his sleep,
His all in all? I prithee speak to me?
Thou art not ripe for death, come back again,
Clare, my Clare, If death must needs have one,
I am the fittest, prithee let me go,
Thou dying whilst I live, I am dead with woe.

What means this outcry?

O ruthful spectacle.

Thou were not wont to be so sullen child,
But kind and loving to thy aged father:
Awake, awake, Ift be thy lasting sleep,
Would I had not sense for grief, nor eyes to weep.

What Papers this, the sad contents doth tell me,
My Brother writ, he hath broke his faith to her,
And she replies, for him she hath killed her self.

Was that the cause that thou hast soiled thy self,
With these red spots, these blemishers of beauty?
My child, my child, wast perjury in him,
Made thee so fair, act now so foul a finn,
That he deceived thee in a Mothers hopes,
Posterity, the bliss of marriage?
Thou hast no tongue to answer no, or I,
But in red Letters writes: For him I die.
Curse on his Traitorous tongue, his youth, his blood,
His pleasures, Children, and possessions,
Be all his days like winter, comfortless:
Restless his nights, his wants Remorcelesse,
And may his Corps be the Physicians stage,
Which plaid upon, stands not to honoured Age,
Or with diseases may he lie and pine,
Till grief wastes blood, his eyes, as grief doth mine.

O good old man, made wretched by this deed,
The more thy age, were to be pitied.

What ride by the gate, not call, that were a shame in faith.


We'll but taste of his Beer, kiss his Daughter, and to horse again, wheres
the good Knight hear?


You bring me to my shame unwillingly.


Shamed of what, for deceiving of a wench, I ha not blushed,
that ha dnut to a hundred of em.
In women's love hes wise, doth follow this,
Love one so long till her another kiss.
Wheres the good Knight here?

O Brother, you are come to make your eye
Sad mourner at a fatal Tragedy.
Peruse this Letter first, and then this Corps.

O wronged Clare? Accursed Scarborrow?
I writ to her, that I was married,
She writes to me, forgive her she is dead:
I'll balm thy body with my faithful tears,
And be perpetual mourner at thy Tomb,
I'll sacrifice this Commit into sighs,
Make a consumption of this pile of man,
And all the benefits my parents gave,
Shall turn distempered to appease the wrath
For this blood shed, and I am guilty of.

Dear husband.

False woman, not my wife, tho married to me,
Look what thy friends, and thou art guilty of,
The murder of a creature, equalled heaven
In her Creation, whose thoughts like fire,
Never looked base, but ever did aspire
To blessed benefits, till you and yours undid her,
Eye her, view, tho dead, yet she dus look,
Like a fresh frame, or a new printed book
Of the best paper, never looked into,
But with one fullied finger, which did spot her,
Which was her own too, but who was cause of it,
Thou and thy friends, and I will loath thee fort.

They do belly her that do say she's dead,
She is but strayed to some by-gallery,
And I must ha her again. Clare, where art thou Clare?

Here, laid to take her everlasting sleep.

A lies that says so,
Yet now I know thee, I do lie that say it,
For if she be a villen like thy self,
A periurd Traitor, recreant, miscreant,
Dog, a dog, a dog, has dunt.

O Sir Iohn Harcop.

O Sir Iohn villen, to be troth thy self
To this good creature, harmless, harmeles child,
This kernel hope, and comfort of my house,
Without Enforcement, of thine own accord,
Draw all her soul ith compass of an oath,
Take that oath from her, make her for none but thee,
And then betray her?

Shame on them were the cause of it.

But hark what thou hast got by it,
Thy wife is but a strumpet, thy children Bastards,
Thy self a murderer, thy wife, accesary,
Thy bed a stews, thy house a Brothel.

O, tis too true.

I, made a wretched father childles.

I, made a married man, yet wiueles.

Thou the cause of it.

Thou the cause of it.

Curse on the day that ere it was begun,
For I an old man am, undone, undone.

For Charity have care upon your father,
Least that his grief, bring on a more mishap,
This to my arms, my sorrow shall bequeath,
Tho I have lost her, to thy grave I'll bring,
Thou were my wife, and I'll thy Requiem sing:
Go you to the Country, I'll to London back,
All riot now, since that my souls so black.

Thus am I left like Sea-tost-Marriners,
My Fortunes being no more then my distress,
Upon what shore soever I am driven,
Be it good or bad, I must account it heaven,
Tho married, I am reputed not a wife,
Neglected of my Husband, scorned, despised,
And tho my love and true obedience
Lies prostrate to his beck, his heedles eye,
Receives my services unworthily.
I know no cause, nor will be cause of none,
But hope for better days when bad be gone,
You are my guide, whether must I, Butler?

Toward Wakefield, where my masters living lies.

Toward Wakefield where thy master we'll attend,
When things are at the worst, tis hopt they'll mend.

How now sister, no further forward on your journey yet?

When griefs before one, who'd go on to grief,
I'd rather turn me back to find some comfort.

And that way sorrows hurtfuller then this,
My Brother having brought unto a grave,
That murdered body whom he called his wife,
And spent so many tears upon her Hearse,
As would have made a Tyrant to relent,
Then kneeling at her Coffin, thus he vowed,
From thence he never would embrace your bed.

The more Fool he.

Never from hence acknowledge you his wife,
When others strive to enrich their fathers name,
It should be his only aim, to beggar his,
To spend their means, and in his only pride,
Which with a sigh confirmed, hes rid to London,
Vowing a course, that by his life so foul
Men ne'er should join the hands, without the soul.

All is but grief, and I am armed for it.

Weel bring you on your way in hope that's strong
Time may at length make strait. what yet is wrong.

Hes our own, hes our own, Come, lets make use of his wealth, as the snow of
Ice: Melt it, melt it.


But art sure he will hold his meeting.


As sure as I am now, was dead drunk last night.


Why then so sure will I be arrested by a couple of Sergeants, and fall into
one of the unlucky Cranks about Cheapside, called Counters.


Withal, I have provided M. Grype the Usurer, who upon the instant will be
ready to step in, charge the Seargeaunts to keep thee fast, and that now he
will have his five hundred pounds, or thou shalt rot for it.


When it follows, young Scarborow shall be bound for the one: then take up as
much more, we share the one half, help him to be drunk with the other.


Ha, ha, ha.


Why, dost laugh Frank?


To see that we and Usurers line by the fall of young heirs as swine by the
dropping of Acorns. But hes come. Where be these Rogues? shall we ha no
tendance here?


Good day Gentlemen.


A thousand good days, my noble Bully, and as many good fortunes as there were
Grasshoppers in Egypt, and that's covered over with good luck: but Nouns,
Pronounes, and Participles. Where be these Rogues here: what, shall we have no
Wine here?


Anon, anon, sir.


Anon, goodman Rascal, must we stay your leisure? gee't us by and by, with
apoxe to you.


O, do not hurt the fellow?


Hurt him, hang him, Scrape-trencher, star-waren, Wine spiller, mettle-clancer,
Rogue by generation. Why, dost hear Will? If thou dost not use these
Grape-spillers as you do their pottle-pots, quoit em down stayres three or
four times at a supper, they le grow as saucy with you as Sergeants, and make
bills more unconscionable then Taylors.


Here's the pure and neat grape Gent. I hate for you.


Fill up: what ha you brought here, goodman rog?


The pure element of Claret sir.


Ha you so, and did not I call for Rhenish you Mongrel?


Thou need no wine, I prithee be more mild?


Be mild in a Tavern, tis treason to the red Lettyce, enemy to their sign
post, and slave to humour:

Preethee, lets be mad,
Then fill our heads with wine, till every pate be drunk,
Then peace in the street, Iustell all you meet, and with a Punk,
As thou wilt do now and then: Thank me thy good
Master, that brought thee to it.

Nay, he profits well, but the worst is he will not swear yet


Do not belie me: If there be any good in me that's the best: Oaths are
necessary for nothing, They pass out of a mas mouth, like smoke through a
chimney, that files all the way it goes.


Why then I think Tobacco be a kind of swearing, for it furs our nose pockily.


But come, lets drink our selves into a stomach asor supper.


Agreed. I'll begin with a new health. Fill up.


To them that mnke Land fly,
By wine, whores, and a Die.
To them, that only thrives,
By kissing others Wives.
To them that pay for clothes,
With nothing but with Oaths:
Care not from whom they get,
So they may be in debt:
This health my harts
But who their Taylors pay,
Borrow, and keep their day,
Weel hold him like this Glass,
A brainless empty Ass,
And not a mate for us.
Drink round my harts.

An excellent health.

Master Ilford, there's a couple of strangers beneath desires to speak with
you.


What beards ha they? Gentleman-like-beards, or broker-like-beards?


I am not so well acquainted with the Art of Facemending sir: but they would
speak with you.


I'll go down to em.


Do: and we'll stay here and drink Tobacco.


Thus like a Fever that doth shake a man
From strength to weakness, I consume my self:
I know this company, their custom wild,
Hated, abhord of good-men, yet like a child
By reasons rule instructed how to know
Evil from good, I to the worser go.
Why do you suffer this, you upper powers,
That I should surfeit in the sin I taste, have sense to feel my mischief,
yet make wast
Of heaven and earth:
My self will answer, what my self doth ask?
Who once doth cherish sin, begets his shame,
For vice being fosterd once, coms Impudence,
Which makes men count sin, Custom, not offence,
When all like me, their reputation blot,
Pursuing evil, while the good (...) got.

Nay, never strive, we can hold you.


I, me, and any man else, and a fall into your Clutches: Let go your tugging,
as I am a Gentleman, I'll be your true prisoner.


How now: whats the matter Frank?


I am fallen into the hands of Sergiants, I am arrested.


How, arrest a Gentleman in our company?


Put up, put up, for sins sake put up, lets not a^l sup in the Counter to
night, let me speak with master Gripe the Creditor.


Well: what say you to me Sir?


You have arrested me here master Gripe.


Not I Sir, the Sergiants have.


But at your suit master Gripe: yet hear me, as I am a Gent.


I rather you could say as you were an honest man, and then I might believe
you.


Yet hear me.


Hear me no hearings, I lent you my money for good will.


And I spent it for mere necessity, I confess I owe you five hundred pound,
and I confess I owe not a penny to any man, but he wold be glad to hate: my
bond you have already master Gripe If you will, now take my word.


Word me no words: Officers look to your prisoner: If you cannot either make
me present payment, or put me in security such as I shall like too.


Such as you shall like too: what say you to this young Gent. He is the widgen
that we must feed upon.


Who young master Scarborrow, he is an honest Gentleman for ought I know, I
ne'er lost penny by him.


I would be ashamed any man should say so by me, that I have had dealings
withal: But my enforced friends, wilt please you but to retire into some small
distance, whilst I descend with a few words to these Gentlemen, and I'll commit
my self into your hands immediately.


Well sir we'll wait upon you.


Gentlemen I am to profer some conference, and in especially to you master
Scarborrow, our meeting here for your mirth hath proved to me thus adverse,
that in your companies I am Arrested: How ill it will stand with the flourish
of your reputations when men of rank and note communicate, that I Frank
Ilforde, Gentlem. whose Fortunes may transcend, to make ample Gratuities
future, and heap satisfaction for any present extention of his friends
kindness, was Enforced from the Mitre in Bredstreet, to the Counter in the
Poultrey: for mine own part, if you shall think it meet, and that it shall
acord with the state of gentry, to submit my self from the featherbed in the
Masters side, or the Flock-bed in the Knights ward, to the straw-bed in the
hole, I shall buckle to my heals insted of guilt spurs, the armour of
patience, and doote.


Come, come, what a pox need all this, this is Mellis Flora, the sweetest of
the honey, he that was not made to fat Cattle, but to feed Gentlemen.


You wear good clothes.


Are well descended.


Keep the best company.


Should regard your credit.


Stand not upon it, be bound, be bound.


Ye are richly married.


Love not your wife.


Have store of friends.


Who shall be your heir.


The son of some slave.


Some groom.


Some Horse-keeper.


Stand not vpont, be bound, be bound.


Well at your Importance, for once I'll stretch my purse Whose borne to sink,
as good this way as worse.


Now speaks my Bully like a Gentleman of worth.


Of merit.


Fit to be regarded.


That shall command our souls.


Our swords.


Our selves.


To feed upon you as Pharoes lean kine did upon the fat.


Master Gripe is my bond currant for this Gentleman.


Good security you Egyptian Grasshopper, good security?


And for as much more kind Master Scarborrow.
Provided that men mortal as we are,
May have.

May have security.


Your bond with land conveyed, which may assure me of mine own again.


You shall be satisfied, and I'll become your debtor, for full five hundred more
then he doth owe you.

This night we sup here, bear us company,
And bring your Counsel, Scrivener, and the money with you,
Where I will make as full assurance as in the Law you'd wish.

I take your word Sir,
And so discharge you of your prisoner.

Why then lets come and take up a new room, the infected hath spit in this.

He that hath store of Coin, wants not a friend,
Thou shalt receive sweet rogue, and we will spend.

Brother, you see the extremity of want
Enforces us to question for our own,
The rather that we see, not like a Brother
Our Brother keeps from us to spend on other.

True, he has in his hands our portions, the patrimony which our Father gave
us, with which he lies fatting himself with Sack and sugar in the house, and
we are fain to walk with lean purses abroad. Credit must be maintained which
will not be without money, Good clothes must be had, which will not be without
money, company must be kept which will not be without money, al which we must
have, and from him we will have money.


Besides, we have brought our sister to this Town,
That she her self having her own from him,
Might bring her self in Court to be preferred,
Under some Noble personage, or else that he
Whose friends are great in Court, by his late match,
As he is in nature bound, provide for her.

And he shall do it brother, tho we have waited at his lodging, longer then a
Tailors bil on a young Knight for an old rekoning, without speaking with him,
Here we know he is, and we will call him to parle.


Yet let us doot in mild and gentle terms,
Fair words perhaps may sooner draw our own,
Then ruffer courses by which his mischief grown.

Anon, anon, look down into the Dolphin there.


Here comes a drawer we will question him.


Do you hear my friend, is not master Scarborrow here?


Here sir, what a jest is that, where should he be else, I would have you
well know my master hopes to grow rich before he leaves him.


How long hath he continued here since he came hither.


Faith Sir not so long as Noahs floude, yet long enough to have drowned up the
livings of three Knights, as Knights goes now adays, some month or there
abouts.


Time ill consumed to ruinate our house,
But what are they that keep him company?

Pitch, Pitch, but I must not say so, but for your further satisfaction, did
you ever see a young whelp and a Lyon play together.


Yes.


Such is master Scarborrows company
Within Oliuer.

Anon, anon, look down to the Pomegranate there.


I prithee say here's them would speak with him.


I'll do your message: Anon, anon there.


This fool speaks wiser then he is aware,
young heirs left in this town where sins so rank,
And prodigals gape to grow fat by them,
Are like young whelps thrown in the Lyons den,
Who play with them awhile, at length devour them.

Whose there would speak with me?


Your Brothers, who are glad to see you well.


Well.


Tis not your riot, that we hear you use,
(With such as wast their goods, as Time the world
With a continual spending, nor that you keep
The company of a most Leprous route,
Consumes your bodies wealth, infects your name
With such Plague-sores, that had you reasons eye,
'twould make you sick, to see you visit them)
Hath drawn us, but our wants to crave the dew
Our father gave, and yet remains with you.

Our Byrth-right good brother, this Town craves maintenance, silk stockings
must be had, and we would be loath our heritage should be arraigned at the
Vintners bar, and so condemned to the Vintners box, though while you did keep
house, we had some Belly-timber at your Table, or so, yet we would have you
think, we are your Brothers, yet no Esaus to sell our patrimony for Porridge.


So, so, what hath your coming else?


With us our sister joins in our request,
Whom we have brought along with us to London,
To have her portion, wherewith to provide,
An honoured service, or an honest bride.

So, then you two my Brothers, and she my sister, come not as in duty you are
bound, to an elder brother, out of Yorkshire to see us, but like leaches to
suck from us.


We come compelled by want to crave our own.


Sir, for your own, then thus be satisfied,
Both hers and yours were left in trust with me,
And I will keep it for ye: Must you appoint us,
Or what we please to like mixed with reproof,
You have bin to saucy both, and you shall know,
I'll curb you for it, ask why; I'll have it so?

We do but crave our own.

Your own sir: whats your own?

Our portions given us by our fathers will,

Which here you spend.

Consume?

Ways worse then ill.

Ha, ha, ha.

Nay, nay, nay, Will: prethy come away, we have a full gallon of Sack stays in
the fire for thee, thou must pledge it to the health of a friend of thine.


What dost think these are Frank?


They are Fiddlers I think, if they be, I prithee send them into the next
room, and let them scrape there, and weell send to them presently.


They are my brothers Frank, come out of Yorkshire, To the Tavern here, to
ask their portions: they call my pleasures, riots, my company Leproes, like a
school boy, they would tutor me?


O, thou should have done well to have bound them prentices when they were
young, they would have made a couple of saucy Tailors.


Tailors?


I Birdlime: Tailors: Tailors are good men, and in the Term time they wear
good Clothes. Come, you must learn more manners, stand at your Brothers
back, as to shift a Treancher neatly, and take a Cup of Sack, and a Capons
leg contentedly.


You are a slave
That feeds upon my brother like a fly,
Poisoning where thou dost suck.

You lie.

O, to my grief I speak it, you shall find,
There's no more difference in a Tauern-haunter
Then is between a Spittle and a Beggar.

Thou workst on him like Tempests on a ship.

And he the worthy Traffic that doth sink.

Thou makst his name more loathsome then a grave.

Lives like a Dog, by vomit,

Die a slave?

Do, fight: I love you all well, because you were my old masters sons, but
I'll neither part you, nor be partaker with you. I come to bring my mast, news,
he hath two sons borne at a birth in Yorkshire, and I find him together by the
ears with his brothers in a Tavern in London. Brother and brother at ods, tis
nought: sure, it was not thus in the days of charity. Whats this world like to?
Faith just like an Inne-keepers Chamber-pot, receives all waters, good and bad,
It had need of much scouring. My old mast kept a good house, and twenty or
thirty tall sword and Buckler men about him, and y faith his son differs not
much, he will have mettle to, tho he hath not store of Cutlers blades, he will
have plenty of Vintners pots. His father kept a good house for honest men, his
Tenants, that brought him in part, and his son keeps a bad de house with Knaves
that help to consume al. Tis but the change of time: why should any man
repyne at it: Crekits, good living, and lucky worms, were wont to feed, sing,
and rejoice in the fathers chimney, and now Carrion Crows builds in the sons
Kitchen, I could be sorry for it, but I am too old to weep. Well then, I will
go tel him news of his of-springs.


Alas good Brothers, how came this mischance?


Our portions, our brother hath given us our portions sister, hath he not?


He would not be so monstrous I am sure.


Excuse him not, he is more degenerate,
Then greedy Vipers that devour their mother,
They eat on her but to preserve themselves,
And he consumes himself, and Beggars us.
A Tavern is his Inn, where amongst Slaves,
He kills his substance, making pots the graves
To bury that which our forefathers gave.
I asked him for our portions, told him that you
Were brought to London, and we were in want,
Humbly we craved our own, when his Reply
Was, he knew none we had, beg, starve, or d^e.

Alas what course is left for us to live by then?

In troth sister, we two to beg in the fields,
And you to betake your self to the old trade,
Filling of small Cans in the suburbs.

Shall I be left then like a common road,
That every beast that can but pay his told
May travel over, and like to Cammomil,
Flourish the better being trodden on.

Well I will not curse him: he seeds now upon Sack Anchoues with a pox to
him: but if he be not fain before he dies to eat Acornes, let me live with
nothing but pollerd, and my mouth be made a Cooking stool for every scold to
set her tail on.


How now Butler, whats the meaning of this?


Your brother means to lame as many as he can, that is a beggar himself, many
live with him in the Hospital. His wise sent me out of Yorkshire, to tell him,
that God had blessed him with two sons, he bids a plague of them, a vengeance
of her, crosses me ore the pate, and sends me to the Surgeons to seek
salve: I looked at least he should have given me a brace of Angels for my
pains.


Thou hast not lost all thy longing, I am sure he hath given thee a cracked
crown.


A plague on his fingers, I cannot tel, he is your Brother my master, I would
be loath to Prophecy of him, but who soere doth curse his Children being
Infants, ban his wife lying in childbed, and beats his man brings him news of
it, they may be borne rich, but they shall live Slaves, be Knaves, and die
Beggars.


Did he do so.


Guess you, he bid a plague of them, a vengeance on her, sent me to the
Surgeons.


Why then I see there is no hope of him. Some husbands are respectles of their
wives,
During the time that they are yssulesse,
But none with Infants blessed, can nourish hate,
But love the mother for the childrens sake.

But he that is given over unto sin,
Leprosed therewith without, and so within,
O Butler, we were issue to one father?

And he was an honest Gentleman.

Whose hopes were better then the sun he left,
Should set so soon, unto his houses shame.
He lives in Taverns, spending of his wealth,
And here his Brothers and distressed Sister,
Not having any means to help us with.

Not a Scots Baubee (by this hand) to bless us with.

And not content to riot out his own,
But he detains our portions: suffers us
In this strange Air, open to every wrack,
Whilst he in riot swims to be in lack.

The mores the pity.

I know not what course to take me to,
Honesty fain would live: What shall I do?

Sooth I'll tell you, your brother hath hurt us,
We three will hurt you, and then go all to a spittle together.

Jest not at her, whose burden is too grievous,
But rather lend a means how to relieve us.

Well I do pity you, and the rather because you sale, you would fain live
honest and want means for it, for I can tell you tis as strange here to see a
maid fair, poor, and honest, as to see a Collier with a clean face. Maids
here do live (especially without maintenance)

Like Mice going to a trap,
They nibble long* at last they get a clap.
Your father was my good Benifactor, and gave me a house whilst I live to put
my head in: for I would be loath then to see his only daughter, for want of
means, turn punk, I have a drift to keep you honest. Have you a care to
keep your self so, yet you shall not know of it, for women's tounges are like
siues, they will hold nothing, they have power to vent. You two will further
m^*


In any thing good honest Butler.


Ift be to take a purse I'll be one.


Perhaps thou speak righter then thou art aware of: well, as chance it, I
have received my wages: there is forty shillings for you, I'll set you in a
lodging, and till you hear from us, let that provide for you, we'll first to
the surgeons,

To keep you honest, and to keep you brave,
For once an honest man, will turn a Knave.

Boy* bear the Torch fair: Now am I armed to fight with a Wind-mill, and to
take the wall of an Emperor: Much drink, no money: A heavy head, and a light
pair of heals.


O, stand man?


I wear an excellent creature to make a Punk of, I should down with the least
touch of a knaves finger, thou hast made a good night of this: What hast won
Frank?


A matter of nothing, some hundred pounds.


This is the hell of al gamsters* I think when they are at play, the board
ea^es up the mo^ey: For if there be five hundred pound lost, there's never but a
hundred pounds won. Boy, take the wall of any man, and yet by light, such
deeds of darkness may not be.


What dost mean by that Will?


To save charge, and walk like a Fury with a fire-brande in my hand, every one
goes by the light, weel go by the smoke.


Boy, keep the Wall: I will not budge for any man, by these Thumbs, and the
paring of the Nails shall stick in thy teeth not for a world.


Whose this, young Scarborrow?


The man that the Mare^id on.


Is this the reverence that you owe to me?


You should have brought me up better.


That vice should thus transform man to a beast.


Go to, your names Lord, I'll talk with you when your out a debt and ha better
clothes.


I pity thee even with my very soul.


Pity ith thy throat, I can drink Muscadine and Eggs, and Muld sack, do you
hear: you put a piece of turned stuff upon me, but I will -


What will you do Sir?


Peace in thy way, and that's no slander.


Your sober blood will teach you otherwise.


My honoured Lord, your happily well met,


Ill met to see your Nephew in this case,
More like a brute Beast, then a Gentleman.

Fi: Nephew, shame you not thus to transform your self?

Can your nose smell a Torch.

Be not so wild, it is thine Uncle Scarborrow.

Why then tis the more likely tis my Fathers brother.

Shame to our name, to make thy self a Beast,
Thy body worthy borne, and thy youths breast
Tyld in due time for better discipline.

Thy self new married to a Noble house,
Rich in possessions, and Posterity,
Which should cal home thy unstaid affections.

Where thou makst havoc.

Riot, spoil, and wast,

Of what thy father left.

And lives disgracst.

I'll send you shorter to heaven, then you came to the earth, do you Catechize?
Do you Catechize?


Hold, hold, do you draw upon your uncle?


Pox of that Lord,
We'll meet at Mitre, where we'll sup down sorrow,
We are drunk to night, and so we'll be to morrow.

Why now I see: what I hard of, I believed not,
Your kinsman lives.

Like to a swine.


A perfect Epythite he feeds on draff,
And wallowes in the mire, to make men laugh,
I pity him.

No pities fit for him.

Yet we'll advise him.

He is my kinsman.

Being in the pit where many do fall in,
We will both comfort him, and counsel him.

What shall we do now Butler?


A man had better lyne a good handsome pair of gallows before his time, then
be born to do these sucklings good, their mothers milk not wrung out of their
nose yet, they know no more how to behave themselves in this honest and
needful calling of Purse-taking, then I do to piece stockings.


Sfut what shall we do now?


See if they do not quake like a trembling. Asp-leafe, and look more miserable
then one of the wicked Elders picturd in the painted cloth, should they but
come to the credit to be arraind for their valor, before a worshipful bench,
their very looks would hang 'em, and they were indighted but for stealing of
Eggs.


Butler.


Honest Butler.


Squat hart squat, creep me into these Bushes, lye me as close to the ground
as you would do to a wench.


How good Butler, show v^how.


By the Moon patroness of all purse-takers, who would be troubled with such
Changelings, squat hart squat.


Thus Butler.


I so suckling, so, stir not now, If the peering Rogues chance to go over
you, yet stir not younger Brothers call you em and have no more forecast, I
am ashamed of you, these are such whose fathers had need leave them money, even
to make them ready withal, for by this hilts, they have not wit to butten
their sleeves without teaching, close, squat close. Now if the lot of hauging
do fall to my share, so, then the Fathers old man drops for his young masters.
If it chance it chances and when it chances, heaven and the Sheriff send me a
good rope, I wold not go up the lather twice for any thing, in the mean time
preuentious, honest preventions do well, off with my skin, so you on the
ground, and I to this tree to escape the Gallows.


Do follow, if I do not deceive you, I'll bid a pox of this wit, and hang with
a good grace.


Up to this wood they took, search near my friends, I am this morn robbed of
three hundred pound.


I am sorry there was not four to ha^ made even money now by the Devils
horns, tis Sir Iohn Harcop.


Leave not a bush vnbeare, nor tree unsearched, as sure as I was robbed the
thieves went this way.


Theirs Nobody I perceive but may lie at sometime for one of them climbd this
ways.


Stand, I hear a voice, and here's an Owl in an Ivy bush.


You lie, tis an old Serving-man in a Nut-tree.


Sirrah, sir, what make you in that tree.


Gathring of Nuts, that such fools as you are may crack the shells, and I eat
the kernels.


What fellows that?


Sir Iohn Harcop, my Noble Knight, I am glad of your good health, you hear
your Age fair, you keep a good house, I ha fed at your board, and bin drunk
in your buttery.


But sirha: what made you in that tree?
My man and I at foot of yonder hill
Were by three kanues robbed of three hundred pound.

A shrewd loss berlady sir, but your good worship may now see the fruit of
being miserable: You will ride but with one man to save hors-meat and mans meat
at your Inn at night, lose three hundred pound in a morning.


Sirha, I say I ha lost three hundred pound.


And I say sir, I wish all miserable knights might be served so: For had you
kept half a dozen tall fellows, as a man of your coat should do, they would
have helped now to keep your money.


But tell me sir, why lurkt you in that tree?


Mary, I will tell you sir, Coming to the top of the hill where you (Right
worshipful) were robbed at the bottom, seeing some a scuffling together, my mind
strait gave me there were knaves abroad. Now sir, I knowing my self to be old,
tough, and unwieldy, not being able to do as I would, as much as to say*
Rescue you (right Worshipful,) I like an honest man, one of the Kings liege
people, and a good subject


A says well Sir.

Got me up to the top of that tree: The tree (if it could speak) would bear
me witness, that there I might see which way the knaves took, then to tell
you of it, and you right worshipfullie to send hue to cry after em.


Was it so.


Nay twas so sir.


Nay then I tell thee they took into this wood.


And I tell thee (setting thy worsh. knighthood aside) he lies in his throat
that sa^es so: Had not one of them a white Frock? Did they not bind your
worships knighthood by the thumbs? then fagoted you and the fool your man,
back to back.


He says true.


Why then so truly, came not they into this wood, but took over the Lawns,
left Winno steeple on the left hand.


It may be so, by this they are out of reach, Well, farewell it.


Ride with more men, good knight.


It shall teach me wit.


So, If this be not played a weapon beyond a Schollers Prize, let me be hist
at. Now to the next. Come out you Hedghogs?


O Butler, thou deserust to be chronicled for this.


Do not belly me, If I had my right I deserve to be hanged fort. But come, Down
with your dust, our mornings purchase.


Heer tis, Thou hast played well, Thou deserust two shares in it.


Three hundred pound: A pretty breakfast: Many a ma works harde all his days
and never sees half the money. But come, Tho it be badly got, it shall be better
bestowd. But do ye hear Galants, I ha not taught you this trade to get your
livings by. Use it not, for if you do, though I escaped by the Nut tree, be sure
you'll speed by the Rope: But for your pains at this time, There's a hundred
pounds for you, how you shall bestow it, I'll give you instructions. But do you
hear, Look you go not to your Gills, your Punkes, and your Cock-tricks with
it, If I hear you do: as I am an honest thief, tho I helped you now out of the
Briars, I'll be a means yet to help you to the Gallows. How the rest shall be
employed I have determined, and by the way I'll make you acquainted with it.

To steal is bad, but taken where is store,
The faults the less, being don to help the pore

Sure I ha sed my prayers, and liud virtuously a late, that this good fortunes
befallen me. Look Gallants: I am sent for to come down to my Fathers burial.


But dust mean to go?


Troth no, I'll go down to take possession of his land, let the cutry bury him
the will: I'll stay here a while, to save charge at his funeral.


And how dost feel thy self Frank, now thy father is dead?


As I did before, with my hands, how should I feel my self else? But I'll tell
you news Gallants.


Whats that? Dost mean now to serve God?


Faith partly, for I intend shortly to go to Church, and from thence do
faithful service to one woman.


Good, I ha met my flesh-hooks together.


What, Dost mean to be married?


I Mongrel, Married.


That's a bait for me.


I will now be honestly married.


Its impossible, for thou hast bin a whoremayster this seven year.


Tis no matter, I will now marry, And to some honest woman to, and so from hence
her virtues shall be a countenance to my vices.


What shall she be, prithee?


No Lady, no widow, nor no waiting gentlewoman, for under protection

Ladies may lard their husbands heads, Widows will Woodcocks make,
chambermayds of seruigme learn that, they'll ner forsake.


Who wilt thou wed then, prethe?


To any maid, so she be fair: To any maid, so she be rich To any maid so she be
young: and to any maid


So she be honest.


Faith, its no great matter for her honesty, for in these days, that's a
Dowry out of request.


From these Crabes will I gather sweetness: wherein I'll imitate the Be, that
sucks her honey, not from the sweetest flowers, but Timb the bitterest: So these
having been the means to beggar my master, shall be the helps to relieve his
brothers and sister.


To whom shall I now be a suitor?


Fair fall ye Gallants.


Nay, and she be fair she shall fall sure enough. Butler, how Is't good Butler.


Will you be made gallants?


I, but not willingly Cuckolds, tho we are now talking about wives.


Let your wives agree of that after, will you first be richly married?


How Butler: richly married?


Rich in beauty, rich in purse, rich in virtue, rich in all things. But Mum,
I'll say nothing, I know of two or three rich heirs. But Cargo, my fiddlestick
cannot play without Rosin: Avaunt.


Butler.


Dost not know me Butler?


For Kex, dryde Kex, that in summer ha bin so liberal to fodder other men's
cattle, and scarce have enough to keep your own in Winter. Mine are precious
Cabinets, and must have precious Jewels put into them, and I know you to he
merchants of Stockfish, and not men for my market: Then vanish.


Come, ye old mad-cap you, what need all this? Cannot a man ha bin a little
whoore-mayster in his youth, but you must upbraid him with it, and tell him of
his defects, which when he is married, his wife shall find in him? Why my
fathers dead man now, who by his death has left me the better part of a
thousand a year.


Tut, she of Lancashire has fifteen hundred.


Let me have her then, good Butler.


And then she the bright beauty of Leystershire, has a thousand, nay thirteen
hundred a year, at least.


Or let me have her, honest Butler.


Besides, she the most delicate, sweet countenanst, black browd gentlewoman in
Northamptonshire, in substance equals the best of em.


Let me have her then.


Or I.


Or I, good Butler.


You were best play the parts of right fools, and most desperate
whore-maysters, and go together by the ears for the ere ye see them. But they
are the most rare featurd, well faced, excellent spoke, rare qualited,
virtuous, and worthy to be admired gentlewoman,


And rich Butler?


(I that must be one, tho they want all the rest) And rich Gallants, as are
from the utmost parts of Asya, to these present confines of Europe.


And wilt thou help us to them Butler?


Faith, tis to be doubted, for precious pearl will hardly be bought without
precious stones, and I think there's scarce one indifferent one to be found,
betwixt you three: yet since there is some hope ye may prove honest, as by the
death of your fathers. Fathers you are proved rich, walk severally, for I
knowing you all three to be covetous Tug-muttons will not trust you with the
sight of each others beawty but will severally, talk with you, and since you
have deignd in this needful portion of wedlock to be ruled by me Butler,
will most bountifully provide wives for you generally.


Why that honestly said.


Why so, and now first to your Sir Knight


Godamercy.


You see this couple of abominable Woodcocks hear.


A pox on them, absolute Coxcomes.


You heard me tel them, I had Intelligence to give of three Gentlewomen.


True.


Now indeed Sit I ha but the performance of one.


Good.


And her I do intende for you, only for you.


Honest Butler.


Now sir, she being but lately come to this town, and so nearly watched by
the jealous eyes of her friends, she being a Rich heir, least she should be
stolen away by some dissolute Prodigal, or desperate estated spend thrift, as you
ha bin Sir.


O but that's past Butler.


True I knowt, intend now but to make use of them, flatter with them with
hopeful promises, and make them needful instruments.


To help me to the wench,


You ha hit it which thus must beeffected, first by keeping close your purpose.


Good.


Also concealing from them, the lodging beauty and riches of your new, but
admirable Mistress.


Excellent.


Of which your following happiness, if they should know either in envy of your
good, or hope of their own advancement theyd make our labours known to the
gentlewoman's Uncles, and so our benefit be frustrate.


Admirable Butler.


Which done, als but this, being as you shall be brought into her company, and
by my praising your virtues you get possession of her Love, one morning step to
the tower, or to make al sure, hier some stipendary priest for money: for
Money in these days, what will not be done, and what will not a man do for a
rich wife, and with him make no more ado but marry hit in her lodging and
being married, he with her and spare not.


Do they not see us, do they not see us, let me kiss thee, let me kiss thee
Butler, let but this be done, and all the benefit requital and happiness. I can
promise thee fort, shall be this, I'll be thy rich master, and thou shalt carry
my purse.


Enough, meet me at her lodging some half an hour hence: hark she lies.


I hate.


Fail not.


Will I live.


I will but shift of these two Rhinoceros,


Wigens, wingens, a couple of gulls.


With some discourse of hope to wive them two, and be with you straight.


Blessed day, my love shall be thy cushion honest Butler.


So now to my the other Gallants.


O Butler, we ha bin in passion at thy tediousness,


Why look you. I had al this talk for your good.


Had.


For you know the knight is but a scuruy-proud-prating-Prodigall, licentious
unnecessary.


An Ass, an Ass, an Ass.


Now you heard me tel him I had three Wenches in store,


And he would ha had them al would he.


Hear me, tho he may live to be an Ox, he had not now so much of the Goat in
him, but only hopes for one of the three when indeed I ha but two, and knowing
you to be men of more virtue, and dearer in my respect intend them to be
yours.


We shall honour thee.


But how Butler.


I am now going to their place of residence, situate in the choicest place in
the City, and at the sign of the Wolf just against Gold-smiths-row where you
shall meet me, but ask not for me, only walk too and fro and to avoid suspicion
you may spend ^ome conference w^h the Shop-keepers wives, they have seats
built a purpose for such familiar entertainment, where from a bay window which
is opposite, I will make you known to your desired beauties, commend the good
parts you have.


Bith mass mine are very few.


And win a kind of desire, as women are soon won to make you be beloved
where you shall first kiss, then Woe, at length Wed, and at last bed my Noble
harts.


O Butler.


Wenches bona robes, blessed beauties, without colour or counterfeit: Away, put
on you best Clothes, get you to the Barbers, Curl up your hair, walk with
the best strouts you can, you shall see more at the Window, and I ha vowed to
make you.


Wilt thou.


Both Fools, and I'll want of my wit but I'll doot.


We will live together as fellows.


As Brothers.


As arrant knaves if I keep you company,
O, the most wretched season of this time,
These men like Fish, do swim within one stream,
Yet theyd eat one another, making no Conscience
To drink with them theyd poison, no offence,
Betwixt their thoughts and actions have control,
But headlong run, like an vnbiaest Bowl,
Yet I will throw them on, but like to him,
At play knows how to loose, and when to win.

Butler.


O, are you come. And fit as I appointed: so, tis well, you know you knes, and
have instructions howe to bear your selves: Al, al is fit, play but your part,
your states from hence are firm.


What shall I term this creature not a man.

Hes not of mortals temper but hes one,
Made all of goodness, tho of flesh and bone,
O Brother, brother, but for that honest man,
As near to misery had bin our breath,
As where the thundering pellet strikes is death.

I, my shift of shirts and change of cloths knowt.


Well tel of him, like bells whose music rings
One Coronation day for joy of Kings,
That hath preserved their steeples not like towels,
That summons living tears for the dead souls,

Gods preciour Sir, the hell Sir, even as you had new kissed, and were about to
court her, if her Uncles be not come.


A plague on thee, spit out.


But tis no matter Sir, stay you here in this upper chamber, I'll stay beneath
with her, tis ten to one you shall hear them talk now, of the greatness of her
possessions, the care they have to see her well bestowed, the admirablenes of
her virtues, all which for all their coming, shall be but happiness ordained
for you, by my means be your inheritance.


Then thou't shift them away, and keep from the sight of them.


Have I not promised to make you.


Thou hast.


Go to then, rest here with patience, and be confident in my trust, only in
my absence, you may praise God for the blessedness you have to come, and say
your prayers if you will, I'll but prepare her hart for entertainment of your
love, dismiss them, for your free access, and return straight.


Honest-blest-natural-friend, thou deal with me like a Brother: Butler,


As we were saying Brother,
Where shall we find a husband for my Niece.

Marry she shall find one here tho you little knowt, thanks,
Thanks honest Butler.

She is left rich in Money, Plate, and Jewels.

Comfort, comfort to my soul.

Hath all her manner houses richly furnished.

Good, good, I'll find employment for them.

Speak loud enough that he may hear you.

I take her state to be about a thousand pound a year,

And that which my father, hath left me, will make it about fifteen, hundred
admirable.


Indebt to no man, then must our natural care be,
As she is wealthy to see her married well.

And that she shall be as well as the priest can, he shall not,
Leave out a word ont.

I think she has.

What a Gods name.

About four thousand pound in her great chest.

And I'll find a vent fort I hope.

She is virtuous, and she is fair.

And she were foul, being rich, I would be glad of her.

Pisht, pisht.

Come, we'll go visit her, but with this care,
That to no spend-thrift we do marry her.

You may chance be deceived old gray-beardes, ^eares he will spend some of it,
thanks, thanks, honest Butler, now do I see the happiness of my future
estate, I walk me as to morrow, being the day after my marriage, with my
fourteen men in Livery cloaks after me, and step to the wall in some chief
street of the City, tho I ha no occasion to use it, that the Shop-keepers may
take notice how many followers stand bare to me, and yet in this latter age,
the keeping of men being not in request, I will turn my aforesaid fourteen
into two Pages and two Coaches, I will get me self into grace at Court, run
head-long into debt, and then look scurvily upon the City, I will walk you
into the presence in the afternoon having put on a richer suit, then I wore in
the morning, and call boy or sitrah, I will ha the grace of some great Lady
though I pay fort, and at the next Triumphs run a Tilt, that when I run
my course, though I break not my lance: she may whisper to her self, looking
upon my smell, well run my knight I will now keep great horses, scorning to
have a Queen to keep me, indeed I will practise all the Gallantry in use, for
by a Wife comes all my happiness.


Now sir, you ha heard her Uncles, and how do you like them.


O But. they ha made good thy words, I am ravished with the.


And having seen kissed the gentlewo. how do you like her?


O Butler beyond discourse, she's Paragon for a Prince, then a fit Implement
for a Gentleman, beyond my Element.


Well then, since you like her, and by my means, she shall like you, nothing
rests now but to have you married.


True Butler, but withal to have her portion.


Tut, that's sure yours when you are married once, for tis hers by Inheritance,
but do you love her?


O, with my soul.


Ha you sworn as much.


To thee, to her, and ha called heaven to witness.


How shall I know that.


Butler, here I protest, make vows Irrevocable.


Upon your knees.


Upon my knees, with my hart, and soul I love her.


Will live with her.


Will live with her.


Marry her and maintain her.


Marry her and maintain her.


For her forsake al other women.


Nay for her forswear all other women.


In al degrees of Love.


In all degrees of Love, either to Court, kiss, give private favours, or use
private means, I'll do nothing that married men being close whoremaisters do,
so I may have her.


And yet you having bin an open whoremaister, I will not believe you till I hear
you swear as much in the way of contract to her self, and call me to be a
witness.


By heaven, by earth, by Hell, by all that man can swear, I will so I may have
her.


Enough.
Thus at first sight, rash men to women swear,
When such oaths broke, heaven grieves and sheds a tear:
But she's come, ply her, ply her.

Kind Mistres, as I protested, so again I vow, I faith I love you.

And I am not Sir so uncharitable,
To hate the man that loves me.

Love me then,
The which loves you as Angels loves good men,
Who wish them to live with them ever,
In that high bliss whom hell cannot diss ever.

I'll steal away and leave them, so wise men do,
Whom they would match, let them ha leave to wo.

Mistress I hnow your worth is beyond my desert, yet by my praising of your
virtues, I would not have you as women use to do, become proud.


None of my affections are prides children, nor a kin to them


Can you love me them?


I can, for I love al the world, but am in love with none.


Yet be in love with me, let your affections
Combine with mine, and let our souls
Like Turtles have a mutual Sympathy,
Who love so well, that they together die,
Such is my life, who covets to expire,
If it should loose your love.

May I believe you?

In truth you may,
Your lifes my life, your death my dying day.

Sir the commendations I have received from Butler of your birth and worth,
together with the Judgment of mine own eye, bids me believe and love you.


O seal it with a kiss,
Blessed hour my life had never joy till this.

Here about is the house sure.


We cannot mistake it, for here's the sign of the Wolf and the Bay-window.


What so close? Tis well, I ha shifted away your Uncles Mistress, but see the
spite Sir Francis, if you same couple of Smel-smockes, Wentloe and Bartley, ha
not scented after us.


Apoxe on em, what shall we do then Butler?


What but be married straight man.


I but how Butler.


Tut, I never fail at a dead lift, for to perfect your bliss, I have provided
you a Priest.


Where, prethe Butler where?


Where? But beneath in her Chamber. I ha filled his hands with Coin, and he
shall tie you fast with words, he shall close your hands in one, and then do
clap your self into her sheets and spare not.


O sweet.


Down, down, tis the only way for you to get up.
Thus in this task, for others good I toil,
And she kind Gentlewoman weds her self,
Having bin scarcely woed, and ere her thoughts,
Have learned to love him, that being her husband,
She may relieve her, brothers in their wants,
She marries him to help her nearest kin,
I make the match, and hope it is no sin.

Sfut it is scurvy Walking, for us so near the two Counters, would he would
come once?


Mass hes yonder: Now Butler.


O Gallants are you here, I ha done wonders for you commended you to the
Gentlewomen, who having taken note of your good legs, and good faces, have a
liking to you, meet me beneath.


Happy Butler.


They are yours, and you are theirs, meet me beneath I say.
By this they are wed, I and perhaps have bedded,
Now follows whether knowing she is poor,
Heel swear he loved her as he swore before.

Ho Sirrha, who would ha thought it, I perceive now a woman may be a maid, be
married, and loose her maiden-head, and all in half and an hour, and how
doest like me now wench.


As doth befit your servant and your wife,
That owe you love and duty al my life.

And there shall be no Love lost, nor service neither, I'll do thee service at
board, and thou shalt do me service a bed: Now must I as young married men use
to do, kiss my portion out of my young wife. Thou art my sweet Rogue, my Lamb,
my Pigsny, my play-fellow, my pretty pretty any thing, come a bus prithee, so
tis my kind hart, and wats thou what now?


Not till you tel me Sir,


I ha got thee with Child in my Conscience, and like a kind Husband,
methinkes I breed it for thee. For I am already sick at my stomach and long
extremely. Now must thou be my helpful Physician, and provide for me.


Even to my blood,
Whats mine is yours, to gain your peace or good.

What a kind soul is this, could a man have found a greater content in a wife,
if he should ha sought thorough the world for her: Prethy hart as I said, I
long, and in good troth I do, and methinkes thy first child will be borne
without a nose, if I loose my longing, tis but for a trifle too, yet methinkes
it will do me no good unless thou effect it for me. I could take thy keys my
self, go into thy Closet, and read over the deeds and evidences of thy Land,
in reading over them, rejoice I had such blessed fortune to have so fair a wife
with so much endowment, and then open thy Chests, and survey thy Plate, Jewels,
Treasure. But a pox ont, al will do me no good, unless thou effect it for me.


Sir I will show you al the wealth I have,
Of Coin, of Jewels, or Possessions,

Good gentle hart, I'll give thee another bus for that, for that give thee a
new gown to morrow morning, by this hand do thou but dream what stuff and
what Fashion thou wilt have it on to night.


The land I can endow you with, is my Love,
The riches I possess for you is love,
A Treasure greater then is Land or Gold,
It cannot be forfeited, and it shall near be sold.

Love I know that, and I'll answer thee love for. Love in abundance: but come
prithee come, lets see these deeds and evidences, this Money, Plate, and
Jewels, with ha thy Child borne without a nose* if thou be so careless,
spare not, why my little frappet you, I heard thy Uncles talk of thy riches,
that t^ou had hundreds a year, several Lord-ships, Mannours Houles,
Thousands of pounds in your great Chests, Jewels, Plate, and Rings in your
little Box.


And for that riches you did marry me.


Troth I did, as now adays Bachelors do swear I loved thee but indeed married
thee for thy wealth.


Sir I beseech you say not your oths were such,
So like falce coin, being put unto the touch,
Who bear a flourish in the outward show,
Of a true stamp, but truly are not so,
You swore me love, I gave the like to you,
Then as a ship being wedded to the sea,
Dus either sail or sink even so must I,
You being the haven to which my hopes must she.

True Chuck I am thy haven, and harbour too,
And like a ship I took thee, who brings home Treasure
As thou to me, the Marchant-venturer.

What riches I am ballast with are yours.

That's kindly said now,

If but with sand, as I am but with earth,
Being your right of right, you must receive me,
I ha no other lading but my Love.
Which in abund^nce I will render you,
If other fraught you do expect my store,
I'll pay you ^eares, my riches, are no more.

Howes this? howes this? I hope you do but Jest,

I am Sister to decayed Scarborrow.

Ha.

Whose substance your Enticements did consume.

Worse then an Ague.

Which as you did believe so they supposed,
Twas fitter for your self then for another,
To keep the sister, had undone the brother.

I am gulled by this hand. An old Co^ichacher, and beguiled; where the pox now are
my two Coaches, choice of houses, several suits, a plague on them, and I know
not what: Do you hear Puppet, do you think you shall not be damned for this,
to Cousin a Gentleman of his hopes, and compel your self into Matrimony with a
man, whether he will or no with you, I ha made a fair match in faith, will any
man buy my commodity out of my hand, as God save me he shall have her for half
the money she cost me.


O, ha we met you Sir.


What, turned Micher, steal a wife, and not make your old friends acquainted
with it.


A pox on her, I would you had her.


Well, God give you Joy, we can hear of your good fortune, now tis done, tho we
could not be acquainted with it aforehand.


As that you have two thousand pound a year.


Two or three manor houses.


A wife, fair, rich, and virtuous.


Pretty infaith, very pretty.


Store of Gold.


Plate in abundance.


Better, better, better.


And so many Oxen, that their horns are able to store al the Cuckolds in your
Country.


Do not make me mad good Gentlemen, do not make me mad, I could be made a
Cuckold with more patience, then endure this.


For we shall have you turn proud now, grow respectles of your Ancient
acquaintance, why Butler told us of it: Who was the maker of the match for you?


A pox of his furtherance, Gentlemen as you are Christians, vex me no more,
that I am married I confess, a plague of the Fates, that wedding and hanging
comes by destiny, but for the riches she has brought, bear witness how I'll
reward her.


Sir.


Whore, I and Jade, Witch, Ilfacst, stinking-breath, crooked-nose, worse then
the Devil, and a plague on thee that ever I saw thee.


A Comedy, a Comedy.


Whats the meaning of all this, is this the mask after thy marriage.


O Gentlemen, I am undone, I am undone, for I am married, I that could not
abide a Woman, but to make her a whore, hated all Shee-creatures, fair and
poor, swore I would never marry but to one that was rich, and to be thus cun
nicacht. Who do you think this is Gentlemen?


Why your wife, Who should it be else?


That's my misfortune, that marrying her in hope she was rich, she proves to be
the beggarly Sister to the more beggarly Scarborrow.


How?


Ha, ha, ha.


I, you may laugh, but she shall cry as well as I for it,


Nay, do not weep.


He dus but conterfeit now to delude us, he has all her portion of Land, Coin,
Plate, Jewels: and now dissembles thus least we should borrow some Money of him.


And you be kind Gentlemen lend me some, for having payed the Priest, I ha not
so much left in the world, as will higher me a horse to carry me away from her.


But art thou thus gulled infaith.


Are you sure you ha eyes in your head.


Why then, By her brothers setting one in my conscience, who knowing thee now
to ha somewhat to take to, by the death of thy father, and that he hath spent
her portion, and his own possessions, hath laid this plot, for thee to marry
her, and so he to be rid of her himself.


Nay, that's without question, but I'll be revenged of em both, for you Minxe.
Nay Sfut, give em me, or I'll kick else.


Good, sweet.


Sweet with a pox, you stink in my nose, give me your Jewels? Nay Bracelets
too.


O me, most miserable.


Out of my sight, I and out of my doors, for now, whats within this house is
mine, and for your brother

He made this match, in hope to do you good,
And I wear this for which, shall draw his blood.

A brave resolution.


In which wele second thee.


Away, whore, Out of my doors whore.


O grief, that poverty should ha that power to tear:
Men from themselves, tho they wed, bed, and swear.

How now sister.


Undone, undone.


Why Mistress, how is't? how is't?


My husband has forsook me.


O perjury.


Has taine my Jewels, and my Bracelets from me.


Vengeance, I played the thief for the money that bought em.


Left me distressed, and thirst me forth a doors.


Damnation on him, I will here no more,
But for his wrong revenge me on my brother,
Degenerate, and was the cause of all,
He spent our portion, and I'll see his fall.

O but Brother.


Persuade me not.
All hopes are shipwract, misery comes on,
The comfort we did look from him is frustrate,
All means, all maintenance, but grief is gone.
And all shall end by his destruction.

I'll follow and prevent, what in this heat may happen,
His want makes sharpe his sword, to greates the ill,
If that one brother should another kill.

And what will you do Mistress?

I'll sit me down, sigh loud in stead of words,
And wound my self with grief as they with swords.
And for the sustenance that I should eat,
I'll feed on grief, tis woes best rellisht meat.

Good hart I pity you,
You shall not be so cruel to your self,
I have the poor Seruingmans allowance,
Twelve pence adaye to buy me sustenance,
One meal aday I'll eat, the tothet fast,
To give your wants relief. And Mistress
Be this some comfort to your miseries,
I'll ha thin cheeks, ear you shall ha wet eyes.
What is prodigallity? Faith like a Brush
That wears himself to flourish others clothes,
And having worn his hart even to the stump,
Hes thrown away like a deformed lump.
Oh such am I, I ha spent all the wealth
My ancestors did purchase, made others brave
In shape and riches, and my self a knave.
For tho my wealth raised some to paint their door,
Tis shut against me, saying I am but poor:
Nay, even the greatest arm, whose hand hath grast,
My presence to the eye of Majesty, shrinks back,
His fingers cluch, and like to lead,
They are heavy to raise up my state, being dead.
By which I find, spend thriftes, and such am I,
Like strumpets flourish, but are foul within,
And they like Snakes, know when to cast their skin.

Turn, draw, and dye, I come to kill thee.

Whats he that speaks? Like sickness: Oh is't you,
Sleep still, you cannot move me, fare you well.

Think not my fury slakes so, or my blood
Can cool it self to temper by refusal,
Turn or thou die.

Away.

I do not wish to kill thee like a slave,
That taps men in their cups, and brooch their harts,
Ear with a warning piece they have waked their ears,
I would not like to powder shoot thee down,
To aflat grave, ere thou hast thought to frown:
I am no Coward, but in manly terms,
And fairest oppositions vow to kill thee.

From whence proceeds this heat.

From sparkles bred by thee, that like a villain.

Ha.

I'll hallow it in thine ears till thy soul quake to hear it,
That like a villain hast undone thy brothers.

Would thou were not so near me: yet farewell.

By nature, and her laws make us a kin,
As near as are these hands, or sin to sin.
Draw and defend thy self, or I'll forget
Thou art a man.

Would thou were not my Brother?

I disclaim them.

Are we not off-spring of one parent wretch.

I do forget it, pardon me the dead,
I should deny the pains you bid for me.
My blood grows hot for vengeance, thou hast spent
My lives revenues that our parents purchased.

O do not wrack me with remembrance ont.

Thou hast made my life a Beggar in this world,
And I will make thee bankrupt of thy breath:
Thou hast bin so bad, the best I can give,
Thou art a Devil, not with men to live.

Then take a Devils payment.

Hes here, draw Gentlemen.


Die Scarborrow.


Girt round with death.


How set upon by three, Sfut fear not Brother, yon Cowards, three to one,
slaves, worse then Fensers that wear long weapons. You shall be fought withal,
you shall be fought withal.


Brother I thank you, for you now have bin
A patron of my life, forget the sin
I pray you, with my loose and wasteful hours,
Hath made against your Fortunes, I repent em,
And wish I could new joint and strength your hopes,
Tho with indifferent ruin of mine own.
I have a many sins, the thought of which
Like finished Needles prick me to the soul,
But find your wrongs, to have the sharpest point.
If penitence your losses might repair,
You should be rich in wealth, and I in care.

I do believe you Sir, but I must tell you,
Evils the which are against an other done,
Repentance makes no satisfaction
To him that feels the smart. Our father sir,
Left in your trust my portion: you ha spent it,
And suffered me (whilst you in riots house,
A drunken Tavern, spilled my maintenance
Perhaps upon the ground with overflown cups,
Like birds in hardest winter half starved, to fly)
And pick up any food, least I should die.

I prithee let us be at peace together.

At peace for what? For spending my inheritance,
By yonder son that every soul has life by,
As sure as thou hast life I'll fight with thee.

I'd not be moved vntoot.

I'll kill thee then, were thou now clasped
Within thy mother, wife, or childrens armea.

Would homicide? art so degenerate?
Then let my blood grow hot.

For it shall cool.

To kill rather then be killed is manhoods rule.

Stay let not your wraths meet.

Hart, what makst thou here?

Say who are you, or you, are you not one,
That scarce can make a fit distinction
Betwixt each other. Are you not Brothers?

I renounce him.

Shalt not need.

Give way.

Have at thee,

Who stirs, which of you both hath strength within his arm
To wound his own breast, whose so desperate,
To dam himself by killing of himself,
Are you not both one flesh?

Hart, give me way.

Be not a bar betwixt us, or by my sword
I'll mete thy grave out.

O do, for Gods sake do?
Tis happy death, if I may die and you
Not murder one another. O do but harken,
When dus the Sun and Moon borne in one frame
Contend, but they breed Earthquakes in men's harts:
When any star prodigiously appears,
Tells it not fall of kings or fatal years.
And then if Brothers fight, what may men think,
Sin grows so high, tis time the world should sink.

My hart grows cool again, I wish it not.

Stop not my fury, or by my life I swear,
I will reveal the robbery we ha done,
And take revenge on thee,
That hinders me to take revenge on him.

I yield to that, but near consent to this,
I shall then die as mine own, sin affords,
Fall by the law, not by my Brothers swords.

Then by that light that guids me here I vow,
I'll straight to Sir Iohn Harcop, and make known
We were the two that robbed him.

Prethy do.

Sin has his shame, and thou shalt ha thy due.

Thus have I shown the nature of a Brother,
Tho you have proved unnatural to me.
Hes gone in heate to publish out the theft,
Which want and your unkindness forest us to,
If now I die that death and public shame,
Is a Cursive to your soul, blot to your name.

O tis too true, there's not a thought I think,
But must partake thy griefs, and drink
A relish of thy sorrow and misfortune,
With weight of others tears I am ore borne,
That scarce am Atlas to hold up mine own,
And al to good for me. A happy Creature
In my Cradle, and have made my self
The common curse of mankind by my life,
Undone my Brothers, made them thieves for bread,
And begot pretty children to live beggars,
O Conscience, how thou are stung to think vpont,
My Brothers unto shame must yield their blood,
My Babes at others stirrups beg their food,
Or else turn thieves to, and be choked fort,
Die a Dogs death, be percht upon a tree,
Hang betwixt heaven and earth, as fit for neither,
The curse of heaven that's due to reprobates,
Discends upon my Brothers, and my children,
And I am parent to it, I, I am parent to it.

Where are you Sir?


Why starest thou, whats thy hast?


Here's fellows swarm like flies to speak with you.


What are they?


Snakes I think Sir, for they come with stings in their mouths, and their
tongues are turned to teeth to: They claw Villainously, they have eat up your
honest name, and honourable reputation by railing against you, and now they
come to devour your possessions.


In playner Euargy, what are they, speak?


Mantichoras, monstrous beasts, enemies to mankind, that ha double rows of
teeth in their mouths. They are Usurers, they come yawning for money, the
Sheriff with them, is come to serve an extent upon you Land, and then cease
on your body by force of execution, they ha begirt the house round.


So that the roof our Ancestors did build
For their sons comfort, and their wives for Charity,
I dare not to look out.

Besides Sir, here's your poor children.

Poor children they are indeed.

Come with fire and water: tears in their eyes, and burning grief in their
harts, and desire to speak with you.


Heap sorrow upon sorrow? Tell me, are
My brothers gone to execution?
For what I did, for every heinous sin,
Sits on his soul by whom it did begin.
And so did theirs by me. Tell me withal,
My children carry moisture in their eyes,
Whose speaking drops, say father, thus must we
Ask our relief, or die with infamy,
For you ha made us beggars. Yet when thy tale has killed me
to give my passage comfort from this stage,
Say all was done by enforced marriage:
My grave will then be welcome.

What shall we do sir?

Do as the devil dus, hate panther-mankind,
And yet I lie: for devils sinners love,
When men hate men, tho good like some above.

Your wives come in sir.

Thou lie, I ha not a wife. None can be called,
True man and wife, but those whom heaven instald. Say,

O my deer husband?

You are very welcome, peace: wele ha complement.
Who are you Gentlewoman.

Sir your distressed wife, and these your children.

Mine? Where, how begot:
Prove me by certain instance that's divine,
That I should call them lawful, or the mine.

Were we not married sir?

No, tho we heard the words of Ceremony,
But had hands knit as felons that wear fetters
Forsty upon them. For tell me woman,
Did ere my Love with sighs entreat thee mine,
Did ever I in willing conference,
Speak words, made half with tears that I did love thee.
Or was I ever
But glad to see thee as al Lovers are.
No, no, thou know I was not.

O me.

The mores the pity.

But when I came to Church, I did there stand
All water, whose forest breach had drowned my Land,
Are you my wife, or these my children?
Why tis impossible, for like the skies,
Without the suns light, so look al your eyes,
Dark, Cloudy, thick, and full of heaviness,
Within my Country there was hope to see
Me and my issue to be like our fathers,
Upholders of our Country, al our life,
Which should ha bin, if I had wed a wife.
Where now,
As dropping leaves in Autume you look al,
And I that should uphold you like to fall,

Twas, nor, shall be my fault. Heaven bear me witness.

Thou lie? stumpet thou lie?

O Sir.

Peace saucy Jack, strumpet I say thou lie,
For wife of mine thou art not, and these thy Basterds
Whom I begot of thee, with this unrest,
That Bastards borne, are borne not to be Blessed

One me pour al your wrath, but not on them.

On thee, and them, fot tis the end of lust,
To scourge it self, heaven lingering to be just:
Harlot.

Husband.

Bastards.

Father.

What hart not pities this?

Even in your Cradle, you were accursed of heaven,
Thou an Adulteress in thy married arms.
And they that made the match, bawds to thy lust:
I, now you hang the head, should ha done so before,
Then these had not bin Bastards, thou a whore.

I cannot brooked no longer, Sir you do not well in this?

Ha slave.

Tis not the aim of gentry to bring forth,
Such harsh vnrellisht fruit unto their wives,
And to their pretty pretty children by my troth.

How rascal.

Sir I must tel you, your progenitors
Two of the which these years were servant to,
Had not such mists before their understanding,
Thus to behave themselves.

And you'll control me sir.

I, I, will.

You rogue.

I tis, I will tel you tis ungently done
Thus to defame your wife, abuse your children,
Wrong them, you wrong your self, are they not yours?

Pretty, pretty Impudence infaith,

Her whom your are bound to love, to rail against,
These whom you are bound to keep, to spurn like dogs,
And you were not my master, I would tell you.

What slave.

Put up your Bird-spit, tut I fear it not,
In doing deeds so base, so wild as these,
Tis but a Kna, kna, kna.

Rog.

Tut howsoever, tis a dishonest part,
And in defence of these I throw off duty

Good Butler.

Peace honest Mistress, I will say you are wronged,
Prove it upon him, even in his blood, his bones,
His guts, his Maw, his Throat, his Entrails.

You runagate of threescore,

Tis better then a knave of three and twenty,

Patience be my Buckler,
As not to file my hands in villains blood,
You knave Slaue-trencher-groome
Who is your master?

You if you were a master.

Off with your coat then, get you fort a doors.

My cote sir.

I your coat slave.

Sfut when you hate, tis but a thred-bare coat,
And there tis for you: know that I scorn
To wear his Livery is so worthy borne,
And live so base a life, old as I am,
I'll rather be a beggar then your man,
And there's your service for you.

Away, out of my door: Away.
So, now your Champions gone, Minx thou had better ha gone
quick unto thy grave.

O me, that am no cause of it.

Then have subornd that slave to lift his hands against me.

O me, what shall become of me?

I'll teach you tricks for this, ha you a companion.

My hart not suffer me to leave my honest Mistress and her pretty children.


I'll mark thee for a strumpet, and thy Bastards.


What will you do to them Sir.


The Devil in thy shape come back again.


No, but an honest servant Sir will take this cote,
And wear it with this sword to safeguard these,
And pity them, and I am wo for you,
But will not suffer
The husband Viper-like to pray on them.
That love her, and have cherished him as these,
As they have you.

Slave.

I will not humour you,
Fight with you, and loose my life or these
Shall taste your wrong whom you are bound to love.

Out of my doors slave.

I will not, but will stay and wear this coat,
And do you service whether you will or no.
I'll wear this sword to, and be Champion,
To fight for her in spite of any man.

You shall. You shall be my master Sir.

No, I desire it not,
I'll pay you duty even upon my knee,
But loose my life, ere these oppressed I'll see.

Yes goodman slave, you shall be master,
Lie with my wife, and get more Bastards, do, do, do.

O me.

Turns the world upside down, that men orebeare their
Masters, It dus, it dus.
For even as Iudas sold his Master Christ,
Men buy and sell their wives at highest price,
What will you give me? what will you give me? what will you give me?
O, Mistress,
My soul weeps, tho mine eyes be dry,
To see his fall and your adversity,
Some means I have left, which I'll relieve you with,
Into your chamber, and if comfort be a kin
To such great grief, comfort your children.

I thank thee Butler, heaven when he please,
Send death unto the troubled a blessed ease.

In truth I know not if it be good or ill,
That with this endless toil I labour thus,
Tis but the old times Ancient conscience
That would do no man hurt, that makes me doot,
If it be sin that I do pity these,
If it be sin I have relieved his Brothers,
Have plaid the thief with them to get their food,
And made a luckless marriage for his Sister,
Intended for her good, heaven pardon me.
But if so, I am sure they are greater sinners,
That made this match, and were unhappy men,
For they caused all, and may heaven pardon them.

Whose within here.

Sir William, kindly welcome.

Where is my kinsman Scarborrow?

Sooth hes within sir, but not very well.

His sickness?

The hell of sickness, troubled in his mind.

I guess the cause of it,
But cannot now intend to visit him,
Great business for my sovereign hastes me hence,
Only this Letter from his Lord and Guardian to him,
Whose inside I do guess, tends to his good,
At my return I'll see him, so farewell.

Whose inside I do guess turns to his good,
He shall not see it now then, for men's minds
Perplexed like his, are like Land-troubling-winds,
Who have no gracious temper.

O Butler.

Whats the fright now?

Help strait, or on the tree of shame
We both shall perish for the robbery.

What is't reueald man?

Not yet good Butler, only my brother Thomas
In spleen to me* that would not suffer him
To kill our elder brother, had undone us
Is riding now to sir Iohn Harcop straight, to disclose it.

Hart, who would rob with Sucklings:
Where did you leave him?

Now taking horse to ride to Yorkshire.

I'll stay his journey, least I meet a hanging.

I'll parley with the Devil: I, I will,
He gives his council freely, and the cause
He for his Clients pleads, goes always with them,
He in my cause shall deal then: and I'll ask him
Whether a Cormorant may have stuffed Chests
And see his brother starve: why heel say I,
The less they give, the more I gain thereby.

Their souls, their souls, their souls.
How now master? Nay, you are my master?
Is my wives sheets warm? Dus she kiss well?
Good sir.

Foe, makt not strange for in these days,
There's many men lie in their masters sheets,
And so may you in mine and yet: Your business sir?

There's one in civil habit sir, would speak with you.

In civil habit.

He is of seemly rank sir, and calls himself
By the name of Doctor Baxtor of Oxford.

That man undid me, he did blossoms blow
Whose fruit proved poison, tho twas good in show,
With him I'll parley, and disrobe my thoughts
Of this wild frenzy that becomes me not:
A table, candles, stools, and all things fit,
I know he comes to chide me, and I'll hear him,
With our sad conference we will call up tears,
Teach Doctors rules, instruct succeeding years:
Usher him in:
Heaven spare a drop from thence wheres bounties throng
Give patience to my soul, inflame my tongue.

God master Scarborow.

You are most kindly welcome, sooth ye are.

I ha important business to deliver you.

And I have leisure to attend your hearing.

Sir, you know I married you.

I know you did sir.

At which you promised both to God and men,
Your life unto your spouse should like snow,
That falls to comfort, not to overthrow,
And love unto your issue should be like
The dew of heaven, that hurts not tho it strike,
When heaven and men did witness and record
Twas an eternal oath, no idle word*
Heaven being pleased therewith, bleste you with children,
And at heavens blessings, all good men rejoice.
So that Gods chair and footstool, heaven and earth
Made offering at your nuptials as a knot
To mind you of your vow, O break it not?

Tis very true.

Now sir, from this your oath and band,
Faiths pledge, and seal of conscience you ha run,
Broken all contracts, and the forfeiture,
Justice hath now in suit against your soul,
Angels are made the Iurots, who are witnesses
Unto the oath you took, and God himself
Maker of marriage, he that sealed the deed,
As a firm lease unto you during life,
Sirs now as judge of your transgression,
The world informs against you with this voice,
If such sins reign, what mortals can rejoice.

What then ensues to me?

A heavy doom, whose executions
Now served upon your conscience, that ever
You shall feel plagues whom time shall not dissever,
As in a map your eyes see all your life,
Bad words, worse deeds, falce oths, and al the injuries,
You ha done unto your soul, then comes your wife,
Full of woes drops, and yet as full of pity,
Who tho she speaks not, yet her eyes are swords,
That cut your hart-strings, and then your children.

Oh, oho, oh.

Who what they cannot say talk in their looks,
You have made us up, but as misfortunes books,
Whom other men may read in, when presently,
Taskt by your self, you are not like a Thief,
Astonished being accused, but scorch with grief,

I, I, I.

Here stands your wives tears.

Where?

And you fry for them, here lie your childrens wants.

Here?

For which you pine in conscience burn,
And wish you had bin better, or ne'er borne.

Dus all this happen to a wretch like me.

Both this and worse, your soul eternally
Shall live in torment, tho the body die.

I shall ha need of drink then Butler,

Nay all your sins are on your children laid,
For the offences that the father made.

Are they Sir.

Besure they are.

Butler.

Sir?

Go fetch my wife and children hither.

I will sir.

I'll read a Letter to the Doct. too, hes a Divine? I hes a Divine.


I see his mind is troubled, and have made bold with duty to read a Letter
tending to his good, have made his Brothers friends: both which I will
conceal till better temper: He sends me for his wife and children, shall I
fetch em.


Hes a Divine, and this Divine did marry me, that's good, that's good,


Master Scarborrow.


I'll be with you straight Sir,


I will obey him,
If any thing doth happen that is Ill,
Heaven bear me record tis against Butlers will.

And this Divine did marry me,
Whose tongue should be the key to open truth,
As Gods Ambassador. Deliver, deliver, deliver.

Naister Scarborrow.

I'll be with you straight sir,
Salvation to afflicted consciences,
And not give torment to contented minds,
Who should be lamps to comfort out our way,
And not like Firedrakes to lead men astray,
I, I'll be with you straight sir.

Here's your wife and children sir?

Give way then,
I ha my lesson perfect, leave us here*

Yes I will go, but I will be so near,
To hinder the mishap the which I fear.

Now sir, you know this Gentlewoman?

Kind mistress Scarborrow,

Nay pray you keep your seat, for you shall hear,
The same affliction you ha taught me fear,
Due to your self.

To me sir.

To you sir,
You matched me to this Gentlewoman.

I know I did sir.

And you will say she is my wife then.

I ha reason sir, because I married you.

O that such tongues should ha the time to lie,
Who teach men how to live, and how to die,
Did not you know my soul had given my faith,
In contract to another, and yet you
Would ioyn^ this Loom unto unlawful twists.

Sir.

But sir,
You that can see a Mote within my eye,
And with a Cassock blind your own defects,
I'll teach you this, tis better to do ill,
That's never known to us, then of self will,
And these all these in thy seducing eye,
As scorning life make em be glad to die.

Me Scarborrow.

Here will I write, that they which marry wives,
Unlawful live with strumpets al their lives.
Here will I seal the children that are born,
From wombs vnconsecrate, even when their soul
Has her infusion, it registers they are foul,
And shrinks to dwell with them, and in my close,
I'll show the world, that such abortive men,
Knit hands without free tongues look red like them
Stand you and you, to acts most Tragical,
Heaven has dry eyes, when sin, makes sinners fall.

Help master Scarborrow,

Father.

Husband.

These for thy act should die, she for my Clare,
Whose wounds stare thus upon me for revenge.
These to be rid from misery, this from sin,
And thou thy self shalt have a push amongst em,
That made heavens word a pack-horse to thy tongue.
Cotest scripture to make evils shine like good,
And as I send you thus with worms to dwell,
Angels applaud it as a deed done well.

Stay him, stay him.
What will you do sir.

Make fat worms of stinking carcasses,
What hast thou to do with it?

Look who are here sir.

Injurious villen that preuentst me still.

They are your brothers and alliance Sir.

They are like full ordinance then, who once discharged,
A far off give a warning to my soul,
That I had done them wrong.

Kinsman.

Brother.

Husband.

Father.

Hark how their words like Bullets shoot me thorough
And tel me I have undone em, this side might say.
We are in want, and you are the cause of it,
This points at me, y^re shame unto your house,
This tongue says nothing, but her looks do tell,
She's married but as those that live in hell:
Whereby all eyes are but misfortunes pipe,
Filled full of wo by me, this feels the stripe.

Yet look Sir,
Here's your Brothers hand in hand, whom I ha knit so.

And look Sir here's my husbands hand in mine,
And I rejoice in him, and he in me.

I say Cos what is past, the way to bliss,
For they know best to mend, that know amiss,

We kneel, forget, and say if you but love us,
You gave us grief for future happiness.

What al this to my Conscience?

Ease* prom^se of succeeding joy to you,
Read but this Letter.

Which tells you that your Lord Guardians dead.

Which tells you that he knew he did you wrong,
Was greeud fort, and for satisfaction
Hath given you double of the wealth you had.

Increased our portions.

Given me a dowry too.

And that he knew,
Your sin was his, the punishment his due.

All this is here,
Is heaven so gracious to sinners then?

Heaven is, and has his gracious eyes,
To give men life not like intrapping spies.

Your hand, yours, yours, to you my soul, to you a kiss,
In truth I am sorry I ha strayed amiss,
To whom shall I be thankful. All silent:
None speak: whist: why then to God,
That gives men comfort as he gives his rod,
Your portions I'll see paid, and I will love you,
You three I'll live withal, my soul shall love you,
You are an honest servant, sooth you are,
To whom, I these and all must pay amends,
But you I will admonish in cool terms,
Let not promotions hope, be as a string,
To tie your tongue, or let loose it to sting.

From hence it shall not Sir.

Then husbands thus shall norish with their wives.

As thou and I will wench.
Brothers in brotherly love thus link together,

Children and servants pay their duty thus.
And all are pleased.

We are.

Then if all these be so,
I am new wed so ends old marriage woe,
And in your eyes so lovingly being wed,
We hope your hands will bring us to our bed.
