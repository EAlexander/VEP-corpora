WHat lack you sir? fair stuffs, or veluets?


Good morrow Frank.


Good morrow master Balance.


Save you master Long-field.


And you sir, what business draws you toward this end o'th town?


Faith no great serious affairs, only a stirring humour to walk, and partly
to see the beauties of the City; but it may be you can instruct me: pray whose
shop's this?


Why tis Will Rashes fathers, a man that you are well acquainted with.


As with your self; and is that his sister?


Marry is it sir.


Pray let us walk, I would behold her better.


Buy some quaifes, handkerchers, or very good bone-lace Mistress.


None.


Will you buy any handkerchers, sir?


Yes, have you any fine ones?


I'll show you choice, please you look sir?


How now! what news?


Mistress Tickleman has sent you a Letter, and expects your company at night,
and entreats you to send her an angel, whether you can come, or whether you
can not.


Sweet rascal! if your love be as earnest as your protestation, you will meet
me this night at Supper, you know the randeuows, there will be good company, a
noise of choice Fiddlers, a fine boy with an excellent voice, very good songs
and bawdy; and which is more, I do purpose my self to be exceeding merry: but
if you come not, I shall powt my self sick, and not eat one bit tonight.

Your continual close friend, Nan Tickle-man.



I pray send me an angel by this bearer, whether ye can come, or whether ye
cannot. What's the price of these two?


Half a crown in truth, sir.


Hold thee, there's an angel, and commend me to my delight, tell her I will
not fail her, though I loose my freedom by it.


I thank you sir; buy any fine handkerchers?


You are taken sir extremely, what's the object?


She's wondrous fair.


Nay, and your thoughts be on wenching I'll leave you.


You shall not be so unfriendly, pray assist me; We'll to the shop and cheapen
stuffs or satins.


What lack you Gentlemen? fine stuffs, veluets, or satins? pray come near.


Let me see a good satin.


You shall sir, what colour?


Faith I am indifferent, what colour most affects you Lady?


Sir!


Without offence (fair creature) I demand it.


Sir, I believe it, but I never did
Tie my affection unto any colour.

But my affection (fairest) is fast tied
Unto the crimson colour of your cheek.

You relish too much Courtier, sir.


What's the price of this?


Fifteen indeed sir.


You set a high rate on it, it had need be good.


Good! if you find a better in the town, I'll give you mine for nothing: if you
were my own brother, I'd put it into your hands, look upon it, it is close
wrought, and has an excellent glass.


I, I see it.


Pray sir come into the next room; I'll show you that of a lower price shall
(perhaps) better please you.


This fellow has an excellent tongue, sure he was brought up in the Exchange.


Will you come in sir?


No, it is no matter, for I mean to buy none.


Pre thee walk in, what you bargain for, I'll discharge.


Say so; fall to your work, I'll be your chapman.


Why do you say I flatter?


Why? you do;
And so do all men when they women woo.

Who looks on heaven, and not admires the work?
Who views a well cut Diamond, does not praise
The beauty of the Stone? if these deserve
The name of Excellent, I lack a word
For thee which meritst more,
More then the tongue of man can attribute.

This is pretty Poetry, good fiction this: Sir, I must leave you.


Leave with me first some comfort.


What would you crave?


That which I fear you will not let me have.


You do not know my bounty; Say what it is.


No more (fair creature) then a modest kiss.


If I should give you one, would you refrain, on that condition, ne'er to beg
again.


I dare not grant to that.


Then't seems you have,
Though you get nothing, a delight to crave,
One will not hurt my lip, which you may take,
Not for your love, but for your absence sake. So farewell sir.

O fare thee well (fair regent of my soul)
Never let ill sit near thee, unless it come
To purge it self; be as thou ever seem,
An Angel of thy Sex, borne to make happy
The man that shall possess thee for his Bride.

Will you have it for thirteen shillings and six pence? I'll fall to as lowe a
price as I can, because I'll buy your custom.


How now man! what! entranced?


Good sir, ha you done?


Yes faith, I think as much as you, and it is just nothing: where's the wench?


She's here sir, here.


Vds pity! vnbutton man, thou'lt stifle her else.


Nay good sir, will you go?


With all my heart, I stay but for you.


Do you hear sir?


What say?


Will you take it for thirteen?


Not a penny more then I bid.


Why then say you might have had a good bargain; Where's this boy to make up
the wares? here's some ten pieces opened, and all to no purpose.


O Frank* shut up shop, shut up shop.


Shut up shop, boy, why?


My Master is come from the Court knighted, and bid us, for he says he will
have the first year of the reign of his Knighthood kept holiday; here he
comes.


God give your worship joy, sir.


O Frank* I have the worship now in the right kind, the sword of Knighthood
sticks still upon my shoulders, and I feel the blow in my purse, it has cut two
leather bags asunder; but all's one, honour must be purchased: I will give
over my City coat, and betake my self to the Court jacket; as for trade, I
will deal in it no longer, I will seat thee in my shop, and it shall be thy
care to ask men what they lack, my stock shall be summed up, and I will call
thee to an account for it.


My service sir, never deserved so much,
Nor could I ever hope so large a bounty
Could spring out of your love.

That's all one,
I do love to do things beyond men's hopes,
To morrow I remove into the Strand,
There for this quarter dwell, the next at Fulham:
He that hath choice, may shift, the whilst shalt thou
Be master of this house, and rent it free.

I thank you sir.


To day I'll go dine with my Lord Mayor: to morrow with the Sherifes, and next
day with the Aldermen, I will spread the Ensign of my knighthood over the face
of the City, which shall strike as great a terror to my enemies, as ever
Tamberlaine to the Turks.

Come Frank, come in with me, and see the meat,
Upon the which my knighthood first shall eat.

There is a devil has haunted me these three years, in likeness of an
Usurer, a fellow that in all his life never ^at three groat loaves out of his
own purse, nor never warmed him but at other men's fires, never saw a joint of
mutton in his own house these four and twenty years, but always cosoned the
poor prisoners, for he always bought his victuals out of the almes-basket,
and yet this rogue now feeds upon capons which my tenants sent him out of the
Country; he is Landlord forsooth over all my possessions: well, I am spent,
and this rogue has consumed me; I dare not walk abroad to see my friends, for
fear the Sergeants should take acquaintance of me: my refuge is Ireland, or
Virginia; necessity cries out, and I will presently to Westchester. Bubble
hast thou packed up all thy things? our parting time is come: nay pre thee do
not weep.


Affection sir will burst out.


Thou hast been a faithful servant to me, go to thy uncle, he will give thee
entertainment, tell him upon the stony rock of his merciless hart my
fortunes suffer shipwreck.


I will tell him he is an vsuring rascal, and one that would do the
Common-wealth good, if he were hanged.


Which thou hast cause to wish for, thou art his heir, my affectionate
Bubble.


But Master, wherefore should we be parted?


Because my fortunes are desperate, thine are hopeful.


Why but whither do you mean to go Master?


Why to Sea.


To sea! Lord bless us, me thinks I hear of a tempest already, but what will
you do at Sea?


Why as other Gallants do that are spent, turn pirate.


O Master! have the grace of Wapping before your eyes, remember a high tide,
give not your friends cause to wet their handkerchers: nay Master, I'll tell
you a better course then so, you and I will go and rob mine uncle; if we
escape, wee'le dominiere together, if we be taken, wee'le be hanged together at
Tyburne, that's the warmer gallows of the two.


By your leave sir, whereabouts dwells one M. Bubble?


Do you hear, my friend, do you know M. Bubble if you do see him?


No in truth do I not.


What is your business with Master Bubble?


Marry sir, I come with welcome news to him.


Tell it, my friend, I am the man.


May I be assured sir, that your name is master Bubble?


I tell thee, honest friend, my name is master Bubble, Master Bartholomew
Bubble.


Why then sir, you are heir to a million, for your uncle the rich usurer is
dead.


Pray thee honest friend, go to the next Haberdashers, and bid him send me a
new melancholy hat, and take thou that for thy labour.


I will sir.


Vmh, vmh, vmh.


I would the news were true; see how my little Bubble is blown up with it!


Do you hear, my friend, for what do you knock there?


Marry sir, I would speak with the worshipful Master Bubble.


The worshipful! and what would you do with the worshipful Master Bubble? I
am the man.


I cry your worship mercy then, Master Thong the Belt-maker sent me to your
worship, to give you notice, that your uncle is dead, and that you are his
only heir.


Thy news is good, and I have looked for it long,
Thanks unto thee, my friend, and goodman Thong.

Certainly, this news is true: for see another, by this light his Scrivener!
now M. Blancke, whither away so fast?


Master Staines, God save you, where is your man?


Why look you sir, do you not see him?


God save the right worshipful master Bubble; I bring you heavy news with a
light heart.


What are you?


I am your worships poor Scrivener.


He is an honest man it seems, for he has both his ears.


I am one that your worships uncle committed some trust in for the putting out
of his money, and I hope I shall have the putting out of yours.


The putting out of mine! would you have the putting out of money?


Yea sir.


No sir, I am old enough to put out my own money.


I have writings of your worships.


As thou love thy profit, hold thy tongue, thou and I will confer.


Do you hear, my friend, can you tell me when, and how my uncle died?


Yes sir, he died this morning, and he was killed by a Butcher?


How! by a Butcher?


Yes indeed sir, for going this morning into the Market, to cheapen meat, he
fell down stark dead, because a Butcher asked him four shillings for a
shoulder of Mutton.


How stark dead! could not aqua vitae fetch him again?


No sir, nor Rosa solis neither, and yet there was trial made of both.


I shall love aqua vitae rosa solis the better while I live.


Will it please your worship to accept of my poor service, you know my case is
desperate, I beseech you that I may feed upon your bread, tho it be of the
brownest, and drink of your drink tho it be of the smallest, for I am humble
in body, and dejected in mind, and will do your worship as good service for
forty shillings a year, as another shall for 3. pounds.


I will not stand with you for such a matter, because you have been my master,
but otherwise, I will entertain no man without some Knights or Ladies Letter
for their behaviour, Geruase I take it is your christen name.


Yes if it please your worship.


Well Geruase, be a good servant, and you shall find me a dutiful master: and
because you have been a Gentleman, I will entertain you for my Tutor in
behaviour; Conduct me to my palace.


As little children love to play with fire*
And will not leave till they themselves do burn,
So did I fondly dally with Desire:
Until Loves flames grew hot, I could not turn,
Nor well avoid; but sigh and sob, and morn
As children do, when as they feel the pain,
Till tender mother kiss them whole again.
Fie, what unsavoury stuff is this? but she,
Whose mature judgment can distinguish things,
Will thus conceit; tales that are harshest told,
Have smoothest meanings, and to speak are bold:
It is the first-borne Sonnet of my brain,
We sucked a white leaf from my blacke-lipp'd pen
So sad employment,
Yet the dry paper drinks it up as deep,
As if it flowed from Petrarkes cunning Quill.

How now! what have we here, a Sonnet and a Satire coupled together like my
Ladies Dog and her Munkie; As little children c.


Pre thee away, by the deepest oath that can be sworn, thou shalt not read
it, by our friendship I conjure thee, pre thee let go.


Now in the name of Cupid, what want thou, a pigeon, a dove, a mate, a
turtle, dost love foul, ha?

O no, she's fairer thrice then is the Queen,

Whom beauteous Venus called is by name, pre thee let me know what she is thou
love, that I may shunae her, if I should chance to meet her.


Why I'll tell you sir what she is, if you do not know.


No not I, I protest.


Why it is your sister.


How! my sister?


Yes, your eldest sister.


Now God bless the man, he had better choose a wench that has been borne and
bred in an alley, her tongue is a perpetual motion, Thought is not so swift as
it is; and for pride, the woman that had her Ruff poak'd by the devil, is but
a Puritan to her, thou could never have fastened thy affection on a worse
subject, she'll flowt faster then a court-waiting woman in progress, any man
that comes in the way of honesty does she set her mark upon, that is, a
villainous least; for she is a kind of Poetesse, and will make Ballads upon
the calves of your legs: I pre thee let her alone, she'll never make a good
wife for any man unless it be a Leather dresser; for perhaps he, in time, may
turn her.


Thou hast a Privilege to utter this,
But by my life my own blood could not escape
A chastisement for thus profaning her,
Whose virtues sits above men's calumnies,
Had mine own brother spoke thus liberally,
My fury should have taught him better manners.

No more words as you fear a challenge.


I may tell thee in thine ear, I am glad to hear what I do; I pray God send
her no worse husband, nor he no worse wife: do you hear love, will you take
your Cloak and Rapier, and walk abroad into some wholesome air? I do much
fear thy infection, good council I see will do no good on thee, but pursue
the end, and to thy thoughts, I'll prove a faithful friend.


Here's a spacious room to walk in, sir set down the candle, and fetch us
up a quart of Ipocras, and so we'll part.


Nay faith Son, we'll have a pottle, let's ne'er be covetous in our young
days.


A pottle sir, do you hear?


Yes sir, you shall.


How now Wench! how dost?


Faith I am somewhat sick, yet I should be well enough if I had a new gown.


Why here's my hand, within these three days thou shalt have one.


And will you (son) remember me for a new fore-part, by my troth, my old one
is worn so bare, I am ashamed any body should see it.


Why, did I ever fail of my promise?


No in sincerity did thou not.


Here's a cup of rich Ipocras.


Here sister, mother, and master Pursnet; nay good sir, be not so dejected, for
by this wine, to morrow I will send you stuff for a new suite, and as much as
shall line you a cloak clean through.


I thank you, and shall study to deserve.


Here boy, fill, and hang that eurmogin that's good for no body but himself.


Heroickly spoken by this Candle, it is pity thou were not made a Lord.


A Lord! by this Light I do not think but to be Lord Mayor of London before
I die, and have three Pageants carried before me, besides a Ship and an
Unicorn; prentices may pray for that time, for whenever it happens, I will
make another Shrouetuesday for them.


Young master Rash has sent you a quart of Maligoe.


M: Rash! zownds how does he know I am here?


Nay, I know not sir.


Know not! it comes through you and your rascally glib-tongu'd companions, it is
my Masters son, a fine gentleman he is, a boon companion, I must go so him.


Boy, fill us a cup of your maligo, we'll drink to M. Sp^ndall in his absence,
there's not a finer spirit of a Citizen within the walls, here master Pursnet
you shall pledge him.


I'll not refuse it were it puddle: by Styx hs is a bountiful Gentleman, and I
shall report him so: here M Tickleman, shall I charge you?


Do your worst Sergeant, I'll pledge my young Sp^ndall a whole sea, as they
say, fa la la la la, would the Music were here again, I do begin to be
wanton, Ipocras sir, and a dry biscuit; here bawd, a carouse.


Bawd! I faith you begin to grow light ith head, I pray, no more such words,
for if you do, I shall grow into distempers.


Distempers! hang your distempers, be angry with me and thou d^r'st, I pray,
who feeds you, but I? who keeps the feather-beddes from the Brokers, but I?
tis not your sawsege face, thick clouted cream rampallion at home, that
snuffles in the nose like a decayed Bagge-pipe.


Nay, sweet Mistress Tickle-man, be concordant, reverence Antiquity.


Save you, sweet creatures of beauty, save you: How now old Beelzebub, how
dost thou?


Beelzebub! Beelzebub in thy face.


Nay, good words Mistress Swearman, he's a young Gallant, you must not weigh
what he says.


I would my lamentable complaining Lover had been here, here had been a
Supersede as for his melancholy, and in faith Frank I am glad my father has
turned over his shop to thee, I hope I, or any friend of mine, shall have so
much credit with thee, as to stand in thy books for a suite of Satin.


For a whole piece, if you please, any friend of yours shall command me to the
last remnant.


Why God a mercy Frank, what, shall's to dice?


Dice or drink, here's forty crowns, as long as that will last, any thing.


Why there spoke a jingling Boy.


A pox of money, it is but rubbish, and he that hoord's it up, it but a
Scauenger: if there be cards ith house, let's go to Primero.


Primero! why I thought thou had not been so much gamester as to play at it.


Gamester (to say truth) I am none, but what is it I will not be in good
company? I will ^it my self to all humours, I will game with a Gamester, drink
with a drunkard, be civil with a citizen, fight with a swaggerer, and drab
with a whoore-master.


An excellent humour in faith.


Zownds what have we here?


A land Porpoise, I think.


This is no angry, nor no roaring boy, but a blustering boy; now Eolus defend
us, what puffs are these?


I do smell a whore.


O Gentlemen, give him good words, he's one of the roaring boys.


Rogue.


Here sir.


Take my cloak, I must unbuckle, my pickled oysters work; puff, puff.


Puff, puff.


Dost thou retort, in opposition stand.


Out you swaggering Rogue, Zownds I'll kick him out of the room.


Out alas! their naked tools are out,


Fear not (sweet heart;) come along with me.


Thrice happy days they were, and too soon gone,
When as the heart was coupled with the tongue,
And no deceitful flattery or guile:
Hung on the Lovers teare-commixed smile:
Could women learn but that imperiousness,
By which men use to stint our happiness,
When they have purchased us for to be theirs,
By customary sighs and forced tears,
To give us bittes of kindness lest we faint,
But no abundance, that we ever want,
And still are begging; which too well they know
Endeeres affection, and doth make it grow:
Had we these sleights, how happy were we then,
That we might glory over loue-sicke men?
But Arts we know not; nor have any skill,
To fain a sour look to a pleasing will,
Nor couch a secret love in show of hate:
But if we like, must be compassionate;
Yet I will strive to bridle and conceal,
The hid affection which my heart doth feel.

Now the boy with the Bird-bolt be praised: nay faith sister forward, t'was an
excellent passion, come let's hear, what is he? if he be a proper man, and
have a black eye, a smooth chin, and a curled pare, take him wench, if my
father will not consent, run away with him, I'll help to convey you.


You talk strangely sister.


Sister, sister, dissemble not with me, though you do mean to dissemble with
your lover, though you have protested to conceal your affection; by this
tongue you shall not, for I'll discover all as soon as I know the Gentleman.


Discover, what will you discover?


Mary, enough I'll warrant thee, first and foremost, I'll tell him thou readst
loue-passions in print, and speak every morning without book to thy
looking-glasse; next, that thou never sleep, till an hour after the Bell
man; that as soon as thou art asleep, thou art in a dream, and in a dream
thou art the kindest and comfortablest bed-fellow for kissings and embracings;
by this hand, I can not rest for thee, but our father. --


How now! what are you two consulting on, on husbands? you think you loose
time I am sure, but hold your own a little Girls, it shall not be long ere
I'll provide for you: and for you Gartred, I have bethought my self already,

Whirle-pit the usurer is late deceased,
A man of unknown wealth, which he has left
Unto a provident kinsman as I hear,
That was once servant to that unthrift Staines.
A prudent Gentleman they say he is,
And (as I take it) called master Bubble.

Bubble!

Yes nimble-chappes, what say you to that?

Nothing, but that I wish his Christen name were Wa^er.

Sir, I'm at your disposing, but my mind
Stands not as yet towards marriage,
Were you so pleased I would a little longer
Enjoy the quiet of a single bed.

Here's the right trick of them all, let a man
Be motioned to um, they could be content
To lead a single life forsooth, when the harlotries
Do pine and run into diseases,
Eat chalk and oate-meale, cry and creep in corners,
Which are manifest tokens of their longings,
And yet they will dissemble. But Gartred,
As you do owe me reverence, and will pay it,
Prepare your self to like this Gentleman,
Who can maintain thee in thy choice of Gowns,
Of tyres, of servants, and of costly Jewels;
Nay for a need, out of his easy nature,
Mai'st draw him to the keeping of a Coach
For Country; and Carroach for London,
Indeed what might thou not.

Sir, here's one come from Master Bubble, to inuit you to the funeral of his
uncle.


Thank the Messenger, and make him drink,
Tell him I will not fail to wait the coarse,
Yet stay, I will go talk with him my self:
Gartred, think upon what I have told you,
And let me er't be long receive your answer.

Sister, sister.


What say you sister?


Shall I provide a Cord?


A Cord! what to do?


Why to let thee out at the window; do not I know that thou wilt run away
with the Gentleman, for whom you made the passion, rather then endure this same
Bubble, that my father talks of, 'twere good you would let me be of your
council, lest I break the neck of your plot.


Sister, know I love thee,
And I'll not think a thought thou shalt not know;
I love a Gentleman that answers me,
In all the rites of love as faithfully,
Has wooed me oft with Sonnets, and with tears,
Yet I seem still to slight him. Experience tells,
The Jewel that's enjoyed is not esteemed,
Things hardly got, are always highest deemed.

You say well sister, but it is not good to linger out too long, continuance of
time will take away any mans stomach in the world; I hope the next time that he
comes to you, I shall see him.


You shall.


Why go to then, you shall have my opinion of him, if he deserve thee, thou
shalt delay him no longer; for if you can not find in your heart to tell him
you love him, I'll sigh it out for you; come, we little creatures must help
one another.


How cheerfully things look in this place,
Tis always Spring-time here, such is the grace
And potency of her who has the bliss,
To make it still Elizeum where she is:
Nor doth the King of flames in's golden fires,
After a tempest answer men's desires,
When as he casts his comfortable beams,
Over the flowery fields and silver streams,
As her illustrate Beauty strikes in me,
And wrappes my soul up to felicity.

Do you hear sir?


Why sister, what will you do?


By my mayden-head, an oath which I ne'er took in vain, either go down and
comfort him, or I'll call him up, and disclose all: What, will you have no
mercy? but let a proper man, that might spend the spirit of his youth upon
your self, fall into a consumption, for shame sister.


You're the strangest creature, what would you have me do?


Marry, I would have you go to him, take him by the hand, and grype him, say
you're welcome, I love you with all my heart, you are the man must do the feat,
and take him about the neck, and kiss upon the bargain.


Fie how you talk, 'tis mere immodesty,
The commonest strumpet would not do so much.

Mary the better, for such as are honest,
Should still do what the common strumpet will no^:
Speak, will you do it?

I'll loose his company for ever first.


Do you hear sir? here's a Gentlewoman would speak with you.


Why sister, pray sister.


One that loves you with all her heart, yet is ashamed to confess it.


Good sister hold your tongue, I will go down to him.


Do not ieast with me, for by this hand I'll either get him up, or go down
my self, and read the whole History of your love to him.


If you'll forbear to call, I will go down.


Let me see your back then, and hear you? do not use him scurvily you were
best; vnset all your tyrannical looks, and bid him lovingly welcome, or as I
live, I'll stretch out my voice again; vds foot, I must take some pains I
see, or we shall never have this gear cotton: but to say truth, the fault is
in my melancholy Monsieur, for if he had but half so much spirit, as he has
flesh, he might ha boarded her by this. But see, yonder she marches; now a
passion of his side of half an hour long, his hat is off already, as if he
were begging one poor penny-worth of kindness.


Shall I presume (fair Mistress) on your hand to lay my unworthy lip?


Fie upon him, I am ashamed to hear him, you shall have a Country fellow at a
Maie-pole, go better to his work: he had need to be constant, for he is able
to spoil as many Maids as he shall fall in love withal.


Sir, you profess love unto me, let me entreat you it may appear but in some
small request.


Let me know it (Lady) and I shall soon effect it.


But for this present to forbear this place,
Because my father is expected here.

I am gone Lady.


Do you hear sir?


Did you call?


Look up to the window.


What say you Gentlewoman?


Nay pray sir go, it is my sister call's to hasten you.


I call to speak with you, pray stay a little.


The Gentlewoman has something to say to me.


She has nothing, I do conjure you, as you love me, stay not.


The power of Magic can not fasten me, I am gone.


Good sir, look back no more, what voice ere call you,
Imagine, going from me, you were coming,
And use the same speed, as you love my safety.
Wild witted sister, I have prevented you,
I will not have my love yet opened to him,
By how much longer'tis ere it be known,
By so much dearer 'twill be when'tis purchased:
But I must use my strength to stop her journey,
For she will after him: and see, she comes;
Nay sister, you are at furdest.

Let me go you were best, for if you wrestle with me I shall throw you,
passion, come back, fool, lover, turn again, and kiss your belly full;

For here she is will stand you, do your worst:
Will you let me go?

Yes, if you'll stay.


If I stir a foot, hang me, you shall come together of your selves, and be
nought, do what you will, for if here I trouble my self again, let me want
help In such a case when I need.


Nay but pre thee sister be not angry.


I will be angry, vdsfoot, I cannot indu^e such foolery, I, two bashful
fools that would couple together, and yet ha not the faces.


Nay pre thee sweet sister.


Come, come, let me go, birds that want the use of reason and speech, can
couple together in one day, and yet you that have both, cannot conclude in
twenty.


Why what good would it do you to tell him?


Do not talk to me, for I am deaf to any thing you say, go weep and cry.


Nay but sister.


Drawer, bid them make haste at home,
Tell them they are coming from church.

I will sir.


That I should live to be a serving-man, a fellow which scalds his mouth with
another mans porridge, brings up meat for other men's bellies, and carries away
the bones for his own, changes his clean trenchor for a foul one, and is glad
of it, and yet did I never live so merry a life, when I was my masters master,
as now I do, being man to my man, and I will stand too't for all my former
speeches, a serving-man lives a better life then his Master, and thus I prove
it; the saying is, The nearer the bone the sweeter the flesh: then must the
serving-man needs eat the sweeter flesh, for he always pickes the bones.
And again the Proverb says, The deeper the sweeter: There has the serving-man
the vantage again, for he drinks still in the bottom of the pot, he filles
his belly, and never asks what's to pay? wears broad-cloth, and yet dares
walk Wa^ing-stre^te, without any fear of his Drap^r: and for his c^lour^,
they are according to the season, in the Summer he is apparelled (for the
most part) like the heavens, in blew, in the winter, like the earth, in freeze.

But see, I am preu^nted in my Encomium,
I could have maintained this theme these two hours.

Well, God rest his soul, he's gone, and we must all follow him


I, I, he's gone sir Lionell, he's gone.


Why tho he be gone, what then? 'tis not you that can fetch him again, with
all your cunning, it must be your comfort, that he died well.


Truly and so it is, I would to God I had even another uncle that would die no
worse; surely I shall weep again, if I should find my handkercher.


How now! what, are these onions?


I, I, sir Lyonell, they are my onions, I thought to have had them roasted this
morning for my cold: Geruase you have not wept to day, pray take your onions
Gentlemen, the remembrance of death is sharpe, therefore there is a banquet
within to sweeten your conceits: I pray walk in Gentlemen, walk you in, you
know I must needs be melancholy, and keep my Chamber, Geruase, usher them
into the banquet.


I shall sir, please you sir Lyonell.


Well Master Bubble, wee'le go in and taste of your bounty.
In the mean time, you must be of good cheer.

If grief take not away my stomach,
I will have good cheer I warrant you Sprinckle.

Sir.


Had the women puddings to their dole?


Yes sir.


And how did they take them?


Why wi^h their hands, how should they take um?


O thou Hercules of ignorance! I mean, how were they sati^fied?


By my throth sir, but so so, and yet some of them had two.


O insatiable women! whom two puddings would not sati^fie, but vanish
Sp^inckl^; bid your fellow Geruase come hither:

And off my mourning robes, grief to the grave,
For I have gold, and therefore will be brave:
In silks I'll rattle it of every colour,
And when I go by water, scorn a Sculler,
In black carnation velvet I will cloak me,
And when men bid God save me, Cry Tu quoque:
It is needful a Gentleman should speak Latin sometimes, is it not Geruase?

O very graceful sir, your most accomplished Gentlemen are known by it.


Why then will I make use of that little I have,
Upon times and occasions, here Geruase, take this bag,
And run presently to the Mercers, buy me seven ell, of horse flesh coloured
taffeta, nine yards of yellow satin, and eight yards of orange tawny velvet;
then run to the Tailers, the Haberdashers, the Sempsters, the Cutlers, the
Persumers, and to all trades whatsoe'r that belong to the m^king up of a
Gentleman; and amongst the rest, let not the Barber be forgotten: and look
that he be an excellent fellow, and one that can snacke his fingers with
dexterity.


I shall fit you sir.


Do so good Geruase, it is time my beard were corrected, for it is grown so
sawsie, as it begins to play with my nose.


Your nose sir must endure it: for it is in part the fashion.


Is it in fashion? why then my nose shall endure it, let it tickle his worst.


Why now you're ith right sir, if you will be a true Gallant, you must bear
things resolute, as this sir, if you be at an Ordinary, and chance to loose
your money at play, you must not fret and fume, tear cards, and fling away
dice, as your ignorant gamester, or country-Gentleman does, but you must put on
a calm temperate action, with a kind of careless smile, in contempt of
Fortune, as not being able with all her engines to batter down one piece of your
estate, that your means may be thought invincible, never tell your money, nor
what you have won, nor what you have lost: if a question be made: your answer
must be, what I have lost, I have lost, what I have won, I have won, a
close heart and free hand, makes a man admired, a testerne or a shilling to a
servant that brings you a glass of beer, binds his hands to his lips, you
shall have more service of him, then his Master, he will be more humble to
you, then a Cheater before a Magistrate.


Geruase, give me thy hand, I think thou hast more wit then I that am thy
Master, and for this Speech only, I do here create thee my steward: I do long
me thinks to be at an Ordinary, to smile at Fortune, and to be bountiful:
Geruase about your business good Geruase, while^t I go and meditate upon a
Gentleman-like behaviour, I have an excellent gate already Geruase, have I not?


Hercules himself sir, had never a better gate.


But dispatch Geruase, the satin and the velvet must be thought upon, and the
Tu quoque must not be forgotten: for whenever I give Arms, that shall be my
Motto.


What a fortune had I thrown upon me, when I preferred my self into this
fellows service! indeed I serve my self, and not him, for this Gold here
is mine own truly purchased: he has credit, and shall run ith books
for it, I'll carry things so cunningly, that he shall not be able to look into
my actions, my mortgage I have already got into my hands: the rent he shall
enjoy a while, till his riot constrain him to sell it, which I will purchase
with his own money, I must cheat a little, I have been cheated upon,
therefore I hope the world will a little the better excuse me, what his uncle
craftily got from me, I will knavishly recover of him, to come by it, I must
vary shapes, and my first shift shall be in satin:

Proteus propitious be to my disguise,
And I shall prosper in my enterprise.

A Rubber sir.


You shall sir.


And bid those two men you said would speak with me, come in.


I will sir.


Did I not play this Set will?


Excellent well by Phaeton, by Erebus, it went as if it had cut the Line.


God bless you sir.


Master Blank! welcome.


Here's the Gentleman's man sir has brought the money.


Wilt please you tell sir?


Have you the Bond ready master Blank?


Yes sir.


Tis well, Pursenet, help to tell -- 10.11.22. What time have you given?


The thirteenth of the next Month.


Tis well, here's light gold.


'twill be the less troublesome to carry.


You say well sir, how much hast thou told?


In gold and silver here is twenty pounds.


Tis right M. Spendall, I'll warrant you.


I'll take your warrant sir, and tell no further, come let me see the Condition
of this Obligation.


A man may win from him that cares not for it,
This royal Casar doth regard no Cash,
Has thrown away as much in Ducks and Drakes,
As would have bought some 50000 Capons.

Tis very well; so, lend me your pen.

This is the Captain of brave Citizens,
The Agamemnon of all merry Greekes,
A Stukely or a Sherley for his spirit,
Bounty and Royalty to men at arms.

You give this as your deed.

Ma^y do I sir.

Pleases this Gentleman to be a witness.

Yes Mary shall he, Pursenet, your hand.

My hand is at thy service, Noble Brutus.

There's for your kindness master Blank.

I thank you sir.

For your pains.

I'll take my leave of you.

What, must you be gone too, master Blancke?

Yes indeed sir, I must to the Exchange.

Farewell to both, Pursenet,
Take that twenty pounds, and give it mistress Sweatma^*
Bid her pay her Landlord and Apothecary,
And let her Butcher and her Baker stay,
They're honest men, and I'll take order with them.

The Butcher and the Baker then shall stay.


They must till I am somewhat stronger purst.


If this be all, I have my errand perfect.


Here sir, here's for balls, there's for your self.


I thank your worship.


Commend me to your mistress.


I will sir; in good faith 'tis the liberall'st Gentleman that comes into our
Court, why he cares no more for a shilling then I do for a box o'th ear, God
bless him.


Sir, what a clock i'st?


Past ten sir.


Here will not be a Gallant seen this hour.


Within this quarter sir, and less, they meet here as soon as at any
Ordinary in the town.


Hast any Tobacco?


Yes sir.


Fill.


Why thou report miracles, things not to be believed: I protest to thee,
had thou not vnrip't thy self to me, I should never have known thee.


I tell you true sir, I was so far gone, that desperation knocked at mine
elbow, and whispered news to me out of Barbary.


Well, I'm glad so good an occasion staid thee at home,
And mai'st thou prosper in thy project, and go on,
With best success of thy invention.

False dice say Amen, for that's my induction,
I do mean to cheat to day without respect of persons:
When saw thou Will Rash?

This morning at his Chamber, hell be here.


Why then do thou give him my name and character, for my aim is wholly at my
worshipful Master.


Nay thou shalt take another into him, one that laughs out his life in this
Ordinary, thanks any man that wins his money; all the while his money is
loosing, he swears by the cross of this silver, and when it is gone, he
changes it to the hilts of his sword.


Hee'le be an excellent coach-horse for my captain.


Save you Gallants, save you.


How think ye now? have I not carved him out to you?


You have lighted me into his heart, I see him thoroughly.


Ninni-hammer.


Sir.


Take my cloak and rapier also: I think it be early Gentlemen, what time do
you take it to be?


Inclining to eleven sir.


Inclining! a good word; I would it were inclining to twelve, for by my
stomach it should be high Noone: but what shall we do Gallants? shall we to
cards, till our Company come?


Please you sir.


Harry. fetch sir Cards, me thinks 'tis an unseemly fight to see Gentlemen
stand idle, please you to impart your smoke.


Very willingly sir.


In good faith a pipe of excellent vapour.


The best the house yields.


Had you it in the house? I had thought it had been your own: 'tis not so
good now as I took it to be: Come Gentlemen, what's your game?


Why Gleek, that's your only game.


Gleek let it be, for I am persuaded I shall gleek some of you; cut sir.


What play we, twelve pence gleek.


Twelve pence, a crown; vds foot I will not spoil my memory for twelve
pence.


With all my heart.


Honour.


What is't, Harts?


The King, what say you?


You must speak sir.


Why I bid thirteen.


Fourteen.


Fifteen.


Sixteen.


Sixteen, seventeen.


You shall have it for me.


Eighteen.


Take it to you sir.


V^slid I'll not be out-brau'd.


I vie it.


I'll none of it.


Nor I.


Give me a mournauall of aces, and a gleek of queens.


And me a gleek of knaves.


V^slid, I am gleek't this time.


Play.


Equal fortunes befall you Gallants.


Will Rash, well, I pray see what a vile game I have


What's your game, Gleek?


Yes faith, Gleek, and I have not one Court card, but the knave of Clubs.


Thou hast a wild hand indeed: thy small cards show like a troupe of
rebels, and the knave of Clubs their chief Leader.


And so they do as God save me, by the cross of this silver he says true.


Pray, play sir:


Honour.


How go the stocks Gentlemen, what's won or lost?


This is the first game.


Yes this is the first game, but by the cross of this silver here's all of
five pounds.


Good day to you Gentlemen.


Frank, welcome by this hand, how dost lad?


And how does thy wench in faith.


Why fat and plump
Like thy geldings: thou giu'st them both good provender
It seems, go to, thou art one of the madd'st wags,
Of a Citizen 'ith town^, the whole company talks of thee already.

Talk, why let um talk, vdsfoot I pay scot and lot, and all manner of duties
else, as well as the best of um: it may be they understand I keep a whore, a
horse, and a kennel of hownds, what's that to them? no mans purse opens for it
but mine own; and so long, my hownds shall eat flesh, my horse bread, and my
who ore wear velvet.


Why there spoke a courageous Boy.


Vdsfoote, shall I be confined all the days of my life to walk under a
pent-house? no, I'll take my pleasure whiles my youth affords it.


By the cross of these hilts, I'll never play at Gleek again, whilst I have
a nose on my face,
I smell the knavery of the game.

Why what's the matter? who has lost?


Mary that have I, by the hilts of my sword, I have lost forty crowns, in as
small time almost, as while a man might tell it.


Change your Game for dice,
We are a full number for Nouum.

With all my heart, where's M. Ambush the Broker Ninni-hammer?


Sir.


Go to M. Ambush, and bid him send me twenty marks upon this Diamond.


I will sir.


Look you (to make us the merrier) who comes here.


A fresh Gamester, M. Bubble, God save you.


Tu quoque sir.


God save you Master Bubble.


Tu quoque.


Save you sir.


Et tu quoque.


Good master Bubleb


Et tu quoque.


Is your name Master Bubble?


Master Bubble is my name, sir.


God save you sir.


Et tu quoque.


I would be better acquainted with you.


And I with you.


Pray let us salute again.


With all my heart sir.


Behold yonder the oak and the Ivy how they embrace.


Excellent acquaintance, they shall be the Gemini.


Shall I desire your name sir?


Master Scattergood.


Of the Scattergoods of London?


No indeed sir, of the Scattergoods of Hampshire.


Good Master Scattergood.


Come Gentlemen, here's dice.


Please you advance to the Table?


No indeed sir.


Pray will you go?


I will go sir over the whole world for your sake, But in cur^esie I will not
budge a foot.


Here is the Cash you sent me for, and master Rash,
Here is a Letter from one of your sisters*

I have the dice, set Gentlemen.


From which sister?


From the mad-cap, I know by the hand.


For me, six.


And six that.


Nine; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8: eighteen shillings.


What's yours sir?


Mine's a Bakers dozen: master Bubble tel your money.


In good faith I am but a simple Gamester, and do not know what to do.


Why you must tell your money, and hee'le pay you.


My money! I do know how much my money is, but he shall not pay me, I have a
better conscience then so: what for throwing the dice twice, in faith he should
have but a hard bargain of it.


Witty rascal, I must needs away.


Why what's the matter?


Why the lovers can not agree, thou shalt along with me, and know all.


But first let me instruct thee in the condition of this Gentleman, whom dost
thou take him to be?


Nay, he's a stranger, I know him not.


By this light but you do, if his beard were off, 'tis St^ined^.


The devil it is as soon: and what's his purpose in this disguise?


Why cheating, do you not see how he plays upon his worshipful Master, and
the rest.


By my faith he draws apace.


A pox upon these dice, giue's a fresh bale.


Ha ha, the dice are not to be blamed, a man may perceive this is no
Gentlemanly gamester, by his chasing: do you hear, my friend, fill me a glass
of beer, and there's a shilling for your pains.


Your worship shall sir.


Why how now Frank, what hast lost?


Fifteen pounds and upwards: is there never an honest fellow.


What do you lack money sir?


Yes, can furnish me?


Upon a sufficient pawn sir.


You know my shop, bid my man deliver you a piece of three pile velvet, and let
me have as much money as you dare adventure upon it.


You shall sir.


A pox of this luck, it will not last ever:
Play sir, I'll set you.

Frank, better fortune befa'l thee: and Gentlemen, I must take my leave, for I
must leave you.


Must you needs be gone?


Indeed I must.


Et tu quoque?


Yes truly.


At your discretions Gentlemen.


Farewell.


Cry you mercy sir, I am chanced with you all Gentlemen: here I have 7, here
7, and here 10.


It is right sir, and ten that.


And nine that.


Two fiues at all.


One and five that.


V^nh, and can a suite of Satin cheat so grossely? By this light there's
nought on one die but fiues and sixes, I must not be thus gulled.


Come Master Spendall, set.


No sir, I have done.


Why then let us all leave, for I think dinner's ne^e ready.


Your meat's upon the Table.


On the Table! come Gentlemen, we do our stomachs wrong: M. Bubble, what have
you lost?


That's no matter, what I have lost, I have lost; nor can I choose but smile at
the foolishnes of the dice.


I am but your steward Gentlemen, for after dinner I may restore it again.


M. Scatter-good, will you walk in?


I'll wait upon you sir, come Gentlemen, will you follow?


Yes sir, I'll follow you.


Hear you sir, a word.


Ten if you please.


I have lost fifteen pounds.


And I have found it.


You say right, found it you have indeed,
But never won it: do you know this die?

Not I sir.

You seem a Gentleman, and you may perceive.
I have some respect unto your credit,
To take you thus aside, will you restore
What you ha drawn from me unlawfully?

Sir, by your out-side you seem a citizen,
Whose Cockes-comb, I were apt enough to break,
But for the Law; go y' are a prating Jack,
Nor 'ist your hopes, of crying out for clubs,
Can save you from my chastisement, if once
You shall but dare to utter this again.

You lie, you dare pot.


Lie! nay villain, now thou tempest me to thy death.


So 't, you must buy it dearer,
The b^st blood flows within you is the price.

Dare thou resist, thou art no Citizen.


I am a Citizen.


Say thou art a Gentleman, and I am satisfied,
For then I know thou'lt answer me in field.

I'll say directly what I am, a Citizen,
And I will meet thee in the field as fairly
As the best Gentleman that wears a sword.

I accept it, the meeting place.


Beyond the Maze in Tuttle.


What weapon?


Single rapier.


The time.


To morrow.


The hour.


Twixt nine and ten.


Tis good, I shall expect you, farewell.


Farewell sir.


Why I commend thee Girl, thou speak as thou think, thy tongue and thy
heart are Relatives, and thou were not my sister, I should at this time fall in
love with thee.


You should not need, for and you were not my brother, I should fall in love
with you, for I love a proper man with my heart, and so does all the Sex of us,
let my sister dissemble never so much, I am out of charity with these nice and
squeamish tricks, we were borne for men, and men for us, and we must together.


This same plain dealing is a Jewel in thee.


And let me enjoy that Jewel, for I love plain dealing with my heart.


Tha'rt a good wench in faith, I should never be ashamed to call thee sister,
though thou should marry a Broomeman: but your lover me thinks is over
tedious.


No, look ye sir, could you wish a man to come better upon his q, let us
withdraw.


Close, close, for the prosecution of the plot, wench,
See he prepares.

Silence.

The Sun is yet wrapped in Aurora^s arms,
And lulled with her delight, forgets his creatures:
Awake thou god of heate,
I call thee up, and task thee for thy slowness;
Point all thy beams through yonder flaring glass,
And raise a beauty brighter then thy s^fe;
Musicians, give to each Instrument a tongue,
To breathe sweet music in the ears of her
To whom I send it as a messenger.

Sir, your music is so good, that I must say I like it; but the Bringer so
ill welcome, that I could be content to loose it: if you plaid for money, there
'tis; if for love, here's none; if for goodwill, I thank you, and when you
will you may be gone,


Leave me not entranced: sing not my death,
Thy voice is able to make Satires tame,
And call rough winds to her obedience.

Sir, sir, our ears itch not for flattery, here you besiege my window, that I
dare not put forth my self to take the geatle Air, but you are in the
fields, and volley out your woes, your plaints, your loves, your injuries.


Since you have heard, and know them, give redress, True beauty never yet was
merciless.


Sir, rest thus satisfied, my mind was never woman, never altered, nor shall
it now begin: So fare you well.


Sfoot, she plays the terrible tyrannizing Tamberlaine over him, this it is to
turn Turk, from a most absolute complete Gentleman, to a most absurd
ridiculous and fond lover.


Oh, when a woman knows the power and authority of her eye.


Fie upon her, she's good for nothing then, no more then a jade that knows
his own strength: The window is clasped, now brother, pursue your project,
and deliver your friend from the tyranny of my domineering sister.


Do you hear, you drunkard in love, come in to ^s and be ruled, you would
little think^, that the wench that talked so souruily out of the window there,
is more enamoured on thee then thou on her: nay, look you now, see if he turn
not away slighting our good council: I am no Christian if she do not sigh,
whine, and grow sick for thee: look you sir, I will bring you in good
witness against her.


Sir, you're my brothers friend, and I'll be plain with you, you do not take
the course to win my sister, but indirectly go about the bush: you come and
fiddle here, and keep a coil in verse: hold off your hat, and beg to
kiss her hand, which makes her proud. But to be short, in two lines thus it
is:

Who most doth love, must seem most to neglect it,
For those that show most love, are least respected.

A good observation by my faith.


Well this instruction comes too late now,
Stand you close, and let me prosecute my invention,
Sister, O sister, wake, arise sister.

How now brother, why call you with such terror?


How can you sleep so sound, and hear such groans,
So horrid and so tedious to the ear,
That I was frighted hither by the sound?
O sister, here lies a Gentleman that loved you too dearly,
And himself too ill, as by his death appears,
I can report no further without tears;
Assist me now.

When he came first, death startled in his eyes,
His hand had not forsook the dagger hilt,
But still he gave it strength, as if he feared
He had not sent it home unto his heart.

Enough, enough,
If you will have me live, give him no name,
Suspicion tells me 'tis my Geraldine:
But be it whom it will, I'll come to him,
To suffer death as resolute as he.

Did not I tell you 'twould take, down sir down.


I guess what y'ould have me do.


O for a little blood to besprinckle him.


No matter for blood, I'll not suffer her to come near him, till the plot have
taken his full height.


A scarf ore my face, left I betray my self.


Here, here, lie still, she comes,
Now Mereurie, be propitious.

Where lies this spectacle of blood?
This tragic Scene.

Yonder lies Geraldine.

O let me see him with his face of death!
Why do you stay me from my Geraldine?

Because, unworthy as thou art, thou shalt not see
The man now dead, whom living thou did scorn,
The worst part that he had, deserved thy best,
But yet contemned, deluded, mocked, despised by you,
Unfit for aught but for the general mark
Which you were made for, mans creation.

Burst not my heart before I see my Love,
Brother, upon my knees I beg your leave,
That I may see the wound of Geraldine,
I will embalm his body with my tears,
And carry him unto his sepulcher,
From whence I'll never rise, but be interred
In the same dust he shall be buried in.

I do protest she draws sad tears from me,
I pre thee let her see her Geraldine.

Brother, if e're you loved me as a sister,
Deprive me not the sight of Geraldine.

Well, I am contented you shall touch his lips,
But neither see his face nor yet his wound,

Not see his face?

Nay, I have sworn it to the contrary:
Nay, hark you further yet.

What now?

But one kiss, no more.

Why then no more.

Marry this liberty I'll give you,
If you intend to make my speech of repentance
Over him, I am content, so it be short.

What you command is Law, and I obey.

Peace, give ear to the passion.

Before I touch thy body, I implore
Thy discontented ghost to be appeasde:
Send not unto me till I come my self:
Then shalt thou know how much I honoured thee.
O see the colour of his coral lip!
Which in despite of death lives full and fresh,
As when he was the beauty of his Sex:
'twere sin worthy the worst of plagues to leave thee:
Not all the strength and policy of man
Shall snatch me from thy bosom.

Look, look, I think she'll ravish him.

Why how now sister?

Shall we have both one grave? here I am chained,
Thunder nor Earthquakes shall shake me off.

No? I'll try that, come dead man, awake, up with your bag and baggage, and
let's have no more fooling.


And liue's my Geraldine?


Live? faith I,
Why should he not? he was never dead,
That I know on.

It is no wonder Geraldine should live,
Tho he had emptied all his vital spirits,
The Lute of Orpheus spake not half so sweet,
When he descended to th'mfernall vaults,
To fetch again his fair Euridice,
As did thy sweet voice to Geraldine.

I'll exercise that voice, since it doth please
My better self, my constant Geraldine.

Why so la, here's an end of an old Song,
Why could not this have been done before
I pray?

O you're a goodly sister, this is your plot:
Well, I shall live one day to requite you.

Spare me not, for wheresoever I set my affection, although it be upon a
Colliar, if I fall back, unless it be in the right kind, bind me to a
stake, and let me be burned to death with char-coale.


Well, thou art a mad wench, and there's no more to be done at this time, but
as we brought you together, so to part you, you must not lie at rack and
manger: there be those within, that will forbid the banes, Time must shake good
Fortune by the hand, before you two must be great, specially you sister; come
leave swearing.


Must we then part?


Must you part? why how think you? vdsfoote, I do think we shall have as much
to do to get her from him, as we had to bring her to him: this love of women is
of a strange quality, and has more tricks then a Juggler.


But this, and then farewell.


Thy company is heaven, thy absence hell.


Lord who'ld think it?


Come wench.


This ground is firm and even, I'll go no further.

This be the place then, and prepare you sir,
You shall have fair play for your life of me,
For look sir, I'll be open breasted to you.

Shame light on him that thinks his safety lies in a
French doublet.
Nay I would strip my self, would comeliness
Give sufferance to the deed, and fight with thee,
As naked as a Mauritanian Moore.

Give me thy hand, by my heart I love thee,
Thou art the highest spirited Citizen,
That ever Guild-hall took notice of.

Talk not what I am, until you have tried me.

Come on sir.

Now sir, your life is mine.

Why then take it, for I'll not beg it of thee.

Nobly resolved, I love thee for those words,
Here take thy arms again, and if thy malice
Have spent it self like mine, then let us part
More friendly then we met at first encounter.

Sir, I accept this gift of you, but not your friendship,
Until I shall recouer't with my honour.

Will you fight again then?

Yes.

Faith thou dost well then, justly to whip my folly.
But come sir.

Hold, you're hurt I take it.

Hurt! where? zownds I feel it not.

You bleed I am sure.

Sblood, I think you wear a cattes claw upon your
Rapiers point,
I am scratched indeed, but small as 'tis,
I must have blood for blood.

You're bent to kill I see.

No by my hopes, if I can seape that sin,
And keep my good name, I'll never offer't.

Well sir, your worst.

We both bleed now I take it,
And if the motion may be equal thought,
To part with clasped hands: I shall first subscribe.

It were vnmanlinesse in me to refuse
The safety of us both, my hand shall never fall
From such a charitable motion.

Then join we both, and here our malice ends,
Tho foes we came to'^h field, we'll depart friends.

Come, come, follow me knave, follow me, I have the best nose 'ith house, I
think, either we shall have rainy weather, or the vaults vnstop'd: sir,
go see, I would not have my guess smell out any such inconvenience: Do you
hear sir Symon?


Sir.


Bid the Kitchin-maide skowre the sink, and make clean her backside, for
the wind lies just upon it.


I will sir.


And bid Anthonie put on his white fustian doublet, for he must wait to day:
It doth me so much good to stir and talk, to place this, and displace that,
that I shall need no Apothecaries prescriptions, I have sent my daughter this
morning as far as Pimliko to fetch a draught of Darby ale, that it may fetch
a colour in her cheeks, the puling harlotry looks so pale, and it is all for
want of a man, for so their mother would say, God rest her soul, before she
died.


Sir, the Gentlemen are come already.


How knave, the Gentlemen!


Yes sir, yonder they are.


Gods precious, we are too tardy, let one be sent presently to meet the
gerles, and hasten their coming home quickly: how dost thou stand dreaming?
Gentlemen, I see you love me, you are careful of your hour; you may be
deceived in your cheer, but not in your welcome.


Thanks, and Tu quoque is a word for all.


A pretty concise room: sir Lyonell, where are your danghters?


They are at your service sir, and forth coming.


Gods will Geruase! how shall I behave my self to the Gentlewomen?


Why advance your self toward them, with a comely steppe, and in your salute,
be careful you strike not too high, nor too lowe, and afterward for your
discourse, your Tu quoque will bear you out.


Nay, and that be all, I care not, for I'll set a good face on it, that's flat:
and for my nether parts, let them speak for themselves: here's a leg, and
ever a Baker in England show me a better, I'll give him mine for nothing.


O that's a special thing that I must caution you of.


What sweet Geruase?


Why for commending your self; never whilst you line commend your self: and
then you shall have the Ladies themselves commend you.


I would they would else.


Why they will I'll assure you sir, and the more vilely you speak of your
self, the more will they strive to collaud you.


Let me alone to dispraise my self,
I'll make my self the arrantest Cockes-combe within a whole
Country.

Here come the Gipsies, the Sunne-burn'd gerles,
Whose beauties will not utter them alone,
They must have bags although my credit crack for it.

Is this the eldest sir?

Yes marry is she sir.

I'll kiss the youngest first, because she likes me best.

Marry sir, and whilst you are there, I'll be here:
O delicious touch! I think in conscience
Her lips are lined quite through with Orange Tawny velvet.

They kiss exceeding well, I do not think but they have been brought up
too't, I will begin to her like a Gentleman in a set speech: Fair Lady,
shall I speak a word with you?


With me sir?


With you Lady, -- this way, -- a little more, --
So now tis well, vmh --
Even as a Drummer, -- or a Pewterer.

Which of the two no matter,
For one beats on a Drum, the other a Platter.

In good faith sweet Lady you say true*
But pray mark me further, I will begin again.

I pray Sir do.

Even as a Drummer, as I said before, --
Or as a Pewterer.

Very good Sir.


Do -- do -- do.


What do they do?


By my troth Lady, I do not know: for to say truth, I am a kind of an Ass.


How Sir, an Ass?


Yes indeed Lady.


Nay that you are not.


So God ha me, I am Lady: you never saw an arranter Ass in your life.


Why here's a Gentleman your friend, will not say so.


Y faith but he shall: How say you sir,
Am not I an Ass?

Yes by my troth Lady is he: Why I'll say any thing my brother Bubble says.


Is this the man my Father choose for me, to make a Husband of? O God, how
blind are parents in our loves: so they have weath, they care not to what
things they marry us.


Pray look upon me Lady.


So I do sir.


I but look upon me well, and tell me if you ever saw any man look so
scurvily, as I do?


The fellow sure is frantic.


You do not mark me?


Yes indeed sir.


I, but look upon me well:
Did you ever see a worse timberd Leg?

By my faith tis a pretty four square Leg.

I but your four square Legs are none of the best.
Oh! Iaruis, Iaruis.

Excellent well sir.


What say you now to me Lady, can you find ere a good inch about me?


Yes that I can sir.


Find it, and take it sweet Lady:
There I think I bobbed her, Iaruis?

Well sir, disparadge not your self so: for if you were
The man you'd make your self; yet out of your
Behaviour and discourse, I could find cause enough
To love you.

Augh! now she comes to me: My behaviour? alas, alas, tis clownicall; and my
discourse is very bald, bald: You shall not hear me break a good Ieast in a
twelve month.


No sir? why now you break a good Ieast.


No, I want the Boon Jour, and the Tu quoques,
Which yonder Gentleman has: There's a bob for him too:
There's a Gentleman, and you talk of a Gentleman?

Who he? he's a Coxcomb indeed.


We are sworn Brothers in good faith Lady.


Yes in truth we are sworn Brothers, and do mean to go both alike, and to
have Horses alike.


And they shall be sworn Brothers too?


If it please them, Lady.


M. Balance, the Gold smith desires to speak with you.


Bid him come, knave.


I wonder (Sir Lyonell) your son Will Rash is not here?


Is he of your acquaintance, sir?


O very familiar; he struck me a box on the ear once, and from thence grew
my love to him.


It was a sign of virtue in you sir; but heel be here at dinner. Master
Balance, what makes you so strange?

Come, you're welcome: what's the News?


Why sir, the old News: your man Francis royots still,
And little hope of thrift there is in him*
Therefore I come to advise your Worship,
To take some order whilst there's something left,
The better part of his best Ware's consumd.

Speak softly Master Balance.
But is there no hope of his recovery?

None at all sir; for hes already laid to be arrested by some that I know.


Well, I do suffer for him, and am loath
Indeed to do, what I am constrained to do:
Well sir, I mean to cease on what is left.
And hark you one wo^d more.

What heinous sin has yonder man committed,
To have so great a punishment, as wait
upon the humours of an idle Fool:
A very proper Fellow, good Leg, good Face,
A Body well proportiond: but his mind
Betrays he never came of Generous kind.

Go to, no more of this at this time.
What sir, are you come?

Yes sir, and have made bold to bring a Guist along.


Master Geraldines son of Essex?


The same sir.


Ye're welcome sir, when will your Father be in town?


'twill not be long, sir.


I shall be glad to see him when he coms.


I thank you sir.


In the mean time you're welcome; pray be not strange,
I'll leave my Son amongst you Gentlemen,
I have some business: hark you M. Balance,
Dinner will soon be ready; one word more.

And how does my little Asinus and his Tu quoque here? Oh you pretty
sweet-fac'd rogues, that for your countenances might be Alexander and Lodwicke:
What says the old man to you? will it be a match? shall we call Brothers?


I faith with all my heart; if Mistress Gartred will, we will be married to
morrow.


S'fott, if Mistress Joyce will, wee'le be married to night.


Why you courageous Boys, and worthy Wenches, made out of Wax. But what
shall's do when we have dined, shall's go see a Play?


Yes faith Brother: if it please you, let's go see a Play at the Gloabe.


I care not; any whither, so the Clown have a part: For Ifayth I am no body
without a Fool.


Why then wee'le go to the Red Bull; they say Green's a good Clown.


Green? Greene's an Ass.


Where^ore do you say so?


Indeed I ha no reason: for they say, he is as like me as ever he can look.


Well then, to the Bull.


A good resolution, continue it: nay on?


Not before the Gentlewomen; not I never.


O while you live, men before women:
Custom hath placed it so.

Why then Custom is not so mannerly, as I would be.


Farewell M. Scatter-good: Come Lover, you're too busy here, I must tutor
ye: Cast not your eye at the table on each other, my Father will spy you
without Spectacles,

He is a shrewd observer: do you hear me?

Very well sir.


Come then go we together, let the Wenches alone.
Do you see yonder fellow?

Yes: prithee what is he?


I'll give you him within, he must not now be thought on: but you shall know
him.


I have observed my sister, and her eye
Is much inquisitive after yond fellow;
She has examined him from head to foot:
I'll stay and see the issue.

To wrestle against the stream of our Affection,
Is to strike Air, or buffet with the Wind,
That plays upon us: I have strived to cast
This fellow from my thoughts, but still he grows
More comely in my sight; yet a slave
Unto one worse conditioned then a Slave:
They are all gone, here's none but he, and I,
Now I will speak to him: and yet I will not.
Oh! I wrong my self, I will suppress
That insurrection Love hath trained in me,
And leave him as he is: once m^ bold spirits
Had vowed to utter all my thoughts to him
On whom I settled my affection:
And why r^tyres it now?

Fight Love on both sides; for on me thou strik'st
Strokes that hath beat my heart into a flame:
She hath sent amorous glaunses from her eye:
Which I have back returned as faithfully.
I would make to her, but these servile Robes,
Curbs that suggestion, till some fitter time
Shall bring me more perswadingly unto her.

I wonder why he stays; I fear he notes me,
For I have publicly betrayed my self,
By too much gazing on him: I will leave him.

But you shall not; I'll make you speak to him
Before you go. Do you hear sir?

What mean you sister?

To fit you in your kind, sister: do you remember
How you once tyranizd over me?

Nay prithee leave this jesting,
I am out of the vain.

I, but I am in: go speak to your Lover.


I'll first be buried quick.


How, ashamed? S'^ott Itro, if I had set my affection on a Collier, I'd ne'er
fall back, unless it were in the right kind: if I did, let me be tied to a
Stake, and burnt to death with Charcoal.


Nay then we shall hate.


Yes marry shall you. Sister, will you speak to him:


No.


Do you hear sir? here's a Gentlewoman would speak with you.


Why Sister, I pray Sister.


One that loves you with all her heart,
Yet is ashamed to confess it.

Did you call, Ladies?


No sir, here's no one called.


Yes sir twas I, I called to speak with you.


My Sister's somewhat frantic; there's no regard to be had unto her clamours:
Will you yet leave?

In faith you'll anger me.

Passion: Come back fool lover, turn again and kiss your belly full,
here's one will stand ye.


What does this mean tro^*


Yes, is your humour spent?


Come let me go, Birds that want the use of
Reason and of Speech, ca^ couple together in one day;
And yet you that have both, cannot conclude in twenty:
now Sister I am even with you, my venom is spit,
As much happiness may you enjoy with your lover as I with mine:
And droop not wench, not never be ashamed of him,
The man will serve the turn, though he be wrapped
In a blew Coat, lle warrant him, come.

You're merely disposed, Sister.

I needs must prosper, Fortune Love work for me.
Be moderate my Joys; for as you grow to your full height,
So Bubbles waxes low.

Will my sweet Spendall be gone then?


I must upon promise; but I'll be here at supper:
Therefore Mistress Sweatman, provide us some good cheer.

The best the Market will yield.


Here's twenty shillings; I protest I have left my self but a Crown, for my
spending money: for indeed I intend to be frugal, and turn good husband.


I marry will you, you'll to play again, loose your Money and fall to
fighting; my very heart trembles to think on it: how if you had been killed in
the quarrel, of my faith I had been but a dead woman.


Come, come, no more of this; thou dost but dissemble.


Dissemble* do not you say so; for if you do,
Gods my judge lle give my self a gash.

Away, away, prithee no more: farewell.

Nay bus first: Well,
There's no adversity in the world shall part us.

Thou art a loving Rascal; farewell.


You will not fail supper?


You have my word; farewell.


Sir, we arrest you.


Arrest me, at whose suite?


Marry there's suites enough against you,
I'll warrant you.

Come, away with him.


Stay, hear me a word.


What do you say?


How now Purssuet, why come in such haste?

Shut up your doors, and bar young Spendall out,
And let him be cashieard your company,
He is turned Banquerout, his wares are ceazd on,
And his shop shut up.

How, his wares ceazd on? thou dost but jest, I hope.

What this tongue doth report, these eyes have seen,
It is no Aesops fable that I tell,
But it is true, as I am faithful Pander.

Nay I did ever think the prodigal would prove
A Banquerout; but hang him, let him rot
In prison, he comes no more within these doors
I warrant him.

Come hither, I would he would but offer it,
We'll fire him out with a pox to him.

Will you do it;
To carry me to prison, but undoes me?

What say you fellow Gripe, shall we take his 40. shillings.

Yes faith, we shall have him again within this week.

Well Sir, your 40 shillings? and we'll have some compassion on you.

Will you but walk with me unto that house,
And there you shall receive it.

What, where the women are?

Yes sir.

Look yonder, if the ungracious rascal be not coming hither,
Betwixt two Sargiantes: he thinks belike,
That we'll relieve him; let us go in,
And clap the doors against him.

It is the best course Mistres Tickleman?

But I say no, you shall not stir a foot,
For I will talk with him,

Nan, I am come
Even in the Minute that thou did profess
Kindness unto me, to make trial of it,
Adversity thou Sees lays hands upon me,
But Fortie-shillings will deliver me,

Why you Impudent Rogue, do you come to me for Money?
Or do I know you? what acquaintance pray,
Hath ever past betwixt your self and me?

Zounds do you mock us, to bring us to these women that do not know you?

Yes in good Sooth, (Officers I take it you're)
He's a mere stranger here: only in charity,
Sometimes we have relived him with a meal.

This is not earnest in you? Come, I know
My guistes and bounty cannot be soon buried:
Go prithee fetch Forty shillings?

Talk not to me (you slave) of Forty shillings;
For by this light that shines, ask it again,
I'll send my Knife of an earrand in your Guts:
A shameless Rog to come to me for Money?

Is he your Prisoner, Gentlemen?

Yes marry is he.

Pray carry him then to Prison, let him smart for it,
Perhaps twill tame the wildness of his youth,
And teach him how to lead a better life:
He had good counsel here, I can assure you,
And if a would a took it.

I told him still my self, what would insew.

Furies break loose in me: Sargeants, let me go, I'll give you all I have, to
purchase freedom but for a lightning while, to tear yond Whore. Baud, Pander;
and in them, the Devil: for there's his Hell, his habitation; nor has he any
other local place.


No sir, we'll take no Bribes.


Honest Sargeants, give me leave to unlade
A heart ore-chargd with grief; as I have a soul,
I'll not break from you.
Thou Strumpet, that were borne to ruin men,
My fame, and fortune: be subject to my Curse,
And hear me speak it: May thou in thy youth,
Feel the sharpe Whip; and in thy Beldam age,
The Cart: when thou art grown to be
An old Upholster unto Venery,
(A Bawd I mean, to live by Fether-beds,)
Mayst-thou be driven to sell all thou hast
Unto thy Aqua vite Bottle; that's the last
A Bawd will part withal; and line so poor,
That being turned forth thy house, may die at door.

Come sir, ha you done?

A little further give me leave, I pray,
I have a charitable Prayer to end with.
May the French Cannibal eat into thy flesh,
And pick thy bones so clean, that the report
Of thy Calamity, may draw resort
Of all the common Sinners in the town,
To see thy mangled Carcass: and that then,
They may upon it, turn honest; Bawd, say Amen.

Out upon him wicked villain, how he blspheames;

He will be damned for turning Heretic.

Hang him Banquerout rascal, let him talk in Prison,
The whilst we'll spend his Goods: for I did never
Hear, that men took example by each other.

Well, if men did rightly consider't, they should find,
That Whores and Bawds are profitable members
In a Common-wealth: for indeed, tho we somewhat
Impair their Bodies, yet we do good to their Souls;
For I am sure, we still bring them to Repentance.

By Dis, and so we do.

Come, come, will you Dis before: thou art one of them, that I warrant thee
wilt be hanged, before thou wilt repent.


Well, this Love is a troublesome thing, Iupiter bless me out of his fingers:
there's no estate can rest for him: He runs through all Countries, will
travel through the I'll of Man in a minut; but never is quiet till he come
into Middle-sex, and there keeps his Christmas:

Tis his habitation, his mansion, from whence,
Heel never out, till he be fierd.

Well, do not tyrannize too much, least one day he make you know his Deity, by
sending a shaft out of a sparkling eye, shall strike so deep into your heart,
that it shall make you fetch your breath short again.


And make me cry, O eyes no eyes, but two celestial Stars! A pox ont, I'd
as leiue hear a fellow sing throngh the nose. How now Wench^


Keep your station; you stand as well for the encounter as may be: she is
coming on; but as melancholy, as a Base-vyollin Consort.


Which makes thee as Sprightly as the Treble.

Now dost thou play thy prize: here's the honourable Sciense one against
another: Do you hear Lover, the thing is done you wot off; you shall have
your Wench alone without any disturbance: now if you can do any good, why so,
the Silver Game be yours, we'll stand by and give aim, and hallow if you hit
the Clout.


Tis all the assistance I request of you,
Bring me but opportunatly to her presence,
And I desire no more: and If I cannot win her,
Let me loose her.

Well sir, let me tell you, perhaps you undertake
A harder task then yet you do imagine.

A task, what to win a Woman, have opportunity? I would that were a task
ifayth, for any man that wears his wits about him: give me but half an
hours

Conference with the coldest creature of them all,
And if I bring her not into a fools Paradise,
I'll pull out my tongue, hang it at her door for a draw-latch.
Vds^oot, I'd ne'er stand thrumming of Caps for the matter,
I'll quickly make trial of her if she love:
To have her Beauty prays'd, I'll praise it: if her Wit,
I'll commend it: if her good parts, I'll exalt them.
No course shall escape me; for to what soever I saw her inclind too, to that
would I fit her.

But you must not do thus to her, for she's a subtle flouting rogue, that
will laugh you out of countenance, if you solicit her ceriously: No, talk me
to her wantonly, flightly carelessly, and perhaps so you may preuaile as much
with her, as wind does with a Sail, carry her whither thou wilt, Bully.


Well sir, I'll follow your instruction.

Do so. And see she appears; fall you two off from us,
Let us two walk together.

Why did my enquiring eye take in this fellow,
And let him down so easy to my heart;
Where like a Conqueror he ceases on it,
And beats all other men out of my Bossome*

Sister, you're well met,
Here's a Gentleman desires to be acquainted with you.

See, the Serving-man is turned a Gentleman,
That villainous Wench my Sister, has no mercy,
She and my Brother has conspired together to play upon me;
But I'll prevent their sport: for rather then my tongue shall have scope to
speak matter to give them mirth, my heart shall break.


You have your desire sir, I'll leave you;
Grapple with her as you can.

Lady, God save you. She turns back upon the motion,
There's no good to be done by braying for her, I see that;
I must plunge into a passion: now for a piece of Hero and Leander: 'twere
excellent; and praise be to my memory,
It has reached half a dozen lines for the purpose:
Well, she shall have them.
One is no Number; Maids are nothing then
Without the sweet society of Men.
Wilt thou live single still? one shalt thou be,
Though never singling Hymen couple thee.
Wild Savages that drink of running Springs,
Thinks Water far excells all other thing.
They that daily taste neat Wine, despise it.
Virginity albeit some highly prize it,
Compared with Marriage; had you tried them both,
Differs as much, as Wine and Water doth. No?
Why then have at you in another kind.
By the faith of a Soldier (Lady) I do reverence the ground that you walk
upon: I will fight with him that darts, say you are not fair: Stab him that
will not pledge your health; and with a Dagger pierce a Vain, to drink a full
health to you; but it shall be on this condition, that you shall speak first.

Vds-foot, if I could but get her to talk once, half my labour were over: but
I'll try her in an other vain.
What an excellent creature is a Woman without a tongue?
But what a more excellent creature is a Woman that has a tongue, and can hold
her peace? But how much more excellent and fortunate a creature is that man,
that has that Woman to his wife? This cannot choose but mad her;

And if any thing make a Woman talk, tis this. It will not do
tho yet I pray God they have not gulled me:
But I'll try once again.
When will that tongue take liberty to talk?
Speak but one word, and I am satisfied:
Or do but say but Mum, and I am answered?
No sound? no accent? Is there no noise in Woman?
Nay then without direction I ha don.
I must go call for help.

How, not speak?


Not a s^llable, night nor sleep, is not more silent:
She's as dumb as Westminster Hall, in the long vacation.

Well, and what would you have me do?

Why, make her speak.

And what then?

Why, let me alone with her.

I, so you said before, Give you but opportunity,
And let you alone, you'd desire no more: but come,
I'll try my cunning for you: See what I can do.
How do you Sister, I am sorry to hear you are not well,
This Gent. tells me you have lost your tongue, I pray lels see?
If you can but make signs whereabout you lost it,
We'll go look fort': in good faith Sister, you look very pale,
In my conscience tis for grief: will you have
Any comfortable Drinks sent for, this is not the way;
Come walk, seem earnest in discourse, cast not an eye
Towards her, and you shall see weakness work it self.

My heart is swollen so big, that it must vent,
Or it will burst: Are you a Brother?

Look to your self Sir,
The Brazen head has spoke, and I must leave you.

Has shame that power in him, to make him fly:
And dare you be so impudent to stand
Just in the face of my incensed anger?
What are you? why do you stay? who sent for you?
You were in Garments yesterday, befitting
A fellow of your fashion; has a Crown
Purchased that shining Satin of the Brokers?
Or is't a cast Suite of your goodly Masters.

A Cast suite, Lady?

You think it does become you: faith it does not,
A Blew Coat with a Badge, does better with you.
Go untruss your Masters Points, and do not dare
To stop your Nose when as his Worship stinks:
T^a's been your breeding.

Vds'life, this is excellent: now she talks.

Nay, were you a Gentleman: and which is more;
Well Landed, I should hardly love you:
For, for your Face, I never saw a worse,
It looks as if it were drawn with yellow Oacker
Upon black Buckram: and that Hair
That's on your Chin, looks not like Beard,
But as ift had been smeard with Shoemakers Wax.

Vdsfoot, sheele make me out of love with my self.

How dares your Baseness once aspire unto
So high a fortune, as to reach at me:
Because you have heard, that some have run away
With Butlers, Horskeepers, and their fathers Clerks;
You forsooth, cockerd with your own suggestion,
Take heart upon it, and think me, (that am meat,
And set up for your Master) fit for you.

I would I could get her now to hold her tongue.

Or cause, some times as I have past along,
And have returned a Curtcie for your Hat;
You (as the common tricks is) straight suppose,
Tis Love, (sirreuerence, which makes the word more beastly.)

Why, tis worse then silence.

But we are fools, and in our reputations
We find the smart on it:
Kindness, is termed Lightness, in our sex:
And when we give a Favour, or a Kiss,
VVee give our Good names too.

Will you be dumb again.

Men you are called, but you're a viperous brood,
Whom we in charity take into our bosoms,
And cherish with our heart: for which, you sting us.

Vds'foot, I'll fetch him that waked your tongue,
To lay it down again.

Why how now man?

O relive me, or I shall loose my hearing,
You have raysde a Fury up into her tongue
A Parliament of women could not make
Such a Confused noise as that she utters.

Well, what would you have me do?

Why make her hold her tongue.

And what then?

Why then let me alone again.

This is very good I faith, first give thee but oppertunitie, and let thee
alone: then make her but Speak, and let
Thee alone: now make her hold her tongue, and then
Let her alone: By my torth I think I were best to let
Thee alone indeed: but come, follow me,
The Wild-cat shall not carry it so away,
Walk, walk, as we did.

What, have you fetched your Champion? what can he do?
Not have you, nor himself from out the storm
Of my incensed rage; I will thunder into your ears,
The wrongs that you have done an innocent Maid:
Oh you're a couple of sweet: What shall I call you?
Men you are not; for if you were,
You would not offer this unto a Maid.
Wherein have I deserved it at your hands? Have I not been, always a kind
Sister to you; in signs tokens showed it? Did I not send Money to you at
Cambridge when you were but a Freshman, wrought you Purses and Bands; and
since you came toth'Inn's a Court, a fair pair of Hangers? Have you not taken
Rings from me, which I have been fain to say I have lost, when you had paund
them: and yet was never beholding to you for a pair of Gloves?


A Woman's tongue I see, is like a Bell,
That once being set a going, goes it self.

And yet you to join with my sister against me,
Send one here to play upon me, whilst you laugh and leer,
And make a pastime on me: is this Brotherly done?
No it is Barbarous, a Turk would blush to offer it to a Christian: but I will
think on it, and have it written in my heart, when it hath slipped your memories.


When will your tongue be weary?

Never.

How never? Come talk, and I'll talk with you,
I'll try the ninble footmanship of your tongue;
And if you can out-talke me, yours be the victory.

Vds'foot, dost thou stand by, and do nothing?
Come talk, and drown her clamours.

Alas, she's spent yfayth: now the storms over.


Vds'foot, I'll follow her as long as I have any breath.


Nay no more now Brother, you have no compassion,
You see she cries.

If I do not wonder she could talk so long, I am a villain,
She eats no Nuts I warrant her: sfoot, I am almost out of breath
With that little I talked: well Gent. Brothers I might say;
For she and I must clap hands upon it: a match for all this.
Pray go in; and Sister, salve the matter, collogue with her
Again, and all shall be well: I have a little business
That must be thought upon, and tis partly for your mirth;
Therefore let me not (tho absent) be forgotten:
Fare well.

We will be mindful of you sir, fare you well.


How now man, what tyerd, tyerd?


Zounds, and you had talked as much as I did, you would be tyrd I warrant: What,
is she gone in? I'll to her again whilst my tongue is warm: and if I thought
I should be used to this exercise I would eat every morning an ounce of
Lickorish.


Have you sumd up those Reckonings?


Yes Sir.


And what is owing me?


Thirtie-seuen pound odd money,


How much owes the Frenchman?


A fourtnights Commons.


Has Spendall any money?


Not any sir: and he has sold all his Clothes.


That fellow would wast Millions, if he had them;
Whilst he has Money, no man spends a penny:
Ask him money, and if he say he has none,
Be plain with him, and turn him out o'th Ward.

I will sir. Master Spendall,
My Master has sent to you for money.

Money, why does he send to me? does he think
I have the Philosophers Stones, or I can clip or coin?
How does he think I can come by money?

Faith sir, his occasions are so great, that he must have money, or else he
can buy no Victuals.


Then we must starve, belike: Vdsfoot thou see
I have nothing left, that will yield me two shillings.

If you have no money,
You're best remove into some cheaper Ward.

What Ward should I remove in?


Why to the Two-pennie Ward, is likliest to hold out with your means: or if
you will, you may go into the Holl, and there you may feed for nothing.


I, out of the Almes-basket, where Charity appears
In likeness of a piece of stinking Fish:
Such as they beat Bawds with when they are Carted.

Why sir, do not scorn it, as good men as your self,
Have been glad to eat Scraps out of the Almsbasket.

And yet slave, thou in pride wilt stop thy nose,
Scrue and make faces, talk contemptibly of it, and of the feeders; surely
groom.

Well sir, your mallapertnes will get you nothing.
Fox.

H^ere.


A prisoner to the Holl, ^ake charge of him, and use him as scurvily as thou
can you shall be taught your duty sir, I warrant you.


Hence slavish tyrants, instruments of torture,
There is more kindness yet in Whores, then you,
For when a man hath spent all, he may go
And seek his way, they'll kick him out of doors;
Not keep him in as you do, and enforce him
To be the subject of their cruelty.
You have no mercy; but be this your comfort*
The punishment and torturs which you do
Iuflict on men, the Devils shall on you.

Well sir, you may talk, but you shall see the end,
And who shall have the worst of it.

Why villain, I shall have the worst, I know it,
And am prepared to suffer like a Stoicke,
Or else (to speak more properly) like a Stock;
For I have no sense left: dost thou think I have?

Zounds, I think he's mad?

Why, thou art in the right; for I am mad indeed,
And have been mad this two year. Dost thou think
I could have spent so much as I have done
In wares and credit, had I not been mad?
Why thou must know, I had a fair estate,
Which through my riot, I have torn in pieces,
And scattered amongst Bawds, Buffoons, and Whores,
That fawnd on me, and by their flatteries,
Rocked all my understanding faculties
Into a pleasant slumber; where I dreamt
Of nought but joy and pleasure: never felt
How I was luld in sensuality,
Until at last, Affliction waked me:
And lighting up the Taper of my soul,
Led me unto my self; where I might see
A mind and body rent with Misery.

Harry Fox, Harry Eox.

Who calls?

Here's the Bread and Meate-man come.


Well, the Bread and Meate-man may stay a little.


Yes indeed Harry, the Bread and Meat-man, may stay:
But you know our stomachs cannot stay.

Indeed your Stomach is always first up.


And therefore by right, should be fire served: I have a stomach like Aqua
fortis, it will eat any thing:

O Father Gatherscrap, here are excellent bits in the Basket.

Will you hold your Chops further; by and by you'll drivel into the Basket?


Perhaps it may do some good; for there may be a piece of powderd Beef that
wants watering.


Here sir, here's your share.


Here's a bit indeed: whats this to a Gargantua stomach?


Thou art ever grumbling.


Zounds, it would make a Dog grumble, to want his Victuals: I pray give
Spendall none, he came into'th Holl but yesternight.


What, do you refuse it?


I cannot eat, I thank you.


No, no, give it me; he's not yet seasond for our company.


Divide it then amongst you.


To such a one as these are, must I come,
Hunger will draw me into their fellowship,
To fight and scramble for unsavoury Scraps,
That come from unknown hands, perhaps vnwasht:
And would that were the worst; for I have noted,
That nought goes to the Prisoners, but such food
As either by the weather has been tainted,
Or Children, nay sometimes full paunched Dogs,
Have overlickt, as if men had determined
That the worst Sustenance, which is Gods Creatures,
How ever they're abused, are good enough
For such wild Creatures as abuse themselves.
O what a Slave was I unto my Pleasures?
How drowned in Sin, and ouerwhelmd in Lust?
That I could write my repentance to the world,
And force th'impression of it in the hearts
Of you, and my acquaintance, I might teach them
By my example, to look home to Thrift,
And not to range abroad to seek out Ruin:
Experience shows, his Purse shall soon grow light,
Whom Dice wastes in the day, Drabs in the night:
Let all avoid false Strumpets, Dice, and Drink;
For he that leaps in Mud, shall quickly sink.

Yonder's the man.

I thank you.
How is it with you, sir? What on the ground*
Look up, there's comfort towards you.

Belike some charitable Friend has sent a Shilling,
What is your Business?

Liberty.

There's virtue in that word; I'll rise up to you.
Pray let me hear that cheerful word again.

The able, and wel-minded Widow Ra^sby,
Whose hand is still upon the poor mans Box,
Hath in her Charity remembered you:
And being by your Master seconded,
Hath taken order with your Creditors
For day, and payment; and freely from her Purse,
By me her Deputy, she hath discharged
All Duties in the House: Besides, to your necessities,
This is bequeathd, to furnish you with Clothes.

Speak you this seriously?

Tis not my practise to mock Misery.

Be ever praised that Divinity,
That has to my oppressed state raysd Friends:
still be his blessings powered upon their heads:
Your hand, I pray,
That have so faithfully performed their wills:
If ere my industry, joined with their loves,
Shall raise me to a competent estate,
Your name shall ever be to me a friend.

In your good wishes, you requite me amply.

All Fees, you say, are paid? there's for your love.

I thank you sir, and glad you are releast.

How Apparel makes a man respected; the very children in the street do adore
me: for if a Boy that is throwing at his lacke-alent chance to hit me on the
shins: Why I say nothing but, Tu quoque, smile, and forgive the Child with a
beck of my hand, or some such like token: so by that means, I do seldom go
without broken shins.


The blessings of your Mistres fall upon you,
And may the heat and spirit of Hee-lip,
Endue her with matter above her understanding,
That she may only live to admire you, or as the Italian says;
Que que dell fogo Ginni Coxcombie.

I do wonder what language he speaks.
Do you hear my friend, are not you a Conjurer?

I am sir, a perfect Traveller, that have trampled over
The face of this vneuerss. and can speak Greek and
Latin as promptly, as my own natural Language:
I have composed a Book, wherein I have set down
All the Wonders of the world that I have seen,
And the whole scope of my Iornies, together with the
Miseries and lousy fortunes I have endured therein.

O Lord Sir, are you the man; give me your hand:
How do ye: in good faith I think I have heard of you.

No sir, you never heard of me, I set this day footing
Upon the Wharffe, I came in with the last peal of Ordinance,
And dind this day in the Exchange amongst the Merchants.
But this is friuelous and from the matter: you do seem
To be one of our Genteell spirits that do affect Genorositie:
Pleases you to be instituted in the nature, Garb. and habit,
Of the most exactest Nation in the world, the Italian:
Whose Language is sweetest, Clothes nearest, and hauiour
Most accomplished: I am one that have spent much money,
And time; which to me is more dear then money, in the
Observation of these things: and now I am come,
I will sit me down and rest, and make no doubt,
But by quality, to purchase and build, by professing this Art,
Or humane Science (as I may term it,) to such Honourable
And Worshipful personages as mean to be peculiar.

This fellow has his tongue at his fingers ends:
But hark you sir, is your Italian the finest Gentleman?

In the world Signeor, your Spaniard is a mere Bombard to him: he will bounce
indeed; but he will burst: But your Italian is smooth and lofty, and his
language is, Cozen germane to the Latin.


Why then he has his Tu quoque in his salute?


Yes sir, for it is an Italian word as well as a Latin,
And infoldes a double sense: for one way spoken,
It includes a fine Gentleman like your self;
And another way, it imports an Ass, like whom you will.

I would my man Iaruis were here, for he understands these things better
then I. You will not serve?


Serve, no sir, I have talked with the great Sophy.


I pary sir, whats the lowest price of being Italianated?


Sir, if it please you, I will stand to your bounty:
And mark me, I will set your face like a Grand signeors,
And you shall march a whole day, until you come opounctly to your Mistirs,
And not disrancke one hair of your physiognomy.

I would you would do it Sir, if you will stand to my
Bounty, I will pay you, as I am an Italian tu quoque.

Then sir, I will first disburden you of your Cloak,
You will be the nimbler to practise: Now sir, observe me,
Go you directly to the Lady to whom you devote your self.

Yes sir.

You shall set a good stayed face upon the matter then.
Your Band is not to your Shirt, is it?

No sir, tis loose.


It is the fitter for my purpose.

I will first remove your Hat, it has been the fashion (as I have heard) in
England, to wear your Hat thus in your eyes; But it is gross, nought,
inconvenient, and proclaymes with a loud voice; that he that brought it up
first, stood in fear of Sargiants. Your Italian is contrary, he doth advance
his Hat, and sets it thus.


Excellent well: I would you would set on my head so.


Soft, I will first remove your Band, and set it out of the reach of your eye;
it must lie altogether backward: So, your Band is well.


Is it as you would have it!


It is as I would wish; only sir, this I must condition you off; in your
affront or salute, never to move your Hat: But here, here is your
courtesy.


Nay I warrant you, let me alone; if I perceive a thing once, I'll carry it
away: Now pray sir, reach my Cloak.


Never whilst you live, sir.


No, what do your Italians wear no Cloaks?


Your Signeors never: you see I am vnfurnisht my self.


Sa'y so'prethee keep it then. See, yonder's the company that I look for;
therefore if you will set my face of any fashion, pray do it quickly?


You carry your face as well as ear an Italian in the world, only enrich it
with a Smile, and tis incomparable: and thus much more, at your first apparace,
you shall perhaps strike your acquaintance into an ecstasy, or perhaps a
laughter: but tis ignorance in them, which will soon be overcome, if you
persevere.


I will persevere, I warrant thee; only do thou stand aloof and be not seen,
because I would have them think I fetched it out of my own practise.


Do not you fear, I'll not be seen, I warrant you.


Now Widow, you are welcome to my house,
And to your own house too; so you may call it:
For what is mine, is yours: you may command here,
As at home, and be as soon obayde.

May I deserve this kindness of you, sir?

Save you Gent. I salute you after the Italian fashion.

How, the Italian fashion? Zounds, he has dressed him rarely

My son Bubble, I take it?

The nether part of him I think is he,
But what the upper part is, I know not.

By my troth he's a rare fellow, he said true:
They are all in an ecstasy.

I think he's mad?


Nay that can not be* for they ^ay, they that are mad, loose their wits: and
I am sure he had none to loose.


How now son Bubble, how come you thus attyrder
What, do you mean to make your self a laughing stock, ha?

Um; Ignorance, ignorance.

For the love of laughter, look yo^der,
Another Hearing in the same pickle.

The the other Hobby-horse I perceive is not forgotten.

Ha, ha, ha, ha.

Ha, ha, ha, ha.

Who has made him such a Coxcomb troe?
An Italian tu quoque.

I salute you according to the Italian fashion.

Puh, the Italian fashion? the tatterd-de-malian fashion he means.

Save you sweet bloods, save you.

Why but what lig is this?

Nay if I know father, would I were hanged,
I am even as Innocent as the Child new borne.

I but son Bubble, where did you two buy your Felts?


Felts? By this light, mine is a good Beaver:
It cost me three pound this morning upon trust.

Nay, I think you had it upon trust: for no man that has any shame in him,
would take money for it: behold Sir.


Ha, ha, ha.


Nay never do you laugh, for you're in the same block.


Is this the Italian fashion?


No, it is the Fools fashion:
And we two are the first that follow it.

Et tu qu^que, are we both cozend:
Then lets show our selves brothers in adversity, and embrace.

What was he that cheated you?

Marry sir, he was a Knave that cheated me.

And I think he was no honest man, that cheated me,

Do you know him again, if you see him?

Yes I know him again, if I see him:
But I do not know how I should come to see him.
O Iaruis, Iaruis, do you see us two, Iaruis?

Yes sir, very well.

No, you do not see us very well;
For we have been horribly abused:
Never were Englishmen so gulled in Italian, as we have been.

Why sir, you have not lost your Cloak and Hat.

Iaruis you lie, I have lost my Cloak and Hat:
And therefore you must use your credit for another.

I think my old Cloak and Hat, must be glad to serve me till next quarter
day.

Come, take no ca^ for Cloaks, I'll furnish you;
To night you lodge with me, to morrow morn
Before the Sun be up, prepare for Church,
The Widow and I have so concluded on it:
The Wenches understand not yet so much,
Nor shall not, until bedtime: then will they,
Not sleep a wink all night, for very joy.

And I'll promise the next night,
They shall not sleep for joy neither.

O Master Geraldine, I saw you not before:
Your Father now is come to town, I hear?

Yes Sir.

Were not my business earnest, I would see him*
But pray entreat him break an hours sleep
To morrow morn, t'accompanie me to Church;
And come your self I pray along with him.

Sir, I thank you.

But look, here comes one,
That has but lately shook off his Shackles.
How now firra, wherefore come you?

I come to crave a pardon sir, of you,
And with hearty and zealous thanks
Unto this worthy Lady, that hath given me
More then I ere could hope for: Liberty.

Be thankful unto Heaven, and your Master:
Nor let your heart grow bigger then your Purse,
But live within a limit, least you burst out
To Riot, and to Misery again:
For then 'twould loose the benefit I mean it.

O you do graciously, tis good advice:
Let it take root firra, let it take root.
But come Widow come, and see your Chamber;
Nay your company too, for I must speak with you.

Tis bound unto you Sir.

And I have to talk with you too, Mistress Joyce:
Pray a word.

What would you, Sir?


Pray let me see your hand: the line of your Maidenhead is out. Now for your
Finger; upon which Finger will you wear your wedding Ring?


Upon no Finger.


Then I perceive you mean to wear it on your thumb.
Well, the time is come sweet Joyce, the time is come.

What to do, sir?

For me to tickle thy Tuquoque; to do the act of our forefathers: therefore
prepare, provide,
To morrow morn to meet me as my Brde.

I'll meet thee like a Ghost first.

How now, what matter have you fished out of that fool?

Matter as poysning as Corruption,
That will without some Antidote strike home
Like blew Infection to the very heart.

As how, for Gods sake?

To morrow is the appointed Wedding day.

The day of doom it is?

'twould be a dismal day indeed to some of us.

Sir, I do know you love me; and the time
Will not be dallied with: be what you seem,
Or not the same: I am your Wife, your Mistress,
Or your Servant; indeed what you will make me:
Let us no longer wrangle with our Wits,
Or dally with our Fortunes; lead me hence,
And carry me into a Wilderness:
I'll fast with you, rather then feast with him.

What can be welcommer unto these arms?
Not my estate recovered, is more sweet,
Nor strikes more joy in me, then does your love.

Will you both kiss then upon the bargain,
Here's two couple on you; God give you joy,
I wish well to you, and I see tis all the good that I can do you:
And so to your shifts I leave you.

Nay Brother, you will not leave us thus, I hope.


Why what would you have me do, you mean to run away together, would you ha
me run with you, and so loose my Inheritance: no, trudge, trudge with your
backs to me, and your bellies to them: away.


Nay I prithee be not thus unseasonable:
Without thee we are nothing.

By my troth, and I think so too: you love one another in the way of
Matrimony, do you not?


What else man?


What else man? why tis a question to be asked;
For I can assure you, there is an other kind of love:
But come follow me, I must be your good Angel still:
Tis in this brain how to prevent my Father, and his brace
Of Beagles: you shall none of you be bid to night:
Follow but my direction, if I bring you not,
To have and to hold, for better for worse, let me be held an
Eunuch in wit, and one that was never Father to a good Feast.

Wee'le be instructed by you.

Well, if you be, it will be your own^ another day.
Come follow me.

How ruthless men are to adversity,
My acquaintance scarce will know me, when we meet
They cannot stay to talk, they must be gone;
And shake me by the hand as if I burnt them:
A man must trust unto himself, I see;
For if he once but halt in his estate,
Friendship will prove but broken Crutches to him:
Well, I will lean to none of them, but stand
Free of my self: and if I had a spirit
Daring to act what I am prompted too,
I must thrust out into the world again,
Full blossomd with a sweet and golden Spring:
It was an argument of love in her
To fetch me out of Prison, and this night,
She clasped my hand in hers, as who should say,
Thou art my Purchase, and I hold thee thus:
The worst is but repulse, if I attempt it:
I am resolved, my Geneus whispers to me
Go on and win her, thou art young and active;
Which she is apt to catch at, for there's nought
That's more vnsteadfast, then a woman's thought.

Here's ill lodging Widow: but you must know,
If we had better, we could affoord it you.

The lodging Sir, might serve better Guests.

Not better, Widow, nor yet welcommer:
But we will leave you to it; and the rest.
Phillis, pray let your Mistress want not any thing,
Once more Good night, I'll leave a kiss with you,
As earnest of a better Gift to morrow.
Sirrah, a Light.

Good rest to all.

Et tu quoque, forsooth.

God give you good-night, forsooth,
And send you an early resurrection.

God-might to both.

Come, come away, each Bird unto his nest,
To morrow night's a time of little rest.

Here untie: soft, let it alone,
I have no diposition to sleep yet:
G^ue me a Book, and leave me for a while,
Some half hour hence, look into me.

I shall forsooth.

How now, what makes this bold intrusion?

Pardon m^e Lady, I have business to you.

Business, from whom, is it of such importance
That it craves present hearing?

It does.

Then speak it, and be brief.

Nay gentle Widow, be more pliant to me.
My suite is soft and courteous: full of love.

Of love?

Of love.

Why sure the man is mad? bethink thy self,
Thou hast forgot thy errand?

I have indeed, fair Lady; for my errand
Should first have been delivered on your lips.

Why thou impudent fellow, unthrift of shame,
As well as of thy purse; What has moved thee
To prosecute thy ruin? hath my bounty,
For which thy Master was an orator,
Importune thee to pay me with abuse?
Sir retire, or I will to your shame,
With clamours raise the house, and make your Master
For this attempt, return you to the Dungeon,
From whence you came.

Nay then I must be desperate:
Widow, hold your Clapdish, fasten your Tongue
Unto your Roof, and do not dare to call,
But give me audience, with fear and silence:
Come kiss me: No?
This Dagger has a point, do you see it?
And be unto my suite obedient,
Or you shall feel it too:
For I will rather totter, hang in clean Linen,
Then live to scrub it out in lousy Lynings.
Go too, kiss: You will? why so: Again: the third time?
Good, tis a sufficient Charm: Now hear me,
You are rich in Money, Lands, and Lordships,
Manors, and fair Possessions, and I have not so much
As one poor Coppy-hold to thrust my head in.
Why should you not then have compassion
upon a reasonable handsome fellow,
That has both youth and livelihood upon him;
And can at midnight quicken and refresh
Pleasures decayed in you? You want Children,
And I am strong, lusty, and have a back
Like Hercules, able to get them
Without the help of Muscadine and Eggs:
And will you then, that have enough,
Take to your Bed a bundle of diseases,
Wrapped up in threescore years, to lie a hawking,
Spitting, and coffing backwards and forwards
That you shall not sleep; but thrusting forth
Your face out of the Bed, be glad to draw
The Curtains, such a steam shall reeke
Out of this dunghill. Now what say you^
Shall we without further wrangling clap it up,
And go to Bed together?

Will you hear me?

Yes with all my heart,
So the first word may be, Untruss your Points.
Zounds one knocks: do not stir I charge you,
Nor speak, but what I bid you:
For by these Lips, which now in love I kiss,
If you but struggle, or but raise your voice,
My arm shall rise with it, and strike you dead.
Go too, come on with me, and ask who's there?

It is my Maid.

No matter, do as I bid you: say, Who's there?

Who's there?


If it be you, forsooth, then pray stay.
Till I shall call upon you.

If it be you forsooth, then pray you stay,
Till shall call upon you.

Very well, why now I see
Thou'lt prove an obedient wise, come, let's undress.

Will you put up your naked weapon sir?

You shall pardon me (Widow) I must have you grant first.

You will not put it up.

Not till I have some token of your love.

If this may be a testimony take it.
By all my hopes I love thee, thou are worthy
Of the best widow living, thou t^k'st the course;
And those that will win widows must do thus.

Nay, I knew what I did, when I came with my naked weapon in my hand; but come,
unlace.

Nay my dear love, know that I will not yield
My body unto lust, until the Priest
Shall ioynevs in Hymens sacred nuptial rites.

Then set your hand to this, nay 'tis a contract
Strong and sufficient, and will hold in Law,
Here, here's pen and ^cke, you see I come provided.

Give me the pen.

Why here's some comfort,
Yet write your name fair I pray,
And at large; why now 'tis very well,
Now widow you may admit your Maid,
For in the next room I'll go fetch a nap.

Thou shalt not leave me so, come pre thee sit,
We'll talk a while, for thou hast made my heart
Dance in my bosom I receive such joy.

Thou art a good wench in faith, come kiss upon it.

But will you be a loving husband to me,
Avoid all naughty company, and be true
To me, and to my bed?

As true to thee, as Steel to Adamant.

I'll bind you to your word, see that you be,
Or I'll conceal my bags, I have kins folks,
To whom I'll maked over, you shall not ba^e^ penny.

Push, pre thee do not doubt me,
How now, what means this?

It means my vengeance; nay sir, you are fast,
Nor do not dare to struggle, I have liberty,
Both of my tongue and feet, I'll call my maid:
Phillis come in, and help to triumph,
Over this bold Intruder, wonder not wench,
But go unto him, and rans^cke all his pockets,
And take from thence a Contract which he forced
From my unwilling fingers:

Is this according to your oath.

Come sir, I must search you.

I pre thee do.
And when thou take that from me, take my life too.

Hast thou it girl?

I have a paper here.

It is the same, give it me, look you sir,
Thus your new fancied hopes I tear asunder:
Poor wretched man, t'hast had a golden dream,
Which gilded over thy calamity:
But being awake thou findst it ill laid on,
For with one finger I have wiped it off:
Go fetch me hither the Casket that contains
My choicest Jewels, and spread them here before him;
Look you sit:
Here's gold, pearl, rubies, sapphires, diamonds;
These would be goodly things for you to pawn,
Or revel with amongst your Courtesans,
Whilst I and mine did starue^ why dost not curse,
And utter all the mischiefs of thy heart,
Which I know swells within thee, power it our,
And let me hear thy fury.

Never, never:
When ere my tongue shall speak but well of thee,
It proves no faithful servant to my heart.

False traitor to thy master, and to me,
Thou lie, there's no such thing within thee.

May I be burned to ugliness, to that
Which you and all men hate, but I speak truth.

May I be turned a monster, and the shame
Of all my Sex, -- and if I not believe thee,
Take me unto thee, these, and all that's mine,
Were it thrice trebled, thou were worthy all:
And do not blame this trial, cause it shows
I give my ^elfe unto thee, am not forced,
And with it alone, that ne'er shall be diuorc'd.

I am glad 'tis come to this yet, by this light
Thou putt'st me into a horrible fear:
But this is my excuse: know that my thoughts
Were not so desperate as my actions seemed,
For fore my dagger should ha drawn one drop
Of thy chaste blood, it should have sluc'd out mine:
And the cold point struck deep into my heart:
Nor better be my fate, if I shall move
To any other pleasure but thy love.

It shall be in my Creed: but lett's away,
For night with her black Steeds draws up the day.

Softly Boy, softly, you think you are upon firm ground, but it is dangerous;
you'll never make a good thief, you rogue, till you learn to creep upon all
four: if I do not swear with going this pace: every thing I see, me thinks,
should be my father in his white beard.


It is the property of that passion, for fear
Still shapes all things we see to that we fear.

Well said Logic, sister, I pray lay hold of him, For the man I see is able
to give the Watch an answer, if they


They take their way directly, intend nothing against us.

Can you not discern who they are?

One is Spendall.

The other is the Widow as I take it.

It is true, and that's her maid before her.

What a night of conspiracy is here, more villainy* there's another goodly
mutton going, my father i^ fleeced of all, grief will give him a box in faith,
but 'tis no great matter, I shall inherit the sooner, nay soft sir, you shall
not pas^e so currant with the matter, I'll shake you a little: who goes there?


Out with the Candle, who's that asks the question?


One that has some reason for it.


It should be, by the voice, young Rash.
Why we are honest folks.

Pray where do you dwell? not in town I hope.

Why we dwell, zownds where do we dwell?
I know not where.

And you'll be married you know not when, zownds it were a Christian deed to
stop thee in thy journey: hast thou no more spirit in thee, but to let thy
tongue betray thee. Suppose I had been a Constable, you had been in a fine
taking, had you not!


But my still worthy friend,
Is there no worse face of ill bent towards me,
Then that thou merrily putt'st on.

Yes, here's four or five faces more, but ne'er an ill one, though never an
excellent good one, Boy, up wish your lantern of light, and show him his
associates, all running away with the flesh as thou art, go yoke together, you
may be oxen one day, and draw all together in a plough, go march together, the
Parson stays for you, pay him royally, come, give me the Lantern, for you
have light sufficient, for night has put off his black Cap, and salut^s the
morn, now farewell my little children of Cupid, that walk by two and two as
if you went a feasting: let me hear no more words, but be gone.


Farewell.


Farewell brother.


I, you may cry farewell, but if my father should know of my villainy, how
should I fare then? but all's one, I ha done my sisters good, my friends good,
and my self good, and a general good is always to be respected before a
particular, there's eight score pounds a year saved, by the conveyance of this
widow, I hear footsteps, now darkness take me into thy arms, and deliver
me from discovery.


Lord, lord, what a careless world is this, neither Bride nor Bridegroom
ready, time to go to Church, and not a man vnroosted, this age has not seen a
young Gallant rise with a candle, we live drowned in feather-beds, and dream
of no other felicity: this was not the life when I was a young man, what makes
us so weak as we are now? a feather-bed: what so unapt for exercise? a
feather-bed: what breede^ such pains and aches in our bones? why a feather-bed
or a wench, or at least a wench in a feather-bed: is it not a shame, that an
old man as I am should be up first, and in a wedding day, I think in my
conscience there's more mettle in lads of three score, then in boys of one
and twenty. Basket hilt.


Here sir.


Shall I not be trussed to day?


Yes sir, but I went for water.


Is Will Rash up yet?


I think not sir, for I heard no body stirring in the house.


Knock sir at his chamber,
The house might be plucked down and builded again
Before he would wa^e with the noise.

Who's that keeps such a knocking, are you mad?

Rather thou art drunk, thou lazy slowch,
That make thy bed thy grave, and in it bury
All thy youth and vigour; up for shame.

Why 'tis not two a clock yet.

Out sluggish knave 'tis nearer unto five,

The whole house has out-slept themselves, as if they had drunk wild poppy:
Sir, go you and raise the maids, and let them call upon their mistresses.


Well sir, I shall.


Did I eat any Lattice to supper last night, that I am so sleepy, I think it
be day light, brother Bubble.


What sai'st thou brother? heigh ho!


Fie, fie, not ready yet? what sluggishness
Hath seized upon you? why thine eyes are close still.

As fast as a Kentish oyster, surely I was begotten in a Plumb-tree,
I ha such a deal of gum about mine eyes.

Lord how you stand! I am ashamed to se^
The Sun should be a witness of your sloth,
Now sir, your haste.

Marry sir, there are gu^sts coming to accompany you to church.


Why this is excellent, men whom it not concerns
Are more respective then we that are maine Actors.

Father Rash, be not so outrageous, we will go in and buckle our selves, all
in good time, how now! what's this about my shins?


Me thought our shanks were not fellows, we have metamorphosed our stockings
for want of splendour.


Pray what's that Splendour?


Why 'tis the Latin word for a Christmasse candle


O Gentlemen, you love, you honour me, welcome, welcome good Master Geraldine,
you have taken pains
To accompany an undeserving friend.

You put us to a needless labour sir,
To run and wind about for circumstance,
When the plain word, I thank you, would have served.

How now wench, are the females ready yet?
The time comes on upon us, and we run backward:
We are so untoward in our business,
We think not what we have to do, nor what we do.

I know not sir whether they know what to do, but I am sure they have been at
Church well-nie an hour, they were afraid you had got the start of them, which
made them make such has^e.


I'st possible, what think you Gentlemen?
Are not these wenches forward? is there not virtue in a man can make young
Virgins leave their beds so soon.
But is the widow gone along with them?

Yes sir; why she was the ring-leader.

I thought as much, for she knows what belong's to it,
Come Gentlemen, me thinks 'tis sport to see
Young wenches run to church before their husbands:
Faith we shall make them blush for this ^re night:
A sir, are you come? why that's well said;
I marl'd indeed that all things were so quiet,
Which made me think th'ad not vnwrapt their sheet^:
And then were they at Church I hold my life:
Maids think it long until each be made a wi^e.
Hast thou my cloak knave? well said, put it on,
We'll after them; let me go hasten both,
Both the Bridegrooms forward, we'll walk a little
Softly on before: but see, see, if they be not come
To fetch us now, we come. we come,
Bid them return, and save themselves this labour.

Now have I a quartain ague upon me.


Why how now! why come you from Church to kneel thus publicly, what's the
matter?


We kneel sir for your blessing.


How, my blessing! Master Geraldine, is not that your son?


Yes sir, and that I take it is your daughter.


I suspect knavery, what are you?
Why do you kneel hand in hand with her?

For a fatherly blessing too sir.


Hoy day! 'tis palpable, I am gulled, and my son
Scatter-good and Bubble fooled, you are married?

Yes sir, we are married.


More villainy! every thing goes the wrong way.


We shall go the right way anon, I hope.


Yes marry shall you, you shall even to the Counter again, and that's the
right way for you.


O you are wrong,
The prison that shall hold him are these arms.

I do fear that I shall turn stinckard, I do smell such a matter: you are
married then?


Ecee signum, here's the wedding Ring t'affirme it.


I believe the knave has drunk Ipocras,
He is so pleasant.

God morrow Gentlemen.


Tu quoque to all: what, shall we go to Church?
Come, I long to be about this gear.

Do you hear me, will you two go sleep again? take out the the other nap, for
you are both made Cockescombes, and so am I.


How, Cockes-combes!


Yea Cockes-combes.


Father, that word Cockes-comb goes against my stomach.


And against mine, a man might ha digested a Woodcock better.


You two come now to go to church to be married,
And they two come from Church, and are married.

How, married! I would see that man durst ma^ry her.


Why sir, what would you do?


Why ^ir I would forbid the banes.


And so would I.


Do you know that youth in Satin, he's the penner that belongs to that
Inck-horne.


How, let me see, are not you my man Ger^ase?


Yes sir.


And have you married her?


Yes sir.


And do you think you have used me well?


Yes sir.


O intolerable rascal! I will presently be made a Justice of Peace, and have
thee whipped, go fetch a Constable.


Come, you're a flourishing Ass; Sergeant take him to thee, he has had a long
time of his pageantry.


Sir let him go, I'll be his bail, for all debts which come ag^inst him.


Reverend sir, to whom I owe the duty of a son,
Which I shall ever pay in my obedience:
Know that which made him gracious in your eyes,
And gilded over his imperfecti^ns,
Is wasted and consumed eue^ like ice,
Which by the vehemence of heate dissolves,
And glides to many rivers, so his wealth,
That felt a prodigal hand, hot in expense,
Melted within his gripe, and from his coffers,
Ran like a violent stream to other men's,
What was my own, I caught at.

Have you your mortgage in?


Yes sir.


Stand up, the matter is well amended,
Master Geraldine, you give sufferance to this match.

Yes marry do I sir, for since they love,
I'll not have the crime lie on my head,
To ^iuide man and wife.

Why you say well, my blessing fall upon you,


An^ upon us that love sir Lyonell.


By my ^roth since thou hast ^ane the young kna^e,
God give the^ ^oy of him, and may ^e prove*
A wiser man then his Master.

Sergeant, why dost not carry him to prison?

Sir Lyonell Rash will bail him.

I bail him knave! wherefore should I bail him?
No, carry him away, I'll relieve no prodigalls.

Good sir Lyonell, I beseech you sir, Gentlemen, I pray make a purse for me.


Come sir, come, are you begging?


Why that does you no harm Ger^se, master I should say; some compassion.


Sergeants, come back with him, look sir, here is your livery,
If you can put off all your former pride,
And put on this with that humility
That you first wore it, I will pay your debts,
Free you of all incomb^ances,
And take you again into my service.

Tenter-hooke let ^e go, I will take his worships offer without wages, rather
then come into your clu^ches again; a man in a blew coat may have some colour
for his knavery, ^n the Counter he can have none.


But now M. Scatter-good, what say you to this?


Marry I say 'tis scarce honest dealing for any man to Conny-catch another mans
wife, I protest we'll not put it up.


No, which we?


Why Gartred and I.


Gartred, why she'll put it up.


Will she?


I that she will, and so must you.


Must I?


Yes that you must.


Well, if I must, I must* but I protest I would not:
But that I must: So vale, vale: Et tu quoque.

Why that's well said,
Then I perceive we shall wind up all wrong:
Come Gentlemen, and all our other guests:
Let our well-temper'd bloods taste B^cchus feasts,
But let us know fi^st how these sports delight,
And to these Gentlemen each bid good night.

Gentles, I hope, that well my labour ends,
All that I did was but to please my friends.

A kind enamouret I did strive so prove,
But now I leave that, and pursue your love.

My part I have performed with the rest,
And though I have not, yet I would do best.

That I have cheated through the Play, 'tis true,
But yet I hope, I have not cheated you.

If with my clamours I have done you wrong,
Ever hereafter I will hold my tongue.

If through my riot I have offensive been,
Henceforth I'll play the civil Citizen.

Faith all that I say, is, how ere it hap,
Widows like M^ids sometimes may catch a clap.

To mirth and laughter henceforth I'll provoke ye,
If you but please to like of Greenes Tu quoque.
