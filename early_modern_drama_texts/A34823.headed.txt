WHo says the Times do Learning disallow?
'Tis false; 'twas never honoured so as now
When you appear, great Prince, our night is done:
You are our Morning-star, and shall b'our Sun.
But our Scene's London now, and by the rout
We perish if the Roundheads be about:
For now no ornament the head must wear,
No Bays, no Mitre, not so much as Hair.
How can a Play pass safely, when we know,
Cheapside-Cross falls for making but a show?
Our only hope is this, that it may be
A Play may pass too, made ex tempore.
Though other Arts poor and neglected grow,
They'll admit Poetry* which was always so.
Besides, the Muses of late times have bin.
Sanctifi'd by the Verse of Master Prin.
But we contemn the fury of these days,
And scorn as much their Censure as their Praise.
Our Muse, blessed Prince, does only on you rely;
Would gladly live, yet not refuse to die.
Accept our hasty zeal; a thing that's played
Ere 'tis a Play, and acted ere 'tis made.
Our Ignorance, but our Duty too, we show:
I would all ignorant people would do so.
At other times, expect our Wit and Art;
This Comedy is acted by the Heart.

PRithee widow be not incensed, we'll show our selves like young Lords shortly;
and you know, I Hope, they use to pay their debts.


I, you talk of great matters, I wis, but I'm sure I could never see a groat
yet of your money.


Alas, we carry no silver about us,
That were mechanical and base;
Gold we about us bring:
Gold, thou art mighty in each place,
Of Metals Prince and King.
Why I tell you my pockets have not been guilty of any small money in my
remembrance.


I know not, but all things are grown dear of late; our Beef costs three
shillings a stone, and the price of corn is raised too.


Nay, mother, coals are raised too, they say. These things you think cost
nothing.


Nay, Tabytha, Mistress Tabytha! ifaithlaw now I'll make a Psalm for you, and
be but peaceable.

Contain thy tongue, and keep it in
Within thy mouths large prison.
Both jars, and also many a sin
From out the mouth has risen.
I'm only for Odes, by the Muses, and the quickest for them, I think, in the
Christian world, take in Turks, Infidels, Jews and all.


Have but a little patience, widow; well^ I'll say this for thee, thou art the
honestest Landlady upon the face of the earth, which makes me desire to live in
your house; and you shall not lose by it: do but mark the end.


I stand not so much upon that; but I use to have Lawyers in my house, such
civil complete gentlemen in their Satin doublets (I warrant you) and broad
ruffs, as passes; and Courtiers, all to be laced and slashed, and fine fellows
as you shall see in a summers day; they would not say Why do ye this? to a
woman: and then Knights.


I, and Gentlemen too, mother.


But you, forsooth, come in drunk every night, and fall a sweari^g as if you
would rend the house in two, and then mumble and tumble my daughters clothes,
she says.


I, and would have --


What would we have done?


Nay no good, I warrant you.


And then you drink up a kilderkin of small beer next morning.


All this shall be corrected and amended, Landlady: yes faith, Cutter, thou
must repent, thou hast been to blame sometimes.


Besides, you are always so full of your fripperies, and are always a grinning
and sneering at every thing: I was wont to have sober boorders in my house, and
not such hee-hee-heeing fellows.


Nay, they mocked and fleer'd at us as we sung the Psalm the last Sunday-night.


That was that mongrel Rhymer; by this light, he envies his brother Poet honest
Iohn Sternhold, because he cannot reach his heights.


O the father! the Colonel's as full of waggery as an egge's full of meat: I
warrant, M. Dogrel, what you get by him you may even put in your eye, and never
see the worse for it.


Well, and how dost in faith now, honest Landlady? when shall we walk again into
Moor-fields, and rejoice at the Queens Cake-house?


I'll bespeak Cakes and Ale of the purpose there; and thou shalt eat stewed
Prunes, little Tabytha, till thy smock drop again. A word in you ear, Landlady:
Can you accommodate us with two shillings?

To morrow ere the rosie fingered morn
Starts from Tithonus bed, as Authors write;
Ere Phoebus cry Gee-hoe unto his team,
We will restore again, and thank you for your pain.


I'll tell you a secret, Landlady: Captain Blade and I shall be called shortly
to the Court; the King has taken notice of our deserts: I say no more: though
yet thou scorn me, Tabytha, I'll make thee a Lady one day. Will you lend,
widow? Great affairs bid me make haste.


I care not much if I trust you for once: Come in and take it.


Then Mistress let me lead you thus,
And as we go let's buss.

Buss me no bussings. O lord, how you tumble my gorget!


I could now be as melancholy as an old scabbie Mastiff, or the Lions in the
Tower: 'twere a good humour to repent. Well, Captain, something must be done,
unless a man could get true gems by drinking, or, like a mouse in a cheese,
enlarge his house-room by eating. Four hundred pound a year cashiered? Four
hundred, by this light, Captain. All my comfort is, that now the usurer's
damned; and now that niggardly three score and ten withered chap-faln
Puritanical thing, his wife, refuses to marry me: I would see her burnt for an
old witch before I'd take her for a wife, if she had not Agues, Squinancies,
Gouts, Cramps, Palsies, Apoplexies, and two dozen of diseases more then S.
Thomas Hospital; and if she live long with all these, I'm sure she'll kill me
quickly. But let her be damned with her husband: Bring some drink, boy; I'm
soxt, by this light, with drinking nothing yet.

What are ye come? Bring us a Tun then, and that so big, that that of
Heidelberg may seem but like a barrel of pickled Oysters to it. Welcome
Snapsack, welcome little vermin of Parnassus: how is't, my Laur^ate Rhymer?
Cost thou sing Fortune my foe still with thy brother Poet?


Ye Muses nine assist my verse,
That dwell by Helicon along;
Captain Blades praise I will rehearse,
With lyre and with song.

Why this right Ballad, and they hobble like the fellow with the wooden leg
that sings them. And how dost, man of blood?


As well as a man of worth can do in these days, where deserts are so little
regarded: if Wars come once, who but Cutter? who else but Colonel Cutter? God
save you, Colonel Cutter, cry the Lords; the Ladies they smile upon Colonel
Cutter, and call Colonel Cutter a proper Gentleman: every man strives who shall
invite Colonel Cutter to dinner: not a Cuckoldly creditor dares pluck me by the
cloak, and say, Sir, you forgot your promise, I'm in a strait for moneys, my
occasions force me, or the like.


Cheer up, my Hercules upon a sign, I have a plot for ye, which if it thrive,
thou shalt no more lie sunning in a bowling-alley, nor go on special holidays
to the three-peny Ordinary, and then cry It pleases my humour better then to
dine at my Lord Majors.


Would we had some drink here to stop your mouth.


No more be sick two or three days while thy boots are vamping: no more
outswear whores in a reckoning, and leave the house in an anger.


Have you done?


Nor sup at Taverns with Radishes: nor for a meals meat overthrow the King of
Spain of the Hollanders when you please: no^ when you go to bed produce ten
several Tavern snuffs to make one pipe of Tobacco.


'Slid would I had one here.


Nor change your name and lodging as often as a whore; for as yet, if you had
lived like a Tartar in a cart, (as you must die, I fear, in one) your home
could not have been more uncertain. Your last Gests were these: From a
Water-mans house at the Banks side, (marry you stayed there but a small while,
because the fellow was jealous of his wife) passing over like great King Xerxes
in a Sculler, you arrived at a Chandlers house in Thames-street, and there took
up your lodging. The day before you should have paid, you walked abroad, and
were seen no more; for ever after the smell of the place offended you. Next,
you appeared at an Ale-house in the Covent-Garden, like a Duck that dives at one
end of the pond, but rises unexpectedly at the other. But that place (though
there was Beer and Tobacco there) by no means pleased you; for there dwelt so
many cheaters thereabouts, that you could not live by one another; they spoiled
your trade quite. Then from a Shoo-makers, (as you entitl'd him; marry some
authors call him a Cobbler) to a Basket-makers; from thence to the Counter: from
thence, after much benevolence, to a Barbers; changing more lodgings then
Pythagoras his soul did. At length, upon confidence of those new breeches, and
the scouring of that everlasting Buff, you ventured upon the widows, that
famous house for boorders, and are by this time hoisting up your sails, I'm
sure; the next fair wind you're gone.


I wonder, Captain, among so many rascally houses, how I happened to miss
yours. 'Tis true, I have not lien leaguer always at one place: Soldiers must
remove their tents: Alexander the Great did it an hundred times.


Now to the words of comfort -- drink first -- then Lordings listen all.


We do, both great and small. O my conscience this cup of wine has done my
genius good.


When first my brother departed --


'Twas poorly spoken, by this day.


He committed his daughter and estate to my care; which if she either died, or
married without my consent, he bequeathed all to me. Being five years gone, he
died.


How frail is humane life! Well sung the divine Poet

Like to the damask rose you see,
Or like the blossom on the tree,
Or like, c.

Sirrah, Trundle, either hear out peaceably, or I shall cut your ears off.
Proceed, Captain.


I falling into ill company, yours, or some other such idle fellows, began to
be misled, could drink and swear, nay, at last, whore sometimes too; which
courses having now at last made me like Iob in every thing but patience; your
Landlady (for to her husband my estate was mortgaged.) I have sought all means
to marry.


That Niobe! that Hecuba!


Pish! I could have lien with either of the two, so 't had been before Hecuba
was turned into a bitch, or the other into a stone: for though I hate her worse
then small beer.


Or pal^d wine.


Or proverbs and Latin sentences in discourse.


Or a Sermon of two hours long.


Or Dogrels verses, or what you will else; yet she has money, blades; she would
be a Guiana or Peru to me, and we should drink four or five years securely,
like Dutchmen at a Wedding. But hang her, let her die and go to hell, 'tis
only that can warm her: she scorns me now my money's gone.


Thus Pride doth still with Beauty dwell,
And like the Baltic ocean swell.

Why the Baltic, Dogrel?


Why the Baltic? This tis not to have read the Poets.


Now if my niece should marry, praesto, the means are gone; and I must, like
some Gentleman without fear or regard of the gallows, betake my self to the
high-way, or else cheat like one of you, and tremble at the sight of a pillory.
Therefore -- (prick up your ears, for your good angel speaks) upon conditions
of share, I marry her to one of you.


I but how, Captain? how?


Why either she shall have one of you, or no body; for if she marry without my
consent, the money's mine own: and she'll be hang^d first in the Friars rope,
ere she turn Nun.


I'll be a Franciscan, if she do.


Not a Carthusian, I warrant thee, to abstain from flesh. Thou might well
have taken holy Orders, if it were not for chastity and obedience: their other
vow of never carrying money about thee, thou hast observed from thy youth up.


I'll have her, by Mercury; I have two or three Love-odes ready made; they
can't choose but win her. Cutter, adore me, Cutter, thou shalt have wine thy
fill, though thou could out-drink Xe^xes his army.


You get her? what with that Ember week-face of thine? that Razor of thy nose,
those ea^s that prick up like a Puritanical button-makers of Amsterdam? thou
look as if thou never had been fed since thou suck'dst thy mothers milk:
thy cheeks begin to fall into thy mothers mouth, that thou might eat 'em. Why
thou very lath with a thing cut like a face atop, and a slit at the bottom! I
am a man, and can do her service; here's metal, boy.


'Tis in your face then.


I can fight her quarrels, boy, and beg^t on her new Achilleses.


Yes -- thou art a very Achilles -- in the swiftness of thy feet* but thou art
a worser coward then any of the Trained Bands: I'll have a school-boy with a
cat-stick take away thy Mistress from thee. Besides, what parts hast thou? hast
thou scholarship enough to make a Brewers clerk? Can thou read the Bible? I'm
sure thou hast not. Can thou write more then thine own name? and that in su^h
vile characters, that most men take them for Arabian pot-hooks; and some think
thou dost but set thy mark when thou write thy name. I'm versed, Cutter in
the whole Encyclopaedie, a word that ^s Greek to you. I am a Wit, and can make
Greek verses ex tempore.


Nay not so; for if you come to your verses* Dogrel, Im sure you have done with
wit. He that best pleases her, take her a Gods name, and allow the the other a
pension: What think you, gallants?


Agreed; thou shalt have three pound and a cloak.


Away, you puff, you kickshaw, you quaking custard.


Prithee be patient, thou shalt have lace to it too.


Pox take you both; drink and be friends.


Here's to you, Cutter. I'm something choleric, and given to jeering: but
what, man? words are but wind.


I'll call her in. Why boy within three, call my niece quickly hither.


I'm undone; I have left my Ode at home: undone, by Mercury, unless my memory
help me.


Thus and thus will I accoast her: I'm the man; Dogrels clothes will cast him.


When she has seen you both, one void the room, and so woo by tu^ns.


I^ll go out fi^st, and meditate upon my Ode.


Welcome, dear niece; I sent for you to entertain these Gentlemen my friends:
and hark you niece, make much of them; they are men of worth and credit at the
Court, though they go so plain; ^hat's their humour only: And hark you,
niece, they both love you; you cannot choose amiss. I have some business -- Your
servant, Gentlemen.


Not choose amiss? indeed I must do, Uncle, if I should choose again. You're
welcome, Gentlemen.


I thank you, fairest Lady: I am a Soldier, Lady, and cannot complement; but I
have travelled over all the world, Germany, Morocco, Swethland, Persia, France,
Hungary, Caleput, Peru.


'Slid* ho^ he shuffles all the Countries together like lots in a hat!


Yet I never saw before so fair a Lady. I cannot complement in faith.


Y'have taken a long journey, Sir 'twere best
To rest your self a little: Will you sit?
Will you, Sir, take a seat too?

'Slife I can't say my Ode now. I'll wait upon you presently.


Fair Lady -- (This 'tis to converse with none but whores: I know not what to
say to her.)

You are the only mistress of my thoughts.

My service to you, Lady.


To me, Sir, do you speak, or to the wine?


To you, by Mars. Can you love me, Beauty? I'm sure your uncle prefers no man
under the cope --


Soft, Sir, do ye use to take in Towns so soon?
My uncle gave an equal commendation
To both of you.

What? to that mole-catcher in the old Serge? he brought him in for humour, to
make you sport. Ill tell you what he is.


Pray do, Sir.


The very emblem of poverty and poor poetry: the feet are worse patched of his
Rhymes, then of his Stockings: if one line forget it self, and run out beyond
his elbow, while the next keeps at home (like him) and dares not show his head;
he calls that an Ode. Your uncle and I maintain him only for sport. I'll tell
you how I found him; marry walking in Moor-fields cross armed: he could not
pluck his hat over his eyes, there were so many holes in it: he had not so much
linen about him as would make a cuff for a Bartlemew-fayr-baby. Marry the worst
I like in him is, he will needs sometime^, in way of gratitude, present me with
a paper of Verses. Here comes the vermin.


I'll leave him alone with you, that you may have the better sport: he'll not
show half his tricks before me. I think I have spoiled his markets. Now will I
stand behind the hangings, and hear how she abuses him. I know by her eye she
loves me. Cutter, you're blessed


Fairer, O fairer then the Lilly,
Then Primrose fair, or Daffa^ illy;
Less red then thy cheeks the Rose is,
When the Spring it doth disclose his
Leaves; thy eyes put down the star-light;
When they shine, we see afar -- light.
O these eyes do wound my heart
With pretty little Cupids dart;
Wounded I am with deadly smart;
The pain raigns in every part.
Thy beauty and thy great desert
Draw me as horses draw a Cart.
O that I had Rhetoricks art -- impart-sart-mart-start.
To move thee; for I would not start
Till I --

Take heed, Sir, you'll be out of breath anon.
Y'ha' done enough for any honest Poet.

Fairest nymph, I swear to thee,
The later part was made ex tempore?
Not a bit of prose goes down with me.

(I must know it.)
May I be so bold as to enquire of you
Your friends name that was here; he seems to be
A man of worth and quality.

That's I.


Quality? yes?


That's I again. If whoring, drinking, cheating, poverty and cowardice be
qualities, he's one of the best qualified men in the Christian world.


O the devil!


He's a great traveller.


In suburbs and by-lanes; he never heard a gun but in Moor-fields or Finsbury
at a mustering* and quaked then as if they had been the Spaniards: I^ll
undertake a Pot-gun shall dismay him


A plague upon him --


Those breeches he wears, and his hat, I gave him: till then, he went like a
Paper-mill all in rags, and like some old statue in a ruined Abbey. About a
month ago, you might have seen him peep out at a grate, and cry, Kind merciful
Gentlemen, for the Lords sake, poor prisoners undone by sur^tish^p, and the
like.


Contain thy self* great spirit; keep in a while.


We call him Colonel in an humour only. The furniture of his chamber (for now,
at mine and some other Gentlemen's charges, he has got one) is half a chair, and
an earthen chamber-pot, the bottom of an inkhorn for a candlestick, and a dozen
of little gally-pots with salve in them; for he has more diseases --


I can endure no longer. Dogrel, thou lie; there's my glove; meet me an hour
hence.


And there's mine. I'll put a good face on it; he dares not fight, I^m sure.


Two hours hence
Expect the Saracens head; I'll do it, by heavens.
Though hills were set on hills, and seas met seas, to guard thee,
I'd reach thy head, thy head, proud Dogrel.

Nay, you're both even: just such an ex'lent character
He did bestow on you. Why thou vile wretch
Go to the stews, the jail, seek there a wife;
Thou'lt find none there but such as will scorn thee.
Was thy opinion of my birth or fortune,
My chastity or beauty (which I willingly
Confess to be but small) so poor and lowe,
That thou could think thy self a match for me?
I^ll sooner marry with my grave; for thou
Art worser dirt then that. See me no more.

Scorned by a mistress? with a friend to sight?
Hence, lighter Oder; I'll biting Satyrs write.

I must be gone, my Lucia; I must leave
My self, and thee more then my self, behind me
Thus parts the greedy usurer from his bags,
With an heart heavier then those: he fixes
His covetous eye upon the charming metal,
As if he meant to throng those many pleasures
Which several times would yield, into one minute.
With as much joy he kisses his loved Idol,
As I do thee, to whom all gold compared,
Seems but like Pebbles to the Diamond:
And then he sighs, my Lucia.

And weeps too, if, like us, he bid farewell.
Why should your father be so cruel?

He's old and angry, Lucia, very angry,
And either has forgot his youthful days,
Or else I'll swear he did not love my mother
With half that noble heat that I do thee:
For when he heard your uncles resolutions,
Doubting your portion if we two should marry,
He forced me to an oath so strange, which though
I then durst swear, I scarce dare now repeat;
An oath never more to see nor hear thee, Lucia,
After the envious shortness of this hour,
Without his leave.

You will forget me quite then.

Forget thee, Lucia? 'tis not death it self
Has so much Lethe in it: I shall not choose
In the long sleep o'th grave, but dream of thee,
If it be true that souls which leave hid treasures
(Being buried far less peaceable then their gold)
Walk up and down, and in their urns want rest,
How will my ghost then wander, which has left
Such precious wealth behind it? Sure it will
Desire to see thee, and I fear will fright thee.
I would say more, but I shall weep anon.

So quickly gone! he might have staid, me thinks,
A little longer, and I owed that happiness
To the misfortune of his future absence.
Why did he swear to's father? I'm a fool,
And know not what to say.

Stay, Lucia, prithee stay; I had forgot
The business which I came for.

I owe much
To your forgetfulness, my Truman: if
It be such always, though you forget me,
I'll pardon you. What was your business, pray?

To kiss your hand, my dearest.

Was that all?
I'm glad to see your grief so small and light,
That it can find leisure to complement:
'Tis not like mine, believe me.

Was not that business, Lucia?
In my opinion now, th'affairs of Kings,
The honourable troubles of a Counsellor,
Are frivolous and light, compared to this.
May I not kiss your lips too, dearest Lucia?
I have an inward dropsy; and my remedy
Enflames my thirst: tis that best Nectar only
Which has the power to quench it.

If there be Nectar there,
It was your lip that brought it thither first;
And you may well be bold to claim your own.
Shall we sit down and talk a little while?
They will allow us sure a parting-time.

And that I would not change, not this poor minute
In which I see, and hear, and touch thee, Lucia,
For th'age of Angels, unless thy loved presence
Make a heaven there for me too.
What shall I do to bring the days t'an end?
Sure they'll be tedious when I want thy company.

I'll pray for the success of our chaste loves,
And drop down tears for beads.

I'll read over the large volume of the creatures;
And where I find one full of grace and beauty,
I'll gaze and think on that; for that's thy picture.

Whatever kind of Needle-work I make,
Thy name I'll intermingle, till at last,
Without my minds conjunction and consent,
The needle and my hand shall both agree
To draw thy name out.

I will gather flowers,
Turn wanton in the truness of my love,
And make a posy too, where Lu^ia
Shall be mysteriously writ in flowers:
They shall be fair and sweet, such as may paint
And speak thee to my senses.
Lucia, Lucia.

I am called: farewell.

My father, cousin, would speak with you.

I'll wait upon him.

Will you be gone so soon, Sir?

I must offend your father else.

You would have stayed longer with her, I'm sure.

It may be so. Your servant, Lady.

Contemned by all? while my proud cousin walks
With more eyes on her then the moon: but I,
Like some small petty star without a name,
Cast unregarded beams.
It must not be; I snatch of all those glories
Which beauty or feign^d virtue crown her with,
Till her short light confess her but a Comet.
I love thee, Truman; but since 'tis my fate
To love so ill, I'll try how I can hate.

Come on, Dogrel, now will I cut your throat.


You^ll be hanged first.


No, by this light.


You'll be hanged after then.


I'll slice thee into steaks.


I believe indeed thou art so hungry, thou could feed like a Cannibal.


No, thou'lt be a dish for the devil; he'll dress thee at his own fire. You
called me Coward: had thou as many lives as are in Plutarch, I'd make an end
of them. (I must daunt him, for fear he should fight with me.) I will not leave
so much blood in thee as will wet my nail: and for thy flesh, I'll mangle it in
such manner, that the Crows shall not know whether it were a mans body or no.


(He was once a Coward, and I never heard yet of his reformation)
Hear, thou altitonant Jove, and Muses three.
(Muses? a plague upon them I meant Furies.)
Hear, thou altitonant Jove, and Furies three.

Nay then
Leap from the leathern dungeon of my sheath,
Thou Durindana brave.
(Will nothing do?) Come on, miscreant.

Do, do, strike if thou dare.

Coward, I'll give thee the advantage of the first push.

I scorn to take any thing of thee I.

Thou had better eat up thy mothers soul, then touch me.

If thou wilt not strike first, take thy life.

I had rather die then give the first blow, since thou hast said it.

I see this quarrel, Cutter, will come to a quart of wine: shall's go?

How rash is anger! had not reason checked me,
I should have killed my Poet for a woman,
A very woman. Let's sheath, Dogrel --

Here's company; 'slid I'll fight then.


How now, Paynims? fighting like two sea-fishes in a map? slaying and killing
like horse-leaches? Why my little gallimaufry, what Arms and Arts?


Tam Marti, quam Mercurio, I. 'Slife, outbrav'd by a fellow that has no more
valour in him then a woman's Tailor?


By my fathers Soul, I'll kill him an he were an Army.


Hold! stop! this Colonels spirit's all flame.


'Tis the flame of a flap-dragon then, for 'twill hurt no body.


Mr. Puny, you do me wrong.


What do ye mean bufles?


'Slife, an you hinder me Puny --


Pox take you, kill one another and be hanged then, do, stab, why don't ye?


At your command Mr. Puny? I'll be forc^d by no man; put up Dogrel, we'll
fight for no mans pleasure but our own.


Agreed, I'll not make another sport by murthering any man though he were a
Ti^ker.


Why now you speak like righteous Hom^ncles, ye have both great spirits, as big
as Indian-whales, for wit and valour a couple of Phoenixes.


'Tis my fault Puny; I'm the resolutest man if I be but a little heated. Pox
take it, I'm a fool for it.


Give me thy hand.


I did not think thou had been so valiant, i'faith: I should have killed my
self, if I had hurt thee in my fury.


So should I by this hand.


This is rare! up and down like a game at chess;


Why a game at chess more then any other?


A game at chess? why -- pox you're a kind of Poet I confess, but for wit you
shall pardon me -- there's as much in Tom Coriats shoes. But prithee, why did
you two Pythagorians fall out?


A trifle, only a Mistress.


A pox take her, I wooed her in an humour only, I had rather marry a wench of
ginger-bread, they're both of a Complexion.


And then her mouth's as wide as a Crocodiles, her kisses devour a man.


Her eyes are like the eyes of a needle, and her nose pointed like that; I
wonder her face is no cleaner, for those two perpetually water it: As for her
lower parts, blessed are they that live in ignorance.


What an Heliogabalus make you of this wench? would I could see this Barbara
Pyramidum.


Hang her, she looks like a gentlewoman upon the top of a ballad.


Shavers, who i the devils name would you guess to be my Mistress?


Some w^nch at a red lattice.


Some beast that stincks worse then Thames-street.


And looks like a shoulder of mutton stuffed with parsley.


Faith guess who.


'Tis impossible among so many whores.


Faith Tabitha, none but gentle Mistress Tabitha.


We shall have him turn Brownist now, and read Comments upon the Revelations.


Thou hast hit it Dogrel: I'll put my self into a rare garb; Buff, thou must
off, tru^y Buff thou must.


'Slid, a good humour; I could find in my heart to change religion too.


Pox! no body will change with me, I'm sure. But can thou put off swearing
with Buff? can thou abstain in the middle of long grace from crying a plague
upon him, the me^ts cold? can thou repeat scripture enough to make a Puritan?
I'm sure for understanding thou'lt be like enough to any of them.


Let me alone, I'll deal with no oath above gods fatlikins, or by my truly:
exclaim upon the sickness of drinking healths, and call the Players rogues,
sing psalms, hear lectures; and if I chance to preach my self, woe be to the
act, the object, the use, and applica^ion.


Thou art an everlasting stinker Colonel, 'tis a most potent humour, there's
mustard in it, it bits in the nose.


Dog^el, take heed of swearing before Tabitha.


If I look not as grave as a Judge upon the bench, let me be hanged for it.


Come away Physicians; 'slid I'll be of some Religion ere^t be long too.


You hear me --


Sir --


Sir me no sirs: I say you shall marry Mistress Tabitha.


I hope sir --


I, when I bid you do any thing, then you are a hoping; well, what do you hope
sir?


That you'd be pleased --


No, I will not be pleased till I see your manners mended: marry gap, you'll be
teaching your father.


I am --


Go to, you're a foolish boy, and know not what's good for your self: you are?
what are you, pray? we shall have you crow over your father.


I shall observe --


You will not sure? will you observe me? 'tis very well if my son come to
observe me i'my old days, you will observe me? will ye?


I mean sir --


You shall mean what I please, if you be mine: I must be bound to your meaning?


It may be --


You'll teach me what may be, will you? do not I know what may be? 'tis fine,
'tis very fine: now i'your wisdom, now what may be?


That Captain Blade --


That what? what can he do? I'll see his nose cheese before you shall marry his
niece. Captain Blade's a swaggering companion; let them swagger, and see what he
gets by his swaggering; I would have swaggered with him for his ears when I was
a young man. And though I have done swaggering -- well -- I shall meet with
Captain Blade, I hold him a tester on it --


(Would he were gone.) I shall obey --


Obey me no obeyings, but do what I command you. I'll to the Widow, and talk
abo^t her portion: stay ^ I had almost forgot to tel you; oh -- Mistress
Tabitha's a virtuous maid, a very religious wench; I'll go speak concerning her
portion.


It may be sir --


You^ll never leave this trick, you'll be at your may-bees; take heed boy, this
humour will undo thee -- she cannot have less then three thousand pounds: well
-- I'll go see -- and do ye hear? she goes plain, and is a good huswife; which
of your spruce mincing squincing dames can make bone-lace like her? o tis a
notable, apt, quick, witty girl -- I'll go to her mother about the portion.


About this time her letter promised me a meeting here: destiny it self will
sooner break its word then she. Dear Mistress, there's none here besides your
vassal. She's ready --


Ha! why this covering?
This is mystery darker then the veil
That clouds thy glorious face; unless t'encrease
My desire first, and then my joy to see thee,
Thou cast this subtler night before thy beauty.
And now like one scorched with some raging fever,
Upon whose flames nor dew nor sleep hath fallen,
I could begin to quarrel with the darkness,
And blame the slothful rising of the morn;
But with more gladness entertain't, then they,
Whose icy dwellings the cold Bare ore-looks,
When after half the years continued night,
And the most ^edious night of all but death;
A sudden light shot from their horizon,
Brings the long wisht-for day, which with such glory
Leaps from the East, as doth thy mateless beauty.
When thus the mist departs --
Why shrinkst thou back?
I prit he let me see thee, Lucia.
I'd rather some good power would strike me blind,
Then lose the cause for which I love mine eyes:
At least speak to me: well may I call it night,
When silence too has joined it self to darkness.
And did I not swear I would not --
Thy witty goodness can save others too
From sinning: I had quite forgot my oath
Yet sure an oath forced from a lovers tongue
Is not recorded in heavens dreadful book,
But scattered loosely by that breath that made it.
However thy blessed Letter makes me patient:
Thou give all virtues: I can love thee thus.
And though thy skin were such, that it might seem
A black veil cast by nature over thy body,
Yet I would love thee, Lucia: every night,
Which is the harvest-time of all our hopes,
Will make thee as you are now; and dost thou think
I shall not love thee most then?
We trifle here: I'll follow thee, O heaven;
Prosper the wise invention which it hath taught thee.

Is he carried to prison? that damned Urinal-monger, that stinking
Clyster-pipe-rogue! that ignorant Satin cap! He has not so much physic as
would cure the toothach. A slave that poisons Gentlemen, to keep his hand in
ur Must a slave come up stairs mount the bank for money, and not be
dishonoured down? He look^d as patiently then, as any Fiddler need to do. Give
me some small beer, and the godly book; I must not go to hell; there are too
many Physicians there. I was never in a worse disposition to die, in my life:
my guts begin to squeak already. Nothing vexes me now, but that I shall stand
pictured in a Ballad, with Beware the physician, or some such sentence, coming
out of my mouth. I shall be sung in Smithfield: not a blind Ale-house but the
life and miserable death of captain Blade shall be pasted up in: there shall I
be brought confessing my sins at the later end, and giving good counsel. (You
will be jumbling still.) Ten to one but Dogrel makes an Epitaph; there's
another mischief. Here, take the book again; I'll not trouble my brain now I'm
a dying.


Here's the widow, Sir, and her daughter, come to see you; and they have
brought M. Knockdown to comfort you.


How? everlasting Knockdown? 'Slid, will they tro^ble a man when he's a dying?
Sirrah, blockhead, let in Knockdown, and I'll send thee to heaven before me. I
have but an hour to live, my Physician says, and that's too little for him to
preach in.


Shall I let the widow come in?


That's a she -- Knockdown too. Well, let her come in; I must bear all torments
patiently now. But, rogue, take heed of Ioseph Knockdown: thou shalt not live
with ears, if Ioseph Knockdown enter. A plague upon all Physicians.


How do you? how is't, Sir?


Cut off in the flower of my age, widow.


Not so, Sir, you are old, neighbour, God he knows.


In the very ^lower, i'faith. That damned quacksalver.


He looked like a rogue; a man might know him for a rogue, by his very eyes.
Take comfort, Sir; ye know we must all die either sooner or later. Our life is
compared to a flower; and a flower is subject to uncertainty, as M. Knockdown
observes.


O the torture of such a tongue! Would I were dead already.


Alas, good man! his tongue, I warrant ye, is hot: look how he raves, daughter!
I have heard, indeed, that many rave when they are poisoned. Think of your
sins, Sir.


I prithee molest me not; there's none of them worth thinking of. I'm hotter
then a dozen of Fevers: give me a cup of Sack there: Shall I die thirsty?


By no means, M. Blade. Fellow, take heed what ye give him: he must have none;
it breeds inflammations.


I'll never repent without a cup of Sack. Do, do, choose whether you'll ha'me
saved or no.


For his souls sake then, I'll drink to him in a cup of Sack


To my good journey widow. Sirrah, fill me a brimmer. Here, Tabytha.


Stand to 't now.


I'll warrant you I'll stand like a knight of the post: I'll forswear with the
devil. As for Cutter, he has don't forty times before a Judge already.


My dearest father, though we cannot call
The sentence of fate back that's past upon you,
Yet heaven has mixed some mercy with its anger,
And shown us the cursed plotters of your ruin.

How now, varle^s? ye see I'm going to heaven, and ye must follow; but the
Captain must be saved before the Colonel. Who art thou? a godly Weaver?


I am not he that I was of old: what hath passed, is gone and vanishes; but
what is now, remains.


No I'll besworn is he not; never was Christian creature so altered, as they
say.


He said a prayer last night so zealously, that all the house heard him, did
they not? Brother M. Cutter.


Sister, I did pour out my self last night. Captain, you're abused.


A small abuse; nothing but only poiso^d.


Yes faith, we saw the Physician, Mi^ress Lucia and Truman consulting all
together: the Physician plucked a box out, showed it them; they seemed to
approve: an oath of secrecy we heard them take, but suspected nothing, by this
hand. We honest men do seldom suspect others.


Is this true, Colonel?


Should I say it is not true, I should not tell the truth if I should say so.


You swear 'tis true?


Before an Elder I shall swear.


Aurelia, send for them immediately, as if I meant to see them contracted; and
bid the servants be ready to carry um away. I'll see them clapped up close before
I die.


I go, Sir.


Dearest Uncle,
I come to beg one boon of you, the last
Which you can grant me, or I need to wish.

Speak, gentle Niece.


That since the love 'twixt Truman and my self
Hath been so fixed, and (as our fortunes) equal,
You will be pleased to seal with your last breath
The confirmation of our loves, our Contract:
And when your soul shall meet in heaven my fathers,
As soon as he has bid you welcome thither,
He'll thank you for our marriage.

Oh by all means: where's gentle M. Truman? He's sorry for my death, good man,
I warrant ye. Weep not for me, dear Niece, I know it greives you. Where's
loving Mr. Truman?


Without Sir, waiting on your will, as on the voice of his good fate.


Pray call him in.


Oh the dissembling of these women; they're like a folded picture, that every
diversity of light represents diversely.


Hang all women beside you and your daughter, widow: I could almost like
Mahomets religion, for turning all the sex out of Heaven.


'Tis as we wished, dear Lady; O this blessed hour!


Away with them immediately, let them be sent to prison straight.


What means this rudeness? I understand not this incivility.


Ungratious children, ye have poisoned a most virtuous Soldier here.


I poisoned? what do ye mean?


Away with them I say, they shall ^inde another place to answer for it.


Hei ho! what pity 'tis.


Captain, prithee away with these two impertinences; since you must dye, let's
have a parting cup for shame.


But thou art turned Apostate.


I did but fain all this; I'm as very a Rogue as ever I was.


Thou speak righteously, we will not make a dry farewell on it. Widow. I have
some business with these two; shall I desire privacy a little while?


Fare ye well. Mr. Cutter, you can speak comfortably to him: I'll see you again
anon. Oh the wickedness of these worldlings! Come Tabitha.


The Doctor says, I shall dye without pain; therefore my sparks of Asia, let's
be merry for a while. Boy, fetch some wine and an hour-glass.


An hour-glass! what emblem shall we have? bring a sith too; and this same
lean, greedy, hungry Poet, shall act Time here.


Well said my little Pawn. So, thus I'll husband my time. According to my
Emperick's computation I am to live an hour; half which I do allot to drink
with you, a quarter to settle some business; and the rest to good medit^tions
and repentance. How like ye this my gallants?


Most Logically divided; never Scholer divided mess better.


How it sparkles! Never be drunk again? My Homer junior, have at thee; this
will string up thy Muse: rejoice young frog of Hellic^n.


No, rather let me weep, drop briny tears, Till I like Niobe --


There's a piece of her sticks in his throat still, drink it down Dogrel.


Do, for when I am once gone, ye must even like Mahumetans, count wine a thing
forbidden.


Let's drink, let's drink, whilst life we have:
You'll find but cold drinking, cold drinking in the grave.

A catch i'faith.
Boy go down,
And fill's the the other quart;
That we may drink the Captains health,
Before that we do part.

Why dost thou frown, thou arrant Clown c.


Ha hei boy's! another catch i'faith.
And all our men we^e very very merry.
And all our men were drinking,

One man of mine,


Two men of mine,


Three men of mine,


And a man of mine,


As we went by the way, were
Drunk Drunk, Damnable Drunk;
And all our men were very very merry c.

Hei brave boys! now, Cutter, thou art a precious Puritan.


And thou a puissant Captain. Some would have pined, and kept a quarter, and
howled at their death, and have been more froward and troublesome then a
Citizens wife when she takes Physic. This is true valour.


Sure he has died before, he's so expert at it.


What says old Priam to Achilles great?


'Tis well, I'm glad to see you in you Priams; but for all your Priams, and
your Killisses, what have you done with my Son?


Thrice was thy Hector drawn about the walls.


Xanthus and Simois, with his purple gore.


Alas, and welladay! we are stained all over.


Ha, ha, ha.


'Tis very well, excellent well, all's well that ends well; I say -- I shall
find Law I hope. My Son Dick in prison, and old Dick laughed at here by
Raggamuffins: 'Tis very excellent well; I thank you gentlemen I thank you
heartily.


'Tis not so much worth i'faith Sir; what do you mean Sir? pray spare your
courtesy, nay, I pray be covered Sir.


It may be so, 'tis very likely Sir, an there be Law in Westminster --


-- And what dost thou mean, old man?


-- And what dost thou mean, old man?


-- If thou mean to live long, plump, lusty, and strong;


-- Then take of the cup and the Can.


Ha, ha, ha.


Well, I'm made a laughing stock, it seems.


And good Sir --


Yes, I am made the laughing stock; I shall take some other course, I hold you
a groat. Rest ye merry Gentlemen, I pray be merry, very very merry.


Nay, you shall stay and drink first.


Shall I, Iacksauce?
Pray Sir, be you covered too.

Come old Iethro, here's a cup of wine will stir thy brains again, they're
mouldy now.


I, you'd poison me, would you? 'tis very well if a man may be suffered to
poison whom he pleases.


No, your good Son has got the art of poisoning.


My Son? Thou lie. My Son?


If ye be raging Lyon-mad, do ye see that door? Be gone to your Son, and take
some juice of Opium: Thou wants sleep, Iethro.


There's Law, Captain.


There is so; would you'd go fetch it.


Nay there's none it seems.


True, there shall be no Law, so you'll be gone


There shall be no Law, say you? I desire no more, 'tis very exceeding dainty.
There shall be no Law; I desire no more, 'tis a kind of petty Treason: You'll
remember, Sir, that there shall be no Law: That's enough, I pray remember Sir:
and so farewell. There shall be no Law.


This worm-eaten old fellow has spoiled our sport. And what says my hour-glass
now? Time was i'faith.


How do you feel your self?


As hot as Hell. Come we'll take our last farewell within; and farewell here all
drinking. God send me a good journey, I say.


Then briny tears come trickling down apace,

For loss of him --


And what?


Nay, ye put me out.


Not poisoned you say?


No, hes as well as we.


It may be he has more lives then one, or used himself to poison, as we now,
that are Scholars, and Poets read, of one Mithidrates.


He was never sick.


Yes, very hot.


I, as a painted fire, his fancy made him so; I smell a plot in it. Lucia, you
say, urged him then for Truman. 'Twas a mere plot, I doubt, to put him in fear
of death.


I shall be taken for a kind of Rogue then, for bearing false witness


You shall not be mistaken, Sir, at all.


Pilloried, and whipped, with my godly brother Cutter.


Abused by the Prentices as you walk in the streets, and have rotten apples
slung at you.


Have a hundred blustering oaths of mine no more believed, then when I swear to
my Creditors, I'll pay all.


Be abandoned by all men above a Tapster; and not dare to look a gentleman
in the face; unless perhaps you sneak into a Play-house, at the fifth Act.


If ever I have to do with women again, but in the way of all flesh, may I dye
an Eunuch. I'll never lye or swear hereafter, but for my self. Were not you the
virtuous gentlewoman, with the brown paper-face, that persuaded me to it?


The very same, Sir; and I have just such another exploit here to employ thee
in: therefore be secret, close as a cokle, my good Rymer.


To employ me in!


Nay, you must do it i'faith; I have sworn first, Dogrel.


By this good light, I will do nothing at thy entreaty: not if thou should
entreat me to lye with thee. Must Poet Dogrel?


I, must, if he intend e're to drink Sack again; or to make more use of his
little-pocket, then to carry Tavern-bills in it; must do it, unless he intend to
die without a shirt, and be buried without a winding-sheet.


I like thy wit yet wench, what is't?


I would marry Puny; he's rich you know, and a bravery, and a wit.


He says himself he is so; but few are of his faith.


He dances too, and courts the Ladies.


Yes in more postures then a dozen of Bowlers.


But he's rich, Dogrel, and will be wise enough; when I have got'um knighted,
then I shall be a Lady, Dogrel; have a dozen of French-Taylors, Doct^rs,
Jewellers, Perfumers, Tyre-women, to sit in consultation every morning, how I
shall be dressed up to play at Gleek, or dance, or see a Comedy, or go to the
Exchange in the afternoon; send every day my Gentleman, to know how such a Lady
slept, and dreamed; or whether her dog be yet in perfect health: Then have the
young smelling braveries; all adore me, and cut their arms, if I be pleased to
be angry: Then keep my close and open Coaches, my yellow satin Pages, Monkeys,
and women, or (as they call them) creatures.


Be then a politic, Lady; keep none but ugly ones, you'll never be handsome
else. But suppose all this, what's this to Dogrel?


Dogrel shall be maintained by me, he shall have fine new Serge; and every day
more wine then's drunk at a Coronation.


This qualifies. And when the good Knight's dicing, or at bowls, or gathering
notes in private out of Romances; might not Dogrel have a bit?


Yes, like enough your Poetry might tempt some of my under-women to it. But are
you prepared to cheat, in your own behalf, and mine?


I, but how must this be done?


Why thus briefly. First read this Letter.


Dearest Truman, We have long desired to be contracted together, that nothing
might be wanting to our Loves, but Ceremony: To night about nine a clock, I
shall find opportunity to meet you at the garden door, and let you in; silence
and the help of veils, will save the violating of your oath. Farewell.

Yours, Luc. Blade.

I'faith, was this her writing?


No* but the hand's ^s like hers as the left is to the right. This you shall
show to Puny; and tell him that you found or stole it from Truman: I need not I
suppose instruct you, to polish over a lye; he knows their love, and cannot
suspect any thing; persuade him to make use of the occasion, and come himself.


And you^ll meet him veiled.


Hast thou found it out? thou hast shrew^d reaches Dogrel.


I'll do it. Thou shalt be blessed. I'll do it i'faith.


About it then; I'll leave you: and fail not, Dogrel; remember wine and serge.
But first, I have another way to undo thee, Lucia: And that I^ll try too.


Go thy ways girl for one, and that's for Puny I hope; I see thou'lt never turn
Seamstress, nor teach girls; you would be a rare wife for me, I should beget on
thee Donnes, and Iohnsons: but thou art too witty. We men that are witty know
how to rule our selves, can cheat with a safe conscience; 'tis charity to help
thee, Aurelia, and I will do it, and merit.


Our minds are like the Sea, and every Passion
Like some fierce Tempest stricken from the North,
Disturbs the Peaceful calmness of our thoughts:
Custom of anger drives us from our selves,
The Adrian Gulf a milder fury hurries;
Those Waves touch Heaven, but these arise to Hell.
Sometimes the winged whirle-wind of blind Avarice
Shoots it self forth, and sweeps up all before it.
Now we with greedy hope, knock at the Spears,
Anon the deadly hand of cold despair
Throws us beneath the grave: and midst these dangers
The flame of Love appears in stead of lightning;
And with sad glory frights the night it self.
Oh! 'tis a subtle fire! and kills, but wounds not.
Good God! What more then man can safely pass
The Bil^ows, Rocks, and Monsters of this Ocean,
Unless some power Divine, become his Pilot?
For then the winds would scatter, the waves shrink,
And th'outworn storm suffer it self a shipwreck.

Thanks good Taylor; now I'll only beg that I may buy your secrecy: Fare thee
well, Friend.


Ha! I did but speak just now of Heavenly powers,
And my good Angel enters! welcome
Lucia; I can scarce say so here, yet welcome heartily:
You see how ill our honest Plot succeeds;
I see we must out-weary fortunes anger,
And I have armed my self for it -- ha!
I have with much ado gotten to you, and can stay with you to night. (Ha!) Why
should we defer our joys longer, since we are married in heart? The
opportunity, and impatience of such delays, forced me to desire that which else
my modesty would not suffer me -- (Modesty?) -- Your desires -- to your bed --
long wisht-for -- (why this is strange) hum-hum-hum -- Yours, Lucia. No, no,
thou art not Lucia. If thou dost (As thou say) love me, do not use that name.


May all remembrance of thee perish with thee,
Unhappy paper, made of guilty linen.
The menstruous reliqu^s of some lustful woman:
Thy very ashes here will not be innocent,
But fly about, and hurt some chaste men's eyes,
As they do mine.
Oh thou that once were Lucia! thy soul
Was softer then, and purer then swans feathers,
Then thine own skin: Two whitest things, that paper,
And thine own self, thou did at once defile.
But now you are blacker then the skin that covers thee:
And that same gloomy shade not so much hides
Thy Bodies colour, as it shows thy Minds.
Kneel not to me, fond woman, but to heaven;
And prithee weep: tears will wash cleaner Ethiops --
Would thou have had me been mine own adult'rer?
Before my Marriage too? Would thou have given me
An earnest of the horns I was to wear?
Is Marriage only a Parenthesis
Betwixt a maid and wife? Will they remain
Entire without it? Go, pray go back,
And leave me too, since thou hast left thy self:
When peace is made with heaven, 'tis made with me.
What are these women made of? Sure we men
Are of some better mold. Their vows and oaths
Are like the poisonous Spiders subtle net,
As dangerous to entrap, and broke as soon.
Their love, their faith, their selves enslaved to passion.
Nothing's at their command, except their tears,
And we frail men, whom such heat-drops entice.
Hereafter I will set my self at liberty,
And live more free then is the air I breathe in:
And when I sigh, henceforth, it shall not be
For love of one, but pity of all the Sex.

But how shall I represent this Anthropophagus?


Only speak softly, lest she chance to know your voice.


I warrant you I'll whisper like wet wood in a Justices chimney at Christmas.


But of all things, take heed of too much wit; that's always dangerous, but
especially now. Truman, you know, is an honest harmless fellow, and is
contented to speak sense.


I, hang him; there's clotted cream in his head in stead of brains; and no more
of that then will completely serve to fill the eye of a needle. But I shall
never abstain from these fine things, hyperboles and similitudes: my nature
stands a tiptoe: Truman has got the cramp; his genius is like some gouty
Alderman's that sits in a chair. And I were in Phalaris's Bull, I think I
should be witty.


Nay, I know it; a man may as well keep a prentice from Moor-fields on a
holiday, as you from your Muses, and Canundrums; they're meat and drink to you.


No, my good bag-pipe, they're meat and drink to you, that feed by them.


I see you're ashamed of the Muses, and I hope they're even with you. But so
much for this: you^ll find wine, I hope, when I have found you the wen^h.


Though thou would drink cups bigger then Pa^ls-steeple, or the great bell at
Westminster, thou should have them. How long dost thou think has this night
worn her mourning-gown, and looked like a funeral?


Indeed, she has many torches. Why sure, 'tis just about the Critical time
which she appointed. You know your business: First break a piece of Gold;
profess before Heaven and Angels, you take her for your wife; then give her
half of it: and after that, somewhat as you understand me.


Will she be malleable, do ye think? Shall I stamp Puny on her?


There's a Metaphor indeed! It seems 'tis the fashion; you take your wife for
Gold. Hark! the door opens, use your fortune well.


Now, if my Alcocadin be right, I'm sure, I am made.


Pox upon them, they put me into a horrible fear; but I am glad I am so happily
cheated, for all that. Well, I must devise some horrible lye, to justify my
fears; some trick must be thought upon to gull Truman. How now? What news from
Tripoly.


Sad news, my Lord; here's an Army at the door, to speak with you.


Who are they? Creditors? a Merchant, a Mercer, a Scrivener, a Taylor, a
Butcher, Six Cooks, a dozen of Vintners, and the rest? Ha? Tell them I am sick,
taking Physic, or else abroad; hang them Rogues, come like quotidian Agues on a
man.


No, Sir, 'tis old Mr. Truman, the Widow, and her daughter, and Mr. Dogrel, and
I know not who; there's a stock of them.


They are those I wished for, let them in. Blade, If ever thou would see the
golden age of yore, this is the time.


O Sir, my Son has poisoned you, I see; there's no Law yet, is there?


Mr. Trum^n --


True me no more then I true you. Come, Captain Blade, I know what you are, and
so shall others too.


You'll hear me, Sir, I hope --


And so shall you hear me, Sir; I can be heard, I would you should know, in as
good a place as this is; and before as good as you are, Captain Blade.


First leave your raging, Sir: for though you should roar like Tamerlin at the
Bull, 'twould do no good with me.


I Tamerlin? I scorn him, as m^ch as you do, for your ears. I'll have an action
of slander against you, Captain; you shall not miscall me at your pleasure:
remember you called me Iethro once before.


O the Father! little did I think, I wuss, to see you ever with these eyes
again.


Pray, Sir, hear me; The wrong I did you, when you were last here, came from
distraction only, and not my will; and therefore deserves pardon. The
business, if you please, I'll relate truly to you; and by what special
providence I escaped the danger.


Well, Sir, I'm not angry; but I'll not be called Tamerlin by any man.


Upon my faith, Sir, it was an Antidote; I vomited up more then any whale could
have done; things of more colours then twenty Rhetoricians were ever able to
invent.


I shall teach my son --


No good Sir, I forgive him with all my heart: but for my Niece -- You
remember, Sir, the Will my brother left; you were witness to it. For this her
disobedience, the means are fallen to me. Now if you please to marry M. Richard
to my daughter, Lucia's portion shall all be hers.


Thank you good Captain Blade; I thank you for your love heartily: pray send
for them; he shall do it presently. I thank you heartily for your love, good
Captain: he shall do it, he shall do it.


Well, I praise God, Sir, in better health then I deserve, vile wretch. I'm
glad to see our neighbour so recovered.


I, good man, he has had a dangerous time of it, that he has, a very dangerous
time: his niece is a naughty wench, a scurvy girl, to repay him thus for all
his care and trouble: he has been a father to her, Widow, that he has; to my
knowledge he has: Her father was an honest man, I'm sure on it.


Was he? I, as ever trod upon Gods ground, peace be with him; I, and as loving
a neighbour too --


We have drunk our half pintes of Muscadel together many a morning, that we
have.


My husband too was all in all with him. Hei-ho! I shall never forget how merry
we were when we went with him to Mortlake in the Easter-holy-days: and we
carried a shoulder of Mutton with us, and a fat Pig, and he carried his bottle
of wine down with him: I warrant you he he loved a cup of wine as well as his
brother; in a fair sort, I mean.


Ah widow! those days are gone: we shall never see those days again. I was a
merry grig too then, and would ha'danc'd and cut capers: ha -- who but I? I was
as merry as the maids.


My daughter Tabytha was just four year old then, come Lamas-tide.


Captain, I thought thou had been at Ere^us by this time: but 'tis no matter;
'tis but an Epitaph lost: hanged, 'twas made ex tempore and so let it pass.


Had thou made one i'faith?


Yes, by thy, light.


I'm glad I did not die then. O here they come. She's a good handsome wench;
'tis pity to cozen her. But who can help it? Every one for himself, and God for
us all.


Welcome, kind Niece; you see I live still: there were Antidotes as well as
Poisons.


He has been a loving Uncle to you, Mistress Lucia: he might have deserved
better at your hands: you might had Master Truman, I warrant you, had you but
held up your finger to him: he would not have seen you perish, Mistress Lu^ia; I
may say I know him so far. Speak, Mistress Lucia, speak for your self, good
chuck; your Uncle will forgive you: we'll all speak for you: He shall forgive
you, that he shall: he knows we have all our faults.


I understand the language of her silence; it's strong and good. You bound your
son, Sir, to an oath never to see nor hear her without your commission: 'tis
that troubles her conscience; she has a tender one.


I bound them? Well, I absolve them then; what's that to you, Sir? I'll bind them
again, if 't be my pleasure so: if not, a fig for you; that's all I care. I
love to speak my mind; you must pardon me, I have spoke to as good as you i^ my
days.


Do ye speak thus always? I'll have you in a Play if you do.


I'm glad you are so religious, Sir; did I bind you too to silence? Go too,
Sir; I told you what your may bees would bring you to, you'll always be wiser
then your father: Nay, you may speak, and your Minion too, if she pleases.


Does any man here accuse me of any thing?


We, and your conscience do.


My Conscience? 'tis as pure as Sythian Crystal,
From any spot; I can see throughout at pleasure.
Whatever crime you mean, (for yet I know not)
Would it were written in my face.

You would be blacker then a Moor if 'twere. Did not you consent with that
damned Physician to give me poison?


There was none given you, I call God to witness:
If such a thought had slipped into my dream,
The horror would have waked me, and I feared
Ever to sleep again. No; what we did, Sir,
Was but to fright you with a painted danger;
That the just terror of your own destruction
Might call to your remembrance my dead father:
For sure, Sir, you forgot him when you thought
To match his only child with one of these
Fellows that live extempore; whose fortunes
Are patched up like their wit by several pat^ons.
Should I have married thus, (but I would sooner
Endure the shameful end which they deserve)
Your conscious Ghost would start to meet my fathers,
And look more pale then death it self hath made it.

Let her alone, she'll call names and fling stones about anon.


Alas poor soul! you may see she's not her own woman.


What a poor excuse she made! a very idle simple excuse; have you never a
better for us?


No, she says true.


You wo'nt bite off my nose? will ye, Sir? pray do not bite off my nose, I
pray, Sir, do not?


What a bevy of men's here! ha! My little Load-stone, art thou here, my little
Diamond? I'll speak to your Uncle now; we'll have a Parson cry I Nicholas
presently.


You're rude, Sir: what do you mean?


I, so you said in the garden, when I began to gather, you know what fruit: Come
put on your vail, you'll blush else; and look like the picture of a red-rose
in the hangings. Captain, Salve, 'tis done.


Done! What?


I have her, i'faith.


God give you joy, Sir.


Nay, she's my own.


I am very glad of 't.


I scaled the walls, entered the Town, and left a garrison there, I hope.


I congratulate your Victory, Mr. Puny.


You shall go to my wedding, with me and thi^ fair Chorus. I'm as nimble as a
Lybian Rabbit: Come, you must go, though you be as lame as a cripple, that b^s
at Westminster, or a Crow in a gutter without her right leg. What do ye wonder
at? I tell you, she's my Penelope now.


May I be so bold, Sir, as to ask, who 'tis you mean?


'Slid, can thou not see my meaning? are your brains in a litter? I'm
contracted to your Niece, and have got upon her -- Nay, never blush, we're as
good as married, my dear Agate.


Have you then lien with her?


Ha! No figures nor similitudes, good Mr. Puny; be as open and naked with me,
as you were with her.


As plain as a Scholars mourning-cloak. I have don't i'faith, but do ye see? We
broke this gold between us first, and will be married to day. Who's that?
Truman, ha, ha; he looks like the Globe of the World, now: look how he
scratcheth his poul.


God give you joy, Sir: but she has not a farthing portion.


How, Captain?


Not so much as will buy ribbands: all s mine own: a lawful prize, i'faith.


Oh monster of her sex!


Wilt thou, vile man -- I cannot speak to him -- Witness all these --


So 'tis all forfeited to me. Will you try how your sons affection stands
towards Aurelia?


Come, Dick, the Captain has forgiven you: never think of Lucia; she's not
worth your thinking on; a scurvy girl: never think of her; thou shalt marry
fair Aurelia: there's a wench, a wench worth gold i'faith.


I can't marry.


What can't you do, Sir?


I can't marry.


Do you know who 'tis you speak to, Sir? you do'n't sure: Who am I, pray? you
can^t, when I bid you. Surely you know not who 'tis you speak to: you shall
do it, or I'll know why you shall not.


I won't marry.


Get you out of my sight: come within my doors no more; not within my doors,
Sir.


Take heed, M Truman, what you do.


I wo'n't marry.


Pray hear me all --


Come, M. Truman, let's talk of these things within: come, Gentlemen.


Hei-ho! I'll never trust a wart of the right cheek and a twinkling eye again
whilst I breathe, for Mistress Lucia's sake. A man would, think, that sees her*
that butter would not have melted in her mouth. Take heed, Tabytha; the still
Sow eats up all the draff, I see.


I'll never acknowledge him for my son again: I tell you, Captain, he's always
thus; he's always with his may-be's and his wo'nots: I can't abide these
wo'nots, not abide them.


I ll follow him about the portion; he sha' not think to make an Asdrubal of
me.


Now my plot works.


How precious were those tears, if they were true ones!
How much more worth then all the Oceans Jewels!
But they are only false and empty bubbles;
Fair to the sight, but hollow as her heart:
There's nothing, nothing in them: he that weighs them,
Shall find them lighter then a mad mans dreams,
Or women's resolutions.

I never did that fellow any wrong.
Why should he pay so dearly for the loss
Of my poor honour, as to sell his soul for it?

O she confesses, now, sh'has lost her honour.

They triumph in the ruin of us women,
And woo our beauties only, or our dowries;
Which when they miss of, they resolve to take
Revenge of their unworthiness on us;
Stealing away all that makes rich our dowry,
And beauty fair, our Name. But 'tis no matter,
Since heaven and Truman know my chastity.
Ha! he's here still! How do you, Sir?

Well, well.

You look ill.

No, no, no.

Indeed you do: your are not well, Im sure.

I am. Will you be gone?

How, Sir! You do not know me, sure.

I would I never had.

What do you mean?

To see thy face no more.

You said you could not live without the sight on it.

It was a good one then.

Has one day spoiled it?

O yes, more then an hundred years of time,
Made as much more by a continual sorrow,
Could ever have done.

I do not think my glass will say so.

That's
A false as you, perhaps; but 'tis not half
So brittle. Dares your husband trust me alone
With you so long?

My husband?

I cry you mercy;
The man you sin withal. You scorn to use Pretences.

Yes, I do, Sir:
For she that scorns the offence, needs no excuse
Have you so little confidence in that
Which you have seemed to praise so oft, my Virtues?
Or did you flatter only? Sure you did not:
For I remember I have heard you swear
You spoke your thoughts. Are Oaths but complements?
'Tis done unkindly, very unkindly, Truman;
And were 't not your self, I should be angry.
Had a bright Angel come to me, and said
That you were false, I should have sworn ^t had lied,
And thought that rather false then you. Nothing
Could ever move the opinion of thy constancy
But thine own self; and thee I must believe.

And I'll believe my self in what I saw.
I know thou can speak prettily; but thy words
Are not what Nature meant them, thy minds picture.
The Be has left his honey in thy tongue,
But in thy heart his sting.

O do not say so:
My heart is honest still, unless thou spoildst it
When it received thee in. 'T had but three corners.
And thou had two, at least. Would thou could see
How little room I've left my self there in it.

Yes; for 'tis crowded up with many guests;
So many guests, that they excluded me:
And now I freeze without; but never more,
Never will enter: 'twas a Palace once,
But now tis turned a Dungeon.

Will you leave me?
I will not call you fickle nor unconstant;
But sure you are too blame: you will not find
A woman that will love you half so well.

I do not mean to try.

Yes, prithee do.
But when y'have talked, and loved and vowed, and sworn
A little while, take heed of using her
As you do me. No, may your love to her
Be such as mine to you; it can't be better,
What ever you think; I'm sure it cannot, Truman.
May she be worthier of your bed then I,
And bring forth many little selves to you:
And when the happy course of divers years
Makes you seem old to all besides your wife,
May you in the fair glass of your blessed issue,
See your own youth again. But I would have them
True in their loves, and kill no innocent maids.
For me it is no matter: when I'm dead,
My busy soul shall slutter still about you;
'Twill not be else in heaven: it shall watch
Over your sleeps, and drive away all dreams
That fly not with a soft and downy wing.
If any dangers threaten, it shall beckon,
And call your spirit away till they be past;
And be more diligent then your Guardian-Angel.
Only sometimes, when your best leisure serves,
(For I'd not trouble you more dead then living)
Bestow ^ne thought on Lucia, and then sigh,
And (if you will) drop down a tear or two.
But that's a task Ill not enjoin you to:
And if you do it, spend not too many on me;
One will suffice: then only say, That maid
Deserved more of me. And again t'your business.
For my wronged virtue and forsaken truth,
I ask no more. So, dear False-man, farewell.

Farewell? That word has charms and poisons in^t;
It makes my frighted soul start back and tremble.
'Tis but an aerie word. Do ye hear me, Lucia?



Farewell, Lucia, farewell; that's all: farewell
Repent, and meet me in heaven --
Why did rash Nature quarrel with her self,
In making one so excellently bad?
She is more fair then May^s new painted blossoms,
But falser then the smiles of faithless April:
And this I know, and yet me thinks I love her.
O she has killed my Reason: I have lost
That and my self for ever.

Every thing now has left me; tears themselves,
The riches of my very grief, forsake me:
Sorrow, me thinks, shows nakedly without '^m.
My sighs are spent too; and my wearied lungs
Deny me fresh supplies: and I appear
Like some dull melancholy ^pril-even,
When after many a shower the heavens still lower,
As if they threatened more; and the s^ed Sun
Leaves nothing but a doubtful blush behind him.
And I could wish my eternal night were coming,
Did I but know who 'tis that makes me wish it:
Else, when my soul is ready for her slight,
And knows not who it is she must forgive,
A thousand light suspicions will call
Her charity several ways; and I may chance
To doubt thee, T^uman. But thou art abused:
I know not why; but sure thou could not do it.
I fear thee, cousin When we were both girls,
Thou would accuse me falsely to my Mistress,
And laugh to see my tears. I fear thee, cousin;
But I'll not judge too rashly: for I would not
Have any innocent wronged as I have been.
But I^m resolved to try her. She's now seeking
(Hoping that all my fortunes now are hers)
For a new maid t'attend her. That maid I'll be.
Clothes I have got already; and my face
Grief has disguised: that and my voice some art
Will quickly alter. I have left a Note
Upon my chamber-window, which will keep them
From all suspicion of my staying here.

Hei! the Sisters are ravished, and we have holy kisses enough. I shall be as
great among them as -- Who's there? What, your Spouse, Pury?


She looks like Niobe on the mountains top.


That Niobe, Dogrel, you have used worse then Phoebus did. Not a dog looks
melancholy, but he's compared to Niobe. He beat a villainous Tapster the other
day, to make him look like Niobe.


Why faith that 's pretty odd, like one of mine.


O, Sir, had you the virtuous impudence to slander a poor maid thus?


Poor enough now indeed. I will not marry thee: thy portion was a condition of
the Contract. I'll sooner marry a woman that sells Orenges with a face like
Belinsgate.


I scorn thee -- I contracted to thee?


Were not? Answer.


No, by heaven.


Bear witness, Gentlemen; these words are Ca^duus benedictus to me.


And what will you do now, fair Gammer Lucia, you that contemned the Colonel?
Will you knit for your living?


Or else weed gardens for six pence a day and bread.


This is unheard-of rudeness.


Nay let me have mine too; I have got a pat one for her. Or else turn
Apple-woman, live in a stall, and sell pippins for eight a penny.


Or hither in triumph 'twixt two panniers ride,
And sell the bouls of wheat and butter in Cheapside.
The last is a little too long: but I imitate Spencer.

What think ye, Gentlemen? she'll make a pretty Laundress.


A Laundress? hang her, she looks like a foul handkercher.


Pray let me go; I have business requires me.


What? you're to meet some Gentlemen? How is't? twelve pence a time, I warrant,
in these clothes.


Where do you set up? Nay, we are true strikers. What, is't in Covent-garden?


Or do you renew the decayed credit of Turnbal-street?


Or honour the Mill-bank at Westminster.


Or flee to Wapping, and engross the Sailors.


Or Moor-fields, and sell cakes.


Are all barbarous here?


Nay tell's; we shall be customers.


Enough, enough; give her a clap of the breech, and let her go.


Well, fare thee well, girl; we shall find you at the Play house in the
six-peny-room sometimes.


And do ye hear, Lucia, Keep your self wholesome: your tub's a terrible thing.


Unworthy villains -- But I'm born to wrongs,
And must endure them.

Ha, ha, ha.


A pretty Scene i'faith. Now for the Captain; he'll entertain us like foreign
Princes: we'll drink this half-yeer with him before we eat or sleep.


I'll drink like Gog-Magog himself, or the Spanish Tinker on a holy-day.


There will I whet my Lyrick Muse
With Falern wine as I do use.
Captain Blade cannot refuse
To entertain us; he cannot choose,
When we bring him such good news,
As that his niece is gone to the stews.

Leave your verses, Dogrel. I hate your verses, Dogrel, till I be drunk. 'Tis a
glorious Captain.


As free as Free-town in Germany* Here comes Ieronymo.


The story says my niece is run away. The story is not bad. Now will I get the
widow, turn off my old rascally companions, and live like an Emperor.


He says he will live like an Emperor; ha, ha, ha, brave Captain.


Invincible Captain Priam.


Hei brave Captain!


What do you mean, Gentlemen? Are ye broke loose from Bedlam? Have you no other
place to play your tricks in, but at my door? If you come here as Mummers, much
may be done; happily you may have twelve-pence: or else depart; depart, if you be
wise.


Why how now, Captain!


If you be not gone immediately, I'll have my men switch you further off -- Here
are saucy knaves indeed with all my heart --


By this light the Captain's drunk without us.


Prithee, Captain, thou art as humorous as a bell-rope. Dost thou know me, man?
I'm M. Puny.


Y' are a fool, an addle egg: there's nothing else but cobwebs in your head:
The height of all thy knowledge is to find out the quarter day against thy
rents come in, and thou could not find out that, if 'twere not marke'd in the
Almanac with red letters. Yet you forsooth, because you see some Gentlemen and
Poets of late, a little extravagant sometimes in their similitudes; because
they make a pretty kind of sound to those that mark them not; make that your
way of wit, and never speak without comparisons. But never were comparisons so
odious as thine are. And these two Rabbit-suckers, for a quart of wine extol
thee, and cry good when thou speak so.


The Captains raging mad like a Baker when his oven is over heated.


And that was one of um --


Come leave your humours, hang you, confound you, pox take you, Captain, we come
to drink here.


Mine's no blind Ale-house, where you may roar and swagger with half a pipe of
Tobacco in your mouth.


Do you know me, Captain?


I would I never had. Thou art one that say thou hast seen the wars, but
thou lie basely; for if thou ever wast in a battle, i'm sure thou winkest
there. Thou art one that liv'st like a Raven by providence and rapine: one that
if thou should chance to go to bed sober, thou would put it down in thy
Almanac for an unlucky day; sleep is not death's image with thee, unless thou
be dead-drunk.


He dares not abuse me thus.


Is't even so, Captain? Has your money exalted you?


No, it has humbled me, and made me know my self and you, whom I shall study to
forget hereafter.


Come, Captain, shall you and I drink hand to hand?


Oh, you're his Lansprizado, Sirrah, Trundle.


Let not thy wrath swell like the Adrian Sea.


Thou that trouble thy self to be a fool; I will so beat thee, Trundle, that
thou shalt hobble like one of thy own Rhyms. Therefore, if ever thou show
that Poetical face of thine within my doors again, I'll use thee worse then thou
did me, when thou made an Ode in commendation of me.


Then break thine oaten reed --


Fare ye well Gentlemen. I shall see thee Cutter a brave Tapster shortly; it
must be so i'faith, Cutter; thou must like Bardolph in the play, the spigot
wield. Dogrel shall make and sell small Pamphlets in the playhouse, or else
Tobacco, or else snuff Candles. As for Puny, his means will serve him to be
cheated of these five or six years.


'Tis very well the times are so altered.


Ye cannot want a living Gentlemen, as long as there are Whores,
Bowling-allies, or Ordinaries; especially such able men as you are. There will
be wars too shortly; never quake, Cutter; here's Dogrel, when his want has spun
him out a little thinner, will serve you for a pike.


'Tis very well: pray God your mirth last, Captain.


When you're grown old, and your fingers then only nimble with the palsy, I'll
provide an Hospital for you -- Sedes ubi fata quietas -- Fare ye well,
Gallants; and pray be merry: Fare ye well heartily.


Poverty, the pox, an ill wife, and the Devil go with thee, Captain.


I vexed him, when I put that jest upon him, like a Baker when his oven's
overheated.


If I don't compose a Satire shall make him hang himself, may I never write
verse more.


I would beat him like a Buck, but I shall be bound to the peace for it, and be
affronted afterward by every one.


No, no, no -- let me see -- Besides my Satire I have another way -- let me see
-- His brother traffickt at Guiny.


Yes, but the Merchants there report him dead.


The more knaves they: he lives, and I am he.


How? How, Dogrel, thou the Merchant man?


By this light, I either am, or will be.


How, Dogrel! Though thou be as thin and penetrable as a spirit, yet thou can
not assume dead bodies.


Prithee, Dog^el, hold thy peace; thou talk like a hogs f^ce.


De^ide not Puny: if I be not more like then any of your similitudes, I'll be
hang^d for it.


Thy face, indeed, will do exceed^ng well to represent one risen from the grave


By long conversation with the Captain, I know all the passages between him and
his brother; know what his humour, what his state and fortunes were, better
then himself did when he lived.


I, but thou 'lt never act him. Why, man, he was a thing more st^ange then any
monster in Africa where he travelled.


What was he, prithee?


I knew him well enough; he had lost his memory, and therefore either writ down
every thing, and took his business with him in a scroll, or else trusted it to
his man Iohn, whom he carried with him.


O I, that Iohn and he went perpetually together, like the blind man and his
dog.


Or a Tinker and his t^ull. But do ye hear, gallants, let me do apple- Iohn:
never was such a Iohn as I'll be, not Iohn a Gaunt himself, nor Iohn a Nook.


But Dogrel, how wilt thou be made like that Cinque-^ater?


Why we Poets can do any thing. First you may remember (unless you be like him)
'tis seven years since he went from hence; and time, you know, will alter men.
I made an Ode upon that subject once: Time, that dost eat, and makst no Lent --



Pox take your Ode; go on in your business, Dogrel.


Then I and my man Iohn (as simply as he stands here) will swarthy over our
faces as if the Country had made us so: for if you remember my verses, In
Africa they are black as coals --


The devil's in thy verses. Prithee on.


Besides, we'll be attired in some strange habit of those Countries: I know not
how; but you shall see it in Speed, Maps.


Why now I like thee, my little Ovid; go about thy Metamorphosis. I'm for
Tabyth^; she's taken, Dogrel, ^elted like virgins wax. I ll to her presently,
and tell her that the vision appeared to me last, and warned me to carry her to
S. (...); there will I have a Priest.


A Priest, Cutter?


A Minister, I mean; a holy, godly, zealous Minister: and she -- You conceive
me, Dogrel --


Well, let's be going then. Puny, take heed of your wit when you act Iohn: I
shall beat my servant Iohn, if he be witty.


That's the devil; I shall hardly abstain.


And Dogrel, you must make no verses, Dogrel: let that be the first thing your
memory fails you in.


Well, I'll follow you in a pissing-while.


Do so, good Iohn.


Now will I turn Iohn, as round as a Wedding-ring: and if that plot be cut of^
by the nose -- Ha? Here comes sententious Bias that walks gravely. I'll observe
my young Laconian.


She's gone for ever. Peace be with thee, Lucia.
Where ever thou art.

Now he begins his Epithala ^ium.

If she be guilty,
Forgive her, heaven; she'll repent, I'm sure:
For she is soft, and melting as the dew,
That kisses every morn the ^embling roses;
And howsoever beauty and youth misled her,
She cannot be, I know, a stubborn sinner.

Did ever Basket-maker talk thus?
to himself too, l^ke a Conjurer in a garden?

Ha! This is he, that wicked man,
That devil which betrayed her.

O, are you thereabouts?

Nay stay,
For were thou armed with thunder and my anger,
Yet I would bring thee back. Tell me what charms,
(For I will rip thy heart up but I'll know it)
What witch-craft did thou use t'entice her thus?
Never deny it. For had thou been more handsome
Then other men's, or thine own flattery
Could ever make thee: hast thou been as beautiful,
And could have spoke as well as she her self,
All this were nothing; she would look upon thee,
But lust no more then thine own Angel does.
No, thou did use some cursed art to tempt her,
Some Philter --

Not I by all -- what do ye mean pray, Sir?

Why then you ravished her, by Heaven you ravished her:
Alas, she's weak and tender, very tender,
And was not able to resist that strength
Which youth and furious lust did arm thee with.
'Twas basely done, above expression basely,
And I would presently revenge it fully,
But that my sword would take from the laws justice,
And from thy shame.

I ravish her? By this light I scorn't.

You did enjoy her body? Did you not?

I did so.

You did? I prithee do not say you did so;
This is to brag of the vile act you have done:
But I shall spoil your pride and shameful glory
Which your base sin affords you.

You bid me tell you the truth, what would you ha'me do?

Do? I would have thee fix thy adulterous eye
Upon the ground, which thy cursed feet dishonour;
And blush more red then is the sin you have acted.
What would I have thee do? I'd have thee weep,
Shed as true tears as she does for thy fault,
And sigh away thy body into air.
What would I have thee do? I^d have thee kill thy self.
And sacrifice thy life to her wronged Soul.
Can thou refuse to do all this for her,
For whom you have damned thy self?

We were contracted first ever I enjoyed her.

Did thou enjoy her then? How durst thou do it?
Why she was mine, I tell thee she was mine;
All the Seas wealth should not have bought her from me,
While she remained as spotless as my love:
And so she did remain till thy sin stained her.
I tell thee to that hour she was more innocent
Then thou, false man, were in thy mothers womb.
Did thou enjoy her? Either fetch back that word,
Say, nay I'll have thee swear thou did not touch her,
Or by those joys which thou hast robbed me of,
I'll kill thee strait.

'Siid I did not touch her. What would you have me say? would I were Iohn the
Merchants man now.


O Heavens! O most unheard of villainy!
Th hast done a crime so great, that there is hardly
Mercy enough in Heaven to pardon thee.
Tell me, (for now I'll argue mildly with thee)
Why should you seek to undo a harmless maid?
To rob her of her friend^, her life perhaps,
I'm sure her fame, which is much dearer to her.
'Twas an inhuman act; an act so barbarous,
That Nations unciviliz'd would abhor it:
I dare say boldly she never injured you;
For she was gentle as the breath of Zephyrus:
And if she ever did but begin a thought
Of wronging any man, she would have wept
Before she thought it out.

I had rather be a pickled* Oyster, then i'this case I am in now.


Is Lucia abused? and I stand here
T expostulate with words her injuries?
Draw, for I'll talk no more with thee.

Do ye hear, Sir -- by Heaven I lay with her, but we were contracted first --
will you be pleased to hear me?


No, be gone.


Most willingly. Fare ye well heartily, Sir; I wish you a good night-cap.


The want of sleep and diet has distempered me,
If I stay thus I shall be quite distracted;
Me thinks a kind of strangeness seizes me:
And yet if I go home I shall be forced
To marry with Aurelia. Is it possible
There should be women good, if Lucia be not?
They are not sure: She looked as well as any,
And spoke as well too.

I tell you, Captain, he's a stubborn boy, a self-will'd hair-brain'd boy: he
has his know-nots, and his wo'nots, and his may be's, when I speak. I have told
him of his manner a hundred ti^es; nay I may say a thousand.


Pray take ^y counsel for this once: though I be a soldier, yet I love not to
do all things by force. Speak fairly to him.


Speak fairly to my son? I'll see him buried, I'll see his eyes out first.


I mean, desire him.


O, that's another matter. Well, for your persuasion, I'll do it: but if ever I
speak fair to him --


I know his nature's such, that kindness will sooner win him -- Look you, he's
here i'faith, as melancholy as an owl in the day-time.


O, are you there, Jacksauce --


Nay, remember what I told you.


'Tis true indeed How now, son Dick? you're melancholy still, I see.


It best becomes my fortune, Sir, now you have cast me off.


I cast thee off? marry God forbid, Dick. How dost do, Dick? Thou look ill,
Dick, in troth thou dost: I must have thee merry.


I see all kindness is against this dotards nature, he does so over-act it.


Wilt thou have a Physician, Dick? Thou art my only son, Dick, and I must have
a care of thee: thou should ride abroad sometimes, Dick, and be merry. We'll
have a wife too for thee, Dick, a good wife, ha --


I thank you, Sir; but I know not --


I, now he's at his know-nots. I will make you leave those know-nots, boy --


Remember, M. Truman, what I told you.


'Tis true indeed. Your father's old now, Dick, you see, and would fain see a
grandchild: tis out of love to you, Dick, that I persuade you to it; you may be
a comfort, Dick, to your father now.


You may comm^nd me.


Well said, Dick, I see thou love me now, Dick; dost thou want any money,
Dick? or clothes? or horses? You sh^uld tell me what you want, you shall have
any thing -- here's the Captain, a hearty friend of yours -- where's your
Daughter, Captain? there's a wench, Dick! ha you seen her?


Yes, Sir.


And how do you like her, Dick? speak freely.


I know no cause why any should dislike her.


Why well said, Dick; keep thee of that mind still, and God will bless thee.


Your father means, Mr. Truman, I suppose, how you like her for a wife.


I can tell my own meaning my self I hope, I'm old enough I'm sure.


You wrong her much, I never shall deserve her.
Alas, I am a man so weak in all things,
So lost both to the world and to my self;
That if I loved a woman heartily,
And wooed her with all zealous passions,
And valued her love 'bove all things else but Heaven;
Yet, when I thought upon my own unworthiness,
I should my self persuade her not to marry me.

Well, Sir, if you esteem her worth your choice, she shall be yours.


Why what should air him, Captain? He esteem her? Must he, forsooth, or I be
Master pray? Captain Blade, you make him too saucy with such talk; never tell
me, Captain Blade, I say it makes him too saucy, I marry does it, it does
i'faith; must he be his own Carver? Come no more words, I^ll have you married
presently: i'saith law, Captain, you make him too saucy, that you do, you do
i'faith, Sir; I can't abide when sons must come to esteem, he esteem her with a
vengeance?


I desire time only to consider --


I, why I told you this; 'tis such a another wilful, hair-braind Coxcomb, he's
always a considering. Captain Blade, I could never keep him from his
considering; but I shall so consider you -- go get you in, Sir, I'll have it
done when I please; get you in, Sir, I'll keep you from considering hereafter.


What did you say your name was?


Jane, forsooth.


Well said, Iane; and as I told you, Iane, you shall have six pound a year,
Iane, for your wages; and then my clothes will serve you with a little
alteration: There's a gown of my Cousins within will almost fit you, you're much
about her height, you shall have that too. I had a Cousin here was a foolish
thing god wot, 'tis well I'm rid of her -- and do ye hear -- you must be very
secret and faithful to your Mistress; a waiting woman's place, is a place
require, secrecy.


I shall ill deserve your favour else.


Nay, I dare trust thee, Iane, thou look ingenuously: did thou ever live at
Court?


No forsooth.


O, you must learn the fashions of the Court: I'm already contracted to one Mr.
Puny, though he little things of it; Take heed of speaking, Iane, you see I
trust you. And when I'm married to him I'll live at Court: He's a simple thing
God knows, but I'll have him knighted, and I like him the better for it: A wise
woman you know will make the best use of a foolish husband. You know how to
dress me, Iane, in the Court fashion?


Yes forsooth.


And you can lay me on a Fucus handsomely?


I hope I shall quickly learn it.


And when you see a friend with me, or so, that I would be private with; you
can stay in the next room, and see that no body come in, to interrupt us?


I shall not be deficient in my duty.


Well said. And can you tell in private such a Gentleman that you heard me
speak in commendation of him, and that I dreamt of him last night? that will be
in your way, Iane, such men will be grateful. And say that I was longing
the other day, for such a jewel or such a toy?


I hope you shall not find me wanting in any service to you.


I believe thee, Iane. To morrow I'll teach thee more: I shall read to you
every day a lesson, till I see you perfect in the science: 'tis requisite that
you have a little of the Theory first. Go look out the pearl chain in the
Cabinet within; and stay till I come to you.

The wench I see is docile, and will learn; but alas she must have time; she
has a little to much City breeding, I see, by Curtsies and forsooths.


How now? all alone, Aurelia? you're eating soap and ashes here, I warrant you,
without so much as saying grace for them.


I'd rather repent in ashes, Sir, then eat them


What would you think if I should marry now this very day?


I should think, Sir, you'd repent to morrow for^t.


And the widow too.


The widow? then you'll repent to night, Sir, I believe.


I wooed her long ago, and now she sees there's an estate fallen to me, faith
she's content; and, to save charges, is willing to be married to day privately.


But I hope you are not so, Sir: why we shall have all the silenced Ministers
humming and hawing thrice a week here; not a dish of meat but will be longer a
blessing then a rosting. I shall never hear my Virginals when I play upon them,
for her daughter Tabytha's singing of Psalms. The first pious deed will be, to
banish Shakespeare and Ben. Iohnson out of the parlour, and to bring in their
rooms Mar-prelate, and Pryns works. You'll never endure 't, Sir You were wont
to have a Sermon once a quarter at a good time; you shall have ten a day now.


Let me alone to deal with them. If any of her eating talking tribe show their
ears here, I will so use her tribe, that they shall free the Pope, and call me
Antichrist hereafter: and the widow, I^ll warrant you, I'll convert: I'll carry
her to Plays, in stead of Lectures: she shall see them, as well as the dancing
of the ropes, and the Puppet-play of Nineve. But this is not my business, girl:
I have an husband too for you.


I could wish you would keep him, Sir, if you have him; I know not what to do
with him my self.


Come, 'tis a man you'll like, I'm sure; I have heard you often commend him for
his parts. 'Tis young M. Truman.


Truman, Sir? the melancholy cross-arm'd Gentleman that talks to trees and
rivers as he goes by them? We should sit all day together like pictures of man
and wife, with our faces towards one another, and never speak I'll undertake,
upon our Marriage-night he'll only sigh a little, cry Cruel Fate, and then go
sleep.


Never fear't. Come, thou shalt have him, girl: go quickly and dress your self;
we'll both be married on a day. The humour is good, and it saves charges:
there's the widows humour too.


You'll give me leave, Sir --


No, no, no; prithee go dress thy self: by heaven it must be as I say: the
fates have ordained it.


Be pleased to hear me, Sir.


I would not hear thee, though thou were an Angel. I'm as resolute as he that
writ the Resolves. Come away, and adorn thy self.


Me thinks. I look now like a two-peny apple pie, I know no^ how.


Iohn, What's your name, Iohn? I have forgot your name, Iohn.


Do you mean the name that was given me at the Font?


Font? Font? I do not remember that Font. Let me see my scroll.


Your memory, Sir, 's as short as an Ephemerids.


Did not I warn you, Iohn, of such strange what-d'ye-call ums? Here's for that
word.


Pox take you, Dogrel, you strike too hard.


You would act well, I see: we'll have thee to Golden-lane, and there thou shalt
do a King, or else some God in thine own clothes.


When a dead man from Orcus I retract,
Well may you see that to the life I act.

Did not I warn you of these what-d'ye-call-ums? Faith we'll be even, Master.


Very well, Iohn; those be good Memorandums for your Master.


I should be angry with thee for it, but that I have quite forgot it.


Let's see your scroll. Lucia; a handsome fair maid with red cheeks, black
eyes, and brown hair, and a little dimple in her chin. My brother's name (to
whom I left the charge of my daughter) is Blade. (A most excellent Note
indeed.) What have we here? Memorandums concerning my estate. What, they're all
of this stamp, are they not? Take heed, Dogrel, the Captain's a shrewd fellow;
he'll examine you more strictly then the Spanish Inquisition can.


Pish, if he pose me in any thing, my memory's weak, he knows; I h' forgot it
quite.


And then your voice I fear; and then --


Pox take you, Cutter; a Casuist would not find so many scruples.


The devil's in it, I shall never do this part; I know not how to speak and not
be witty.


Well, look to it, gallants; if the Captain find you out, he'll abuse you most
unmercifully -- I'm now for Tabytha.


The Captain abuse me? By this day, I'll jeer with him with my hands bound
behind me. Come away, Master.


I, Iohn; but which way did we come?


Why this way, Master.


Then that way we must go. Is not this my house in Fleet street, Iohn I thought
you had said to had been in Fleet street.


Yes, so 'tis, Sir.


Truly I thought you said so. Come away, Iohn.


And the vision told me, sister Tabytha, that this same day, the twelfth of
March, in the year of grace 1641, at this same holy place, by a holy man, we
two, who are both holy vessels, should be joined together in the holy band of
Matrimony.


My mother will be angry, I'm afraid.


Your mother will rejoice. I would not for a world that you should do it, but
that we were commanded from above; yea, I may say commanded: for, to do things
without a divine warrant, is like unto the building of a fire without a bottom
cake.


I (God knows) that it is.


Very well, sister. Now when my eyes were opened in the morning, I awoke: for
it was morning-tide, and my eyes were opened; and I looked into my pockets; for
my breeches lay upon a joined stool not far from the beds side: and in my
pockets, even made with leather, I looked (I say) and found; What did I find?
marry a License written with ink and pen: Where did I find it? in no other
place, but even in a godly Catechism which I had wrapped and folded up long-ways,
even in that very pocket.


I would my mother knew it. But I'll not resist, God willing.


There is a godly Teacher within, that never was defiled with the Cap and
Surplice, never wore that gambol called the Hood; even he shall join our hands.
Shall we enter, sister?


Brother, I'll not resist.


And must we marry then?

It appears so by the story.

Why will you marry me? What is there in me
That may deserve your liking? I shall be
The most ill-favour'd melancholy Bride-groom
That ever took a melting maid t'his bed:
The faculties of my Soul are all untuned,
And every glory of my spreading youth
Is turned into a strange and sudden winter.
You cannot love me sure.

No by my troth, Sir.

No, nor I you. Why should we marry then?
'Twere a mere folly, were it not Aurelia?

Nay, ask our Parents why. But, Sir, they say
'Tis the best marriage where like is joined to like;
Now we two are a very even match;
For neither I love, you nor you love me;
And 'tis ten to one but we shall beget
Children that will love neither of us.

Nay, by my Soul I love you, but alas,
Not in that way that husbands love their wives;
I cannot play, nor toy, nor kiss, nor do
I know not what: And yet I was a lover,
As true a lover --

A lack a day, Sir.

'Twas then me-thought the greatest happiness
To sit and talk, and look upon my Mistress,
Or (if she was not by) to think upon her.
Then every morning next to my devotion,
And sometimes too (forgive me Heaven) before it,
She slipped into my fancy, and I took it
As a good omen for the following day.
It was a pretty foolish kind of life,
An honest harmless vanity: But now
The fairest face moves me no more then Snow
Or Lillies when I see them and pass by.
And I as soon shall deeply fall in love
With the fresh scarlet of an Eastern cloud,
As the red lips and cheek^ of any woman.
I do confess, Aurelia, thou art fair
And very lovely, and (I think) good natured.

Faith, Sir, I would not willingly be a man, if they be all like you.


And prithee now, Aurelia, tell me truly,
Are any women constant in their vows?
Can they continue a whole week? a month?
And never change their faith? O if they could,
They would be excellent things. Nay, never dissemble:
Are not their lusts unruly, insolent,
And as commanding as their beauties are?
Are their tears true and solid when they weep?

Sure, Mr. Truman, you had not slept of late;
If we be married to night, what will
You do for sleep?

Why? Do not married people use to sleep?

Yes, yes. Alas good innocence!

They have a scurvy time of't if they do not;
But we'll not be as other people are,
We'll find out some new handsome way of love,
Some kind of way that few shall imitate,
But all admire. For 'tis a sordid thing
That lust should dare t'insinuate it self
Into the marriage-bed. We'll get no children,
The worst of men and women can do that.
Besides too, if our issue should be female,
They would all learn to flatter and dissemble,
They'd all deceive with promises and vows
Some simple man, and then turn false and kill him.
Would they not do it Aurelia?

Our sex is little beholding to you, Sir; I would your mother were alive to
hear you. But pray, Mr. Truman, what shall we do when we are married?


Why we'll live lovingly together:
Sometimes we'll sit and talk of excellent things,
And laugh at all the nonsense of the world:
Sometimes we'll walk together into the fields:
Sometimes we'll pray and read, and sometimes eat,
And sometimes sleep; and then at last we^ll die,
And go to heaven together. 'Twill be dainty*

We may do this, me thinks, and never marry for the business.


'Tis true, we might do so:
But since our parents are resolved upon it,
In such a trifle let them have their humour.
My father sent me here to complement,
And keep a prating here, and play the fool:
I cann^t do 't. What should I do, Aurelia?
What do they use to say?

Sure. Sir, you knew, when you were a suitor to my cousin Lucia.


I, but those days are past, and I have now
Forgot what manner of man a lover is:
I was one then, I'm sure on it. O that Lucia,
That Lucia was so wonderful a creature --
There was a cheek, a lip, a nose, an eye!
Did you observe her eye, Aurelia?

Yes, yes, Sir, you were wont to sit all day,
And look upon the pretty babies in it.

It was as glorious as the eye of heaven,
Like the souls eye, dispersed through every thing.
And then her hands! her hands of liquid Ivory!
Did she but touch her Lute (the pleasingest harmony
Then upon earth, when she her self was silent)
The subtle motion of her flying fingers
Taught Music a new art, To take the sight
As well as th'ear.

I, I, Sir, you'd best go look her out, and marry her.

Nay prithee be not angry, good Aurelia;
I do not say she is more fair then thou art:
Yet if I did -- No, but I will not say so:
Only I strive to cherish the remembrance
Of one I loved so well. And, now I think on it,
I'll beg a favour of you: you'll laugh at me,
I know, when you have heard me: but I'll beg it:
Prithee be veiled as Lucia was of late;
Cast such a silken cloud upon thy beauty
For this one day: I'd fain marry you so.
'Tis an odd foolish humour, I confess:
But love and grief may be allow'd sometimes
A little innocent folly.

Well, I'll obey your humour; pray walk in there;
I'll only dress my self, and wait upon you.

And we'll be married very privately.
None but our selves, it will be best, Aurelia.

Why here's a husband for a wench of clouts! May I never laugh again, if his
company has not made me duller then Ale and buttered cakes would have done. I
marry him? the old men must excuse me. I'll sooner choose a fellow that lies
bed-rid, and can do nothing a-nights but cough. Well, if I don't teach them what
'tis to force a wench that has wit, may my husband beat me when I have one, and
I sit still and cry. I like this very well -- It shall be so. Iane, come
hither, Iane.


O Iane, that's well; little think you what good's towards you; 'tis that you
have wished for, I dare say, th^se five years; a good handsome husband. What
think you of young Truman?


I think every thing
That makes a man complete, and his wife happy,
The richest glories of a mind and body,
And their not ill companion, Fortune too,
Are reconciled and married all in him:
And I commend the wisdom of your stars,
That join you two together.

Nay saith thou shalt even have him thy self for better or worse. He's too
handsome indeed, unless he could make better use of his beauty; for by my troth,
wench, I'm afraid thou'lt find thy pillow as good a bed-fellow.


I pray do not mock your servant.


Thou shalt see, Iane, I do not; come in, wench, and I'll tell thee all my
plot.


Well, Sir, is the Cook doing according to my directions?


Yes, Sir, he's very hard at his business in the kitchen: h' has been a swearing
and cursing at the scullions at least this hour, Sir.


'Tis such an over-wasted Coxcomb; an other wedding dinner would make him a S.
Lau^ence: bid him be sure the Venison be well seasoned


Troth, Sir, I dare not speak to him now, unless I put on the armour in the
hall: he had like to have spitted me next to a goose, for saying that he looked
like an ox that was roasted whole at S. Iame's fair.


You have invited a^l the guests to dinner you talk^d of?


Yes, Sir.


And the widows round-headed kindred?


Yes, Sir.


They'll come i'their guarded petticoats, will they not? You should have bid them
eat no por^ige at home, to seem more mannerly here at dinner. The widow will
be angry at their charges, but I'll please her at night. Go bid the Butler look
to his plate, and not be drunk till he sees it all in again. Whose at the door
there?


Faith, Sir, you know as well as I; some charitable beast come to be dressed
here. Shall I call the Cook, Sir?


Why this is my house here, Iohn: ha! ha! little thought I to have seen my
house in Fleet-street again. Where's my brother Blade?


They call me Captain Blade.


Is this he Iohn? Let me see


'Tis now just seven, Sir.


Seven! me think's I was here but yesterday: How the what-d'ye-call-'um runs?
What do ye call it?


Time, Sir.


I, I, Time. What was't I was saying? O, I was telling you brother, that I had
quite forgot you: was I not telling him so Iohn?


By my troth, Sir, we are both quits then; for I have forgot you too. Why, you
were dead five years ago.


Was I so? I have quite forgot it. Iohn, was I dead five years ago? My memo^ry
fails me very much of late*


We were worse then dead I'm sure; we were taken by a barbarous kind of Nation,
and there made slaves these five years. Iohn quoth he! I was poor Iohn indeed:
I'm sure they fed us three whole years with nothing but Acorns and water: we
looked like wicker-bottles.


How, Sirrah? Did your Master look like a wicked boat-man?


Where did they take you prisoners?


Nay ask Iohn, he can tell you I warrant you. 'Twas in -- tell him, Iohn, where
it was.


In Guiny, Sir.


By what Country-men were you taken?


Why they were called -- I know not what they called them 'twas an odd kind of
name; but Iohn can tell you.


'Slife, who I Sir? do ye think I can remember all things?


'Tis in my book here; I remember well the name of any Country under the Sun.


I know their names, Sir, well enough; but I only tried my Masters memory.
They 're called Tartarians.


How say you? what were they?


Tartarians, Sir.


I, I, these were the men


How, Iohn! why all the world, man, lies between them: they live up in the
North.


The North?


I, the very North, Iohn.


That's true indeed: but these were another nation of the Tartarians that lived
by us.


Well, how escaped you, Iohn, at last?


Why faith, Sir, to tell you the truth, for I love not to tell a lye, the
Kings daughter fell in love with me, and for my sake there set us free. My
master has it all in his book; 'tis a fine story.


Strange! In what ship did you come back?


What ship? why 'twas called -- a thing that swims -- How do ye call it?


What? the Mermaid?


No, no, no, let me see --


What? was't the Triton?


No, no -- it swims, I tell you.


The Dolphin?


No, no -- I have forgot what 'twas.


What say you, Iohn?


(Pox take him.) I, Sir? O God, my Master, Sir, can tell as well as I.


He says he has forgot.


Tis his pleasure to say so, Sir: he may say what he pleases. (A plague upon
him.) You can't conceive the misery we have past, Sir.


Well, brother, I'll make bold to ask one question more of you. Where did you
leave your Will when you went away?


'Slife, now he's pos'd again.


I'll tell you presently, brother; let me see. Blade the whole charge of my
estate -- hum -- What did you ask me brother?


In what place you left your Will?


I, that was it indeed; you're in the right; 'twas the very thing you asked me;
and yet see how quickly I forgot it. My memory's short, alas, God help me.


This is no answer to my question, yet.


'Tis true indeed. What was your question, pray?


Where you left your Will.


Good lord^ I had forgot you asked me this; I had forgot, i'faithlaw, that I
had: you'll pardon my infirmity, I hope, brother; for alas -- alas -- I have
forgot what I was going to say to you; but I was a saying something, I am sure.


Did not you know us, Will? prithee tell's true.


No, by this light: why, you're grown as black as the chimney-stock.


That's the nature of the Country where we lived. O the stories that I shall
tell you! And how does Nell, and little bonny Bess? are they as merry grigs as
ever they were?


No; Bess, poor wench, is married to a Chandler; but she's true blue still, as
right as my leg, I'll warrant you.


What is't, Iohn? what was I going to say, Iohn, to my brother?


I know not, Sir; was't not about your daughter?


I, I, my daughter -- What do ye call her?


Lucia, Sir.


'Tis true indeed; my daughter Lucia, brother.


Pray walk into the parlour; I'll come to you presently, and tell you all.


Well, Iohn, put me in mind of my daughter Lucia. (A plague of your
Tartarians.)


(And of your what-d'ye-call ums.)


('Slife, Tartarians.)


If these be rogues, they are as impudent as Mountebanks and Jugglers: and if I
find them to be rogues, (as I see nothing yet to the contrary) how I will
exercise my rogues! The tyranny of a new Beadle over a beggar, shall be nothing
to mine. Come hither, Will, what think you of these two fellows?


Faith, Sir, I know not: but if you think it be not my old Master, I'll beat
them worse then the Tartarians did.


No, no, let's try um first. Thou wast wont to be a very precious knave, and a
great acter too, a very Roscius. Did not thou once act the Clown in
Musidorus?


No, Sir; but I plaid the Bear there.


The Bear? why that's a good part; you are an acter then, I'll warrant thee. The
Bear's a well penned part. And you remember my brothers humour, don't you? They
have almost hit it.


Yes, Sir, I know the shortness of my Masters memory; he would forget sometimes
to pay me my wages till he was put in mind on it.


Well said. I'll dress thee within in his own chamber; and all the servants
shall acknowledge you. But who shall do trusty Iohn?


O, Ralph the Butler, Sir; he's an old actor, Sir, h'has plaid a King he says.
I have heard him speak a Play ex tempore in the Buttry, Sir.


O Ralph, excellent Ralph, incomparable Ralph, Ralph against the world! Come
away, William; I'll give you instructions within. It must be done in the
twinkling of an eye.


Now, Mistress Tabytha Cutter, let me kiss thee.


Pray God my mother be not angry.


Think not of thy mother, Spouse; I tell thee, Spouse, thou shalt be a mother
thy self, within these nine months.

Come to my bed, my dear; my dear come to my bed:
For the pleasant pain,
And the loss with gain,
Is the loss of a maidenhead.

Is that a Psalm, brother husband, that you sing?


No, no, a short ejaculatory. Sirrah boy, are the things within that I spoke
for?


Yes, Sir.


Go fetch them in. Tabytha, let's be merry: Can thou sing a catch, wench? O
well said, Boy!


What do you mean, brother husband?
I hope you'll not turn roarer.

What? do these clothes befit Queen Tabytha*s husband? this hat with a
chimny-crown, and brims no broader then a moderate hat-band? Give me the
Periwig, boy. What? shall Empress Tabytha's husband go as if his head were
scalded? or with the seam of a shirt for a band? Shall I walk without a sword,
and not dare to quarrel in the streets, and thrust men from the wall? Will the
Fiddlers be here presently, boy?


Yes, Sir.


Pish, I can't abide these doings. Are you mad? O lord! what will my mother
say? There shall come no Fiddlers here.


Be peaceable, gentle Tabytha; they will not bring the Organs with them. I say
be peaceable; he vision bid me do thus. Wilt thou resist the vision?


And these be your visions -- Little did I think 'twere -- Is this your
religion and praying? Which of all the Prophets wore such a map about his head,
or such a sheet about his neck? What shall I do? I am undone.


What shalt thou do? Why, thou shalt dance, and sing, and drink, and laugh;
thou shalt go with thy breasts open, and thy hair braided; thou shalt put fine
black stars upon thy face, and have great bobs for thy ears. Nay, if thou dost
begin to look rustily, I'll have thee paint thy face like the whore of B^bylon.


O that ever I was born to see this day!


What? dost thou weep, Queen Did^? Thou shalt have Sack to drive away thy
sorrow. Come hither, boy, fetch me a quart of Canary. Tabytha, bid me give you
drink: we must obey these visions. Sing, Tabytha: Cry on your wedding-day? 'tis
ominous.

Come to my bed, my dear;
Come to my bed:
For the pleasant pain --
O art thou come, boy -- Well said, fill a brimmer; nay fuller yet, yet a
little fuller. So. Here's to the Lady-Spouse; to our good sport to night.


Drink it your self, if you will; I'll not touch it.


By this hand, thou shalt pledge me, seeing the vision said so. Drink, or I'll
take a Coach and carry thee to a Play immediately.


I can't abide --


Why, this will clear thy heart, wench: Sack, and an husband, wench, are both
comfortable things. Have at you again.


I'll pledge you no more. not I.


Here, take this glass, and take it off too, or else I'll swear an hundred
oaths in a breathing-time. Here --


Well, you're the strangest man --


Why this is right now. Nay off with it. So. But the vision said that
whatsoever we left of this same wine, would turn to poison straight. There,
here's to you, Tabytha, once again: 'tis the visions will.


What? must I drink again, then? Well, I'll not resist. You're such another
brother-husband.

Come to my bed, my dear;
Come to my bed --
How was't? Twas a pretty one.


O divine Tabytha! Here come the Fiddlers too. Strike up, you rogues.


What? must we dance now? is not that the fashion? I could have danced the
Coranto when I was a girl. The Coranto's a curious dance.


We'll dance out the disease of the Tarantula: but first we'll have a health to
my pretty Tabytha.


I'll begin't my self. Here, Duck, here's to all that love us.


A health, you eternal scrapers sound a health. Bravely done, Tabytha: what
think thou now of thy mother?


A fig for my mother; I'll be a mother my self. Come, Duckling, shall we go
home?


Go home? the Bride and the Bridegroom go? We'll dance home. Before us,
squeakers: that way, and be hanged. So. O brave Queen Tabytha! excellent
Empress Tabytha! On, you rogues


I must not be fob'd off thus about my daughter: I remember not your excuse;
but Iohn can tell well enough, I warrant you.


I have told you the plain truth: you'll not be angry, I hope.


I shall have cause to be angry, I fear: Did not I leave her to his charge,
Iohn? Brother, I tell you --


I must not answer, brother --


I know you put me out, that I might forget what I said to you before:
remember, Iohn: I'll be as cunning as you're crafty: remember, John. How now?
what's the matter?


Ho, my old Master's come; he's lighted now at the door with his man John: he's
asking for you; he longs to see you: my Master, my old Master.


This fellow's mad.


If you wo'n't believe me, go in and see, Sir: he's not so much altered, but
you'll quickly know him. I knew him as soon as I saw him. Pray, Sir, go in.


Why this is strange.


If this be true, what course shall we take, Dogrel? I begin to shake like a
plum-tree-leaf.


We'll shift some way or other, I warrant you.


How, Dogrel? prithee how?


Let the worst come, we can be but whipped, or burnt in the hand, a^ the most.


Ho, our best way will be to hang our selves -- 'Slife, here's John.


Give me thy hand i'faith, boy: is't possible that thou should be alive
still?


Ha rogue! art thou come i'faith? I have a pottle of Sack to welcome thee.


Why you'll not look upon your poor friends, John Give me thy golls, John. How
hast thou done this great while?


I thank you all heartily for your love; thank you with all my heart-law. What?
my old bed-fellow Robin? how dost do? when shall we steal Apricots ag^in? do ye
remember, Robin?


A murrain take you; you'll never forget your roguery.


A murrain take you all: this was your plot, and be hanged* Would I were Puny
the Wit again.


Accursed Fate --


Come, John, let's go to the Buttry and be merry: Ralph longs to see you, I'm
sure.


And how does Ralph? good honest Ralph? That Ralp's as honest a fellow, though
I say it my self; I love him with all my heart-law, that I do; and there's no
love lost, I dare say for him.


Come, my masters, will you go in? I'll prevail with the Cook for a slice or
two of Beef; and we'll have a cup of Stingo, the best in the ce^lar.


Well said, steel to the back still; that was your word, you know. My master^s
coming in: go. I'll follow you straight.


Make haste, good John, for I can't stay.


Here's a company of as honest fellows a^sa ma^ would with to live in the house
withal; all, no man excepted*


Would I were out of the house, as honest as they are. Here they come, John.


John, quoth he, with a pox.


Me thinks you're not returned, Sir,
But born to us anew, and I could wish
My tongue were not more niggardly then my heart
In giving you a welcome.

Thank you good brother. Truly we have past through many dangers; my man shall
tell you all, I'm old and crazy, and forget these things.


Pox on it, the Widow's come already; keep them here John, till I come back. O
are you here sweet-heart?


Who have you yonder, I pray?


O you should not have seen them yet, they are Maskers.


Not vagrant players, I hope?


No, no, they can only tumble, and dance upon the rope, you shall see them
after dinner. Let^s away sweet-heart, the Parson stays for us, he has blown his
fingers this hour.


I'm glad the Captain's gone, now will I sneak away, like one that has stolen a
silver-spoone.


I'll be your man and follow you.


Who are these Iohn? By your leave, Sir; would you speak with any here?


The Captain, Sir. But I'll take some other time to wait on him, my occasions
call me now.


Nay, pray, Sir, stay. Whom did you say you would speak withal?


The Captain, Sir. But another time will serve. I have some haste of business.


Whom would he speak with, Iohn? I forget still.


The Captain Sir.


Captain? What Captain Sir?


Your brother I suppose he is.


'Ti, true indeed, I had forgot that my brother was a Captain. I cry you mercy,
Sir, he'll be here presently. Are you an English-man, Sir?


Yes, Sir.


Where were you born I pray?


In London, Sir. I must leave you --


In London? you're an English-man then I see, Sir. Would you have spoke with me
Sir?


No, with your brother, but my business with him requires not haste, and
therefore --


You're not in haste you say; pray sit down then: may I crave your name, Sir?


My name's not worth your knowlede, Sir; but my mans name's Iohn.


(If I be John any more I'll be hanged) No my name's Timothy, Sir.


Mr. John Timothy? Very well, Sir. You seem to Be a Travellor.


We're newly come out of Africa, and therefore have some business that
requires us


Of Africa? Law you there now. What Country pray?


Prester John's Country. Fare you well, Sir. now.


Marry God forbid. What come from Prester John, and we not drink a cup of Sack
together?


(What shall I do?) Friend, shall I trouble you to show me where your house of
office is?


You'll stay here Mr. -- what's your name, pray?


Timothy, Sir.


Gods me, 'tis true indeed Mr. John Timothy.


Ill only make water, and come to you.


The door, Sir, is locked; the Captain has locked us all in here, if you^ll be
pleased to stay, Sir, till he comes --


(I'd as live stay to meet the Devil, or a Sergeant.)


(Would I were hid like maggot in a pescod; we shall be abused I see, oh, oh,
oh,)


What makes you quake so, Sir?


Nothing, only I have an extreme list to make water: 'Tis nothing else by this
light.


My brother would not have you gone it seems. Your names Mr. John Timothy, is
it?


No, that's my mans name.


O, your mans name; 'tis true, 'tis very true indeed, that's your man's name.
You'll pardon me, Sir?


Pray, friend, do you know the great City called Astervadil, where my name-sake
Prester-Iohn keeps his Court?


Know it? I, very well; I have lived there a great while, I have cause to
know it.


There's a brave Castle of three miles long.


I, and many stately building too.


The noble men's houses are all built of Marble.


They make indeed a glorious show. I have seen them.


It may be so. But to my knowledge, friend, there is no such City there.


It may be the names are altered since I was there. (Here's the Captain, I'll
sneak behind the hangings.)


I like this Person well, h' has made short work on it, he had appointed sure
some meeting at an Ale-house. Welcome wife, welcome home now. But I have two
brethren which you must know.


Marry, Heavens for^sheild, Sir.


Brethren in God sweet-heart, no otherwise. Come hither Guiny brother; what say
you?


This Gentleman, Brother, has stayed for you here; pray use him kindly, he's a
Traveller: where did you say you travelled Sir?


O yes! How do you, brother?


I your brother? what do ye mean?


Why, are not you my brother Blade that was taken captive by the Tartars? Ha!


You're merrily disposed, Sir: I your brother! I taken captive by the Tartars!
Ha, ha, ha! I understand not your meaning, Sir.


What an impudent slave's this! Sirrah monster, did not thou come with thy
man Iohn?


I, my man Iohn? here's no such fellow here, you see: how you're mistaken, Sir!
you mean some other man. This is the strangest humour.


Sirrah, dost thou see this fist? dost thou see this foot? I'll wear these out
upon thee --


Hold, pray Sir, hold. I remember now indeed that I was Blade the Merchant; but
I had quite forgot it. You must pardon me; my memory's very weak.


I like the humour. But I must know, Sir, who you are, now you have left being
my brother.


Who, I? don't you know me? I'm Dogrel the Poet, and Puny was my man Iohn. Lord
that you should not know* me all this while! not know Poet Dogrel!

Why I intended here this merry play,
To solemnize your nuptial-day.

O thank you, M. Dogrel; Can you dance upon the ropes, and tumble? Truly I
never knew it before, not I.


Where's that fool, Puny? Is he slipped away?


(He was wise enough to do so, I'll warrant you.)


I will beat him so, that he shall not find a similitude for himself. As for
you, Dogrel, because you came off pretty handsomely, with the best at the last,
like an Epigram, I may chance to pardon you; but upon this condition, that you
make no Epithalamiums upon my marriage.

Well said, Will; bravely done, Will: i'faith thou shalt have two laces more to
thy Livery, for doing this so well. I told thee, Will, what 'twas to have acted
the Bear in Musidorus. And Ralph was a brave Iohn too --


How's this? I plainly see I'm an Ass then: 'twas this damned Puny's
fearfulness spoiled all.


(A pox of this coward Dogrel: I thought they were not the right ones.)


I see my Players had more wit then my Poet. Here's something for you to drink.
Go in now: this is your Cue of Exit; and see all things there in a readiness.


Nay, let the Master go first. Follow me, Iohn.


What, husband? Have you given them any thing? Indeed, Love, you're too lavish.


'Twas very wittily put off of me, howsoever.


How now? what have we here? another Puppet-play? Any thing now but brothers,
and I'm for them. Who? Cutter? What's the matter, Poet? Come, what device is
this? like one of yours?


Stay at the door, ye sempiternal squeakers. Come, Queen of fame.


Lord, I'm so weary with dancing as passes. Yonder's my mother. Oh mother! what
do ye think I have been doing to day?


Why what, child?


Nay nothing: I have only been married a little; and my husband and I have so
danced it since!


Brave Tabytha still! Never be angry, Widow; you know where Marriages are made.
How now, Captain? If I turn Tapster now, 'twill be happy for you: for I shall
be rich enough to trust you, Captain.


'Twas Gods will, I see, and therefore there's no resisting. But what do ye
mean, son? I hope you'll not turn swaggerer?


'Tis for special reasons, gentle mother. Why how now, Dogrel? M. Blade the
Merchant looks as if he were broke: he has turned away his servant too.


Who's that? M. Dogrel in these Players clothes? Can M. Dogrel dance too,
husband?


Prithee, Cutter, what hath exalted Tabytha thus?


What? this good fortune she has got by me: You know what a dull creature she
was before; her soul was in her body, like butter in a hot cake; now she's as
full of Spirits as Hell it self. My counsel and two cups of Sack, have wrought
this miracle.


Well said! You are joined then now, my blessing on you both; come in to your
father Blade. Nay, daughter Aurelia, off with your veil now. Ha! Whom have you
married here?


I know not, Sir. She was Aurelia when we went to Church.


This is my daughters maid. Where's the wench? Ho! Aurelia?


Here, Sir.


Here, Sir? Why do you make your husband lead your maid in thus?


My husband, Sir? what's that?


Why, huswife is not Mr. Truman your husband?


No, by my troth, Sir, I thank God.


These are fine tricks; delicate, dainty tricks. Sirrah, how durst you Sirrah?
-- and for your minion -- marry come up, marry a Chamber-maid? Well, Captain,
this was your plotting. You said indeed you'd make a Iethron of me: y' have
don't indeed; I thank you, Captain Blade, 'tis well. Out of my sight, Sir, with
your minion there, I say out of my sight. Ha! am I fooled thus? I shall make
some repent it, I hold a groat on it.


Do ye hear, Mr. Truman --


Yes, Sir, I do hear; and I will not hear if it please me, Sir; but some body
shall hear of this Captain. But, Captain, you're deceived, this is not a lawful
marriage.


Pray, hear me all; for I shall tell those things
That will appease your wrath, and move your wonder.
I've married Truman, and I will enjoy him,
And he will love me, I am sure he will;
For I am Lucia, the much injure'd Lucia.

Ha!


The habit of a servant I put on,
That I might find who 'twas I ought to pardon,
For all the wrongs done to me. I have found it,
Cousin, you know I have, and I forgive them.

Then all my plots are spoiled. Pardon me, Cousin:
And, Mr. Truman, know you have a wife
That is as pure and innocent as the thoughts
Of dying Saints? 'Twas I that with the veil
Deceived you in the Prison; it was I,
Who in that veil contracted my self to Puny.
Forgive me both; I do confess I've wronged you,
But Heaven has seen you righted.

O this blessed hour!
What shall I say? I know thou art all goodness,
But can thou pardon, Lucia, that great sin,
That high and mighty sin which I have done
In doubting of thy faith? I fear thou can not.

I do desire no more then that I may,
Deserve your better opinion, Sir, hereafter.
And uncle for your poison --

Speak no more of it,
I do confess it, Niece; and shall most willingly
Surrender up the charge of your Estate.
It hath pleased Heaven to restore me mine own
By marriage with this Widow.

Ha, ha, ha! To see how things are come about! I thought Dick would not be such
a fool as to marry one that he knew not. He knew her well enough, I'll warrant
you. How do you, Captain? I was somewhat rash: I'm an old man, alas.


Cutter, and M. Dogrel, you that sneak there;
You're precious witnesses. But no more of that.
You have been to blame, Aurelia. But 'tis past.
We want your husband here: Where's Puny?

(I'll venture out amongst them.) Dogrel; are you there?


What? my son Iohn? do ye know this Gentlewoman?


Do ye know this piece of gold, Sir, which you broke?


Hum? Yes faith, 'tis the same: thou art my Cynthia, wench, my Endymion: we'll
be married presently. O for a witty Parson to marry us two Wi^s!


Slife, one, two, three, i'faith four matches here at one time! What accursed
fortune^s this! there's three feasts lost: they'll dine all together.


I will not kiss thee, my little magazine, till I have washed my face Ha, M.
Dogrel, hast thou got no Spouse too?


The thrice three Sisters are my wives.


Well, because thou art a Poet, and my Jews-trump and I are Wits, thou shalt
eat and drink at my pavilion always.


You shall have wine and serge. Do ye remember, Dogrel?


Thank you: but I'll never lye for you again.


Come, let's all in to dinner.


THe Play is done, great Prince, which needs must fear,
Though you brought all your fathers mercies here,
It may offend your Highness, and we've now
Three hours done treason here, for ought we know.
But power your Grace can above Nature give;
It can give power to make abortives live.
In which if our bold wishes should be crossed,
'Tis but the life of one poor week that's lost.
Though it should fall beneath your present scorn,
It could not die sooner then it was born.
