HAil happy Powers, whose harmless [sway,
All the Sylvans do obey;
Had those above fed like to you,
(On Acorns and on Rain-bow Dew)
When the World lay in its Cradle,
And there was no fiddle faddle,
Saturn had still kept his Throne,
And not been outed by his Son;
'Tis head-strong Wine,
And Manchet fine,
That irritates
Ambitious pates:
Pan never quarrels with Sylvanus,
(For every Wood-god worships Janus)
The beauteous Nymphs are all in common,
None's the better Gentlewoman;
With a baneless love they greet,
Horns, and nails, and cloven-feet.
Then unto the Woods let's wander,
To find out Hero and Leander.

Nay, by my Altars that are reeking,
And those Lovers that are sneaking,
Homeward after full enjoyment, (...)
Either accept of this employment,
(Froward Boy) or else I'll strip the^,
And with Rods of Roses whip the^;
I have often (to my sorrow)
Felt the Launcing^ of thy Arrow,
Jove and Juno, Hermes, Hebe,
Mavors, Bacchus, yea and Phebe,
With the God that guides the Surges,
(Riding like a Belgic Burgess)
Will rejoice (like to inferiors)
While I plow up thy Posteriors,
Take away his Bow and Darts,
While I scourge him till a' smarts.
Bare his breech. Thalia --

-- had I
Taken the counsel of my Daddy
(Whom you cuckold every hour)
By this I might have scorned your power.
Cannot Mars his steely chine,
(Who has almost lost his eyne
With over-doing) nor Anchyses,
With his Piltrums and his Spices,
(To heighten Appetite) nor Pe^us
Sate your conduct to Cornelius;
But Adonis must be brought on,
To a thing he never thought on.

Impious Elf (Aeneas broher)
What's that to thee who rides thy Mother,
Horse him Thalia. --

-- Spare, O spare
(Great Goddess) this thy son Heir,
Lest on a Clown he make me doat-a,
I dare not touch his silken Coat-a.

Do it, if thou despise thy duty,
I'll make thee fetch a Box of Beauty,
From the bottom of black Hell,
As Pshyche did (as stories tell.)

Hold, (sweet Honey-Mother) hold,
I confess I've been too bold,
If I live but till to morrow,
(As Gods can't die) I'll send an Arrow
Into Adonis Marble breast,
Headed with a Hornets nest.

On this condition take thy ramble,
To make the wombs of ladies wamble,
But fail not as thou love my smile,
Now I'll take Coach for Cyprus I'll.

Come my Caniculo (sweet Cur)
In thy throat thou hast a bur
I fear, thy voice was wont to ring,
With redoubled echoing;
"Strange thing, when Dogs forget their tones,
"And Lechers leave their Marrowbones
"Unbroken, in this shady Wood,
(Where shaggy Satyrs use to scud)
I reign sole Monarch of content,
And ne'er think what my father spent,
To get and breed me; Pox a'wooing,
'Tis fulsome to be always doing;
My life is strict, and right Laconic,
That love is best that is Platonic:
To hunt the swift-foot Stag, follow
The furius Bear (...) whoop hollow
Is my best delight, -- So -- ho,
Follow me Caniculo.

Thanks Jove, see, where all alone is,
My Mothers misery Adonis,
But I'll mollify his mind,
"They are fools that think me blind;
Have at thee Adon.
Breech, thy preservation
Is signed and sealed; now must I go,
To wound a wanton I adies toc.

Ye Gods that govern Man and Mouse
The King, the Duke, the Lord, the lous
What an uncouth change is here,
I am in love up to the ear,

A wench that wants a nose, blinks,
Were she splay-footed gummy-ey'd,
With all deformities beside
That can be mentioned; all too long
I have done beauteous Venus wrong;
Great God of Love to thee I bow,
"Thou art a devilish Rogue I vow;
Fire, fire, I burn, I burn,
And shortly shall to cinders turn,
Unless some courteous female fall,
Beneath the Parent of all.

How now, my dear Adonis, what?
With thy self in busy chat?
When, when O when shall Venus find,
The flinty-soul'd Adonis kind.

Squeeze me like to Milky Curds,
Drain all my sappy bulk affords,
Let me dwell upon your
You shall find me cold and hot;
But must not fail in Retribution,
When you find my constitution.

Come then (my Paramour) let's sally,
To my Rosie Bower, and dally,
Till our kexey joints complain,
Then we will take breath again.

I must enjoy thee (upon any score)
Adonis, or else cease to be a Boar;
I that despise the Javelin the Spear,
Whose murthering Tusks the sternest Mortals fear,
Do stoop unto a stripling, had I thee
Within my power, thou sightless Deity
I'd crumble thee to atoms, devour
Thy laughing Mother in her flowery Bower.
Mast will not down, I loath my wonted Food,
The unseen flame does set on fire my blood,
Licks up my moisture, and so loud I ^runt,
My voice is heard hence to the Helespont.

Twas long (Alcides) ever thy back was right,
Having mounted fifty Virgins in one night.
Voracious Venus (void of ruth)
Has had no mercy on my youth.

Beauteous Adonis, hark; how long in vain,
Unto thy sealed up ear shall I complain,
Thy scorn will kill me; Nature cannot save
His life, whom Love shall lead unto the Grave.
O pity my perplexity, though rude
In form, my heart is full of gratitude;
My mind's as smooth as pibble, though my hide
Be rough, I have other gifts beside,
May sign my Patent for a Ladies clip,
Though I confess my hair will hurt her lip:
What ere this Wood affords shall call thee Lord,
So thou wilt deign but love for love t'afford.

(...) bri^led Monster, can thou hope
My love, I'll first embrace a Rope;
And on some fatal Yeugh resign^
My life, foul Monster, filthy Swine;
I will procure a Gay of Warwick,
Though I explore from hence to Barwick
(If thou desist not) that shall wear,
Thy head upon his charmed Spear.

Nay, then tis time to cast of al remors
For when intreatles fall, to practice force,
Is Orthodox Adonis, by the Gods,
And their celestial ever-blest abodes,
I must enjoy thee --

-- O I'm slain,
This bawdy Boar hath wrought my bane.

Out alas, what have I done?
He is dead as sure as Gun,
Fallen like some Poplar (in his pride)
Planted by a Rivers side,
Wounded by a Pelean Ax,
In Heaven now a Paralax.
O, O, ye infernal Juries,
Rhamnusia, ye Snake-hair'd Furies,
Ye Harpies, Hags and Gorgons fell,

Witness ye Powers above, that I
Was not murderous willingly,
I would have hugged him, but mistook,
And therefore (sure) may have my book
Where shall I bath this vexed body,
Tormented to a Hoddy-Doddy?
Within some gloomy Cave I'll pine,
And never drink, nor never dine,
Till I look like salt and piss,
And Hermes summon me to Dis.

-- with the Graces.

Here he was wont to go, and here
Tellus being proud to bear
So rich a burden, -- O my heart,
When with Adonis I did part:
Just such a sigh I fetched in sooth^la.
I hope Jove will protect the youth-la
from scathe; sad thoughts do clog my soul,
Which like to Neptunes waves do roll
And ride on one another backs,
My nether parts do melt like Wax,
or Butter in a Basting-ladle.
What do I see, -- do my eyes dazzle?
Or is Adonis drowned in gore?
O Fortune thou most damned whore,
What hast thou done? lift heaven hier
Good Gaffer Atlas, that my fire
Of rage may have full vent; no stone is
More cold then my (once dear) Adonis,
His Nerve that wont to heave stand
Stiff as a stake at my command,
Now droops and hangs the head, his wounds
Do yawn like chapt parched grounds.
What Monster more then fell with fang
Of ruin, would destroy so young,
So fair, so smooth, so deft a ^ad,
Of whom such comfort Venus had.
O I am wild with rage; thy bulk
(Dear boy) in a rich Urn shall skulk,
With rich perfums, whit-bred crumbs
Rich Odours, and Sabean Gums.
Take up the precious load my Graces
But ware he piss not in your faces;
For so (some say) d^ad people do,
This fatal Wilderness shall rue
Thy ruin Adon, Tempests shall,
Tear up the Oaks, the Elms, the small,
The great, the fruitful, and the barren,
With a Hors-pox and a Murren.
Lead on weep till ye are blind, the while
We seat Adonis on his Funeral Pile.
