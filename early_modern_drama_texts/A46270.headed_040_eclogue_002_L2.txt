GOod morrow fellow Filcher,
What, do we sink or swim?
Thou look so like a Pilcher?

Good morrow fellow Nim,
The Devil's in our destiny,
I cannot get a pluck.

No, surely if the Devil were in it
We should have better luck.

What Star is my director,
I am in such a state?

Nay, prethe brother Hector
Do not fall out with Fate;
For we are fortunes Minions,
And sight under her banner,
'Tis she is Queen of all the world.

A mischief light upon her.
No money is revealed yet,
I wonder where it lingers?

The Soldier hath concealed it,
'Tis fast in iron fingers;
From whence if we could get it
By fury or by fraud:
We had as good attempt to pick
The Pocket of a Baud,

Your roaring Cavalier
Who when he had the Chink,
Would bravely domineer
In diceing, drabs and drink:
Go ask him now for money
And he hath none at all,
Bur cries 'tis in my Compting-house
In Haberdashers-Hall.

Our sly Trappanning trade
Maintained with so much fury,
Is openly bewrayed
Both by the Judge and Jury;
For Lawyers have so many quirks,
And are such curious skanners,
That they grow cunninger then we,
And do trappan Trappanners.

Our dyceing Trade is down too,
For when we do begin
By drilling ways to draw
A younger Brother in
The Soldier falls upon us
And proves the best Projector.

Faith every Red-coat now can make
A puppy of a Hector.

Stay prethe who comes here,

A gaping Country Clown.

Look how the slave doth stare;

He's newly come to town.

He gazes in the air as if
The sky were full of Rockets;
Let's fleece him.

But how shall we get
His hands out of his pockets?

Let me alone for that: I lately bought a glass,
Wherein all several colours may
Be seen that ever was,
If held up thus with both hands.

A pretty new design,
This trick will fetch his fingers out;

And hey then in go mine.

Our Taunton den is a dungeon,
And ^aith cham glad cham here,
This vamous zitty of Lungeon
Is worth all Zomerzet-zhere:
In Wagons, in Carts, and in Coaches
Che never did yet see more horse,
The Wenches do zhine like Roches,
And as proud as my fathers vore horse.
Che never zinc che was able
To keep my vathers voulds,
Did ever see such a stable
As thick a thing called Powls:
A Mezle in a red Jacket
Had like to have knack me down,
Because che'd undertake it
Held all the beast in the Town
Ch'am come to see my Lord Major,
And thick as do hang the Thieves,
Ch've forgot what vine neames they are;
(A meazle on them) the zhreeves,
They say they wear Chains and Scarlets,
And vollow'd by many Guardiants,
Ch'ave lost the neams of the Varlets,
A mischief on them, the Sergeants.
And now chill walk-my stations
To every place in Town,
Che mean to buy new vashons,
Iche have above fifty pound;
Che took't away from father
When he was gon a vield:
Cham come away the rather
Because ch'ave got a wench with child.

The Rainbow never knew
Such Colours as are here,

Here's Purple, Green and Blew,

Zooks what have they got there.
Good morrow Master, what do ye call it,

Good morrow good man clot.

Nay vaith vine Gallant there you're out
My Name is honest Wat.

I'll show thee such a slight that
Thou ne'er saw honest Wat,
Neither by day nor night yet.

Yvaith ch'ud laugh at that.

Here take this glass into thy hand
And hold it to thy eyes,
Thou there wilt see more colours than
A Dyar can devise.

I cannot see a colour yet,

Thou dost not hold it high,

Che hav't, che have it, ch'av got it now,

I faith and so have I.

Here's black, and blew, and gray, and green,
And orange-tauny, white;
And now Ich ave lost all again.

In troth you're in the right,
Now prethe tell me honest Wat,
How dost thou like my glass

It is the vittest veat yvaith
That e're was brought to pass
And if that thou wilt spare it
Chill give thee money down.

I will have nothing for it
Chill give thee half a Crown.
Yvaith cham very willing.

You shall not do it now,
To give thee four zhilling,

'Tis more then you can do.

Farewell good Wat, thou shalt not pay,
Good morrow Gentlemen;

Chill get me gone for vear that they
Zhould get my glass again.

Quick let us share
For fear of apprehension.

Gusman could ne'er
Compare with this invention.

That rustic Clown
Hath brought a happy harvest.

Lay your Money down.

My purse is at your service
Crown for Crown.

Open the Purse,
Our Ship of Fortune sail's in it.

Oh heavy curse
It hath nothing but nails in it.

Ne'er men till now
Were gulled by such a Costard;

If we meet I vow
We'll bang the bacon bastard
black and blew.
Unlock that font
Let's enter by degrees in it.

A pox upon it,
There's nought but bread and cheese in it.

Come let's depart
And drink a Saxon Rumkin.

I am vexed at heart,
But if I spare the Bomkin,
Hang me for it.
Soldiers fight and Hectors rant on
Whilst poor Wenches go to rack,
Who would be a wicked wanton
Only for Suppers, Songs, and Sack,
To endure the alteration
Of these times that are so dead;
Thus to lead a long vacation
Without Money, Beer, or Bread.
Farewell Bloomsberry and Sodom,
Lukeners-lane and Turnbull-street,
Woe was me when first I trod 'em
With my wild unwary feet.
I was bred a Gentlewoman,
But our family did fall
When the Gentry's coin grew common,
And the Soldiers shared it all.
I was sure unto a Hector
Who hath basely broke his vow,
Would I had a good projector
That would well support me now.
Who comes here? what simple Thumkin,
Oh! I guess him by his coat,
This is sure some Country Bumpkin,
Now 'tis time to change my note.

I am good at either,
And I can do the the other thing
When we get together.
I have lately lost my dear,
'Twas a holy Brother;
If he do not meet me here
I faith I'll get another.
I can nimbly come above,
I can tumble under,
And If I do but like my Love,

What Vary's that is yonder?
'Tis a dainty dancing Girl,
Zhee would make me gladder,
Her vace doth zyne like mother of Pearl,
chould choose no more and chad her.

A Dutch-man loves his Pipe and Can,
A Jew doth like a Turk well,
But I could hug a Countrey-Man,
For he will do his work well.
Citizens are full of slight,
They will cog and flatter;
But a Countrey-man will do me right.

Che long now to be at her.
Good morrow Mistress Trip and go,

My Countrey-man I take it,
I love you Sir,

Chill love thee to,
And vayth i will veze thy Jacket.

What's thy name, come tell me that
Thou shalt be my Jewel?

Why zom vorzooth do call me Wat,
But my name is Water-Gruel.
Prethe say, and be not avrayd*
Art not thou a Peddler*

I live close by in Tickle Yard,
My name is Mary Medlar.

Then zweet Mol come buss thy Wat,
Let us twain be merry:

I could nimbly dance, but that
My Basket makes we weary.

Give it me, chill dance a Spring,
Che have no veaver Lurden?

If thou wilt dance, then I will sing,
And thou shalt bear the Burden.

A match, a match, it's well a vine,
We both shall make some ztuff on it.

Unless thy feet keep pace with mine
Thoul't quickly have enough on it.

Well don Moll,

'tis well done Wat,

Chill do it to a tittle,

But I have too much strained my throat,
I prethe sing a little,

Fa la la la liera lo
This is pretty prancing,
We will go to Tickle Yard
When we have done dancing.
Now che think ch'av vetcht it up
Zing a little Mary,
We will gulge a merry zup,
Zhuggar and Canary.
Thou dost dance and make no noise
Shall I turn and kiss thee?
Prethe let me hear thy voice.
Hoop where the Devil is she?
Zhe hath left me all alone
Here to mum and mask it,
But yvaith if zhe be gon
Ich chill keep her Basket.
Here's good vortune come to me
In a merry minuet,
Now chill puttne down and see
What zhee have gotten in it.
Oh! wo, wo, what shall you do,
Che con no know which way to go
With thick whore here and her vine zong,
Che have a bore her burden too long;
Che may curse the occasion that e're che came here,
Would che were again in Zomerzet-zhere.

Ch'ave a brungeon a daughter or a zon,
Thick a jewel hath me begu^l'd,
Water Gruel must now veed the child,
Ich chud never be zorry, but find it a place
If che had now but good store of Larzhant;
It looks Tory rory, and zmells so of Mace,
That a sure it was got by some zarzhant.
Goodman zhreeve ze, look on the vace
For a believe me it may be your own case,
Honest free men Ich cham basely begeld,
Good a woman hold but the cheld,
I will but step here hard by, 'tis but home to Taunden,
And chill bring ye zom gold in a Casket,
Thick all are hard hearted both women and men,
Che must march with my youth in a Basket,

We shall ne'er have lucky minuet,
None of our designs will hit;

Some ill Planet sure is in it,
Fortune makes a fool of wit:
All our feats
Are simple cheats,
And destiny will have it so.

There's nothing hits
But with those wits
That cheat Cum Privilegio.

The holy drum
And godly gun
Are now the only Engines that
Make Pimp and Whore
And Hector poor,
And wise men do they know not what.

All our joyful days do leave us,

Never were such times as these,

Every Bumpkin can deceive us

With hob-nails

and with bread and cheese.

Though we mist it
He confessed it
That he brought up fifty pound,

Where he did it
How he hid it
Is the plot that may be found.

If we meet him
We will fit him.

Hark I here one coming in
Very pleasant
'Tis the Peasant

Now let's to our guards again.

Now farawel Lungeon Iche may zing,
Chill no more here until the next spring,
I have put in security for the thing,
Which no body can deny.
Che did a veat in Zomerzet-Zhere
Which vorst me at first to see vashons here,
Ich cham out of the vrying pan into the vere,
Che either must burn or vrye.
In plush and in zatten a vynely wrought,
Ich i have laid out forty pound every groat,

I want a silk Waistcoat,

I lack a plush Coat,

Ch' have puttne all in the Trunk.
Here's zilk and gold, and zilver strings,


Stand

what are you

Lay down your things.
Why sure the Meazle is drunk.
What would ye do to a poor Country man,

First lay down your Trunk, you shall know more anon:

And a very vine way to have my Trunk gone:

Do so or I'll knock thee down.

Nay vaith good man Gentle since ch' have seen it man
Chill lay it down there, and if che can win it
Thou zhalt have my Trunk and all that is in it:
'Twill cost above forty pound.

I'll have as much blood as thy heart can afford.

Thou cowardly knave, wilt thou fight with* zword;
But since 'tis but one, Ich che care not a Twoord,
And what do you think of another.

This Rapier I thorough thy body will run,

Ud zooks there's no vighting with two again one,
Ich che rather will trust to my legs and be gon.

Why now gramercy brother.

The rascal already is run out of sight,

His hands are vile heavy.

His legs are (...) light,
The Plush for a Jacket, I claim as my right,

Which really I deny.
For was it not I that proved the Projector.

But if this good sword had not been your Protector,
The clown would have made you a pitiful Hector,
And beaten you.

Sir ye lye.
My force hath been tried against Castles and Towers*
The prize as it lies is equally ours,
Let victory make it out mine or yours,

I grant it with all my heart.

What mad men are these! pray what do you mean,
I never did see such a sorrowful scene;
Nay sweet Mr. Filcher

stand further ye Quean,
I'll make the proud Rascal smart.

You always were friends, what makes ye fall out?
Pray tell me true, what is the quarrel about?

This duel will suddenly end all the doubt:

I'll suffer between your swords.
E're such a kind couple of Hectors as ye
Shall squabble and quarrel for Paddington-tree.
Jack Filcher, Tom Nim, be counselled by me,
Deliver your Cause in words,
You know that the Law against Duels is high*

That Rodomont ado there gave me the lye,

Pray do but consider that Tyburn is nigh;

That very word cools my wrath.
For my own part I only would live by my Trade,

The Bargain betwixt us must end by the blade;

Pray let me but know the conditions ye made,
I'll judge it between ye both.

I'll tell you then how the quarrel did rise,
This fellow and I have took a rich prize,

And now he denies me my share in it.

he lies,
We agreed that the sword should decide it.
This Trunk is well furnished as e're it can hold,
With silk and with velvet, with silver and gold.

Turn't all into money, and when it is sold,
You equally may divide it.
But first what assurance have you when you win it,
'Tis worth all this danger

We yet have not see*

Why then let us open it and see what is in it,
That every thing may be shown.

A match, let her break the Trunk open and see

It may be by this means you'll sooner agree.

Faith open it or shut it 'tis all one to me,
I vow I'll have all or none.

Then look on your bargain, you both are beguiled,
Pray tell me if this be the velvet three piled,
Is this figured satin?

I vow 'tis a child.
You swore you'd have all or none.

I'll stand to my bargain, for I will have none.

What? can you so suddenly alter your tone.

Come kiss it and love it, for faith 'tis your own.
Remember when we were alone.
For this pretty Babe I have shed many showers,
And suffered a thousand disconsolate hours,
As sure as 'tis mine, I'm certain its yours,
I never knew Man but you.

These Projects to me are Riddles and Charms,
How came the child hither?

For fear of worse harms,
I left it even now in a Countreymans's arms,
A fellow that I never knew.
'Twas left to be lost though the plot would not hit*
I never could see you to tell you of it,
A Countrey-man brought it.

A pox of his wit,
I would I were rid of my life.

Before I knew Filcher, I was a pure Maid,
Pray do but Remember the Contract we made;
You said you would wed me, and live by your trade,

I'll presently make thee My Wife.

For all the worlds wealth I will ne'er be a whore.

I'll purchase new Credit upon an old score.

I'll deal in these damnable courses no more.

We every one will mend.

I never will quarrel, or swagger and roar,

Then make the poor Simpletons pay all the score.

I never will do as I have done before.

We every one will mend.

Ch' have overcome my voes,
And Watty now is free;
It is no zin to cousin those,
That would have cheated me:
Had che but met with one,
Che had not been o'remaster'd;
Ich che wonder what they thought upon,
when they did find the Bastard.
Did ever fellow vinde
Such zimple zots as these,
To leave my fifty pounds behind,
And steal my Bread and Cheese:
Theise zitty thieves are fooled,
That meant to do me hurt,
The Measels could not find my gold,
che knittne in my zhurt;
Ich che cannot choose but zmile,
That men who can talk latin,
Zhould be such fools to take a Child
For velvet, zilk, and zatten:
But Pride will have a val,
The Proverb zaith as much;
Now how do you my Measters all,
Ich cham com to laugh a touch.
God bless my Lady Zhreeve,
And all that noble pack;
Ch'am almost dead with grief,
Che want a cup a zack.
God zave my master too,
And zend him to live long;
Vayth now ch'a nothing else to do,
Chill zing a merry zong.
THe other day among many papers,
Che vown'd a vine zong of the Merchants and
Drapers.
The Grocers, the Goldsmiths, the Taylors and Skinners,
And many such vinical zinners.
The Mercer first a vine dapper blade is,
He zells ye zoft zattin, and very well paid is;
He makes his Commodity cover the Ladies,
So zoft and zweet his Trade is.
The Grocer lays his zhuggered baits,
He loves to have his zhip zail in the Straits;
He deals for sweet Almonds, Prunello's, and Dates,
With Ladies as light as his weights.
The Drapers next in my fancy doth hover.
It is the best Trade betwixt Barwick and Dover;
But when his zhort Yard the women discover,
They will have a handful over.
And now have at the Fishmongers jacket*
It proves a good trade as the Taverns do make it:
But of all the vish in the zea i will undertake it,
He'd rather have a virgin naked.
The Goldsmiths stall will make me to stop,
For Goldsmiths-Hall hath been a great prop;
Of all the rich mysteries this is the top,
The Tower was a Goldsmith's zhop.
The Merchant-Taylors may not be outed,
His Calling hath been e're zinc Adam was routed:
A zuit makes a Gallants wealth not to be doubted,
That is but a Beggar without it.
The Skinners hate Ich che must not incur,
He covers the Corps of your Worshipful Sir,
And cleaves to your Aldermans back like a bur,
Whose lineing is Voxes vur.
Your Haberdashers Art che may call,
The only fine trade that doth cover us all;
But woe to the Cavalier that did val
Into Haberdashers-Hall.
The Zalters trade we shall not omit,
The Scholars say Zalt is an Emblem of Wit;
But vaith I believe they love a vresh bit,
When Mutton and Capers meet.
The fame of Iron-mongers do ring,
The strength of the Mettle can conquer a King;
The Helmet, Musket, and Gauntlet can bring
A Sceptre out of a Sling.
The Vintner's Art but view men do know,
For it is a zience too zuttle to zhow;
The Devil and he a Conjuring go,
When both are a brewing below.
The Cloth-workers trade is a very vine thing,
And of all the Trades may be counted the King;
But yet he will merrily tipple and zing,
'Till his wits go a Wool-gathering.
And now I^ che hope no Tradesman will take
Exzeptions at me for my merriment sake;
Their Trades are all good, but the Vintner's the bonniest,
God bless them and make them all honest.
Ic che now will go home to Zomerzetzheere,
And tell all the (...) what vine things are here;
I will jog to my (...) and see what God hath zent her,
And i will come here again next Winter.
