THE GOBLINS A Comedy. Presented at the Private House in Black-Fryers, by His
Majesties servants.

WRITTEN By Sir JOHN SUCKLING.

LONDON, Printed for Humphrey Moseley, and are to be sold at his shop, at the
Sign of the Princes Arms in St Paul's Churchyard. MDCXLVI.

WIt in a Prologue, Poets justly may
Stile a new imposition on a Play.
When Shakespeare, Beamont, Fletcher ruled the Stage,
There scarce were ten good palates in the age,
More curious Cooks then guests; for men would eat
Most heartily of any kind of meat,
And then what strange variety each Play,
A Feast for Epicures, and that each day.
But mark how oddly it is come about,
And how unluckily it now falls out:
The palates are grown, higher number increas't,
And there wants that which should make up the Feast;
And yet you're so unconscionable. You'd have
Forsooth of late, that which they never gave,
Banquets before; and after. --
Now pox on him that first good Prologue writ,
He left a kind of rent charge upon wit;
Which if succeeding Poets fail to pay,
They forfeit all their worth, and that's their play:
Y' have Ladies humours, and you're grown to that,
You will not like the man less that his boots and hat
Be right; no play, unless the Prologue be,
And Epilogue writ to curiosity.
Well (Gentiles)'^is the grievance of the place,
And pray consider't, for here's just the case;
The richness of the ground is gone and spent,
Men's brains grow barren, and you raise the Rent.
BUt my Lords,
May not this harsh business
Yet be left undone!
Must you hate me because I love your sister;
And can you hate at no less rate then death?

No, at no less:
Thou art the blaster of our fortunes,
The envious cloud that darknest all our day,
While she thus prodigally, and fondly
Throws away her love on thee;
She has not wherewithal to pay a debt
Unto the Prince. --

Is this all?

Faith, what if in short we do not think
You worthy of her? --

I swear that shall not make a quarrel.
I think so too;
'Have urged it often to my self;
Against my self have sworn't as oft to her,
Pray let this satisfy. --

Sure
Look you Sir; --
And brother since his friend has failed him,
Do you retire.

Excuse me
I have an equal interest in this,
And fortune shall decide it. --

It will not need, he's come. --

Mercury protect me! what are these?
The brothers of the high way!

A stranger by his habit. --

And by his looks a Gentleman.
Sir, -- will you make one!
We want a fourth. --

I shall be robbed with a trick now!

My Lords excuse me!

This is not civil.
In what concerns my self,
None but my self must suffer. --

A duel by this light, --
Now has his modesty,
And t'others forwardness warmed me* --
Gentlemen, I wear a sword,
And commonly in readiness,
If you want one, speak Sir. --
I do not fear much suffering.

You're noble Sir,
I know not how t'invite you to it;
Yet, there is Justice on my side,
And since you please to be a witness
To our actions, 'tis fit you know our Story. --

No Story Sir I beseech you, --
The cause is good enough as 'tis,
It may be spoiled in the telling.

Come we trifle then. --

It is impossible to preserve I see
My honour and respect to her.
And since you know this too my Lord,
It is not handsome in you thus to press me,
But come. --
Torcular beckons to Orsabrin. --
Oh! I understand you Sir. --

In posture still. --
Oh, you're mortal then it seems. --

Thou hast undone thy self rash man,
For with this blood thou hast let out a spirit
Will vex thee to thy grave. --

I'm cool again,
Here my Lord. --
And let this Present bind your friendship. --

Yes thus. --

Treacherous, and low. --

I have dril'd my gentleman,
I have made as many holes in him
As would sink a Ship Royal
In sight of the Haven: --
How now? --
S'foot yonder's another going that way too. --
Now have I forgot of which side I'm on,
No matter.
I'll help the weakest;
There's some Justice in that.

The Villain sure has slain my brother.
If I have any friends above,
Guide now my hand unto his heart. --

Hold noble youth!
Destroy me not with kindness:
Men will say he could have killed me,
And that injustice should not be*
For honours sake, leave us together. --

'Tis not my business fighting --
Th'employment's yours Sir:
If you need me,
I am within your call.

The gods reward thee: --
Now Philatell thy worst. --

Hell and the Furies are broke loose upon us,
Shift for your self Sir. --

It will not be, --
My body is a Jade:
I feel it tire, and languish under me.
Those thoughts came to my soul
Like Screech-owles to a sick mans window. --

Here -- here --

Oh! I am fetched away alive.-

Now the good gods preserve my senses right,
For they were never in more danger:
'Ith name of doubt, what could this be?
Sure 'twas a Conjurer I dealt withal:
And while I thought him busy at his prayers,
'Twas at his circle, levying this Regiment.
Here they are again. --

Friend -- Stranger -- Noble youth --

Here -- here --

Shift, shift the place,
The wood is dangerous,
As you love safety,
Follow me. --

The have left the place,
And yet I cannot find the body any where --
May be he did not kill him then,
But he recovered strength,
And reached the Town --
-- It may be not too. --
Oh that this hour could be called back again.
-- But 'tis too late,
And time must cure the wound that's given by fate. --

In the shape of Lions too sometimes,
And Bears? --

Often Sir. --

Pray unriddle. --

The wiser sort do think them Thieves,
Which but assume these forms to rob
More powerfully. --

Why does not then the State
Set out some forces and suppress them?

It often has (Sir) but without success. --

How so? --

During the time those levies are abroad,
Not one of them appears,
There have been
That have attempted under ground;
But of those as of the dead
There has been no return. --

Strange.

The common people think them a race
Of honest and familiar Devils,
For they do hurt to none,
Unless resisted;
They seldom take away but with exchange;
And to the poor they often give,
Return the hurt, and sick recovered
Reward, or punish, as they do find cause. --

How cause? --

Why Sir, they blind still those they take,
And make them tell the stories of their lives,
Which known, they do accordingly. --

You make me wonder! Sir, --
How long is't since they thus have troubled you?

It was immediately upon
The great deciding day, fought
'Twixt the two pretending families,
The Samorats, and the Orsabrins.

Ha! Orsabrin?

But Sir, that storie's sad, and tedious,
We're entering now the Town,
A place less safe then were the Woods,
Since Torcular is slain. --

How S r? --

Yes. --
He was the Brother to the Princes Mistress,
The loved one too.
If we do prize our selves at any rate,
We must embarque, and change the clime,
There is no safety here. --

Hum. --

The little stay we make, must be
In some dark corner of the Town:
From whence, the day hurried to the other world,
Wee'le sally out to order for our journey.
That I am forced to this, it grieves me not;
But (gentle youth) that you should for my sake. --

Sir, loose not a thought on that
A storm at Sea threw me on Land,
And now a Storm on Land drives me
To Sea again. --

Still noble, --

Why; suppose 'tis to a Wench,
You would not go with me, would you? --

To choose, -- to choose, --

Then there's no remedy. --

What doest mean? --

Why? since I cannot leave you alive,
I will try to leave you dead.

I thank you kindly Sir, very kindly.
Now the Sedgly curse upon thee,
And the great Fiend, ^ide through thee
Booted and Spurred, with a Since on his neck;
Pox on thee, I'll see thee hanged first;
S'foot, you shall make none of your fine
Points of honour, up at my charge:
Take your course if you be so hot.
Be doing, -- be doing, --

I am got free of him at last:
There was no other way;
He has been as troublesome as a woman that
Would be loved whether a man would or not:
And he has watched me as if he had been
My Creditors Sergeant. If they should have dispatcht
In the mean time, there would be fine
Opinions of me. -- I must cut his throat
In earnest, if it should be so. --

A prize -- A prize -- A prize --

Some duel (Sir) was fought this morning, this
Weakened with loss of blood, we took, the rest
Escaped. --

He's fitter for our Surgeon, then for us,
Hereafter wee'le examine him --

A prize -- A prize -- A prize -- (They set them down)

Bring them, bring them, bring them in,
See if they have mortal Sin,
Pinch them, as you dance about,
Pinch them till the truth come out. --

What art?

Extremely poor, and miserable.

'Tis well, 'tis well, proceed,
No body will take that away from thee,
Fear not, -- what Country? --

-- Francelia --

Thy name? --

Ardelan. --

And thine, --

Piramant. --

Thy story, -- come --

What story! --

Thy life, thy life. -- (Pinch him)

Hold* hold, --
You shall have it; -- (he sighs)
It was upon the great defeat
Given by the Samorats unto the Orsabrins,
That the old Prince for safety of the young,
Commit^ed him unto the trust of Garradan,
And some few servants more,
Amongst whom I filled a place. --

Ha! Garradan!

Yes.

Speak out, and set me nearer;
So; void the place, proceed. --

We put to Sea, but had scarce lost the sight
Of Land, ere we were made a prey
To Pirates, there Garradan
Resisting the first Board, changed life with death;
With him the servants too, --
All but my self and Piramant.
Under these Pirats ever since
Was Orsabrin brought up,
And into several Countries did they carry him.

Knew Orsabrin himself? --

Oh! no, his spirit was too great;
We durst not tell him any thing,
But waited for some accident
Might throw us on Francelia,
*Bout which we hovered often,
And we were near it now,
But Heaven decreed it otherwise: -- (he sighs)

Why dost thou sigh? --

Why do I sigh? (indeed,)
For tears cannot recall him;
Last night about the second watch, the
Winds broke loose,
And vexed our Ships so long,
That it began to reel and totter,
And like a drunken man,
Took in so fast his liquor,
That it sunk down in the place. --

How did you escape? --

I bound my self unto a mast,
And did advise my Master to do so,
For which he struck me only,
And said I did consult too much with fear. --

'Tis a sad story. -- (within there)
Let them have Wine and
Fire, -- but hark you, --

A Prize. -- A prize, -- A prize. --

Set him down, --

-- Sings. --
-- And for the blew, --
Give him a Cup of Sack 'twill mend his hew. --

Drunk as I live. --
What art? --

I am a Poet,
A poor dabler in Rime. --

Come confess, confess;

I do confess, I do want money.

By the description he's a Poet indeed.
Well proceed. --

What do you mean? --
Pox on you.
Prithee let me alone,
Some Candles here, --
And fill us the other Quart, and fill us
Rogue, Drawer, the the other Quart,
Some small Beer. --
And for the blew,
Give him a Cup of Sack 'twill mend his hew. --

Set him by till he's sober,
Come lett's go see our Duellist
Dressed. --

He's something tall, and for his Chin,
It has no bush below:
Marry a little wool, as much as an unripe
Peach doth wear;
Just enough to speak him drawing towards a man. --

Is he of fury?
Will he foin,
And give the mortal touch?

Oh no!
He seldom wears his Sword.

Topo is the word if he do,
Thy debt, my little Mirmidon.

A yard and a half I assure you without abatement.

'Tis well, 'tis wondrous well:
Is he retired into this house of pleasure?

One of these he's entered;
'Tis but a little waiting,
You shall find me at the next Tavern. --

Stand close, I here one coming.

This house is sure no S^minary for Lucreces,
Then the Matron was so over diligent,
And when I asked for meat or drink,
She looked as if I had mistook my self,
And called for a wrong thing,
Well ^ 'tis but a night, and part of it I'll spend
In seeing of this Town,
So famous in our Tales at Sea. --

Look* look, muffled, and as melancholy after't
As a Gamester upon loss; upon him, upon him,

How now my friends,
Why do you use me thus?

Quietly; 'twill be your best way

Best way? for what?

Why, 'tis your best way,
Because there will be no other,
Topo is the word,
And you must along. --

Is that the word?
Why then, this is my Sword --

Murder, murder, murder;
He has killed the Princes Officer,
Murder -- Murder -- Murder. --

I must not stay,
I hear them swarm. --

Where is he, where is he?

Here, -- here -- oh a Manmender,
A Manmender,
Has broached me in so many places,
All the Liquor in my body will run out.

In good sooth (neighbour) has tapped you at the
Wrong end too;
He has been busy with you here behind;
As one would say, lend a hand, some of you,
And the rest follow me. --

Still pursued!
Which way now?
I see no passage;
I must attempt this wall, --
Oh -- a lucky door.
And open. --

Where am I now?
A garden, and a handsome house,
If it be thy will a Porch too't,
And I'm made;
'Twill be the better lodging of the two. --
Oh! welcome, welcome Sir,
My Lady hath been in such frights for you.

Hum! for me? --

And thought you would not come to night:

Troth, I might very well have failed her:

She's in the Gallery alone in the dark.

Good, very good.

And is so melancholy, --

Hum. --

Have you shut the Garden doors?
Come I'll bring you to her, enter, enter. --

Yes, I will enter:
He who has lost himself makes no great venture. --

OH welcome, welcome, as open air to prisoners,
I have had such fears for you.

She's warm, and soft as lovers language:
She spoke too, prettily;
Now have I forgot all the danger I was in. --

What have you done to day (my better part)

Kind little Rogue!
I could say the finest things to her me thinks,
But then she would discover me,
The best way will be to fall too quietly. --

How now my Samorat,
What saucy heat hath stolen into thy blood,
And heightened thee to this?
I fear you are not well. --

S'foot! 'tis a Platonic:
Now cannot I so much as talk that way neither.

Why are you silent, Sir?
Come I know you have been in the field to day.

How does she know that? --

If you have killed my brother, speak:
It is no new thing that true Love
Should be unfortunate:

'Twas her brother I killed then,
Would I were with my Devils again:
I got well of them,
That will be here impossible. --

Oh! Madam, Madam,
You're undone;
The garden walls are scaled,
A flood of people are entering th'house.

Good -- why here's variety of ruin yet. --

'Tis so,
The Feet of Justice
Like to those of time,
Move quick,
And will destroy I fear as sure:
Oh Sir, what will you do,
There is no venturing forrh,
My Closet is the safest,
Enter there,
While I go down and meet their fu^ie
Hinder the search if possible. --

Her Closet,
Yea where's that?
And, if I could find it,
What should I do there?
She will return, --
I will venture out. --

The lightest aires; 'twill make them
More secure, --
Upon my life hee'le visit her to night. --

Nor she, nor any lesser light
Appears, --
The calm and silence about the place,
Perswardes me she does sleep.

It may be not, but hold,
It is enough, -- let us retire
Behind this Pillar, Phontrell, is thy place,
As thou did love thy Master show thy care,
You to the other Gate,
There's thy Ladder. --

Come forth my Samorat, come forth,
Our fears were false,
It was the Prince with Music,
Samorat, Samorat.,
He sleeps, -- Samorat,
Or else he's gon to find me out
In the Gallery, Samorat, Samorat, it must be so. --

This house is full of Thresholds,
And Trap-doores,
I have been in the Cellar,
Where the Maids lie too,
I laid my hand groping for my way
Upon one of them,
And she began to squeak,
Would I were at Sea again in the storm,
Oh! a door:
Though the Devil were the Porter,
And kept the Gate, I'd out. --

Ha! guarded? taken in a trap?
Nay, I will out,
And there's no other
But this. --

Philatell in ambush on my life-

Where should he be?
Ha! --
Good Heavens what spectacle is this? my Samorat!
Some apparition sure, --

My noble friend,
What angry, and malicious Planet.
Governed at this point of time! --

(My wonder does grow higher)

That which governs ever:
I seldom knew it better.

It does amaze me Sir, to find you here.
How entered you this place?

Forced by unruly men it'h street.

Now the mistake is plain.

Are you not hurt?

No, -- but you bleed?

I do indeed,
But 'tis not here,
This is a scratch,
It is within to see this beauty;
For by all circumstance, it was her brother,
Whom my unlucky Sword found out to day.

Oh! my too cruel fancy. --

It was indeed thy Sword,
But not thy fault,
I am the cause of all these ills.
Why do you weep Sabrina! --

Unkind unto thy self, and me,
The tempest, this sad news has raised within me
I would have laid with Shears,
But thou disturb'st me,
Oh! Samorat.
Had thou consulted but with love as much
As honour, this had never been.

I have no love for thee that has not had
So strict an union with honour still,
That in all things they were concerned alike,
And if there could be a division made,
It would be found
Honour had here the leaner share:
'Twas love that told me 'twas unfit
That you should love a Coward.

These handsome words are now
As if one bound up wounds with silk,
Or with fine knots,
Which do not help the cure,
Or make it heal the sooner:
Oh! Samorat this accident
Lies on our love,
Like to some foul disease,
Which though it kill it not,
Yet will it destroy the beauty;
Disfigur't so,
That't will look ugly to the world hereafter. --

Must then the Acts of Fate be crimes of men?
And shall a death he pulled upon himself,
Be laid on others?
Remember Sweet, how often
You have said it in the face of Heaven,
That 'twas no love,
Which length of time, or cruelty of chance,
Could lessen, or remove,
Oh kill me not that way Sabrina,
This is the nobler;
Take it, and give it entrance any where --
But here,
For you so fill that plaee,
That you must wound your self. --

Am I so slight a thing?
So bankerupt?
So unanswerable in this world?
That being principally in the debt,
Another must be called upon,
And I not once looked after?
Madam why do you throw away your Tears]
On one that's irrecoverable?

Why? therefore Sir,
Because he's irrecoverable.

But why on him?
He did not make him so.

I do confess my anger is unjust,
But not my sorrow Sir,
Forgive these tear^ my Samorat,
The debts of nature must be paid,
Though from the stock of love:
Should they not Sir?

Yes. --
But thus the precious minutes pass,
And time, e're I have breathed the sighs,
Due to our parting,
Will be calling for me.

Parting? --

Oh yes Sabrina, I must part,
As day does from the world,
Not to return till night be gone,
Till this dark Cloud be over,
Here to be found,
Were foolishly to make a present
Of my life unto mine enemy,
Retire into thy Chamber fair,
There thou shalt know all. --

I know too much already. --

Hold rope for me, and then hold rope for him.
Why, this is the wisdom of the Law now,
A Prince looses a subject, and does not
Think himself paid for the loss^,
Till he looses another:
Well I will do my endeavour
To make him a saver;
^or this was Samorat.. --
Let it bleed on, -- you shall not stir
I swear. --

Now by the friendship that I owe thee,
And the Gods beside, I will
Noble youth, were there no danger in thy wound,
Yet would the loss of blood make thee
Unfit for travel,
My servants wait me for direction,
With them my Surgeon, I'll bring him instantly,
Pray go back. --

There. --
You to the other Gate,
The rest follow me. --

Hark a noise Sir.
This tread's too loud to be my Samorats.

(Which way? -- which way) --
Some villainy in hand,
Step in here Sir, quick, quick. --

Look every where. --
Protect thy brothers murderer?
Tell me where thou hast hid him,
Or by my fathers ashes I will search
In every vein thou hast about thee, for him. --

Ere such a villainy should be
The Gods would lend unto a single arm
Such strength, it should have power to punish
An Army, such as thou art. --

Oh! are you here Sir? --

Yes I am here Sir. --

Kill her. --

Oh! save thy self fair excellence,
And leave me to my Fate. --
Base* --

So bring him one,
The other is not far, --

To the Garden walls,
And meet my Samorat,
Tell him, oh tell him any thing,
Charge him by all our loves
He instantly take Horse,
And put to Sea,
There is more safety in a storm,
Then where my brother is. --
A Prize -- A prize, A prize,

Bring him forth, bring him forth;
Welcome w^come, mortal wight,
To the ^ansion of the night:
Good or bad, thy life discover
Truly all thy deeds declare;
For about thee Spirits hover
That can tell, tell what they are.
-- Pinch him, if he speak not true,
-- Pinch him, pinch him black and blew,

What art thou?

I was a man.

Of whence? --

^he Court. --

Whether now bound?

To my own house.

Thy name?

Stramador.

Oh you fill a place about his Grace,
And keep out men of parts, do you not?

Yes. --

A foolish Utensill of State,
Which like old Plate upon a Gaudy day,
'Sbrought forth to make a show, and that is all;
For of no use you're, you'd best deny this:

Oh no! --

Or that you do want wit,
And then talk loud to make that pass for it?
You think there is no wisdom but in form;
Nor any knowledge like to that of whispers: --

Right, right.

Then you can hate, and fawn upon a man
At the same time,
And dare not urge the vices of another,
You are so foul your self;
So the Prince seldom hears truth.

Oh! very seldom.

And did you never give his Grace odd Councels.
And when you saw they did not prosper,
Persuade him take them on himself. --

Yes, yes, often. --

Get baths of Sulphur quick,
And flaming oils,
This crime is new, and will deserve it.
He has inverted all the rule of State;
Confoun^ed policy,
There is some rea^on why a Subject
should suffer for the e^rours of his Prince;
But why a Prince should ^ear^
The faults of's Ministers, none, none at
All. -- Cauldrons of Brimstone there.

Great Judge of this infe^nall p^ace
Allow him yet the mercy of the Cou^t.

Kind Devil. --

Let him be boiled in scalding lead a while
T'enure, and to prepare him for the other.

Oh! hear me, hear me,

Stay!
Now I have better thought upon it,
He shall to earth again:
For villainy is catching, and will spread:
He will enlarge our Empire much,
Then we're sure of him at any time,
So 'tis enough -- where's our Governor? --

His hair curls naturally,
A handsome youth. --

The same, --
Is there no speaking with him?
He owes me a trifling sum. --

Sure Sir the debt is something desperate,
There is no hopes he will be brought
To clear with the world,
He struck me but for persuading him
To make even with Heaven,
He is as surly as an old Lion,
And as sullen as a Bullfinch,
He never eat since he was taken. --

I must needs speak with him,
Hark in the ear. --

Not for all the world.

Nay I do but motion such a thing,

Is this the business Gentlemen?
Fare you well. --

There is no choice of ways then. --
Stir not, if thou but think a noise,
Or breath aloud, thou breath'^t thy last.
So bind him now. --
Undo,
Quickly, quickly,
His Jerkin, his Hat.

What will you do?
None of these Beards will serve,
There's not an eye of white in them.

Pull out the Silvered ones in his
And stick them in the other.

Cut them, cut them out,
The bush will suit well enough
With a grace still.

Desperate wounds must have desperate
Cures, extremes must thus be served, --
You know your parts,
Fear not, let us alone. --
Sings a Catch.
Some drink, -- what Boy, -- some drink --
Fill it up, fill it up to the brink,
When the Pots cry clink,
And the Pockets chink,
Then 'tis a merry world.
To the best, to the best, have at her,
And a Pox take the Woman-hater. --
The Prince of darkness is a Gentleman,
Mahu, Mohu is his name,
How do you Sir?
You gape as you were sleepy,
Good faith he looks like an --

Or as if he had overstrained himself
At a deep note in a Ballad. --

What think you of an Oyster at a low ebb?
Some liquor for him;
You will not be a Pimp for life you Rogue,
Nor hold a door to save a Gentleman,
You are -- Pox on him, what is he Pellagrin?
If you love me, let's stifle him,
And say 'twas a sudden judgement upon him
For swearing; the posture will confirm it.

We're in excellent humour,
Let's have another bottle,
And give out that Anne my wife is dead,
Shall I Gentlemen? --

Rare Rogue in Buckram,
Let me bite thee,
Before me thou shalt go out wit,
And upon as good terms,
As some of those in the Ballad too. --

Shall I so? -- Why then foutree for the Guise,
Saines shall accrue, and ours shall be,
The black eyed beauties of the time,
I'll tic you for old ends of Plays: --
They sing, --
A Round, -- A Round, -- A Round, --
A Round, -- A Round, -- A Round --
Some bodie's at door.
Preethee, preethee, Sir, Sir,
Try thy skill.

Who's there.

One Sturgelot a Jailer here? --

Such a on there was my friend,
But he's gone above an hour ago:
Now did this Rogue whisper in his heart
That's a lie, -- and for that very reason,
I'll cut his throat. --

No prithee now, -- for thinking?
Thou shalt not take the pains,
The Law shall do it --

How, -- how? --

Marry wee'le write it over when wee're gone,
He joined in the plot, and put himself
Into this posture, merely to disguise it to
The world. --

Excellent,
Here's to thee for that conceit,
We should have made rare Statesmen,
We are so witty in our mischief.
Another song, and so let's go,
It will be time.
-- Sing. --
A health to the Nut browne Lass,
With the hazell eyes let it pass.
She that has good eyes
Has good thighs,
Let it pass, -- let it pass. --
A much to the lively Grey,
'Tis as good it'h night as the day,
She that has good eyes,
Has good thighs,
Drink away, -- drink away. --
I pledge, I pledge, what ho some Wine,
Here's to thine, and to thine,
The colours are Divine. --
But oh the black, the black
Give me as much again, and let it be Sack:
She that has good Eyes,
Has good Thighs,
And it may be a better knack. --

A reckoning Boy. --
There. --
Dost hear
Here's a friend of ours 'has forgotten himself
A little (as they call it)
The Wine has got into his head,
As the frost into a hand, he is benumbed,
And has no use of himself for the present.

Hum Sir. --

Prithee lock the door, and when he
Comes to himself,
Tell him he shall find us at the old place,
He knows where.

I will Sir. --

To di^! yea what's that?
For yet I never thought on it seriously;
It may be 'tis. -- hum. --
It may be 'tis not too. --
Ha. -- (as amazed.)
What happy intercession wrought this change?
To whose kind prayers owe I this my friend?

Unto thy virtue -- Noble youth
The Gods delight in that as well as prayers.
I am --

Nay, nay, --
Be what thou wilt,
I will not question't:
Undo, undo.

Thy friend Samorat.

Ha?

Lay by thy wonder,
And put on these clothes,
In this disguise thou'lt pass unto the
Prison-gates, there you shall find
One that is taught to know you;
He will conduct you to the corner
Of the wood, and there my horses wait
Us. --
I'll throw this Jailer off in some odd place,

My better Angel. --

It is 'een as hard a world for Thieves
As honest men, -- nothing to be got --
No prize stirring. --

None, but one with horses,
Who seemed to stay for some
That were to come,
And that has made us wait thus long.

A lean days work, but what remedy?
Lawyers, that rob men with their own consent,
Have had the same:
Come, call in our Perdues,
We will away. --

I hear them now,
Yonder they are. --

Hallow, who are these?
Any of ours?

No, stand close,
They shall be presently,
Yield -- yield. --

Again betrayed? there is no end of my misfortune,
Mischief vexes me
Like a quotidian,
It intermits a little, and returns
E're I have lost the memory of
My former fit. --

Sentences, sentences,
A way with him -- A way with him. --

I am the Jailer, undone, undone,
Conspiracy, a cheat, my prisoner, my prisoner. --

No men? -- nor horses? --
Some strange mistake, --
May it be, the are sheltered in the wood. --

And if a Lady did but step aside,
To fetch a Masque or so,
You follow'd after still,
As if she had gone proud?
Ha; is't not so? --

Yes. --

And if you were used but civillie in a place,
You gave out doubtful words upon it,
To make men think you did enjoy.

Oh! yes, yes.

Made love to every piece of cried-up beauty*
And swore the same things over to them.

The very same. --

Abominable.
Had he but sworn new things, yet't had been
Tolerable. --
Reads the sum of the Confession*

Let me see* -- let me see.
Hum.
Court Ladies Eight,
Of which two great ones. --
Country Ladies twelve.
Tearmers all. --

Is this right?

Very right.

Citizens wives of several trades,
He cannot count them. --
Chamber maids, and Country wenches,
About thirty: --
Of which the greater part,
The night before th'were married,
Or else upon the day:

A modest reckoning, is this all? --

No. --
I will be just t'a scruple.

Well said, -- well said, --
Out with it. --

Put down two old Ladies more.

In the name of wonder,
How could he think of old,
In such variety of young?

Alas I could never be quiet for them.

Poor Gentleman.
Well what's to be done with him now?
Shall he be thrown into the Cauldron
With the Cuckolds,
Or with the Jealous?
That's the hotter place.

Thou mistake^'t,
'Tis the same, they go together still:
Jealous and Cuckolds differ no otherwise
Then Sheriff and Alderman;
A little time makes th'one the other.
What think you of Gelding him,
And sending him to earth again,
Amongst his women?
'Twood be like throwing a dead fly
Into an Ants nest.
There would be such tearing, pulling,
And getting up upon him,
They would worry the poor thing
To death, --

Excellent,
Or leave a string as they do sometimes
In young Colts:
Desire and impotence,
Would be a rare punishment.
Fie, fie, the common disease of age,
A very old man has it.
A prize, -- A prize, -- A prize,

This must be Hell by the noise

Set him down, set him down;
Bring forth the newest wrack,
And flaming pinching Irons,
This is a stubborn piece of flesh,
'Twould have broke loose.

So, this comes of wishing my self
With Devils again. --

What art? --

The slave of Chance,
One of Fortunes fools;
A thing she kept alive on earth
To make her sport,

Thy name?

Orsabrin.

Ha! he that lived with Pirats?
Was lately in a storm?

The very same. --

Such respect as you have paid to me, --
Prepare to Revels, all that can be thought on:
But let each man still keep his shape. --
They unbind him, all bow to him,

Ha!
Another false smile of Fortune? --
Is this the place the gowned Clerks
Do fright men so on earth with?
Would I had been here before.
Master Devil;
To whose use are these set out?

To yours Sir.

I'll make bold to change a little --
Could you not affoord a good plain Sword
To all this gallantry? --

Wee'le see Sir.

A thousand times civiller then men,
And better natured.

All leave the room.
I like not this. --

Cupid do thou the rest,
A blunter arrow, and but slackly drawn,
Would perfect what's begun,
When young and handsome meet,
-- The work's half done. --

She cannot be less then a goddess;
And 't must be Proserpine:
I'll speak to her, though Pluto's self stood by,
Thou beauteous Queen of this dark world,
That make a place so like a hell,
So like a Heaven, instruct me
In what form I must approach thee,
And how adore thee? --

Tell me what thou art first:
For such a creature
Mine eyes did never yet behold. --

I am that which they name above a man:
In the watery Elements I much have lived,
And there they term me Orsabrin.
Have you a name too? --

Why do you ask?

Because I'd call upon it in a storm,
And save a Ship from perishing sometimes.

'Tis Reginella.

Are you a woman too?
I never was in earnest until now.

I know not what I am,
For like my self I never yet saw any.

Nor ever shall.
Oh! how came you hither?
Sure you were betrayed.
Will you leave this place,
And live with such as I am?

Why may not you live here with me?

Yes. --
But I'd carry thee where there is a glorious light,
Where all above is spread a Canopy,
Studded with twinkling Gems,
Beauteous as Lovers eyes;
And underneath Carpets of ^lowry Meads
To tread on. --
A thousand thousand pleasures
Which this place can ne'er affoord thee. --

Indeed!

Yes indeed --
I'll bring thee unto shady walks,
And Groves fringed with Silver purling streams,
Where thou shalt hear soft feathered Queristers
Sing sweetly to thee of their own accord.
I'll fill thy lap with early flowers;
And whilst thou bind'st them up mysterious ways,
I'll tell thee pretty tales, and sigh by thee:
Thus press thy hand and warm it thus with kisses*

Will you indeed? --

Fond Girl:
Her rashness sullies the glory of her beauty,
'Twil make the conquest cheap,
And weaken my designs,
Go part them instantly.
And bind him as before;
Be you his keeper Peridore.

Yes, I will keep him.

Her eyes like lightning shoot into my heart
They will melt it into nothing,
Eere I can present it to her,
Sweet Excellence. --

Ha! why is this hateful curtain drawn before my eyes?
If I have sinned, give me some other punishment;
Let me but look on her still,
And double it, oh* whether, whether do you hurry me?
Madam* you must in. --

Ay me, what's this? --
Must! --

We have had such sport;
Yonder's the rarest Poet without,
Has made all his confession in blank verse:
Not left a God, nor a Goddess in Heaven,
But fetched t^em all down for witnesses;
Has made such a description of Styx,
And the Ferry,
And verily thinks has past them.
Enquires for the blessed shades,
And asks much after certain British blades,
One Shakespeare and Fletcher:
And grew so peremptory at last,
He would be carried where they were.

And what did you with him?

Mounting him upon a Cowle-staffe,
Which (tossing him something high)
He apprehended to be P^gasus.
So we have left him to tell strange lies,
Which hee'le turn into verse;
And some wise people hereafter into Religion.

GGod faith 'tis wondrous well,
We have ee'n done like eager disputers;
And with much ado
Are got to be just where we were.
This is the corner of the wood.

Ha! 'tis indeed. --

Had we no walking ^ire,
Nor saucer*eyed Devil of these woods that led us?
No^ am I as weary
As a married man after the first week.
And have no more desire to move forwards,
Then a Post-horse that has past his Stage.

'Sfoot yonder's the night too, stealing away
With her black gown about her:
Like a kind wench, that had staid out the
Last minute with a man.

What shall we do, Gentlemen?
I apprehend falling into this Jailers
Hands strangely; he would use us worse
Then we did him.

And that was ill enough of Conscience:
What think you of turning Beggars?
Many good Gentlemen have don't: or Thieves?

That's the same thing at Court:
Begging is but a kind of robbing the Exchequer.

Look four fathom and a half OOS --
In contemplation of his Mistres:
There's a Feast, you and I are out now Pellegrin;
'Tis a pretty trick, this enjoining in absence.
What a rare invention 'twood be,
If a man could find out a way to make it real.

Dost think there's nothing in it as tis?

Nothing, nothing.
Did never hear of a dead Alexander,
Raised to talk with a man?
Love's a learned Conjurer,
And with the glass of Fancy will do as strange things?
You thrust out a hand,
Your Mistress thrusts out another:
You shake that hand that shakes you again:
You put out a lip; she puts out hers:
Talk to her, she shall answer you;
Marry, when you come to grasp all this,
It is but air.

It was unlucky, --
Gentlemen, the day appears,
This is no place to stay in;
Let's to some neighbouring Cottage,
May be the Searchers will neglect
The nearer places,
And this will but advance unto our safety.

Who are there?

Now if the spirit of melancholy should possess them*

Why if it should,
An honourable retreat.

I have the rarest fancy in my head, --
Whether are you bound my friends so early?

To a Wedding Sir.

A Wedding?
I told you so.
Whose?

A Country wenches here hard by,
One Erblins daughter.

Good: Erbl^n: the very place.
To see how things fall out.
Hold, here's money for you.
Hark you, you must assist me in a small design.

Any thing.

What dost mean?

Let me alone,
I have a plot upon a wench. --

Your Worship is merry.

Yes faith, to see her only.
Look you, some of you shall go back to 'th' Town,
And leave us your Coats,
My friend and I am excellent at a little Instrument,
And then we'll sing catches.

I understand thee not;
Thou hast no more forecast then a Squirrel*
And hast less wise consideration about thee.
Is there a way safer then this!
Dost think what we have done
Will not be spread beyond this place with every light.
Should we now enter any house
Thus near the Town, and stay all day,
'twould be suspicious: What pretence have we?

He speaks reason Samorat.

I do not like it.
Should any thing fall out 'twould not look well,
I'd not be found so much out of my self,
So far from home as this disguise would make me,
Almost for certainty of safety.

Certainty? Why, this will give it us,
Pray let me govern once.

Well, you suffered first with me,
Now 'tis my turn.

Prithee name not suffering,

Come, come, your Coats,
Our Beards will suite rarely to them:
There's more money,
Not a word of any thing as you tender --

O Sir.

And see you carryit gravely too. --
Now before me Pellagrins rarely translated.
'Sfoot they'll apprehend the head of the Base Viol
As soon as thee;
Thou art so likely,
Only I must confess, that has a little the better face,

Has it so? --
Pox on thee, thou look like I cannot tell what.

Why, so I would fool,
The end of my disguise is to have none
Know what I am:
Look, look, a Devil ayring himself.
I'll catch him like a Mole ere he can get under ground.

Nashorat, Nashorat. --

Pox on that noise, he's earth't.
Prithee let's watch him and see
Whether hee'le heave again.

Ar't mad? --

By this light, three or four of their skins
And weed rob^e.
'I would be the better way. --
Come, come, let's go --

Let the Horse s^t about this place,
We*le make a search within --

Now disperse
In the hollow of the wood,
Wee'le meet again.
Who goes there?
Speak, -- Oh! they are Fiddlers. --
Saw you no Men nor Horse
In the wood to day, -- as you came along.

Speak, speak Rogue.

None Sir, --

Pass on. --

Gentlemen what say you to th'invention now,
I'm a Rogue if I do not think
I was designed for the Helm of State,
I am so full of nimble Stratagems:
That I should have ordered affairs, and
Carried it against the stream of a Faction,
With as much ease as a Skippar,
Would laver against the wind. --

What, no news of any?

No, -- not a man stirring.
Sa how, away, -- away. --

What, any discovery?

Yes, the Horse has staid three fellows,
Fiddlers they call themselves;
There's something in it; they look suspitiously;
One of them has offered at confession once or twice,
Like a weak stomach at vomiting,
But 'twould not out. --

A little cold Iron thrust down his throat
Will fetch it up. --
I am excellent at discovery,
And can draw a secret out of a Knave,
With as much dexterity as a Barber-Surgeon
Wooed a hollow tooth.
Let's join forces with them. --

Sure 'tis eternal night with me;
Would this were all too --
For I begin to think the rest is true,
Which I have read in books,
And that there's more to follow. --

Sure this is he. --

The pure and first created Light
Broke through the Chaos thus. --
Keep off, keep off thou brighter Excellence,
Thou fair Divinity: If thou come near,
(So tempting is the shape thou now assum'st)
I shall grow saucy in desire again,
And entertain bold hopes which will but draw
More, and fresh punishment upon me. --

I see y' are angry Sir:
But if you kill me too, I meant no ill:
That which brought me hither,
Was a desire I have to be with you,
Rather then those I live with: This is all
Beleeve't. --

With me? Oh thou kind Innocence!
Witness all that can punish falsehood,
That I could live with thee,
Even in this dark and narrow prison:
And think all happiness confined within the walls --
Oh, had thou but as much of Love as I.

Of Love? What's that?

Why 'tis a thing that's had before 'tis known:
A gentle flame that steals into a heart,
And makes it like one object ^o, that it scarce cares
For any other delights, when that is present:
And is in pain when 't's gone* thinks of that alone,
And quarrels with all other thoughts that would
Intrude and so divert it. --

If this be Love, sure I have some of it,
It is no ill thing, is it Sir?

Oh most Divine,
The best of all the gods strangely abound in it,
And Mortals could not live without it:
It is the soul of virtue, and the life of life.

Sure I should learn it Sir, if you would teach it.

Alas, thou taught it me;
It came with looking thus. --

I will no longer be concealed,
But tell her what I am,
Before this smooth faced youth
Hath taken all the room
Up in her heart,
Ha! unbound! and sure by her!
Hell and Furies.

What ho -- within there --
Practise escapes?
Get me new irons to load him unto death.

I am so used to this,
It takes away the sense of it:
I cannot think it strange.

Alas, he never did intend to go.
Use him for my sake kindly:
I was not wont to be denied.
Ah me! they are hard hearted all.
What shall I do? I'll to my Governor,
He will not be thus cruel. --

'Tis a rare wench, she 'ith blew stockings:
What a complexion she had when she was warm --
'Tis a hard question of these Country wenches,
Which are simpler, their beauties or themselves.
There's as much difference betwixt
A Towne-Lady, and one of these,
As there is betwixt a wild Pheasant and a tame.

Right: --
There goes such essensing, washing, perfuming,
Da^bing, to the other that they are the least part*
Of themselves.
Indeed the^e's so much sauce, a man cannot taste the meat.

Let me kiss thee for that;
By this light I hate a woman dressed up to her height,
Worse then I do Sugar with Muskadine:
It leaves no room for me to imagine:
I could improve her if she were mine:
It looks like a Jade with his ^ayle tied up with ribbons,
Going to a ^ayre to be ^old.

No, no, thou hate it out of another reason, Nashorat.

Prithee, what's that?

Why they are so sine, they are of no use that day.

Pellegrin is in good feeling.
Sir, did mark the Lass 'ith green upon yellow,
How she bridled in her head,
And danced a stroke in, and a stroke out,
Like a young Fillet training to a pace.

And how she kissed,
As if she had been sealing and delivering her self up
To the use of him that came last,
Parted with her sweet-hearts lips still
As unwillingly, and unto wardly,
As ^oft Wax from a dry Seal.

True; and when she kisses a Gentleman,
She makes a Curtsy, as who should say,
The favour was on his side.
What dull fools are we to besiege a face
Three months for that trifle.
Sometimes it holds out longer, --
And then this is the sweeter flesh too, --

You shall have horses ready at the time,
And good ones too (if there be truth in drink)
And for your letters, they are there by this. --

An excellent Officer. --

Tut, tut, tut,
That's a good one y'faith, not dance?
Come, come, strike up.

Who are those that eye us so severely?
Belong they to the wedding?

I know 'em not.

Gentlemen, will it please you dance. --

No, keep your women, we'll take out others here.
Samorat, if I mistake not.

Ha! betrayed? --

How now! what's the matter? abuse our Fiddlers?

These are no Fiddlers, fools* obey the Princes officers,
Unless you desire to go to prison too.

The thought of what must follow disquiets not at all:
But tamely thus to be surprised
In so unhandsome a disguise? --

I'st ee'n so? Why then,
Farewell the plumed Troops, and the big Wars,
Which made ambition virtue. --

I, I, Let them go, let them go.

Have you ever a stratagem Nasharot?
'Twood be very seasonable. What think you now?
Are you designed for the helm of State?
Can you laver against this Tempest?

Prithee let me alone, I am thinking for life.

Yes, 'tis for life indeed, would 'twere not.

This is very strange; Let's follow after,
And see if we can understand it. --

A mere Phantasm
Raised by Art to try thee.

Good kind Devil,
Try me once more.
Help me to the sight of this Phantasm again.

Thou art undone,
Were it thou not amorous
In the other world?
Did not love women?

Who did hate them?

Why there's it;
Thou though there was no danger in the sin,
Because 'twas common.
Above the half of that vast multitude
Which fills this place, Women sent hither:
And they are highliest punished still,
That love the handsomest.

A very lying Devil this
Certainly. --

All that had their women with you,
Suffer with us.

By your friendships favour though,
There's no justice in that:
Some of them suffered enough
In all conscience by 'em there. --

Oh, this is now your mirth:
But when you shall be pinch't
Into a gellie,
Or made into a cramp all over,
These will be sad truths.

He talks oddly now, I do not like it.
Dost hear? --
Prithee exchange some of thy good counsel
For deeds.
If thou be an honest Devil,
(As thou seem to be)
Put a sword into my hand,
And help me to the sight of this
Apparition again. --

Well, some thing I'll do for thee,
Or rather for my self. --

Come, let's go relieve our Poet.

How, relieve him? he's releas't; is he not?

No, no;
Bersat bethought himself at the mouth of the Cave,
And found he would be necessary to our Masque too night.
We have set him with his feet in a great tub of water,
In which he dabbles and believes it to be Helicon:
There he's contriving in the honour of Mercury,
Who I have told him comes this night of a message
From Jupiter to Pluto, and is feasted here by him.

Oh, they have fetched him off.

Carer per so lo carer,
Or he that made the fairy Queen.

No, none of these:
They are by themselves in some other place;
But here's he that writ Tamerlane.

I beseech you bring me to him,
There's something in his Scene
Betwixt the Empresses a little high and cloudy,
I would resolve my self.

You shall Sir.
Let me see -- the Author of the bold Beauchams,
And Englands Joy.

The last was a well writ peace, I assure you,
A Brittane I take it; and Shakespeares very way:
I desire to see the man,

Excuse me, no seeing here.
The gods in complement to Homer,
Do make all Poets poor above,
And we all blind below.
But you shall con^esse Sir.
Follow. --

Hallight and fresh air again?
The place I know too. --
The very same I fought the Duel in.
The Devil was in the right;
This was a mere Aparition:
But 'twas a handsome one, it left impressions here,
Such as the fairest substance I shall ere behold,
Will scarce deface.
Well I must resolve, but what, or where?
I, that's the question.
The Towne's unsafe, there's no returning thither,
And then the Port. --
Ha! What means the busy haste of these. --
Honest friend. -- No --
Dost hear, --
What's the matter pray?

Gentlemen, gentlemen,
That's good satisfaction indeed.

Prithee good fellow tell me.
What causes all this hurry? --

One Samorat is led to prison Sir,
And other Gentlemen about Lord Torcular.
Ha! Samorat!
There is no mean nor end of fortunes malice:
Oh ^ 'tis insufferable;
I'm made a boy whipped on another back:
Cruel, I'll not endure't by heaven,
He shall not dye for me:
I will not hold a wretched life upon such wretched terms.

Fly; fly abroad, search every place, and
Bring him back:
Thou hast undone us all with thy neglect,
Destroyed the hopes we had to be our selves again;
I shall run mad with Anger;
Fly, be gone. --
My Reginella, what brings you abroad?

Dear Governor? I have a suit to you.

To me my pretty sweetness, what?

You will deny me Sir I fear,
Pray let me have the stranger that came last in keeping.

Stranger? Alas he's gone, made an escape*

I feared he would not stay they used him so unkindly.
Indeed I would have used him better,
And then he had been here still.

Come* do not weep my girl:
Forget him pretty pensiveness, there will
Come others every day as good as he.

Oh! never: I'll close my ey's to all now he's gone.

How catching are the sparks of love? Still this
Mischance shows more and more unfortunate.
I was too curious. --
Come indeed, you must forget him,
The gallant'st and the godli'st to the eye are not the best,
Such handsome and fine shapes as those
Are ever fal^e and foul within.

Why Governor d*you then put
Your finest things still in your finest Cabinets?

Pretty Innocence: no, I do not;
You see I place not you there,
Come no more tears:
Lets in and have a Mate at Chess,
"Diversion cures a loss, or makes it self. --

Crossed all the High-wayes, searched the Woods,
Beat up and down with as much pain diligence,
As ever Huntsman did for a lost Dear.

A race of Cripples, are y' all
Issue of Snails, he could not else have escaped us.
Now? what news bring you?

Sir, we have found him out,
The party is in prison.

How? in prison?

For certain Sir.
It seems young Samorat and he
Were those that fought the duel the other day,
And left our Torcular so wounded there.
For his supposed death was Samorat taken,
Which when this youth had found,
He did attempt to free him (scaling the wall
By night) but finding it impossible,
Next Morning did present himself
Into the hands of Justice, imagining
His death that did the fact, an equal sacrifice.

Brave Orsabrin.

Not knowing that the greedy Law ask's more,
And doth prescribe the accessory
As well as principal.

Just so 'ith nick? 'ith very nick of time?

He's troubled.

It will be excellent.
Be all in soldiers straight,
Where's Torcular?

Forth coming Sir.

How are his wounds?
Will they endure the Air?
Under your gaberdines wear Pistols all.]

What does he mean?

Give me my other habit and my sword
'Ith' least suspected way hast after me.

All?

All but Peridor; I will abroad,
My broken hopes and sufferings
Shall have now some cure.
Fortune spite of her self shall be my friend,
And either shall redress, or give them end. --

I've found it out,
He does intend to fetch this stranger back,
And give him Reginella,
Or else -- No, no, it must be that
His anger, and the search declare it;
The secret of the prison-house shall out I swear.
I'll set all first on fire,
For middle ways to such an end are dull. --

Since she was refused to speak with you Sir,
Nor look of any,
Languishes so fast,
Her servants fear she will not live
To know what does become of him.

Sir 'tis high time you visit her.

I cannot look upon her, and deny her.

Nor need you Sir,
All shall appear to her most gracious:
Tell her the former part of the Law
Must pass, but when it comes t'execute,
Promise her that you intend to interpose.

And shall then Samorat live?

Oh! --
Nothing less! The censure past,
His death shall follow without noise:
*Tis but not owning of the fact,
Disgracing for a time a Secretary,
Or so -- the thing's not new --
Put on forgiving looks Sir,
We are there --
A mourning silence
Sister Sabrina --

Hence, hence,
Thou cruel hunter after life:
Thou art a pain unto my eyes as great,
As my dear Mother had when she did
Bring thee forth -- And sure that was
Extreme, since she produced a monster.

Speak to her your self,
She's so incensed against me,
She will not welcome happiness,
Because I bring it.

Fair ornament of grief,
Why are you troubled --
Can you believe there's any thing within
My power which you shall morn for?
If you have any fears, impart them;
Any desires, give them a name,
And I will give thee rest:
You wrong the greatness of my love,
To doubt the goodness of it.

Alas, I do not doubt your love my Lord,
I fear it; 'tis that which does undo me.
For 'tis not Samorat that's prisoner now,
It is the Princes Rival;
Oh! for your own sake Sir be merciful:
How poorly will this sound hereafter,
The Prince did fear another merit so,
Found so much virtue in his rival, that
He was forced to murder it, make it away.
There can be no addition to you Sir by his death,
By his life there will; You get the point
Of honour, fortune does offer here
What time perchance cannot again:
A handsome opportunity to show
The bravery of your mind --

This pretty Rhetoric cannot persuade me
To let your Samorat live for my sake:
It is enough he shall for yours.

Though virtue still rewards it self, yet here
May it not stay for that; but may the gods
Shower on you suddenly such happiness,
That you may say, my mercy brought me this --

The gods no doubt will hear when you do pray
Right ways: But here you take their names in vain,
Since you can give your self that happiness
Which you do ask of them.

Most gracious Sir, do not --

Hold, I dare not hear thee speak,
For fear thou now should tell me,
What I do tell my self;
That I would poorly bargain for any favours;
Retire and banish all thy fears,
I will be kind and just to thee Sabrina,
What s'ere thou prov'st to me.

Rarely acted Sir, --

Ha! --

Good faith to the very life.

Acted? -- No, -- 'twas not acted.

How Sir?

I was in earnest.
I mean to conquer her this way,
The others low and poor.

Ha? --

I told thee 'twould be so before.

Why Sir, you do not mean to save him? --

Yes -- I do --
Samorat shall be releas't immediately. --

Sure you forget I had a brother Sir,
And one that did deserve Justice at least.

He did --
And he shall have it:
He that killed him shall dye --
And 'tis high satisfaction, that,
Look not --
It must be so --

No Devils Stramador,
Believe your eyes -- To which I
Cannot be so lost* but
You may call to mind
One Peridor.

Ha? Peridor? thou did
Command that day
In which the Tamorens fell.

I did --
Yet Tamoren lives.

Ha?

Not Tamoren the Prince, he fell indeed;
But Tamoren his brother, who that day
Led our horse:
Young Reginella too,
Which is the subject of the suit, --
You have engaged your self by oath,
The King shall grant.

Oh! 'tis impossible,
Instruct me how I should believe thee.

Why thus --
Necessity upon that great defeat
Forced us to keep the Woods, and hide our selves
In holes which since we much enlarged,
And fortified them in the entrance so,
That 'twas a safe retreat upon pursuit:
Then swore we all allegiance to this Tamoren.
These habits better to disguise our selves, we took at first;
But finding with what ease we robbed,
We did continue 'em, and took an Oath,
Till some new troubles in the State should happen,
Or fair occasion to make known our selves
Offer it self, we would appear no other:
But come, let's not loose
What we shall ne'er recover,
This opportunity --

Nashorat, you have not thought of any
Stratagem yet --

Yes I have thought --

What? --

That if you have any accounts with heaven,
They may go on --
This villainous dying's, like a strange tune,
Has run so in my head,
No wholesome consideration would enter it.
Nothing angers me neither, but that
I pass by my Mistresses window to it.

Troth, that's unkind,
I have something troubles me too.

What's that.

The people will say as we go along,
Thou art the properer fellow.
Then I break an appointment
With a Merchants Wife,
But who can help it? --

Yea who can help it indeed,
She's to blame though faith, if she
Does not bear with thee,
Considering the occasion --

Considering the occasion as you say,
A man would think he might be borne with.
There's a Scrivener I should have paid
Some money to, upon my word,
But --

By fair Sabrina's name,
I conjure you not to refuse the mercy
Of the Prince --

It is resolved Sir, you know my answer.

Whether am I fallen?
I think if I should live a little longer,
I should be made the cause of all the mischief
Which should arise to the world --
Hither I came to save a friend,
And by a slight of fortune I destroy him:
My very ways to good prove ills.
Sure I can look a man into misfortune:
The Plague's so great within me 'tis infectious.
Oh! I am weary of my self:
Sir I beseech you yet accept of it,
For I shall be his way
A sufferer,
And an executioner too --

^I beg of thee no more,
Thou dost beget in me desire to live:
For when I find how much I am
Behind in noble acts of friendship,
I cannot choose but wish for longer time, that I might
Struggle with thee, for what thou hast too clearly now
Got from me: The point of honour --
Oh! it is wisdom and great thrift to dye;
For who with such a debt of friendship and
Of Love, as you and my Sabrina must expect from me
Could ere subsist.

They are complementing;
'Sfoot they make no more of it,
Then if 'twere who should go in first at
A door -- I think Pellegrine, as you and I
Have cast it up, it comes to something
More --

Gentlemen, prepare, the Court is setting.

Friends, this is no time for ceremony;
But what a rack have I within m^,
To s^e you suffer.
And yet I hope the Prince will let this anger dye
In me, not to take the forfeiture of you.

If he should, Pellegrin and I are resolved,
And are ready, all but our speeches to the people,
And those will not trouble us much,
For we intend not to trouble them.

Not accept it?
Lose this way too? -- What shall I do?
He makes advantages of mine,
And like a skilful Tennis-player,
Returns my very best with excellent design.
It must not be,
Bring to the Closet here above, the chief of the Jury:
I'll try another way. --

Of all ways of destroying mankind,
These Judges have the easiest,
They sleep and do it.

To my thinking now,
This is but a solemner kind of Puppet-play:
How the Devil came we to be acters in it?
So; it begins.

The Princes Council:
Are they ready?

Here --

Begin then --

My Lords, that this so great and strange.

Most reverend Judges,
To save the expense of breath and time,
And dull Formalities of Law --
I here pronounce my self guilty.

from above. Again he has prevented me --

So guilty that no other can pretend
A share --
This noble youth, a stranger to every thing
But Gallantry, ignorant in our Laws and Customs,
Has made perchance
(In strange severity) a forfeit of himself;
But should you take it,
The gods when he is gone will sure revenge it.
If from the stalk you pull this bud of virtue,
Before 't has spread and shown it self abroad,
You do an injury to all mankind;
And public mischief cannot be private Justice.
This man's as much above a common man,
As man's above a beast; And if the Law
Destroys not man for killing of a beast,
It should not here, for killing of a man.
Oh what mistake 'twould be?
For here you sit to weed the Cankers out
That would do hurt 'ith' State, to punish vice;
And under that y'oud root out virtue too --

If I do blush, 'tis not (most gracious Judges)
For any thing which I have done, 'tis for that
This much mistaken youth hath here delivered.
'Tis true (and I confess) I ever had
A little stock of honour (which I still preserved)
But that (by leaving me behind alive)
He now most cunningly does think to get from me:
And I beseech your Lordships to assist me;
For 'tis most fraudulent all he desires.
Your Laws I hope are reasonable,
Else why should reasonable men
Be subject to them; and then
Upon what grounds is he made guilty now?
How can he be thought accessory
To the killing of a man,
That did not know of the fighting with him?
Witness all those powers which search men's hearts,
That I my self, (until he beckoned me)
Knew nothing of it, if such a thing
As sacrifice must be -- why? Man for mans enough:
Though elder times t'appease diviner Justice,
Did offer up --
(Whither through gallantry, or ignorance)
Vast multitudes of Beasts in sacrifice,
Yet numbers of men is seldom heard of:
One single Curtius purged a whole States sin:
You will not say the offence is now as great,
Or that you ought to be more highly satisfied
Then Heaven --

Brave youths --

Pellegrin, you and I will let our sp^eches alone.

If that the Law were of so fine a web,
As wit and fancy spin it out to, here,
Then these defences would be just, and save:
But that is more substantial,
Of another make --
And Gentlemen, if this be all,
Sentence must pass --

Orsabrin!

Ha! who names me there?

A friend: hear me:
I am an Officer in that dark world
From whence thou came, sent
Thus disguised by Reginella our fair Queen,
And to redeem thee.

Reginella!
In the midst of all these ills,
How preciously that name does sound?

If thou woult swear to follow me,
At the instant the art releast;
I'll save thee and thy friends,
In spite of Law. --

Doubt not of that;
Bring me where Reginella is:
And if I follow not, perpetual misery follow me:
It cannot be a Hell
Where she appears --

Be confident. --
Behold (grave Lords) the man
Whose death questioned the life of these,
Found and recovered by the Thieves
*ith Woods;
And rescued since by us, to rescue Innocence.

Rare Devil,
With what dexterity he has raised this
Shape up; to delude them --

Ha? Torcular alive?

Torcular?
I should as soon believe my brother
Near in being too.

You cannot wonder more to find me here,
Then I do to find my self.

Come unbinde, unbinde, this matter's answered.

Hold: they are not free, the Law exacts
The same for breach of prison that it did before.

There is no scaping out of fortunes hands.
Doest hear; hast never a trick for this? --

Doubt me not, I have without, at my command,
Those which never failed me;
And it shall cost many a life yet
Sir, ere yours be lost --

Stramador you have been a stranger here of late.

Peruse this paper Sir, you'll find there was good reason for it.
Sramador, Peridor, Reginella meet them below.

How! old Tamorens brother, Captain
Of the Thieves, that has infested thus
Our Country?
Reginella too, the heir of that feared Family!
A happy and a strange discovery.

Peridor, and Reginella, the villain
Has betrayed me.

'Tis Orsabrin, they have kept their words.

Reginella? she was a woman then.
O let me go.

You do forget sure what you are.

I do indeed: oh, to unriddle now!

And to this man you owe it Sir,
You find an engagement to him there;
And I must hope you'll make me just to him.

He does deserve it,
Seize on him --

Nay then all truths must out.
That I am lost and forfeit to the Law,
I do confess,
Yet since to save this Prince.

Prince!

(Our Mephosto-philus is mad.)

Yet, Prince, this is the Orsabrin.

Ha! --

So long ago,
Supposed lost,
Your Brother Sir:
Fetch in there Ardelan and Piramont.

What mad Planet rules this day
Ardelan, and Piramont.

The Divel's wanton,
And abuses all mankind to day.

These faces are well known to all Francelians,
Now let them tell the rest --

My noble Master living! found in Francelia?

The gods have satisfied our tedious hopes.

Some Imposture.

A new design of fortune --
I dare not trust it.

Why speak you not?

I am so full of joy, it will not out.
Know ye Francelians,
When Sanborne fatal field was fought,
So desperate were the hopes of Orsabrin,
That 'twas thought fit to send away this Prince,
And give him safety in another clime;
That spite of an ill day, an Orsabrin might be
Preserved alive.
Thus you all know,
To Garradans chief charge he was committed:
Who when our Bark by Pirates was surprised,
(For so it was) was slain 'ith first encounter;
Since that we have been forced to wait
On Fortunes pleasure.
And Sir, that all this time we kept
You from the knowledge of your self,
Your pardon; It was our zeal that erred,
Which did conclude it would be prejudicial.

My Lords you look as if you doubted still:
If Piramont and I be lost unto your memory,
Your hands I hope are not --
Here's our Commission:
There's the Diamond Elephant,
That which our Princes Sons are ever known by:
Which we to keep him undiscovered,
Tore from his ribbon in that fatal day
When we were made prisoners:
And here are those that took us,
Which can witness all circumstance,
Both how, and when, time and place;
With whom we ever since have lived by force:
For on no Kingdom, friend unto Francelia,
Did Fortune ever land us, since that hour;
Nor gave us means to let our Country know
He lived --

These very truths, when they could have no ends,
(For they believed him lost)
I did receive from them before,
Which gave me now the boldness to appear
Here, where I'm lost by Law.

Long live Prince Osabrin.
Long live Prince Orsabrin,
Pellegrin let's second this:
Right or wrong 'tis best for us.

Observe, observe.

What shouts are those?

Soldiers of Tamorens the first;
The second was the peoples, who
Much press to see their long lost Prince.

Sir, 'tis most evident, and all agrees,
This was his coloured hair,
His Air, though altered much with time:
You wear too strange a face upon this news;
Sir, you have found a brother
I, Torcular, the Kingdoms happiness;
For here the plague of Robberies will end.
It is a glorious day --

It is indeed, I am amazed, not sad;
Wonder does keep the passage so,
Nothing will out.
Brother (for so my kinder Stars will have it)
I here receive you as the bounty of the gods;
A blessing I did not expect,
And in return to them, this day,
Francelia ever shall keep holy.

Fortune by much abusing me, has
So -- dul'd my faith, I cannot
Credit any thing.
I know not how to own such happiness.

Let not your doubts lessen your joys:
If you have had disasters heretofore,
They were but given to heighten what's to come.

Here's as strange a turn as if 'twere the
Fifth Act in a Play. --

I'm sure 'tis a good turn for us.

Sir, why stands that Lady so neglected there,
That does deserve to be the business of mankind.
Oh ye gods: since you'll be kind
And bountiful, let it be here.
As fearfully, as jealous husbands ask
After some secrets which they dare not know;
Or as forbidden Lovers meet in the night,
Come I to thee (and 'tis no ill sign this,
Since flames when they burn highest tremble most)
Oh, should she now deny me!

I know not perfectly what all this means;
But I do find some happiness is near,
And I am pleased, because I see you are --

She understands me not --

He seems to have passion for her.

Sir, in my dark commands these flames broke out
Equally, violent at first sight;
And 'twas the hope I had to reconcile my self.

It is a holy Magic that will make*
Of you and I but one. --

Any thing that you would ask me, sure I might grant.

Hark Gentlemen, she does consent,
What wants there else?

My hopes grow cold, I have undone my self.

Nothing, we all will join in this;
The long lived feu'd between the Families
Here dyes, this day the Hyminaeall
Torches shall burn bright;
So bright, that they shall dim the light
Of all that went before --
See Sabrina too. --

Sir, I must have much of pardon,
Not for my self alone, but for all mine --

Rise, had thou not deserved what now thou su'st for,
This day should know no clouds.

Taught by the Princes mercy; I forgive too.

Frighted hither Sir.
They told me you wooed not accept the Princes mercy.

Art thou no further yet in thy intelligence?
See, thy brother lives --

My brother? --

And 'tis the least of wonders has fallen out.

Yes, such a one as you are, fair,
And you shall be acquainted.

Oh could your hate my Lords, now,
Or your love dye.

Thy merit has prevailed
With me.

And me.

And has almost with me.
Samorat thou dost not doubt thy Mistress Constancia.

No Sir.

Then I will beg of her,
That till the Sun returns to visit us,
She will not give away her self for ever.
Although my hopes are faint,
Yet I would have 'em hopes,
And in such jolly hours as now attend us.
I would not be a desperate thing,
One made up wholly of despair.

You that so freely gave me Samorats life,
Which was in danger,
Most justly, justly, may be suffered to attempt
Upon my love, which is in none.

What says my noble Rival?

Sir, y' are kind in this, and wisely do
Provide I should not surfeit:
For here is happiness enough besides to last the Sun's return.

You and I are but savers with all this Pellegrin.
But by the Lord 'tis well we came off
As we did, all was at stake --

Come, no more whispers here,
Let's in, and there unriddle to each other --
For I have much to ask.

A Life! a Friend! a Brother! and a Mistres!
Oh! what a day was here:
Gently my Joys distill,
Least you should break the Vessel you should fill.

ANd how, and how, in faith, -- a pretty plot;
And smartly carried through too, was it not?
And the Devils, how, well? and the fighting,
Well too; -- a fool, and't had bin just old writing.
O what a monster wit must that man have,
That could please all which now their twelve pence gave:
High characters (cries one) and he would see
Things that ne'er were, nor are, nor ne'er will be.
Romances cries easie-soules, and then they swear,
The Playe's well wr^t, though scarce a good line's there.
The Women -- Oh if Stephen shoul^ be killed,
Or miss the Lady, how the plot is spil'd?
And into how many pieces a poor Play
Is taken still before the second day?
Like a strange Beauty newly come to Court;
And to say truth, good faith 'tis all the sport:
One will like all the ill things in a Play,
Another, some of the good, but the wrong way;
So from one poor Play there comes to arise
At several Tables, several Comedies.
The ill is only here, that 't may fall out
In Plays as Faces; and who goes about
To take asunder oft destroys (we know)
What altogether made a pretty show.
