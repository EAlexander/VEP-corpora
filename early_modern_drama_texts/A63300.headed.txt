Bless your honour for your benefaites.


Pray recollect your self, I cannot do it
Without a loss to my repute and fame,
If you have but a foot of ground unsold.
Therefore consult your thoughts, my willingness
Shall not be wanting to procure your freedom;
But I'd not have a dirty piece of Land
Bring an obstruction to it.

Why? as I live
I have not an Inch left; what ere I mortgaged
Is either sold out-right, or forfeited,
I lie not on my Credit.

How's that Man?
Have you credit then? Why, that's as bad.
It is not held convenient by the Huff,
Lords of the sword, that any Yongster should
Be one of us 'till he 'as not only lost
his 'state, but's credit too.

Upon my life,
Dear Townshift, I've not credit for a thrips;
Thou know it well enough, my roaging Landres
Will not do it for the washing of a shirt.

Why, have you shirts then?

One as I live, no more, and that so thin
You may draw't through a Needle.

What Boots have you?

I cannot call these any, yet they are all;
And as for stockings, I have long ago
Held them unnecessary.

Why this Cloak,
And the weather warm and friendly.

'Tis too much,
The weight on it, I confess, 's not to be borne,
I'll ease me of the burden, It shall sink
In sack when I'm made free, prithee about it.

I would not for a world you should have any
Remnant of your Estate left,'t would undo you
See, here's my Brothers, Drawforth and Pinck-carkase
May I presume to recommend you to 'em?

You may, you may, dear Townshift.

How now Trapheire,
What is all gon yet?

All he swears by's Twibell,
His Cloak excepted, and its time expires
Within this half hour; shall we make him free?

Trapheire, you now are to begin the World,
Which you cannot do handsomely, unless
Your Land and you be separated, and if
Ought lie concealed, 'twill rise in judgment against you;
Therefore pray have a care, 'tis Christian Counsel.

It is not fit the least piece of your old
Adulterate fortunes should corrupt the new
Your wit must purchase.

Right, beside, he'll ne'er
Have a refined Wit 'till he has nothing left.

The greatest Enemy I have Gentlemen is my Cloak,
And I promise I'll fee 't no more.

Say you so, then to the next Tavern;
Boy -- boy -- a Room.

Please you to walk into a Room Gentlemen?

What call we thee for else?

How like you this Room Gentlemen?

Indifferent; bring us Wine and Tobacco of the best sirrah.

You shall indeed sir.

Dear Townshift thou must show this Gentleman
The way to the Brokers.

Is he for sale, or Mortgage?

For sale by all means, I'd not charge my memory
I've ought left worth redeeming.

Bravely resolved -- Is't Racie?

Right Racie sir believe me.

Trapheire to thee.

Drink apace, dear Townshift
The sight of that same Gentleman's my tortour,
I prithee rid me of him.

Townshift swear him.

I cannot with a safe conscience swear as long
As that appears before me.

How shall I get it out of the house?

Leave thine here, and wear mine thither.
O how I hate to call it mine -- away wit't.

Trapheire, you now must exercise your Wit
To live on others, as w'ave lived on you;
Wit's never good till purchased, what though't be
With the loss of fortunes Trumpery and Trash;
Content ne'er dwells among dirty Land, who sells it
Parts with a deal of care, and scurvy toil;
Men never are ingenious that are clogged with it.
The Generous spirit will not be cooped up
In that same Country Cage, a mansion house,
And confines of the Buttery; be free,
Thou art not worth a Groat
When this is spent.

How much, how much dear Townshift?

But thirty by my Valour.

Down with it, down with it;
I'll not put up a Dodkin on it; dear Townshift,
Drink, drink away, I thirst until it's melted,
Your moulten silver swallows best.

His Oath, his Oath.

Your sword.
By this Hilt, and this Blade
Which at Hounslow was made,
You swear to be true
To what shall ensue.
First, You swear not to make it any scruple of Conscience to cheat your
Father; That you will hunt after young Heirs, and when you have courst them
out of wind, you'll refresh 'em with some Scrivener, Broker, or Draper; That
you'll keep always three strings to your bow, to make it bend till it break;
That having gotten a Bubble or Bishop, a lad of the last adoption, that you
make him sensible of a Wench, though to the charge of a Surgeon, it being
reason all trades should live, and if occasion be, wink at small faults. Next
be sure to keep them continually at Game, or Drinking; Uurge 'em to quarrel,
and then take up the business, but not without profit to the Brotherhood; That
what quarrels soever arise among our selves, must not cause us to fight with
one another, but the Coins of the Bubble or Bishop must make us friends; That
you must not pay your Coachman but with kicks, unless your Bubble or Bishop
do, and then he owes you a fare; That your Bubble, or Bishop, and you, keep but
one Purse, though two Drabs; That when you have dreined him dry, you make him
free, if he sue for it, if not let him keep Company with the Titteretues, and
live upon the sin of Sodom; That you I take your chance of the day, where there
is need of dipping, without grumbling.

That while you can stand
With sword in your hand,
You'll not be in awe
Of the Halberteere Law;
Kiss this -- Now you're free
Of the Huffs company.

Hey for the Brotherhood; No Wine stirring, Boy? You Rascal, where's your duty?
absent? hah! More Wine.

You shall sir by and by.

Bring a Glass will hold
A Pint at least, I hate a thimble full,
We shall ne'er have consumed this mighty mass
If we sip thus like sparrows;
I marry, this looks like some Brother to you all.

Gramercy.

Sirrah, cover the Board with Bottles,
This is our Coronation day, the Room
Shall swim in Wine; be frolic Huffs, and drain
Me dry, yet I shall live when you're all hanged.

How now, how now Traphiere!

Drink and be damned;
Must I wait on your Drivelling?

Drawforth to you -- Charge him home.

Traphiere a whole bottle to thee -- I'm up to the Chin.

-- So, so sir, -- you're a fine fellow; Is all paid?

No, all's not come in yet.

I'll stay no longer.

Pray leave my cloak behind you.

Your cloak sir? how came it to be yours sir? I have one some where.


Yours is at the Brokers sir.

Is it so sir? I thank you for your information.

There lies the virtue on it.

So sir, I thank you twice; for once I care not if I put my Cloak into my
pocket.


But Trapheire, Trapheire.

Who pays the house?

Let the house pay it self; dip, dip and be hanged you that have Cloaks, am I
bound to fill your insatiate Gorge eternally.


What Asses were we to let the money lie so long, knowing his Rascally humour,
he'll not pay a Penny when he's in drink -- See what thou can work him to.


Boy.

Sir -- I shall sir.

Trapheire, a prize Trapheire.

Of what? Sprats?

A Gudgin man, a Gudgin's come to Net;
The Master of the house desires admittance
To play a Game at Ticktack for a Piece;
And thou know Trapheire -- hah --

I know it Rogue;
And thou shalt play with him for all he's worth;
I'll venture on thy hand my whole Estate,
This my trusty Blade. Provided always sir --

That you have half -- 'tis granted -- he's here;
Thou know I have no money.

Thou shalt not want dear Bully, I'll not leave
My self a George.

Spoke like thy self, come be so.
There sir, pay your self.

You're kindly welcome Gentlemen, fetch my Quart.

Death, what's this?

Ha ha, ha -- Only the Reckoning paid sir.

You're Rogues, Shirks, and Cheats; I'll indict you

Buoy good sir, employ your Tongue at Billings gate;
Adieu, adieu.

Farewell and be hanged.
For your part sirrah, I'll have you up for keeping of a Bawdy house.


Do your worst sir, do your worst.

You're mickle braw sirs, you're mickle braw; bred, ye leoke mere lick Burgemasters

-- 'Twas Morning ere he went to bed sir.

-- All's one; tell who 'tis, and 'twill be warrant
Enough for your awaking him; 'tis business
I come about, and of concernment too,
That cannot admit delay.

I'll venture then to call him sir.

Do so -- if this design
Of mine prove prosperous, Townshift, it will be
Some comfort to me that I am even with thee.

He'll wait upon you presently,
He's rising.

A good Lad -- Townshift arm thy self, for I am prepared
To give thee an assault, and dare thy Action
At Law, if Wit and Sword should fail,
Dear Townshift.

By this light I have not slept
A minute; what's the news? you served us bravely the other night at Tavern.

On this drinking!
This perilous Drinking will destroy us all;
Thy pardon my dear heart, the business now
I come about will try thy friendship.

How?
I hope no quarrel.

Yes, with my base stars.

But what's the matter, tell me?

That's my meaning,
A sort of Rascally Bailiffs dogged me hither,
And thou know if I be once taken I am
A slave perpetually.

What would thou have me to do?
We'll send to Drawforth and the rest.

'T won't do,
They'll make but a disturbance in the street,
Yet I may be surprised for all their Valour,
And then I am undone; the hopes I have
In one I am to dine with lost, which might
Be worth to thee and me some hundreds Bully.

Send for him, now let him take up the business.

What, ere I'm thoroughly known to him; besides,
Should he take this up twenty more would follow't,
Who knowing me so low now, do forbear
To execute their rigour.

What would have me do?

Hark thee, I've thought upon a fine Deceit;
Hast any Patches in thy Chamber?

Rare ones,
Of all sorts.

One to Disguise my face, with a Cloak, would
Do it to the life.

Sure they are gon, I'll send to see.

Oh hang 'em Rogues, the are skulking at the Lanes end,
Or some blind Alenouse -- Dearest Townshift do it.

Do what?

Lend me thy Cloak, and I'll contrive a Patch
Shall cover my left eye, they may not know me.

I know not what to do -- I should go forth
My self.

Nay prithee Townshift --

Will you leave
Your Sword then* you'll have no --

Prithee would have me
Pass by 'em unprovided, put the worst,
They should descry me.

There's no trick in it Trapheire?

No more trick than you see; I prithee meet me in Fishstreet at the Feathers,
where we'll dine; there thou shalt see my friend, and I'll restore thy Cloak
dear Townshift.


Well, thou shalt have it -- Boy fetch
My Cloak and patches -- 'tis thine, there take it.

Gramercy; Is't handsome?

Very well; I must lie down and take a Nap at twelve;
I will not fail to meet thee.

Sirrah boy, be sure you wake him.

I warrant you sir.

Ha, ha, ha,
I'm sworn to cheat my father, and 'tis fit
He that first made the Gin should hansell it.

-- Sir, you are kindly welcome, and the oftner
You visit me, the welcommer you shall be;
I honour men of knowledge. Master Folly,
I am obliged to you for his acquaintance.

-- Geod feith sir, an he's worth yours; I sall play him wy any Anglish Dooctor
in the VVarld.


No sir, Ise can dee mere than Ise speeke sir.

-- I believe you sir,
By what I find of truth within my self;
I must confess, I am not altogether
So right as I would, my body tells me
I may admit of Physic.

Amongst ns Magistrates, which makes me fear
'Tis not for cure.

Farewell sir, farewell.


A pretty place this.

But the Company!
The Company dear Coz hither resorts
Gives life and sweetness to it; the rarest wits!
So rare la man may lose himself ere he
Discover 'em -- for they are not to be --
Discovered -- Besides, the Women, Ladies,
Of such excelling beauty, you would swear
They painted -- and not be forsworn, as merry
As Cupid when he wantons.

And you spent
Your means amongst them?

And spent rarely well!
I've no remorse for it. Can you sing?

Not I Coz.

How Coz? not sing! why then you are no Company;
We have a merry life so long as't lasts.
I'll lay my life you fence not neither.

Yes,
My grounds I do.

Have you the grounds of fencing? that is, to
Make the Passado, to retrieve, comply,
Defend, make up, close, and Disarm;
You know not this I warrant?

Not I truly.

I cannot think what will become of you,
When you meet Men of valour.

I pray keep me
Out of their company, I love no quarrels;
I came to study the Law.

At a fine time.
You've bought no Books I hope.

I, but I have.

Return them to the Bookseller for shame;
A Sword will prove more useful: hark ye Coz,
I am resolved to have you learn to fence.

I'd rather learn to sing.

That ye shall too:
Your money will do all things -- yonder's Townshift,
How like a Rogue he looks? I will not shun him.
And Cozen, as I was telling you

With your leave sir.

'Twas well asked sir,
What's your will with me?

My Cloak sir -- wher's my Cloak sir?

Even at the Brokers sir --

How -- you are a Rogue.

That's nothing sir -- your railing will not fetch it out again.
Townshift I love thee, thou know I do.

A pox upon you.

Thou know the oath, I'm not to spare my Father.
And though we quarrel, yet we must not fight.
I'm punctual to my Oath; but if thou hast
The conscience, I am ready.

Is he sunk for ever.

No, it may rise again, if you be civil.

Is that your friend?

And Kinsman.

Wilt thou cheat him too?

My Oath is past, I will not be forsworn
For a Kings ransom.

Nay then, I'm satisfied.

Come, be known to him -- Coz, this is my friend.

Sir, I kiss your hand.

I thank you heartily sir.

Fie Coz, fie, there's a complement.

He does not look as though he needed ought,
Save what thou want, a Cloak.

Good wit Coz, good wit.

Oh Rogue, how he claws him.

Where shall's dine?

I'll to the Ordinary.

Where?

In Fetter-lane.

To feed on Bruise, and be served with Linen
As sable as the chimney. No, weel take
A Coach, and hence to Fish-street.

What shall we do there?

Eat fish, the World does not afford the like.

But the Coach is costly,

Pough, I'll be at that;
'Tis said the Milk of Asses, makes men fat.

FIE Masters fie, geod feith you're mickle oout; I ga hum noought bet convenable
stooff.


You're a Rascal, a Scotch Horseleech, a Doctor, a Dolthead: Oh the madness of
the men of these times; if any of them be but a little out of temper, none can
set them right but a Scotch Doctor forsooth, as though all the English ones
were fools. But Sirrah, Sirrah, it is well known my husband


Geod Mistras hark ye toll me.

Hang you Rascal, my Husband was never troubled with whimsies in his head, nor
never railed against his Superiors; he was ever a quiet man, and an honest
man, and had the love of the whole Court, and so had I too. Many a good turn
have the good Gentlemen done me, which I must never expect now again, so
violently my Husband rails against the Government. But if he suffer for it,
thou shalt not wear a Nose to thy face; a Nose on thy face said I: Nay if
there be a sign-post in all this Town I'll hang thee on it -- Ah poor heart.

Here he comes -- See what a pickle you have put him in; My fingers itch to
come at thy face, that ugly


A me saw she's a Deele, and will spell awe my Market gif I ser her not lick
him; these gis o tha sem powder, whilke gif sha smell ta, will mack her sa lick
him as may be.


Sweet heart.

Oh, art thou there? tis well; there has bin ne'er
A Pursevant here yet to fetch me, has there?

A Pursevant for you! for what cause Husband?

I am too honest, that is cause enough.
There is a Council Table, Yes forsooth,
And at it is contrived men's ruins -- hah.
Who's that? who's that? is't not for me they ask?
I shall be lost quite, if I look not well
About me.

True, you're in the way to undo
Your self, and me, and all your Family.
But this is thy Gin Rascal; Oh I could tear thee.

Mistras ga me whil toll speeke toll ye; these wudnes o his, cam fro tha
corruption o his hart: Awe that I ga hum was sike as these, be me saw smeel
Laddy, smeel Laddy.


I have not Patience.

No, no, be not wud, smeel toll it.

My thinks tis very comfortable.

Hoow doll ye geod sir?

Oh Mr Doctor is't thee! art safe?
'Tis wonderful there's nothing charged against thee!
There is an Office called the Green-cloth too,
Has no man had thee there yet?

They ken me sa weel sir -- It warks brawly.

Hark you Husband, what is that you said but now? I believe it, what was't? the
King is pestilent, wilful; hah; I was't so? why then, for ought I know, he
must be beaten into better manners.


Reight weel sed geod feith.

Honest Mr Doctor, pray come in sir;
You are the welcom'st man come to my house
This fortnight -- Husband love him, has he not
A taking countenance?

No body at the Gate?
I am possessed with fears and jealousies.

And well you may be Husband, I am sure
You have had cause enough, good Man, I grieve,
I grieve to think on it.

Mr Doctor, be advised;
Pray go not unprepared; to Night you shall
Take my house for your shelter, things work strangely.

Sweet Mr Doctor you shall be so welcome,
It passes; truly, you're a man upright
In every thing I warrant, pray come in sir.

Geod feith, tha cass is awter'd.

Bring forth your Prongs Neighbours; All men stand up for the truth: And he
that will lie on the Sunday, is not to be trusted the week after, what say you
Neighbours?


I say a Sundays lie may go as far as a work-daies, my reason is, it has more
leisure to travel.


For my part neighbours let them lie that will I have no more to do with a
lie, then a lie has to do with me; if any lies with my wife, it shall go hard
but i'll do as much with his.


I, if he have none Neighbour.


Why, if he have none Neighbour, I must go without; no man will be a slave I
think.


A slave! who has such a mind let him have it still: For my part Neighbours,
I'll work hard, earn my bread with the sweat of my brows, none shall eat away
the fruit of my labour, but I will sit down when it is done, and laugh, in
despite of all the Kasars in the World.


Hold a pluck there Neighbour, 'tis ill playing with edge-tooles; that word
despite comes not in handsomely, and may bring us all to the Pot.


What! have we a scabbed sheep amongst us? lets clear our flock of him.


Hold Neighbour, hold, I am for you with all my heart, but give me leave to
speak to you; I am but a fool 'tis confessed, but children and fools tell truth
sometimes, you know.


And what of that, and what of that.


I say again, 'tis dangerous meddling with edge-tooles; there's store of trees
here abouts, and there may be Gibbets made of them, and you know well enough
what fruit Gibbets bring forth; I say no more, but be careful what you do.


Away with him, away with him.


One word more Neighbours, one word more; it is not well to mock our
Superiors, much worse to threaten them: for as I have heard, there was a suit
at Law commenced about a Fart.


Ha, ha, ha, how man, how!


Why, I will tell you Neighbours, be but patient; there was a fellow, I'll not
tell his name, was pissing against the wall, the Mayor came by, now you know
the Proverb, tell a tale to a Mare, and 'twill let a fart; but here the case
alters, for the fellow let the fart, and the Mayor took it in the nose, and
caused the fellow to be carried to the Town Hall, as Prisoner.


The Mayor was a Horse, or a Whoreson knave, what's this to us?


Now to the suit.

'Tis worn out, weel have none on it.

Neighbours lay down your Prongs, take my devise;
'Tis an old Proverb, be merry and wise.

Away with him, away with him, we will break the Cords of our slavery.


These gis tha Doctor, I tolled ye o sir, mickle wise an holy,
My non Contrymon ta sir.

Sir the Character
The Town receives of you, makes me ambitious
Of your Acquaintance.

I complamen not sir, Ise doown reight Scot;
Awe verety an honesty.

The better sir.
That language is the freest from deceit,
That carries most simplicity.

No, no, Ise not sa sample neder.

Pardon me;
I speak not in that sense, but have regard
Unto the Metaphor; I don't conclude,
Because the Organ of the soul may be infected,
The soul must be imperfect; for I've known
Men rarely endued, that Nature has denied
The benefit of expression to.

You're a Scollard sir.

And I presume you one. I have read something
Of the Metaphysics, though I took not on me
The function, or the practice: But, no more
Of that sir, 'tis not wisdom in a man
Unskil'd, to hold a weapon against a Fencer.

Mickle weel sed geod feith.

All my Discourse
Draws to this Period; that is, you'd be pleased
T'afford me your opinion; some thing I ail,
But know not what, save this, a deprivation
Of breath, and find it prejudicial to
My Calling.

You ha bad lungs sir, whilk macks ye short wound.

I could have told you that sir; My defect
Proceeds from thence; but for the Remedy --
I know my failings.

You'll faw sir intoll a Consumption very soon sir, gif ye tack noought ta keep

Gead feith, gif he tack ye in hand sir, you're awe hole.


You're ta fat at hart sir, Pluraletes bred bet iddlenes, an iddlenes, bad

Sir, I shall trust my body to your Care.

Bet Ise net trust me saw to yours.

Sir, Mr Soongul'd desires you would come with the Doctor to him presently.


I sal swett hart, my Jo; Doctor, you mon ta Mr Soongul'd wi me.


You are sent for sir, I see.

Bet I sal ha ye in mind sir.

As soon as may be -- farewell sir.

Fer not sir, fer not.

This is the best Room Gentlemen.

It stinks of Tobacco, don't it Coz?

How Tobacco!
Tobacco is Companion for a Prince.

I take none though.

Then you want education; fill Boy, fill.
Townshift to thee.

Let it come.

Sir, there's some Gentlemen in the next Room desires your Company.


What are they?

I think their names be Drawforth and Pinckcarcase.

Plain Drawforth and Pinckcarcase; well admit em.
Shall it be so Coz?

I hope there'l be no quarrelling.

What if there be?
Have you not here your men of Iron by you.
Can you be better backed and breasted sir;
Townshift, the Rogues have got a Bubble.

The more the merrier -- your servant,
Gentlemen.

This is our friend, and desires your Acquaintance.

Gentlemen, a man of worth, I'll assure you.

What Country man I pray sir?

An Essex man sir, your servant.

The better flesh I'll warrant.

I know not that sir, I have near bin tried.

Not near shall be for me.

Drink, drink about.

To thee Drawforth.

A health to thy friends Mistress.

Well done, about with it.

I thank you Gentlemen.

What! not begin another?

I've drank too hard already; this same glass and no more:
Gentlemen, your Ladies health sir.

Why Traphiere, whence this gallantry?

What an idle question
Is that of thee; why, who should do it, but this?
He sent his Taylor to take measure of
The buildings of our bodies.

And the appurtenances
Came to us by like Providence.

Drink, drink about.

Coz, let me give thee over our Wine some Counsel;
You are a landed Man, be careful what
Strange Company you keep; for there are Cheats,
And desperate Cheats abroad, will make no Conscience
To bring you into Bonds, and make you sell
Or mortgage all you have; take heed good Coz,
What Company you keep.

He that cheats me, shall have good luck Coz.

When does your Taylor fit your body with
A fashionable suit; this bears an Antique
And worn-out date. A gentleman of your Fortunes
And walk so like a Cow-driver.

I will have one against Sunday.

Some six yards makes me one too, let it be so; hah!

The like proportion fits me, twelve, us both.

Well it shall be done Gentlte-men --

Drink, drink about, your friend is gone.

I'll send yours after him.

I-must-be-gone, 'tis-late.

No sure. What, by thy Watch?

The hand is upp-on-on-twel-ve.

A pretty Watch, I prithee lend it me,
To have another made by.

Tis-a-Watch-of Price-Coz.

I would not borrow it else.

What store of Chink have you?

Money-enough, mony-enough.

Lend me a piece or two.

There-there Boy.

The like to me sir, come, I shall, I shall.

There-sir. Ile-be gon --

Twenty two shillings and you're welcome Gentlemen.

all parties agreed -- I know


Nor ours; Heroic spirit wilt thou?

Her's more wine Gentlemen.

About with it, about with it.

The Dice, the Dice.

Come tis a good throw Coz.

But that's better sir; your friend pays.

Hang him he cheated, he's a cheat.

Ne'er go not I, Gentlemen.

You lie, you lie.

How the lie? will you take that?

How shall-I-help it pray?

Well done Coz.

-- Hang him he's-but a Country puppy Calfe.

Throw a Pot at's head.

I shall-not-hit-him. If-I-doe; I am-no-more
Puppy-then your self --

Why, that was well done.

Ile-kick you sirrah -- I learn'd-that of-you Coz --

Gallants expect to hear from us, and suddenly.

A Coach there.

I hope, they -- wait -- not for us -- hah!

What if they do? we fear em not, pay, pay;
Boy there's your reckoning. Call a Coach Boy.

DOwn with this Babell-builder, this Court pride,

I, down with'em husband, down with 'em, they have stood long enough; I am sure
their long standing have made you come short many a time and often, but I hope
now husband you'll take 'em down a Button hole lower.


Am not I a man?


You think so husband, I warrant.


Why, a King's no more.


Nay, is he that husband? troth I dare say our man William is as good a man as
the best of you; for as they say, a man is a man and he has but a hose on's
head.


Well, I am resolved William shall forth.


Forth, how do you mean forth? I hope you will not leave me unprovided at
home; you know your own business abroad, and I am certain he can do your
business at home better than your self -- oh husbund, husband here's the Scotch
Doctor.


Mr Doctor, what news Mr Doctor?


Nen geod sir, nen geod sir, bet me frond ha had hes cass pulled ore his lugs.

I shall be glad of your acquaintance sir.


True, truly sir, you have a face like a man, you'll do the business I warrant,
let you alone, but gently to the women sir, for we are twigs, and may be bowed
which way you list; mere tender twigs sir.


Bred, bet sam o ye bien toough enoough.


We are a long time indeed a bringing up, but then we are soon cast down;
women have tender hearts, and tender flesh, and tender consciences, though
naughty men report that we have none; husband shall they walk into th'Parlor; I
do love to enter into Dialogue with these Gentlemen, they talk so prettily.


I, with all my heart.


You will meet with sir fine Plunder among the Ladies; you shall dine with us
too -- you may make me amends with a Court smock; I look to wear one in truth,
they are so fine and so perfumed, it passes.


Come sir, we'll discourse of our affairs
After w'ave dined -- you'll dine with us too Gentlemen?

Wees tack ye ot yar word.


Nay, you may do it sirs, you may do it, you have warrant for it; 'tis well enough
known, the Pomp of the Prelates, the Whore of Babylon her self in her
feathers, the Kings of the earth commit fornication with her Plu^alities of
Benefices makes men but idle, says Mr Doctor, and idleness makes you fat, and
fat makes you pursy, and so by consequence short winded; It is a trick of Rome
to starve our Religion; Let Iezabell be brought before the Elders, and the
whore of Babyilon to the Whipping post, let her have lash upon lash; let her
smock be given to the Rag-men, it may come to be Paper, and her Condemnation
writ in it; let the Whelps and the Cubs be brought to the Stake, baite'um,
baite'um, baite'um, I am your warrant saith Mr Doctor.


Master Doctor's an Ass.


Children you talk not like men, you are but middling Christians, 'tis well
known to the Parish.


That Bedlams fit for you.


Those that will follow me, let them follow me,

I am now for the Truth,
And the Covenant in sooth.

Hi, hi, hi, Stow the Friar, stow the Friar.


You see what he has brought me to, my Crutches;
I was ere held an able man you know;
Had my tongue at Command, and my head too,
But now they both are so enfeebled I
Have scarce the use of either; if I had
It were all one, the Country People are
Bewitched into belief, they have as much
Reason and Law as I, and will become
Their own Solicitors, and Council too.
I cannot last long, but expect still when
My Crutches will deceive me, and I fall
To the ground for ever.

-- I am brought to nothing
As well as you, I little thought a Scotchman
Could ere have dreind my Veins, and purse so dry,
I am not worth the ground I go on; so
Dejected are my thoughts; my spirit lost,
And all the hopes of my recovery
Extinct and buried.

I should not have known you,
Had you not told me who you were; you are
So changed from your self. Oh those were times,
Worthy to call to mind, (though to our grief)
When you and I, like Twins, derived a being
From one another sustenance, the Monopolies
That you projected, and I perfected!
Like two expert Limners, the one employed
To fashion the face, the other to finish it.

-- I, those were times indeed, but all I got
Then, has been since consumed; and I guess
You are not much the better; I am weary
I protest of my life, and would thank him
Would do me so much good as take it from me.

-- Patience is the best remedy where no
Better can be obtained; 'tis vain to crave
The thing we want when 'tis not to be had;
Your dancing days are done, and all the breath
The Scot has left me scarce will heat my fingers.

-- And my affliction does the more increase
To see my friends disabled, as I am,
From helping one another, 'tis a grief
That's inexpressible, and not for cure.

-- What Fortune sours, content must sweeten, he
Is the best man o'rcomes his misery.

-- For my part, I am but a man, and I owe but a death, let them take it, as
they say they will, give them good on it, let them come, let them come -- where
are they? stand, stand, stand.


Husband now you talk of standing, pray let me lye down, and then let 'em do
their worst, I defy 'em.


-- And so do I, we'll to the Terret, Woman, and there we are secured against
Devil, and Pursevant.


-- I'm wearied off my legs with doing nothing but running up and down in every
Nook and Corner like a Rat for fear of catching.


-- They are coming, they are coming; let me come in woman, let me come in.


I would you would come in husband once, you have been out long enough to small
purpose I'm sure.


Believe it, their Design aims at our ruin;
And though the Cord they make be somewhat finer
Than Ordinary, 'Twill choke us at the last;
I hold a naked freedom better far
Than an adorned Prison; golden fetters
And Iron ones produce a like effect,
What differs them's but curiosity.

Into what a Lethargy has these rabble Scots
Betrayed the peoples senses? tell them on it
And they'll abuse you for it. Nay, though they see
Distraction brought unto their very doors,
They'll look on it, and not know it till they feel it,
And then will tamely kiss the Rod that whipped 'em.
A Nation proud and Arrogant as the Beggar,
That when he has got a Bonnet 'bove his wearing,
Will scarce bow to the Giver. All the service
They ever did this Nation was to help
The people eat their victuals, and share their fortunes.

They are good for nought, but to eat, louze, and sleep,
And stink a street up. Tell you stories of
Don Iohn of Austria, the Magull, great Cham,
Their valour at Madril, Levant, or where
You will, and this in some blind Chimney Corner
In fume and smoke, roused up with lanted Ale,
'Till that their faces do resemble the Towns
They set on fire; And yet dare not encounter
A Rat or Weesell.

-- Yet the world reports
Them, men for siege the best, and can endure
The greatest hardship.

Very true, if they
May but lie still they'll feed on one another,
Rather than venture on their Enemy
To get the least Provision, and indeed
The worst will serve their turn, for they are men
Loves any thing but beating, yet they'll take
That too if need be; take'em down a little,
And you may fillip dead a score of them.
It is a shame the English should become
Such mules to such base burdens; I'm resolved
To turn the Chance o'th'Dy that favours them,
Though to the hazard of my being.

-- 'Twill
Be taken a piece of service fit for Chronicle,
And you shall want no furtherance.

If I bring not
The Soldier, Doctors, and their Crew of Cheaters
As tamely to be hanged as puppy Dogs,
Let me recelve no credit from you after.

Sir, though I hate your Bulls, and your Decoyes,
And know you have two ends to all your ways;
I fear you not, for Truth will show her self
Inspight of all the clouds you cast upon her.

You are in th'right. Truth will appear, and that
To th'shame of your trimmed Covenant; for though
She be but plain, she is more glorious
Than all the gloss and Colours that sets forth
That new devise, Created to deceive
Poor simple people, and at last your selves.

These are but bandying, I'll pursue my wager.

I'll venture ten pound more you're lost in weight.

You'll lose your self sir with your confidence.

Bar treachery and I care not.

I cannot endure this fighting Coz, a Dad.

Pox take your Dad; is that an Oath for a Gentleman?
A Lad at ten swears more profoundly; you'll
Be quarrelling, and then you dare not fight;
As though I were a wall of Steel or Brass,
To stand betwixt you, and receive the Darts
Cast at you; Sir, why did your Cowship send
An Answer to your Challenge, if you found
Your blood so Cool and Phlegmatic?

'Twas your doing, -- I had not had the heart else.

For preservation of your honour sir
Could you do less than Answer him?

What was he
That brought the Challenge?

Pinckcarcase by name.

A devilish name, and full of devilish ends;
This fighting is not lawful; prithee Coz
Take up the matter, I have little maw to it.

What, now the Hostage Reputation
Is past, will you Recant, Reneage, Revoke,
Recoil, Revert? stand to your Principles.

I shall not stand an inch of ground believe me.

'Tis pity you are worth any; let me see,
How shall we do it with Honour?

'Tis no matter
For that thing Honour; let her walk alone,
I don't desire her Company on such terms,
Sweet Coz, sweet Coz.

Let me see -- I'm resolved
That you shall fight him.

Coz, I had forgot
I swear, a strange infirmity, that is
I zound when as I hear a Gun shot off*
And tremble at a Pistols, all my senses
Become as useless.

Why, 'twas your own motion.

No matter, 'tis but so much charges lost,
I will not fight with Bullets, I've more conscience.

Why, then you must prepare a Case of Rapiers,
For Townshift and my self, ours are grown dull
With often usage.

Oh, the better Coz!
They'll do less mischief.

Then your fencing Master
Must make you at your Chamber fit for the field.

That's past his skill I'm sure; more charges Coz.

It cannot be avoided, if you mean
To fight on foot, and put off your Horse combat.

In my mind 'tis horse-play to fight on foot;
But hark you Coz, don't you make winking at
That Weapon ye call sharp, I'm not so set.

Fie, winking, No, how will you see to hit him;

No matter so he hit not me; but may not I
Bar Points being the Challenged?

That's base, and Player-like.

I'd rather play so, than work otherwise.

Come, come, resolve, you know the time draws near.

I would it did not, I love not to think on it;
Can we throw nothing in Times-way to make
Him stumble, and stop a little.

Resolve upon your weapon ere he be
Furnished with horse and Pistols.

I'll lay my life he's that already, then
'Twill be unworthy in you to --

Good sir, talk not to me of Worthies, my Father was none of the Nine; he ne'er
kept Company with your Huffs, nor Puffs; be could drink in a Tavern and ne'er
quarrel about the Reckoning; he lived without knocks, and died in the love of
his Parish.


But he has left a quarrelsome son behind
Must pay for all.

I shall not stand much upon
That point, so I may be discharged from beatings;
Methinks a skin set out with Eyelet holes
Appears not handsome, nor a face to be
Painted with black and blew, I hate those colours.

What will you give him shall take up the business without loss to your honour?


A man cannot lose
That which he never had; My Father was
A man of Bags, and might have been a Knight
When Knighthoods went a begging.

But to the matter,
What say you to my proposition?

Troth,
It sounds well, let me see now what in Conscience
You will demand?

But twenty pieces.

So;
To save a man from beating, very good I
How many such do ye meet with in the year?

Hundreds, hundreds sir.

Men must live Coz, men must live.

Any where but on me (good Coz;) but sir,
Before my Coz here, I'll give you ten.

Ten is too little in all conscience Coz.

Consider sir the danger.

And the Charge
Already I've been for horse and Pistols;
But those I hope you will return me, when
The peace is made.

Not one, expect not one,
They are forfeit Goods to us Lords of the Soil.

'Tis true, you've been at charges, and for that
Reason I'll undertake it at your rate;
Forbib, but I should bear a Conscience too.
Meet us at the Mairmaid.

At the hour of twelve.

The precise time.

Cozen, he will deserve it.

Would I had his Art
To live by when I and my fortunes part.

He is the Challenged, and justly may
Design the way of fighting, and the Place;
But though you have provided us with Horses,
Swords, Pistols, and so forth, yet there's a thing
Called money, we do want, put case he should
Fall by your hand, in what a case were we?

Suppose that you should fail;
-- I, there's the Danger.

We must fly for it, and that we cannot do
Conveniently, without a sum, the Oratory
Of Silver makes our passage free and safe,
The want of it detains us; open, open
Your close-mouth'd bags, and let them speak to us.

Troth Gentlemen, I'll tell you, and I lie not,
You have got a hoarsenesse since they came to Town,
And speak so low, a man can hardly hear 'em.

One Mortgage sir will raise their voice again.

Well, well, he might have taken another way
To work; had I been he, and he been me,
I would have asked him Mercy.

But you see
He is a man of spirit, spirit, sir!

I would he had no more then I, a gnat
Is better furnished; I have heard my Mother
Protest, and solemnly, I had a heart
No bigger than a hazell Nut.

-- Why, saw she't?

No, but she felt it; 'tis an imperfection
In Nature I can't help, and 'tis as cold
I warrant as a Cucumber.

And rises
So little in your stomach!

Troth, as little
As may be sir; how shall I heat it Gentlemen?

Drink wine and Drab.

Why, so I do you know;
Yet when the flame of drinking's o'r, I fall
Into the Noose of Taverns, like a Pigeon.

Only then y'ad best fight when you're drunk.

And so.
Be hanged when I am sober; no, I bear
Too great a Conscience.

If it be a burden
Too hard to bear, we'll teach you how to throw
It off, and live as we do without any.

Take up this quarrel Gentlemen, and have
My heart for ever.

What to do, to throw
The hounds ye starve? yet that so little, 'twill
Not be a mouthful; 'tis your money we
Value the most, let your heart go as't came.

Why, I shall mortgage next week.

Are you serious?
May we give credit to you?

I've occasion.

Thou shalt have more rather than want; my Buliy,
We are thy Guardians, who assaults our ward
Suffers, unless he be on a sure Guard.

BRed, those Anglish are Deeles, we're awe lost men; Awe oour knavery is oout, nen

A sirs, a sirs, geod feith wees meant no bad.


What Mr Doctors! have we found ye? who can cure the Citizen of his head ach
but the Scotch Doctors? who their wives of the Tooth-ach but the Scotch
Doctors? the Scotch Doctor is all in all, the Kirk will take no Physic but of
the Scotch Doctor; the Country will be cheated by none but by the Scotch
Doctor; the Court and Gentry will be begger'd by none but the beggarly Scotch
Doctors; come away and be hanged.


Mercy sirs, Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.


Hawd, hawd, hawd sir.


Nay, I don't intend
To take the advantage of you as I may,
I owe a greater honour to true valour;
I have heard Nobly of your Countrymen,
And therefore to assure my self Report
Lies not, I have exposed my Person to
This single hazard.

A sir* I dee leov you.

And I shall love you too, if that I find
You prove as Gallant as you've spoke your self:
Consider what dependences are on you,
Whom you've involved by your large promises
To this Engagement; let them see you dare
Do something for their money.

Be me saw sir
You're a mickle Gallant mon, Ise thra me swerd an heart at your non feet sir.


That's base, not Souldierlike; submissiveness
In this Case speaks you Coward, and if so,
My breath has been ill spent; what, will you fight?

Not a neustye sir, geod feith I leove a Anglish mon wy awe my heart. A sir, A
sir, send awe reight, send awe reight -- her tack me weppon, Ise your non
Prisoner sir geod feith.


Since thou art so base,
And not fit for a Noble Treaty, take
This, this, and this.

A geod sir, use me like a Gentlemen.

A Gentleman, a Swineheard, hangye, go,
The Bubbles broke, the wind gave Being to.
You're welcome Gentlemen, show a Room there Boy.

Sirrah, there will some Gentlemen ask for us,
Direct 'em hither.

I shall sir; what's your wine?

Sack, Boy, the quickening sack; and such Tobacco
As may inspire a spirit into clay,
Quick, and as sharpe as lightning.

Oh good sir,
I can't endure to think upon a storm;
Talk not of lightning, it does bode some quarrelling;
The calmest language is the best, when there's
A peace intended.

Here they come; now Coz
For your honour seem somewhat averse
To an agreement; carry your self stoutly,
With an unalter'd Countenance.

'Tis not in
The power of humane frailty.

-- Gallants, welcome;
You're men I see for Credit.

What must I say?

Carry your self manly.

What would I give now for an Inch of manhood;
How he does eye me; would I had a look
But half so piercing, I'd encounter then
With Basilisks; It carries daggers in it
Will penetrate a Coat of Male; there is
No safety but in distance.

How he looks at me!
With such a hungry countenance, as though
He meant to satisfy himself upon me;
But if he knew but what a piece of flesh
He had to deal with, he would not be so greedy;
I was not cut out for a Royster; sure
Nature ne'er meant me for the field, unless
To call my Cattle home, or try my hounds.
I am so great an enemy to a sword
I wear none when I ride; Oh, how yon fellow
Would spurn me, like a Mushrome, could he get
Me but alone; but he shall be hanged first.

What, all this while and speak not to each other?
Why, you have hearts of Oak: Not bow, dear Coz!

I cannot help it.

Come, we must have you friends.

With all my heart sir.

How's this? the man's bewitched;
See what the Gold can do!

If you please sir, I am your humble servant.

And what say you Coz?

Hum, I smelt, 'tis so,
The fellow is a Coward on my life.
Are they not all so? 'tis a blessing then.

Come sir, our friend is willing to pass by
All the affronts you gave him, if you'll wave
His Challenge.

I'll wave nothing but my Sword
Against my Enemy.

Shall we be friends?

A friendly blood runs not yet currant in me;
Be challenged by a dunghill Cock? I scorn it.

Why, this is rare! Coz, I'll spit in thy mouth.

Sir, 'tis your friends desire as well as ours
To prevent bloodshed.

-- Let such things as you,
That dare not waste their blood be sparing on it;
For my part, I'll not value if he Tap
From me a Pailefull.

Who the Devil Conjured
Up such a spirit in him?

Your friend's grown --
Take him down, or by this light
I'll kick him.

Pough, let me alone for that.

The Gentleman grows angry, I'll be gon.

Hang him, a Coward, a mere Coward, friend*

How, a coward! he speaks not like one;
I would his hands were tied behind him, I
Would make a trial on it; but he has teeth
Strong as the tusks of Boars, and legs more stiff
And big then any Bedspost, I should do
no good upon him.

Come Coz, throw
Your Ranting habit off, the Scene of War
Is past, and now put on your Robe of Amity,
The Bride-garment of Peace.

-- Peace! who shall peace?
'Tis sauciness to tell me so.

How's this!
You worm! 'slight, if I lay my hands
Upon you once, I'll tear you into nothing*
You Cowardly simple Puppy. Sir, I'll --

Not so loud good Coz;
You know I have but follow'd your directions.

Be hanged, and overdone it, had not you sirrah?
The Gentlemen shall know you have not spirit
To look a Cat in th'face, if that you be not
More sociable.

-- Good Cozen, I'll do any thing.

Well, I have brought him to it with much ado;
Here, shake hands, sir; you must be friends.

Well, if I must, I must, patience is a virtue,
And I'll embrace it -- I am your friend sir.

I shall never be your foe sir.

So said, and so done sir, will do well.

The Rascal acts it handsomely.

To your credit:
Ours is the silliest Rogue.

Boy, more wine;
Would we had Music here to celebrate
This Nuptial.

I will send for some.

Do so; come, here's to the Married Couple.

I do believe we both can't got a Boy
Will prove a Soldier.

Ah sirrah, are you there?

I am your own man sin.

Let's have a good Air, but drink first.

Drink about Gallants, what the Music dulls you;
Hast e're a new song fellow?

Yes, of the Scots coming into England.

That, that by all means.

Please you to hear me -- 'tis but a Ballad put to
One of their own tunes.

The better, the better, let's hear't.

Ha, ha, ha! it's good enough for the subject,

Drink about, drink about; More wine Boy;
Here Witwud to thee.

Let's discharge the Music.

With all my heart.

There ye Rascals.

Thank you Gentlemen.

Trapheire to thee.

Let it come, a Pint and thou dare.

Art mad, Trapheire is drunk enough, he will be
Not'company for a Dog immediately.

To your Mightiness sir.

I shall pledge your Highness sir -- to you sir.

Excuse me pray sir, I am almost spent.

Not pledge me!

No, he shall not pledge you sir;
What then? he is my friend.

But why should he
Be more excused then ours? will you drink for him?

Not, neither sir.

Then he shall pledge me sir.

He shall not sir.

Nay Trapheire, what dost mean?

Hang him turd -- Are you good at that sir?
I shall return you Answer by this Messenger.

Good Coz no fighting; I will drink a Gallon
Rather than lose one drop of blood -- It is
Too precious for the floor to drink.

Gentlemen your noise has drawn Soldiers into the house, th'a^e coming up; as
many as can get into that little Closet,


I would not be in custody for a Million;
The Rode, the Rode --

That's all our faults, in, in.

Where shall we be?

Where's all these Huffs -- what you two make this noise? hurl Pots, break
Glasses, you are youths indeed; Is this a time of night for you to rant in?
come you must with us.


Nay good Gentlemen.

Gentlemen, you may come forth, the coast is clear.


Where's the two Gentlemen?


They have taken 'em with 'em.


Did they pay the Reckoning.


No sir.


A pox upon you, why did you not aske'em for it?


I durst not sir, for fear they should say, the rest of their Company was
above.


'Tis right, the Devil's on it, this was your doing Trapheire, Will you pay the
Reckoning now?


Not a penny, I'll keep unto my Oath, throw who shall dip or pay if you will.


Here's Dice, throw -- twelve, hang ye Rascal


Mine is the worst.


But mine's the worst of all -- Sirrah Boy will you take this Cloak for your
Reckoning?


I know not sir whether I shall or not.


You shall not sir, now, you know, as long as such Spankers last; what's to
pay?


But thirty shillings sir.


Death! but thirty says thou? well, there 'tis;
I shall be even with some body.

Why, this was handsome Trapheire.

Make room for the Magistrates;
The Prisoners
There --

Which are
The Prisoners?

These sir.

Mercy, mercy, Master Judge.

What are those?

The subjects on the which these Villains practised their subtilties and
deceits; first, I shall tender my Charge against 'em, then produce my evidence.


Very well, very well, proceed.

In brief (Sir) then they have infected most
Part of this Nation; here's a thing,
A man of Reputation once, and bore
A place amongst you.

I do pity him.

And now is fit for no place except Bedlam:
Here is another, a man you would think
The Devil could not work upon, and yet
These Scotch ones have. The Lawyer, father of
Contrivances, is noosed in one himself;
He cannot stand without his Crutches, and
His head's so light his nose is every minute
Ready to touch the ground.

What is that Gentleman?

Do you conceive him one? have they left ought
Upon him like a Creature? may we swear
He is a perfect man, no Ghost? 'tis hard.
The hurryings he has had with sleepless eyes,
Continual Purgations, Bleedings, what not,
That they could but invent to bring him low;
He's all's left of a Courtier, and deserves
Your pity; there's no double doors betwixt
His heart now, and your eyes; he's so transparent
You may see through him. Tis not these alone
You have brought to this, but all the Country people,
Both Common sort, and Gentry.

What say you for yourselves?

Mercy, mercy, mercy, wees leove tha Anglish mickle we'll.


Yes, it appears so; we'll requite your Loves,
But cannot say, with your own Coin, because
You never were worth any, but wee'le find
A way to pay you home.

When they had thus
Spread their infection, they begin to think
Their safety would not last without the Soldier;
And to that end and purpose does persuade
The giddy People, which they had before
Distempered, with their Poisons, to receive
This man of Feather, as their grand Protector:
They take him, and to Covenant they go;
Two hundred thousand pounds! (a sum would buy
Their Kingdom) must be raised and paid to them.

Very fine.

But mark sir the event,
I am resolved to open what they did
For all this Money.

'Twill do well indeed.

They gave a piece of Paper, in the which
Were strange things promised then, As if that all
The Courage of the world contracted were
In their, and but their Nation.

And what found you?

I now proceed to that; I found'um sir,
Like Bull-rushes, that tremble if the wind
But blow on them, they run and tumbled over
The necks of one another, like to tiles
A storm forces from houses tops; this any thing
But man, who owned the name of their Protector,
In the most abject'st manner, and beneath,
The Spirit of a man, threw at my feet.
His Sword, and himself too, on single terms,
Without a stroke; Scarefoole they call him, and
They must be Citizens or none that fear him;
A Rat shall make him run to his own Country.

Ise a Gentlemon sir, mind ye me? Ise gang toll me non
Contre wy awe me heart gif ye wul.

Not in such haste sir, we'll reserve you for
Another purpose -- take him hence to prison.

The faw Deele fire thot tong.

What think you sir that Paper, cost so much,
Is worth in weight? here's one will tell you sir.

I am a public Notary by profession,
And dare speak nothing but the truth; the wager
Past on this Gentleman's side, the Popes Bull weighed,
It down by much, the other was not worth
In weight a Penny loaf.

Ha, ha, ha!

But what make you here sir?

Not to do harm sir.

Stay not here upon
Your peril sir, your Bulls have too long tails.

I stay but for a wind sir.

I must confess we have been much deluded,
Cheated, and Cozened by these perjured Scots,
Under the show of zeal and honesty.

Hang 'em Rogues, they complain they are pillaged, you made 'em not bare
enough sirs, you should have taken their skins off too, they would have made
monsters of us, but truly my husband is a Natural man, and I am his own wife;
I hope you do not think we are otherwise than we should be.


I have a husband here too, help his head, he was a Man once, and I was a
Woman, as this Gentleman the Courtier knew well enough, but now I am no-body,
thank yo^ pick-purses; Pray spare 'em not, I'm sure they would not spare me
when time was, do what I could.


Take them hence, there will be order shortly
To pack 'em to some foreign parts, they are
But Caterpillars, and what place so ever
They come at will be the worse for it; take 'em hence.

A mercy, mercy, mercy.

You have done Justice.

You've seen these Scots desected, Gentlemen,
And what d' you find 'em now to be, but Rascals?
Mere Mountebanks, that has instead of Cure
Bred strange Diseases, and distempers amongst you;
Jugglers, that looked you in the face, and told
You a fine tale, to keep your senses busy,
While they did pick your Pockets.

Our Pockets say you sir? I, and something else too, could
They have come at it; but soft, soft, two words to a bargain.

Master Smallfaith, we shall do what lies in us,
Upon your Recantation, to bring
You into favour with the Common Wealth,
And seat you as before, as Capable
Of her Preferment.

I thank you.

Blessing on your hearts.

We make the same profession sir to you,
On the like terms. You may do much
Upon the giddy People, by the example
Of your own Reformation.

Sir, I shall
Do what befits an honest man (abused)
And servant to the Common Wealth.

And you sir,
Are not exempted here the benefit
Of favour if you will take hold of it.

I thank you.

I, and hold it fast husband; had I a good thing to handle, I'd make much on it
a long time I warrant you.


As for these Gentlemen here, Master Downfall,
And Master Worn-out, we shall do our best
To set the one upon his legs again;
And restore the other, though not to his full
Ability, yet to a health contentable.

We are your servants.

When all our minds and hearts are firmly knit,
Let the Scot do his worst, by Sword or Wit.
