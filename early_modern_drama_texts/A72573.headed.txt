THe Father and founder of faith and felicity,
That our fassioun formed to his similitude
And his Soon our Saviour scheild in necessity,
That bocht ow from baillis ranson rude,

The halie Gaist governor and grounder of grace
Of wisdom and weilfair baith fontaine and flude,
Gif ow all that I sie seasit in this place,
And scheild ow from sin.
And with his Spreit ow inspyre
Till I have shawin my desire
Silence Sovereign I require
For now I begin,
Take tent to me my friends and hald ow coy,
For I am sent to ow as messingeir,
From an nobill and rycht redoubtit Roy:
The quhilk hes been absent this money eir.
Humanity give e his name wald speir:
Quha bade me shaw to ow but variance,
That he intendis amang ow to compeir,
With an triumph and awful ordinance:
With crown and sword and sceptre in his hand,
Temperit with mercy quhen penitence appeiris:
Howbeit that he lang time hes been sleipand,
Quhairthrow misreull hes rung their money eiris:
That innocentis hes been brocht on thair beiris,
Be falls reporteris of this natioun:
Thocht young oppressouris at the elder leiris,
Be now assurit of reformatioun.
Sie no misdoeris be sa bald,
As to remain into this hold:
For quhy be him that Iudas sauld
Thay will be heich hang it.
Now faithful folk for joy may sing:
For quhy it is the just bidding
Of my soveraine lord the king
That na man be wrangit.
Thocht he an quhyll into his flouris
Be gouernit be vylde trompouris:
And sumtyme lufe his paramouris,
Hold e him excusit.
For quhen he meittis with Correctioun,
With Verity and Discretioun,
Thay will be banisched aff the toun,
Quhilk hes him abusit.
And heir be oppin proclamatioun,
I wairne in name of his magnificence,
The thrie estaitis of this natioun,
That thay compeir with detfull diligence?
And till his grace make thair obedience.
And first I wairne the Spritualitie,
And sie the burgessis spair not for expense:
Bot speid thame heir with Temporalitie.
Als I beseik ow famous auditouris,
Conveinit in this congregatioun,
To be patient the space of certain houris,
Till e have hard our short narratioun.
And als we make ow supplicatioun,
That na man take our wordis intill disdain:
Althocht e hear be declamatioun,
The common-weill richt pitiouslie complain.
Rycht so the virtuous lady Verity,
Will make an piteous lamentatioun:
Als for the treuth sho will impresonit be,
And banischit lang time out of the toun:
And Chastity will make narratioun,
How sho can get na ludging in this land,
Till that the heauinlie king Correctioun,
Meit with the king and commoun hand for hand.
Prudent peopill I pray ow all,
Take na* man grief in special:
For we sall speik in general,
For pastime and for play.
Thairfoir till all our rymis berung,
And our mistoinit sangis be sung,
Leteuerie man keip weill an tongue,
And every woman tway.

O Lord of Lords and King of kingis all,
Omnipotent of power Prince but peir,
Ever ringand in gloir Celestial
Quha be great micht and haising na mateir
Maid heauin and eird, fire, air and watter cleir:
Send me thy grace with peace perpetual,
That I may rewll my realm to thy pleaseir,
Syne bring my saull to joy angelical.
Sen thow hes giuin me dominatioun
And rewll of pepill subject to my cure,
Be I nocht rewlit be counsall and ressoun,
In dignity I may nocht lang endure.
I grant mystait my self may nocht assure
Nor it conserve my life in sickernes:
Have pity Lord on me thy creature
Supportand me in all my business.
I thee requeist quha rent was on the Rude,
Me to defend from the deids of defame:
That my pepill report of mebot good,
And be my saifgaird baith from sin and shame*
I know my day is induris bot as an dream,
Thairfoir O Lord I hairtlie the exhort,
To gif me grace to use my diadeame
To thy pleasure and to my great comfort.

My Sovereign Lord and Prince but peir,
Quhat garris ow make sic dreirie cheir*
Be blithe sa lang as ear heir,
And pas time with pleasure:
For als lang leifis the mirrie man,
As the sorry for ocht he can:
His banis full sair Sir sall I ban
That dois ow displeasure.
Sa lang as Placebo and I,
Remains into our company,
our grace sall leif richt mirrely:
Of this haif e na dout.
Sa lang as e have us in cure*
our grace sir sall want na pleasure:
War Solace heir I ow assure,
He wald rejoice this rout.

Good brother mine quhair is Solace
The mirror of all mirrines,
I have great marvel be the Mes
He taries sa lang.
Bide he away we are bot shent,
I ferlie how he fra us went:
I trow he hes impediment
That lettis him nocht gang.

I left Solace that same greit loun
Drinkand into the burrows toun,
It will cost him half of an croun,
Althocht he had na mair.
And als he said he wald gang see
Fair lady Sensuality,
The burial of all beauty
And portratour preclair.

Be God I see him at the last
As he war chaist rynnand richt fast,
He glowris euin as he war aghast
Or fleyit of an gaist.
Na, he is wod drunkin I trow,
Se e not that he is wod fow:
I ken weill be his creischie mow
He hes been at an feast.

Now quha saw ever sic an thrang?
Me thocht sum said I had gain wrang,
Had I help I wald sing an sang
With an rycht mirrie noise.
I have sic pleasour at my hart,
That garris me sing the troubill pairt:
Waldsum good fallow sill the quart
It wald my hairt rejoice.
Howbeit my coat be short and nippit,
Thankis be to God I am weill hippit
Thocht all my gold may shone be grippit
Intill an penny purse.
Thocht I an seruand lang haif been,
My purchais is nocht worth an preine:
I may sing Peblis on the greine
For ocht that I may tursse.
Quhat is my name can e not guess,
Sirs ken e nocht Sandy solace?
Thay callit my mother bonie Bess
That dwelt between the bowis.
[] Of twelf eir auld sho learnit to swyfe,
Thankit be the great God on live:
Scho maid me fatheris four or five,
But dout this is na mowis.
Quhen an was deid sho gat an other,
Was never man had sic an mother:
Of fatheris sho maid me an further,
Of law it men and leirit:
Scho is baith wise, worthy and wicht*
For scho spairis nouther kuik nor knycht:
ea four and twenty on an nicht,
And ay thair eine schobleirit,
And gif I lie sirs e may speir:
Bot saw e nocht the King cum heir?
I am an sportour and playfeir
To that Royal young King:
He said he wald within schort space
Cum pas his time into this place:
I pray the Lord to send him grace,
That he lang time may ring.

Solace quhy taryit e sa lang?

The fiend a faster I micht gang:
I micht not thrist out throw the thrang,
Of wife's fyftein fidder:
Then for to rin I tuik an rink,
Bot I felt never sik an stink:
For our lordis luif gif me an drink,
Placebo my deir brother.

My servant Solace quhat gart ow tarry?

I wait not sir be sweit saint Marie,
I have been in an feirie farie
Or ellis intill an trance:
Sir I have scene I ow assure
The fairest earthly creature,
That ever was formit be nature
And may for to advance*
To luik on her is great delyte,
With lippis reid and cheikis quhyte
I wald renunce all this world quyte
For till stand in her grace:
Scho is wantoun and scho is wise:
And cled scho is on the new gyse,
It wald garall our flesche up rise
To luik upon her face.
War* I an king it sold be kend,
I sold not spair on her to spend:
And this same nicht for her to send,
For my pleasure:
Quhat rak of our prosperity*
Gif e want Sensuality?
I wald nocht gif an silly fly,
For our treasure.

Forsuith my friends I think e are not wise,
Till counsall me to break commandment
Directit be the Prince of Paradyce:
Considering e know that my intent
Is for till be to God obedient,
Quhilk dois forbid men to be lecherous:
Do I nocht sa perchance I will repent,
Thairfoir I think our counsall odious
The quhilk e gaif me till.
Because I have been to this day
Tanquam tabula rasa: That is als mekill as to say.
Ready for good and ill.

Believe e that we will begyll ow,
Or from our vertew we will while ow,
Or with evil counsall overseyll ow,
Both into good and evil:
To take our graces part we grant
In all our deidis participant,
Sa that e be nocht an young sanct
And syne an auld devil.

Believe e Sir that Lechery be sin,
Na, trow nocht that, this is my ressoun quhy,
First at the Romance Kirk will e begin
Quhilk is the lemand lamp of lechery:
Quhair Cardinals and Bischops generally
To luif Ladies thay think an pleasant sport,
And out of Rome hes baneist Chastity
Quha with our Prelats can get na resort.

Sir quhill e get an prudent Queine,
I think our Majesty serein
Sold have an lusty Concubein,
To play ow withal:
For I know be our quality,
e want the gift of chastity
Fall to in nomine Domini,
This is my counsall.
I speik Sir under protestatioun,
That nane at me haif indignatioun:
For all the Prelats of this natioun,
For the may part:
Thay think na schame to have an huir,
And sum hes thrie under thair cuir:
This to be true I'll ow assuir
e sall heir efterwart.
Sir knew all the matter throch
To play e wald begin
Speir at the Monks of Bamirrinoch,
Giflecherie be sin.

Sir send e for Sandy solace*
Orells our moneoun Wantonness,
And pray my Lady Priores,
The suith till declair:
Gif it be sin to take Kaity,
Or to leif like an bummill baty
The buik sayis Omnia probate
And nocht for to spair.

Luifers awalk behald the fury spheir,
Behauld the natural dochter of Venus:
Behauld luifers this lusty Lady cleir
The fresche fonteine of Knichtis amorous
Repleit with ioyis dulce and delicious^
Or quha wald make to Venus observance.
In my mirthful chalmer melodious?
Thair sall thay find all pastime and pleasance.
Behauld my heid behauld my gay attire,
Behauld my halse lusum and lily quhite:
Behauld my visage flammand as the fire
Behauld my papis of portratour perfyte.
To luke on me lufferis hes greit delyte,
Rycht sa hes all the Kings of Christindome:
To thame I haif done pleasouris infinite,
And specially unto the Court of Rome.
An kis of me war worth in an morning
A milioun of gold to Knicht or King.
And it I am of nature sa towart
I lat no luiffer pas with an sair hart.
Of my name wald e wit the verity,
Forsuith thay call me Sensuality.
I hold it best now or we farther gang,
To Dame Venus let us go sing an sang.

Madame but tarrying,
For to serve Venus deir,
We sall fall to and sing,
Sister Danger cum neir.

Sister I was nocht sweir
To Venus observance,
Howbeit I make Dangeir:
it be continuance,
Men may have thair pleasance:
Thairfoir let na man fray,
We will take it perchance,
Howbeit that we say nay.

Sister cum on our way,
And let us nocht think lang:
In all the haist we may,
To sing Venus an sang.

Sister sing this sang I may not,
Without the help of good Fund-Ionet:
Fund-Ionet, hoaw cum take a part.

That sall I do with all my hart:
Sister howbeit that I am hais,
I am content to beir a bais.
e two sold luif me as our life,
[]e know I lernit ow baith to swyfe:
In my chalmer e wait weill quhair,
Sen syne the fiend an man e spair.

Fund-Ionet, fie, e are to blame,
To speik foull wordis think e not schame?

Thair is an hundredth heir sitand by
[]That luifis geaping als weill as I,
Micht thay get it in privity:
Bot quha begins the sang let se.

Up Wantonness thow sleipis to lang,
Me thocht I hard an mirrie sang:

Se quhat on mirth may meine.

I trow Sir be the Trinity
on same is Sensuality,
Gif it be scho sun sall I sie
That Soverance sereine.

Qu hat war thay on to me declair?

Dame Sensual baith good and fair.

Sir scho is mekill to advance,
For scho can baith play and dance:
That perfyt patron of plesance
An perle of pulchritude:
Soft as the silk is her quhite lyre,
Her hair is like the goldin wyre:
My hart burnis in an flame of fire
I sweir ow be the Rude.
I think scho is sa wonder fair,
That in earth scho hes na compair,
War e weill leirn it at luifis lair
And syne had her anis scene:
I wait be cokis passioun,
e wald make supplicatioun,
And spend on her an millioun
Her lufe for till obtain.

Quhat say e sir are e content,
That scho cum heir incontinent:
Quhat vails our kingdom and our rent,
And all our great treasure:
Without e haif an mirrie life,
And cast aside all sturt and strife*
And sa lang as e want an wife,
Fall to and take our pleasure.

Gif that be true quhilk e me tell,
I will not langer tarry:
Bot will gang preif that play my sell,
Howbeit the world me wary.
Als fast as e may carry,
Speid with all diligence:
Bring Sensuality,
Fra-hand to my presence.
Forsuth I wait not how it stands,
Bot sen I hard of our tythands,
My body trimblis feit and hands
And quhiles is hait as fire:
I trow Cupido with his dart,
Hes woundit me out* throw the hart
My spreit will fra my body part,
Get I nocht my desire.
Pas on away with diligence,
And bring her heir to my presence:
Spair nocht for travel nor expense*
I cair not for na cost:
Pason our way schone Wantonness,
And take with ow Sandy solace,
And bring that Lady to this place,
Or else I am bot lost.
Commend me to that sweitest thing,
And present her with this same Ring*
And say I lie in languisching,
Except scho make remeid:
With siching sair I am bot schent,
Without scho cum incontinent,
My heavy lang our to relent,
And saif me now fra deid.

Or e tuik skaith be Gods goun,
[]I lever thair war not up nor down
An tume cunt into this toun,
Nor twenty mile about.
Doubt e nocht Sir, bot we will get her,
We sall be feirie for till fetch her,
Bot faith we wald speid all the better,
Till gar our purses rout*

Sir let na sorrow in ow sink,
Bot gif us Ducats for till drink:
And we sall never sleip an wink
Till it be back or eadge:

Beir e that bag upon our lunie,
Now sirs win weill our wage;

Till our days wark be done:
Fairweill for we are at the flicht,

Thocht we marche with the Moan.

Pastime with pleasace greit prosperity

In faith I trow we be at the farrest.

Quhat is our name I pray ou Sir declair?

Quhat King is that quhilk hes sa gay a boy?

Quhilk dois commend him to ow hartfullie
And sends ow heir an ring with an Ruby
In takin that abuife all creator

He bade me say that he will be bot deid,
Without that e make haistelie remeid.

How can I help him althocht he suld for fair*

Till his seiknes micht be greit comforting,
And als he makes ow supplicatioun,
This nicht to make with him collatioun.

I thank his grace of his benevolece,
Good sirs I sall be ready evin fra hand:
In me thair ^all be fund ^a negligence,
Baith nicht day quhen his grace will demand,
Pas e befoir and say I am cummand,
And thinks richt lang to haif of him an sicht:
And I to Venus do make an faithful band,
That i^ his arms I think to lie all nicht.

Take thair an gay gamond of France:
Am I nocht worthy till advance?

And that sa speedily can rin,
To tyst my master unto sin,
The fiend a penny he will win
Of this his marriage.
[]I few richt sair be sanct Michell,

For quhy on King be Bryds bell
Kennis na mair of an cunt:
Nor dois the noueis of an freir:

Fie that I am sa blunt.

Gif e think that sho thinks shame the hyd ye bairnseine
[] With her taill, tent her weil, e wait quhat I meine:

And I sall leirne ow all kewis how to do.

God forbid Wantonness that I gif the leife,
Thou art over perilous an page sic practiks to preife.

Now Sir preife as e pleis, I se her command,
Use our self gravely, we sall by ow stand.

O Queen Venus unto thy Celsitude,
I gif gloir, honour, laud and reverence:
Quha grantit me sic perfect pulchritude,
That Princes of my person have pleasance.
I make an vow with humbill observance,
Richt reverently thy Tempill to visie,
With sacrifice unto thy Dyosie.
Till every stait I am so greabill,
That few or nane refuses me at all:
Paipis, Patriarks or Prelats venerabill,
Common pepill and Princes temporal,
Are subject all to me Dame Sensual.
Sa sall it be ay quhill the world endures
And specially quhair outhage hes the cures.
Quha knawis the contrair*
I traist few in this company,
Wald thay declair the verity,
How thay use Sensuality:
Bot with me makes repair.
And now my way I man advance,
Unto an Prince of great puissance,
Quhom young men hes in governance
Rolland into bis rage:
I am richt glaid I ow assure,
That potent Prince to get in cure:
Quhilk is of lustines the luir,
And greitest of curage.
O potent Prince of pulchritude preclair,

And Dame Venus mot keip our court fro cair
As I wald sho suld keip my awin hart-blud:

Welcum to me peirles in pulchritude,
Welcum to me thow sweiter nor the Lamber,
Quhilk hes maid me of all dolor denude,
Solace, convoy this Lady to my chamber.

I gang this gait with richt good will,
Sir Wantonness tarry e still:
And Hamelines the cap eis fill
And beir him cumpanie.
That sall I do withoutin dout,
And he and I sall play cap'out,

Now Lady len me that batye tout
Fill in for I am dry.
[] our dame be this trewlie,
Hes gotten upon the gumis
Quhat rak thocht e and I
Go iunne our iusting Lumis,

Content I am with good will,
Quhen ever e are ready:

Now weill said be our Lady,
He bair my Master cumpanie,
Till that I may endure:
Gif e be quisland wantounlie,
We sall fling on the flure.

Immortal God may of magnificence,
Quhais Majesty na Clark can comprehend:
Must save ow all that giuis sic audience,
And grant ow grace him never till offend,
Quhilk on the Croce did willingly ascend,
And sched his precious blude on every side:
Quhais piteous passioun from danger ow defend,
And be our gracious governor and gyde.
Now my good friends considder I ow beseik
The cause may principal of my cumming,
Princis or Potestatis are nocht worth an leik,
Be thay not gydit be my good governing:
Thair was never Empriour, Conqueror nor King,
Without my wisdom that micht thair will advance,
My name is Good Counsall without feineing,
Lords for lack of my lair are brocht to mischance.
Finally for conclusioun,
Quha halds me at delusioun:
Sall be brocht to confusioun:
And this I understand,
For I have maid my residence,
With hie Princes of greit puissance,
In Ingland, Italie and France,
And money other Land.
Bot out of Scotland wa alace,
Ihaifbene fleimit lang time space,
That garris our gyders all want grace
And die befoir thair day:
Because thay lychtlyit good counsall,
Fortune turnit on thame her saill,
Quhilk brocht this Realm to meikill baill,
Quha can the contrair say?
My Lords I came nocht heir to lie:
Wais me for King Humanity,
Ov erset with Sensuality,
In th'entrie of his ring:
Throw vicious counsel insolent,
Sa thay may get riches or rent,
To his weilfair thay take na tent,
Nor quhat sal be th'ending.
it in this Realm I wald make sum repair,
Gif I beleifit my name suld nocht forfair,
For wald this King be gydit it with ressoun,
And on misdoars make punitioun:
Howbeit I haif lang time been exyllit,

Sa till I se God send mair of his grace,

Make room sirs hoaw, that I may rin,
Lo se quhair I am new cum,

And I sall schaw ow of my newis.
Throuchout all Christindome I have past,
And am cum heir now at the last,
Tostit on sea ay sen uill day:
That we war fain to hew our Mast,
Nocht half an e mile beond the May.
Bot now amang ow I will remain,
I purpois never to sail again:
To put my life in chance of watter:
Was never scene sic wind and rain,
Nor of Schipmen sic clitter clatter.
Sum bade haill and sum bade standby,
On steirburd hoaw aluiff fie fie:
Quhill all the raipis beguith to rattil:
Was never Roysa fleyd as I,
Quhen all the sails played brittill brattill.
To se the waws it was an wonder,
And wind that raif the sails in sunder,
Bot I lay braikand like an Broke:
And shot sa fast above and under,
The Devil durst not cum neir my dok.
Now am I scapit fra that effray,
Quhat say e sirs am I nocht gay?
Se e not Flattery our awin fuill?
That eid to make this new array,
Was I not heir with ow at uill?

Quhair are my fallows that wald nocht fail?
We suld have cum heir for an cast.
Hoaw Falset hoaw. --

-- Wa sair the Devil
Quha is that that cryis for mesa fast

Quhy Falset brother knawis thou not me?
Am I nocht thy brother Flattrie?

Now welcome be the Trinity
This meitting cums for good
Now let me bresse the ^ my armis,
Quhen friends meits harts warmis:
Quod Iok that frelie fud:
How happinit ow into this place?

Now be my saul evin on a case.

Or ever I wist amang this sort.
Quhair is Dissait that limmer loun?

I left him drinkand in the toun,
He will be heir incontinent.

Now be the haly Sacrament,
Thay tydingis comforts all my hart:

He is richt crafty as e ken,
And counsallour to the Merchand-men:
Let us lie down heir baith and spy,

Stand by the gait that I maysteir,
Aisay Koks bons, how cam I heir?

Into sa greit an thrang:

Good faith I dar not schawit for schame:
Sen I was clekit of my Dame,

For Katie vnsell was my mother,
And common thief my father-brother:

Howbeit I can not steill.
Bot it I will borrow and len,
As be my cleathing e may ken;
That I am cum of nobill men,
And als I will debait,

And I dwell amang the merchands,

Bon-iour brother with all my hart,

Baith into good and evil:

And hid me in an bawburds bed:
[]Bot suddenly her schankis I sched*
With hoch hurland amang her howis*

And als I pray ow as my brother,

Bot I sall die or e be wrangit.

Marie sirs this is my counsall lo,
Till take our time quhill we may get it,
For now thait is na man to let it:
Fra time the King begin to steir him,

And diasagyse us that na man ken us,
Hes na man Clarkis cleathing to len us:
And let us keip grave countenance,
As we war new cum out of France.

Now be my saull that is weill deuysit*

And sa sall I man be the Rude,
Now sum good fallow len me an hude.

Now am I buskit and quha can spy,
The Devil stik me gif this be I:
If this be I or not, I can not weill say,
Or hes the Fiend or Fatie-folk borne me away,

And gif my hair war up in an how,

Quhat sayis thou of my gay garmoun*

I say thou luiks euin like an loun:
Now brother Flattery quhat do e,
Quhat kind of man schaip e to be?

Now be my faith my brother deir,
I will gang counterfit the Freir,

A Freir, quhairto e can nor preiche.

Quhat rak man I can richt weill fleich?
Perchance I'll cum that honour,
To be the Kings confessor.
Pure Freirs are free at any fealt,
And marchellit ay amang the best.
Als God to hes lent them sic graces,
That Bischops puts them in thair places:
Out-throw thair Dioceis to preiche,
Bot ferlie nocht howbeit thay fleich:
For schaw thay all the verity,
Thaill want the Bischops charity.
And thocht the corn war never sa scant,
The gudewyfis will not let Freirs want:
For quhy thay are thair confessors,
Thair heauinlie prudent counsalours.
Thairfoir the wyfis plainly taks thair parts,
And shawis the secreits of thair harts,
To Freirs with better will I trow,
Nor thay do to thair bed-fallow.

The fiend an saull I trow will ken me.

Now gang thy way quhair ever thow will,
Thow may be fallow to freir Gill:

For that matter I dreid nathing,

And Freiris will ready entries get,
Quhen Lords are haldin at the et.

For to begyll are hundredth Kingis.
For thow can richt weil crak and clatter,
And I sall feine, and thow sall flatter.

An drink to make us better hartit.

And I sall schaw the verity:

For money a craft sir do I can,

And I have greit intelligence
In quelling of the quintessence:
Bot to preif my experience,

To make multiplicatioun,
And take my obligatioun,

Hold us for very lownes.

Saw ever man sa quhyte an face:

Howbeit e dang down fyfteine hunder.

And quiet till we cum again:

Gif he dois sa he salbe slain,

Trowit I that he come for an train,
Of my freindis I sold raise an further.

I doubt full sair be God him sell,
That on auld churl be Gude-counsell:
Get he anis to the Kings presence,
We thrie will get na audience.

That matter I sall take on hand,
And say it is the Kings command,
That he anon devoid this place,
And cum nocht neir the Kings grace:
And that under the pain of tressoun:

Brother I hold our counsel ressoun.
Now let us heir quhat he will say,
Auld lyart beard, good day, good day.

Good day again sirs be the rude
The Lord mot make ow men of good.

Pray nocht for us to Lord nor Lady,
For we are men of good already,
Sir schaw to us quhat is our name?

Gude-counsell thay call me at home,

Quhat says thow carl, are thow Gude-counsell?
Swyith pak the soon unhappy vnsell.
Gif ever thou cum this gait again,
I vow to God thou sall be slain.

I pray ow sirs, gif me licence,
To cum anis to the Kings presence:
To speik bot two words to his grace,

Swyith horsune carl, devoid this place.

Brother I ken ow weill aneuch,
Howbeit e make it never sa teuch:
Flattrie, Dissait and Fals-report,
That will not suffer to resort:
Gude-Counsall to the Kings presence.

Suyith hursun carl gang pak the hence,
Gif ever thou cum this gait agane,
I vow to God thousall be slane.
Sen at this time I can get na presence,
Is na remeid bot take in patience.
Howbeit Gude-counsall haistelie be nocht hard
With young Princes it sold thay noch be skard.
Bot quhen outhheid hes blawin his wanton blast,
Then fall Gude-counsall rewll him at the last.

Now quhill Gude-Counsall is absent,
Brother we mon be diligent:
And make betwixt us sikker bands,
Quhen vacadns fallis in onie Lands.
That every man help weill his fallow,

I had deir brother be Alhallow.
Sa e fische nocht within our bounds,

That sall I noch be Gods wounds*
Bot I sall plainly take our partis,

Sa sall we thine with all our hartis.
Bot haist us quhill the King is young,
Let every man keip weill an tongue.
And in ilk quarter have an spy,
Us till adverteis haistelly,
Quhen any casualities,
Sall happin into our countries,
And let us make provisioun,
Or he cum to discretioun*
Na mair he waits now nor an sant,
Quhat thing it is to haif or want,
Or he cum till his perfyte age,
We sall be sikker of our wage:
And then let every carl craif other.

Yat mouth spcik mair my awin deir brother.
For God nor I rax in an raip,
Thow may gif counsall to the Paip.

Quhat gart ou bid sa lang fra my presence?
I think it lang since e depairtit thence.
Quhat man was on with an greit bostous beird
Me thocht he maid ow all thrie very feared.

It was an laidlie lurdan loun,
Cumde to break buithis into this toun:
We have ga^t bind him with an poill,
And send him to the theisis hoill:

Let him sit thair with an mischance,
And let us go to our pastance.

Better go revel at the rackat,
Or ellis go to the hurly hackat,
Or then to schaw our curtlie corsses,
Ga se quha best can rin thair horses.

Na soveraine or we farther gang
Gar Sensuality sing an sang.

Diligite Iustitiam qui iudicatis terram. Luif Justice e quha hes an Judges
cure,
In earth and dried the awful Judgment,
Of him that sall cum judge baith rich and pure,
Rycht terribilly with bludy wounds rent.
That dreidfull day into our harts imprent:
Beleuand weill* how and quhat manner e
Use Justice heir till vthers, thair at lenth
That day but doubt sa salle iudgit be.
Wo than and duill be to ow Princes all,
Suffer and the pure anes for till be oppressed:
In everlasting burn and fire e sall
With Lucifer richt dulfullie be dressed.
Thairfoir in time for till eschaip that nest,
Feir God, do law and Justice equally,
Till every man: se that na puir oppressed
Up to the hevin on ow an vengence cry.
Be just judges without favour or fead,
And hold the Balance euin till every wicht:
Let not the fault be left into the head,
Then sall the members reulit be at richt.
For quhy subjects do follow day and nicht
Thair governors in vertew and in vice.
e are the lamps that sold schaw them the licht
Lo leid them on this sliddrie ron of ice.
Mobile mutatur semper cum principe vulgus. And gif e wald our subiectis war
weill geuin,
Then verteouslie begin the dance our sell:
Going befoir* then they anon I wein,
Sall follow ow, either till heuin or hell:
Kings sold of good exempils be the well*
Bot gif that our strands be intoxicate,
In steid of wine thay drink the poison fell:
Thus pepill follows ay thair principate.
Sic luceat lux vestra coram hominibus, vt videant opera vestra bona. And
specially Princes of the Priests,
That of peopill hes spiritual cuir,
Daily sold revolue into our breistis,
How that their haly words are still may sure
In virtuous life gif that e do endure
The pepill will take mair tent to our deids
Then to our words: and als baith rich and puir
Will follow ow baith in our warks and words.
Gif men of me wald have intelligence,
Or know my name, thay call me VERITY.
Of Christis law I have experience,
And hes over saillit many stormy sey.
Now am I seikand King Humanity,
For of his grace I have good esperance,
Fra time that he acquaintit be with me,
His honour and heich gloir I sall advance.

Good day father, quhair have e been?
Declair till us of our novels.
Flattrie Thair is now lichtit on the grene,
Dame Verity, be Buiks and bells.
Bot cum scho to the Kings presence
Thair is na buit for us to bide.
Thairfoir I red us all go hence.

That will we nocht it be Sanct Bryde
Bot we sall ather gang or ride,
To Lords of Spritualitie,
And gar them trow on bag ofpryde,
Hes spokin manifest heresy.

O reverent fatheris of the Sprituall stait,
We counsall ow be wise and vigilant:
Dame Verity hes lychtit now of lait,
And in her hand beirand the Newtestament*
Be scho ressauit but doubt we are bot schent,
Let her nocht Judge thairfoir into this Land,
And this we reid ow do incontinent,
Now quhill the King is with his luif sleipand.

We thank ow friends of our benevolence,
It sall be done evin as e have devysit:
We think e serve an gudlie recompense,
Defendand us that we be nocht supprysit.
In this matter we man be weill aduysit,
Now quhill the King misknawis the verity,
Be scho ressauit then we will be deprysit,
Quhat is our counsel brother now let se?

I hold it best that we incontinent,
Gar hold her fast into Captivity:
Unto the third day of the Parliament
And then accuse her of her herisie:
Or than banische her out of this country,
For with the King gif Verity be knawin*
Of our greit gloir we will degradit be
And all our secreits to the commouns schawin.

es the King is it effeminate,
And gydit be Dame Sensuality,
Rycht sa with young counsall intoxicate,
Swa at this time e haif our liberty.
To take our time I hold it best for me,
And go destroy all their Lutherians:
In special on lady Verity,

Schir Person e sall be my commissair,
To put this matter till executioun*
And e sir Freir, because e can declair
The haill process, pas with him in commissioun,
Pas all togidder with my braid bennisoun,
And gifscho speiks against our liberty,
Then put her in perpetual presoun,
That scho cum nocht to King Humanity.

Lusty Lady we wald fain understand,
Quhat earand e haif in this Regioun?
To preich or teich quha gaif to ow command,
To counsall Kingis how gat e commissioun?
I dreid without e get an remissioun,
And syne renunce our new opiniones
The sprituall stait sall put ow to perditioun
And in the fire will burn ow flesche and bones.

I will recant nathing that I have schawin,
I have said nathing bot the verity:
Bot with the King fra time that I be knawin
I dreid e spaiks of Spritualitie*
Sall few that ever I came in this country
For gifthe Verity plainly war proclamit,
And specially to the Kings Majesty,
For our traditions e will be all defamit.

Quhat buik is that harlot into thy hand,
Out walloway, this is the New Test'ment,
In Englisch tongue, and printit in England,
Herisie, herisie, fire, fire incontinent.

Forsuith my friend e have an wrag judgment,
For in this Buik thair is na heresy:
Botour Christs word, baith dulce and redolent,
An springing well of sinceir verity.

Cum on our way for all our ealow locks
our vantoun words but doubt e sall repent:
This nicht e sall forfair an pair of stocks,
And syne the morn be brocht to thoill Judgment.

For our christs saik I am richt weill content
To suffer all thing that sall pleis his grace,
Howbeit e put an thousand to torment,
Ten hundredth thousand sall rise into thair place.
Get up, thow, thow sleipis all too lang, O Lord,
And make sum ressonabill reformatioun
On them that dois tramp down thy gracious word,
And hes an deidlie indignatioun
At them quha makes may true narratioun:
Suffer me not Lord mair to be molest,
Good Lord, I make the supplicatioun
With thy vnfreinds let me nocht be suppressed:
Now Lords do as e list,
I have na mair to say.

Sit down and take ow rest,
All nicht till it be day.

My Lord we have with diligence
Bucklit up weill on bledrand baird:

I think e serve good recompense,
Take thirten crowns for our rewaird.

The Prophecy of the Propheit Essay
Is practickit alace, on me this day:
Quha said the verity sold be trampit down
Amid the streit, and put in strange presoun.
His five and fifty chapter quha list luik,
Sall find their words writtin in his Buik.
Richt sa Sanct Paull wrytis to Timothie,
That men sall turn thair earis from verity.
Bot in my Lord God I have esperance,
He will provide for my deliverance.
Bot e Princes of Spirituality,
Quha sold defend the sinceir verity,
I dreid the plagues of Iohnes Revelatioun
Sall sal upon our generatioun.
I counsall ow this miss t'amend,
Sa that e may eschaip that fatal end.

How lang sall this inconstant world endure,
That I sold baneist be sa lang alace:
Few creatures or nane takis on me cure,
Quhilk gars me money nicht lie harbrieles.
Thocht I have past all eir fra place to place,
Amang the Temporal and Spiritual stairs:
Nor amang Princes I can get na grace,
Bot boustuouslie am halden at the etis.

Lady I pray ow schaw me our name,
It dois me no our lamentatioun,

My friend thair of I neid not to think shame,
Dame Chastity baneist from town to town.

Then pas to ladies of Religioun,
Quhilk makes thair vow to observe Chastity:
Lo quhair thair sits an Priores of renown,
Amangs the rest of Spritualitie.

I grant on Lady hes vowit Chastity,
For her professioun thairto sold accord:
Scho maid that vow for an Abesie,
Bot nocht for Christ Iesus our Lord.
Fra time that thay get thair vows, I stand for'd,
Thay banische her out of thair cumpanie,
With Chastity thay can make na concord
Bot leids thair lyfis in Sensuality,
I sall observe our counsall gif I may,
Cum on and heir quhat on Lady will say?
My prudent lusty Lastie Priores,
Remember how e did vow Chastity:
Madame I pray ow of our gentilnes,
That e wald pleis to haif of me pity:
And this an nicht to gif me harberie,
For this I make ow supplicatioun
Do e nocht sa Madame I dreid perdie,
It will because of depravatioun.

Pas hynd Madame, be Christ e cum nocht heir,
e are contrair to my cumplexioun:
Gang seik ludging at sum auld Monk or Freir,
Perchance thay will be our protectioun.
Or to Prelats make our progressioun,
Quhilks are obleist to ow als weill as I:
Dame Sensual hes geuin directioun
ow till exclude out of my company.

Gif e wald wit mair of the verity,
I sall schaw ow be sure experience,
How that the Lords of Sprituality,
Hes baneist me, alace, fra thair presence.
My Lords, laud, gloir, triumph and reverence,
Mot be unto our halie Sprituall stait:
I ow beseik of our benevolence,
To harbry me that am sa desolait**
* Lords I have past throw money uncouth schyre,
Bot in this Land I can get na ludgeing
Of my name gif e wald haif knawledging,
Forsuith my Lords thay call me Chastity,
I ow beseik of our graces bening.
Gif me ludging this nicht for charity.

Pas on Madame we know ow nocht
Or be him that the world wrocht,
our cumming sall be richt deir co^t
Gif e make langer tarry.

But doubt we will baith leif and die
With our luif Sensuality,
We will haif na mair deall with the,
Then with the Queen of Farie.

Pas home amang the Nunnis and dwell,
Quhilks are of Chastity the well:
I traist thay will with Buik and bell,
Ressaue ow in thair Closter.

Sir, quhen I was the Nunnis amang,
Out of thair dortour thay me dang,
And wald nocht let me bide sa lang,
To say my Pater noster.
I se na grace thairfoir to get,
I hold it best or it be lait,
For till go prove the Temporal stait
Gif thay will me resaif:
Gud-day my Lord Temporalitie,
And ow merchant of gravity:
Full fain wald I have harberie,
To ludge amang the laif.

Forsuith we wald be weil content,
To harbie ow with good intent,
War nocht we haif impediment:
For quhy we two are maryit:
Bot wist our wyfis that e war heir,
Thay wald make all this town on steir:
Thairfoir we reid ow rin areir,
In dreid e be miscaryit.

e men of craft of greit ingyne*
Gif me barbrie for Christis pine:
And win Gods bennesone and mine,
And help my hungry hart:

Welcum be him that maid the Moan,
Till dwell with us till it be June:
We sall mend baith our hois and schone,
And plainly take our part.

Is this fair Lady Chastity?
Now welcum be the Trinity:
I think it war an great pity
That thou should lie thairout:
our great displeasour I forthink,
Sit down Madame and take an drink:
And let na sorrow in ow sink,
Bot let us play cap'out.

Fill in and play cap'out,
For I am wonder dry:
[]The Devil snyp aff thair snout,
That haits this company.

Hoaw mynnie, mynnie, mynnie.

Quhat wald thow my deir dochter Iennie?
Iennie my Joy, quhair is thy dadie?

Mary drinkand with an lusty Lady,
An fair young maiden cled in quhyte,
Of quhom my dadie taks delyte,
Scho hes the the fairest form of face,
Furnischit with all kind of grace:
I traist gif I can reckon richt,
Scho schaips to ludge with him all nicht.

Quhat dois the Sowtar my gudman?

Mary fillis the cap and turns the can.
Or he cum home be God I trow
He will be drunkin like an sow.

This is an greit dispyte I think,
For to resaue sic an kow-clink:
Quhat is our counsel that we do?

Cummer this is my counsall lo*
Ding e the taken, and I the other.

I am content be Gods mother.
I think for me thay huirsone smaiks,
Thay serve richt weill to get thair paiks.
Quhat master fiend neids all this haist*
For it is half an eir almaist
[] Sen ever that loun laborde my ledder,

God nor my trewker mence an ledder,
For it is mair nor forty dayis,
[] Sen ever he cleikit up my clayis:
And last quhen I gat chalmer glue,
That foull Sowter began till spew.
And now thay will sit down and drink,
In company with an kow-clink.
Gif thay haif done us this dispyte
Let us go ding them till thay dryte.

Go hence harlot* how durst thow be sa bald
To ludge with our gudemen but our licence:
I make an vow to him that Iudas sauld,
This rock of mine sall be thy recompense.
Schaw me thy name dudron with diligence:

Marie Chastity is my name be Sanct Blais.

I pray God nor he work on the vengence.
For I luifit never Chastity all my days.

Bot my gudeman the treuth I sall the tell,
Gars me keip Chastity sair agains my will:
Because that Monstour hes maid sic an mint
With my bedstaf that dastard beirs an dint.
And als I vow cum thow this gait again,
Thy buttoks salbe beltit be Sanct Blaine.

Falls hurson carl, but dout thou sall forthink,
That evar thow eat or drink with on kow-clink.

I make an vow to Sanct Crispine*
Ise be revengit on that graceles grume:
And to begin the play take thair an flap.

The fiend re^laue the hands that gaif me that.

Quhat now huirsun, begins thow for till ban?
Take thair an other upon thy peild harne-pan.
Quhat now cummer, will thow nocht take my part?

That sal I do cummer with all my hart.

Alace gossop, alace how stands with ow*
on cankart carling alace hes brokin my brow.
Now weils ow Priests, now weils ow all our lifes*
That are nocht weddit with sic wickit wife's.

Bischops are blist howbeit that thay be waryit,
[] For thay may fuck thair fill and be vnmaryit.
Gossop alace, that blak band we may wary,
That ordanit sic puir men as us to mary.
Quhat may be done bot take in patience?
And on all wyfis we'ill cry an loud vengence.

Sen of our cairls we have the victory,
Quhat is our counsel cummer that be done:

Send for good wine hald our selfis merry,
I hold this ay best cummer be Sanct Clone.

Cumer will e draw aff my hois schone,
To fill the Quart I sall rin to the toun.

That sal I do be him that maid the Moan
Withal my hart, thairfoir cummer sit down.
Kilt up our claithis abone our waist,
And speid ow home again in haist
And I sall provyde for an paist,
Our corsses to comfort.

Then help me for to kilt my clais,
Quhat gif the padoks nip my tais.
I dreid to droun heir be Sanct Blais,
Without I get support.
Cummer I will nocht droun my sell,
Go east about the nether mill:

I am content be Bryds bell,
To gang with ow quhair ever e will.

Madame quhat gars ow gang sa lait?
Tell me how e have done debait,
With the Temporal and Spiritual sta it?
Quha did ow may kyndnes*

In faith I fand bot ill and war,
Thay gart me stand fra thame askar:
Evin lyk an beggar at the bar,
And fleimit mair and less.

I counsall ow but tarrying,
Gang tell Humanity the King:
Perchance he of his grace bening
Will make to ow support:

Of our counsel I am content,
To pas to him in continent,
And my service till him present,
In hope of sum comfort.

Hoaw Solace, gentil Solace declair unto the king
How thair is heir an Lady fair of face:
That in this country can get na ludging,
Bot pitifully flemit from place to place*
Without the king of his special grace,
As an servand her in his court resaif:
Brother Solace tell the king all the case*
That scho may-be resavit amang the laif.

Soverane get up and se an hevinlie sicht
An fair Lady in quhyt abuilement:
Scho may be peir unto an king or knicht,
Most lyk an Angel be my judgment.

I sall gang se that sicht incontinent*
Madame behauld gif e have knawledging
Of on Lady, or quhat is her intent,
Thairefter we sall turn but tarrying.

Sir let me se quhat on matter may meine
Perchance that I may know her be her face:
But doubt this is Dame Chastity I weine,
Sir I and scho cannot bide in an place,
But gif it be the pleasour of our grace,
That I remain into our company:
This woman richt haistelie gar chase,
That scho na mair be scene in this country.

As ever e pleis sweit hart sa sall it be,
Dispone her as e think expedient:
Evin as e list to let her live or die,
I will refer that thing to our Judgment.

I will that scho be flemit incotinent,
And never to cum again in this country:
And gif scho dois but doubt scho sall repent,
As als perchance a duilfull deid sall die.
Pas on sir Sapience and Discretioun,
And banische her out of the kings presence.

That sall we do Madame be gods passioun,
We sall do our command with diligence.
And at our hand serve gudely recompense,
Dame Chastity cum on, be not aghast,
We sall rycht soon upon our awin expense,
Into the stocks our bony fut make fast,
I pray ow sirs be patient,
For I sall be obedient
Till do quhat e command,
Sen I se thair is na remeid,
Howbeit it war to suffer deid,
Or flemit furth of the land.
I wit the Empreour Constantine,
That I am put to sic ruin,
And baneist from the Kirk:
For sen he maid the Paip an King,
In Rome I could get na ludging;
Bot heidlangs in the mirk.
Bot Lady Sensuality,
Sensyne hes gydit this country,
And money of the rest:
And now scho reulis all this land,
And hes decryit at her command,
That I suld be suppressed.
Bot all comes for the best,
Till him that louis the Lord:
Thocht I be now molest,
I traist to be restored.
Sister alace, this is an cairful case,
That we with Princes sold be sa abhorde:

Be blithe sister, I trust within schort space,
That we sall be richt honourably restored:
And with the King we sall be at concorde,
For I heir tell divyne Correctioun
Is new landit thankit be Christ our Lord,
I wait he will be our protectioun.

Sirs stand abak and hold ow coy,
I am the King Correctiouns boy,
Cum heir to dres his place:
Se that e make obedience
Until his no bill excellence,
Fra time e se his face.
For he makes reformatiouns,
Out-throw all Christin Natiouns,
Quhair he finds great debaits.
And sa far as I understand*
He sall reform into this Land,
Evin all the thrie estaits.
God furth of heavin hes him send,
To punische all that dois offend
Against his Majesty
As lyks him best to take vengence,
Sumtyme with Sword and Pestilence
With derth and poverty.
Bot quhen the peopill dois repent,
And beis to God obedient,
Then will he gif them grace:
Bot thay that will nocht be correctit,
Rychtsudanlie will be deiectit,
And fleimit from his face.
Sirs thocht we speik in general,
Let na man into special
Take our words at the warst:
Quhat ever we do quhat ever we say
I pray ow take it all in play*
And judge ay to the best.
For silence I protest
Baith of Lord, Lord and Lady:
Now I will rin but rest,
And tell that all is ready.

Brother heir e on proclamatioun,
I dreid full sair of reformatioun,
on message makes me mang it:
Quhat is our counsel to me tell,
Remain we heir be God him sell
We will be all three hang it.

I'll gang to Spirituality,
And preich out-throw his dyosie,
Quhair I will be vnknawin.
Or keip me close into sum closter,
With money piteous Pater noster,
Till all their blasts be blawin.

I'll be weill treitit as e ken,
With my masters the merchant men;
Quhilk can make small debait:
e ken richt few of them that thryfes,
Or can begyll the landwart wife's,
But me thairman Dissait.
Now Falset quhat sall be thy schift?

Na cuir thow nocht man for my thrift
Trows thou that I be daft:
Na I will leif an lusty life*
Withoutin any sturt and strife
Amang the men of craft.

I na mair will remain besyd ow,
Bot counsel ow rycht weill to gyde ow*
Bid nocht on Correctioun.
Fair-weil, I will na langer tarry,
I pray the alrich Queen of Farie,
To be our protectioun.

Falset I wald we maid an band,
Now quhill the King is it sleipand,
Quhat rack to steill his Box?

Now weill said be the Sacrament,
I sall it steill incontinent
Thocht it had twenty lox.
Lo heir the Box now let us ga,
This may suffice for our rewairds:

ea that it may man be this day,
It may weill make of landwart lords.
Now let us cast away our clais,
In dreid sum follow on the chase*

Rycht weill deuysit man be Sanct Blais,
Wald God we war out of this place.

Now sen thair is na man to wrang us
I pray ow brother with my hart,
Let us ga part this pelf amang us,
Syne haistely we sall depart.

Trows thou to get als mekill as I*
That sall thow nocht, I staw the Box:
Thou did nathing bot luikit by.
Ay lurk and like an wily Fox.

Thy heid sall beir an cuppill of knox
Pellour without I get my part:
Swyith huirsun smaik rife up the lox,
Or I sall stick the throuch the hart.

Alace for ever my eye is out,
Walloway will na man red the men?

Upon thy craig take thair an clout,
To be courtesse I sall the ken.
Pair-weill, for I am at the flicht,
I will nocht bide on ma demands,
And we two meit again this nicht,
Thy feit salbe with forty hands.

Beati qui esuriunt sitiunt Iustitiam. Their are the words of the redoutit Roy,
The Prince of peace above all Kings King:
Quhilk hes me sent all cuntries to convoye,
And all misdoars dourlie to down thring.
I will do nocht without the conveining
An Parleament of the estaits all,
In thair presence I sall but feineing
Iniquity under my Sword down thrall.
Thair may no Prince do acts honorabill,
Bot gif his counsall thairto will assist:
How may he know the thing may profitabil,
To follow vertew and vycis to resist:
Without he be instructit and solist:
And quhen the King stands at his counsel sound,
Then wealth sall wax and plenty as he list,
And policy sall in his Realm abound.
Gif any list my name for till inquyre,
I am callit Divine CORRECTIOVN*
I fled throch money uncouth land schyre,
To the greit profit of ilk Natioun.
Now am I cum into this Regioun,
To teill the ground that hes been lang vnsawin:
To punische tyrants for thair transgressioun,
And to cause leill men live upon thair awin.
Na Realm nor Land but my support may stand
For I gar Kings live into Royalty:
To rich and puir I beir an equal band,
That thay may live into thair awin degrie.
Quhair I am nocht is no tranqullitie
Be me tratours and tyrants are put down:
Quha thinks na schame of thair iniquity
Till thay be punisched be me Correctioun,
Quhat is an King nocht bot an officiar,
To cause his Leiges live in equity:
And under God to be an punischer,
Of trespassours against his Majesty.
Bot quhen the King dois live in tyranny,
Breakand Justice for fear or affectioun:
Then is his Realm in weir and poverty,
With schamefull slauchter but correctioun.
I am an Judge richt potent and seveir,
Cum to do Justice money thousand mile:
I am sa constant baith in peace and weir,
Na bud nor favour may my sicht oversyle.
Thair is thairfoir richt money in this I'll,
Of my repair but doubt that dois repent:
Bot virtuous men I traist sall on me smile,
And of my cumming sall be richt weill content.

Welcum my Lord welcum ten thousand tyms
Till all faithful men of this Regioun,
Welcum for till correct all faults and cryms:
Amang this cankerd congregatioun.
Louse Chastity I make supplicatioun,
Put till freedom fair Lady Verity:
Quha be unfaithful folk of this Natioun,
Lyis bund full fast into Captivity.

I mervel Gude-counsell how that may be,
Are e nocht with the King familiar?

That I am nocht my Lord, full wais me,
Bot like an beggeram halden at the bar:
Thay play bo-keik evin as I war an skar:
Thair came thrie knaves in cleithing counterfeit
And fra the King thay gart me stand affar.
Quhais names war Flattrie, Falset and Dissait.
Bot quhen thay knaves hard tell of our cumming,
Thay staw away ilk an an sindrie gait.
And cuist fra them thair counterfit cleithing,
For thair leaving full weill thay can debait:
The merchandmen thay haif resauit Dissait.
As for Falset, my Lord, full weill I ken,
He will be richt weill treitit air and lait,
Amang the may part of the crafts men.
Flattrie hes taine the habit of an Freir
Thinkand to begyll Spirituality.

But dout my friend and I live half an eit
I sall search out that great iniquity.
Quhair lyis on Ladies in Captivity?
How now Sisters quha hes ow sa disgysit?

Unfaithful members of iniquity,
Dispytfullie, my Lord, hes us supprysit.

Gang put on Ladyis to thair liberty
Incontinent and break down all the stocks:
But doubt thay are full deir welcum to me,
Make diligence, me think e do bot mocks
Speid hand and spair nocht for to break the locks*
And tenderly take them up be the hand
Had I them heir thay knaves suld ken my knocks
That them oppressed and baneist aff the land.

We thank ou sir of our benignity,
Bot I beseik our majesty Royal:
That e wald pas to King Humanity.
And fleime from him on Lady Sensual,
And enter in his service Gude-counsell,
For e will find him very counsalabill.

Cum on Sisters as e haif said, I sall,
And gar him stand with ow thrie firm and stabill,

Solace knawis thou not quhat I se?
An knicht or ellis an king thinks me,
With wantoun wings as he wald fl,
Brother quhat may this meine?
I understand nocht be this day,
Quhidder that he be friend or fay:
Stand still and hear quhat he will say,
Sic an I haif nocht seine.

on is an stranger I stand forde,
He seems to be an lusty Lord:
Be his heir-cumming for concorde,
And be kind till our King:
He sall be welcome to this place,
And treatit with the Kingis grace:
Be it nocht sa, we sall him chase,
And to the devil him ding.

I reid us put upon the King;
And walkin him of his sleiping:
Sir rise and se an uncouth thing.
Get up, e lie too lang.

Put on our hude Iohne-Fule, e raif,
How dar e be so pertsir knaif
To tuich the King? sa Christ me saif,
Falls huirsone thow sall hang.

Get up sir King, e haif sleipit aneuch
Into the armis of Lady Sensual.
Be suit that mair belangis to the pleuch,
As efterward perchance rehears I sall.
Remember how the King Sardanapall,
Amang fair Ladies tuke his lust sa lang,
Sa that the may pairt of his Leiges al
Rebeld, and syne him duilfully down thrang.
Remember how into the time of No,
For the foull stink and sin of lechery,
God be my wand did al the world destroy,
Sodome and Gomore richt sa full rigorously,
For that vyld sin war brunt in may cruelly.
Thairfoir I the command incontinent,
Banische from the that huir Sensuality,
Or else but doubt rudlie thow sall repent.

Be quhom have e sa greit authority?
Quha dois presume for till correct an King?
Know e nocht me greit King Humanity?
That in my Regioun Royally dois ring.

I have power greit Princes to dou thring*
That lives contrair the Majesty Divyne
Against the treuth quhilk plainly dois maling,
Repent they nocht I put them to ruin.
I will begin at thee quhilk is the head,
And make on the first reformatioun,
Thy Leiges than will follow the but pleid,
Swyith harlot hence without dilatioun.

My Lord I make ow supplicatioun,
Gif melicence to pas again to Rome:
Amang the Princes of that Natioun,
I lat ow wit my fresche beauty will blume
Adieu Sir King I may na langer tarry,
I cair nocht that, als good luife cums as gais,
I recommend ow to the Queen of Farie.
I se e will be gydit with my fais,
As for this king I cure him nocht two strais:
War I amang Bischops and Cardinals,
I wald get gould, silver and precious clais,
Na earthly joy but my presence avails.
My Lords of the Sprituall stait,
Venus preserve ow air and lait:
For I can make na mair debait,
I am partit with our king:
And am baneischt this Regioun,
Be counsel of Correctioun:
Be e nocht my protectioun,
I may seik my ludgeing.

Welcum our dayis darling,
Welcum with all our hart:
We all but feineing,
Sall plainly take our part.

Sen e are quyte of Sensuality,
Resaue into our service Gude-counsall:
And richt sa this fair Lady Chastity,
Till e mary sum Queen of blude-royall.
Observe then Chastity matrimonial,
Richt sa resaue Verity be the hand,
Use thair counsel our fame sall never fall,
With thame thairfoir make an perpetual band.
Now sir take tent quhat I will say,
Observe their same baith nicht and day,
And let them never part ow fray.
Or else withoutin doubt:
Turn e to Sensuality,
To vicious life and rebaldrie,
Out of our Realm richt schamefullie,
e sall be ruttit out.
As was Tarquine the Roman King,
Quha was for his vicious living
And for the schamefull ravisching
Of the fair chaist Lucres,
He was digraidit of his croun,
And baneist aff his Regioun:
I maid on him correctioun,
As stories dois expres.

I am content to our counsall t'inclyne
e beand of good conditioun.
At our command sall be all that is mine,
And heir I gif ow full commissioun,
To punische faults and gifremissioun,
To all vertew I salbe consociabill,
With ow I sall confirm an vnioun,
And at our counsall stand ay firm and stabill.

I counsall ow incontinent,
To gar proclaim an Parliament,
Of all the thrie estaits.
That thay be heir with diligence,
To make to ow obedience,
And syne dres all debaits.

That salbe done but mair demand,
Hoaw Diligence cum heir fra hand,
And take our informatioun:
Gang warn the Spirituality,
Rycht sa the Temporalitie,
Be oppin proclamatioun,
In gudlie haist for to compeir
In thair may honorabill maneir,
To gif us thair counsals:
Quha that beis absent to them schaw,
That thay sall vnderly the law,
And punischt be that fails.

Sir I sall baith in bruch and land,
With diligence do our command,
Upon my awin expens:
Sir I have servit ow all this eir,
Bot I gat never an dinneir
it for my recompense.

Pas on and thou salbe regairdit,
And for thy service weill rewairdit,
For quhy with my consent,
Thou sall have eirly for thy hire,
The teind mussellis of the ferry mire,
Confirmit in Parliament.

I will get riches throw that rent,
Ester the day of Dume:
Quhen in the colpots of Tranent,
Butter will grow on brume.
All nicht I had sa meikill drouth,
I micht nocht sleip an wink
Or I proclaim ocht with my mouth,
But doubt I man haif drink.

Cum heir Placebo and Solace,
With our companeoun Wantonness,
I know weill our conditioun:
For tysting King Humanity,
To resaue Sensuality,
e man suffer punitioun.

We grant my lord we have done ill,
Thairfoir we put us in our will,
Bot we haife been abusit:
For in gudefaith Sir we beleifit,
That lechery had na man greifit,
Because it is sa vsit.

e se how Sensuality,
With Principals of ilk country,
Been glaidlie lettin in:
And with our Prelatis mair and les,
Speir at my Lady Priores,
Giflechery be sin.

Sir we sall mend our conditioun,
Sa e give us remissioun,
Bot give us live to sing:
To dance, to play at Chess and Tabils,
To reid Stories and mirrie fabils,
For pleasure of our King.

Sa that e do navther crime,
e sall be pardon it at this time,
For quhy* as I suppois
Princes may sumtyme seik solace,
With mirth and lawful mirrines,
Thair spirits to reioyis.
And richt sa Halking and Hunting,
Are honest pastimes for an King,
Into the time of peace:
And leirne to rin an heavy spear*
That he into the time of wear,
May follow at the cheace.

Quhair is Sapience and Discretioun?
And quhy cums nocht Devotioun nar?

Sapience sir was an very loun,
And Discretioun was nathing war:
The suith Sir, gif I wald report,
Thay did beguile our Excellence:
And wald not suffer to resort
An of us thrie to our presence.

Thay thrie war Flattrie and Dissait,
And Falset that unhappy loun:
Against us thrie quhilk maid debait,
And baneischt us from town to town.
Thay gart us two fall into sown,
Quhen thay us lockit in the stocks:
That dastart knave Discretioun,
Full thifte ouslie did steill our Box.

The Devil take them sen thay are gane,
Me thocht them ay thrie very smaiks,
I make an vow to Sanct Mavane,
Quhen I them find thays bear thair paiks,
I se thay have playit me the glaiks,
Gude-counsall now schaw me the best*
Quhen I fix on ow thrie my staiks,
How I sall keip my Realm in rest.

Initium sapientiae est timor Domini. Sir, gif our hienes earnis lang to ring,
First dread our God abuif all other thing.
For e are bot an mortal instrument,
To that great God and King Omnipotent.
Preordinat be his divine Majesty,
To reull his peopill intill unity,
The principal point Sir of an kings office,
Is for to do to euerilk man justice.
And for to mix his justice with mercy,
But rigour, favour or parcialitie.
Forsuith it is na littill observance,
Great Regions to have in governance?
Quha ever taks on him that kingly cuir,
To get an of thirtwa he suld be suir:
Great pain and labour, and that continual,
Or ellis to have defame perpetual.
Quha guydis weill they win immortal fame,
Quha the contrair, they get perpetual schame,
Efter quhais death but dout an thousand eir
Thair life at lenth rehearst sall be perqueir.
The Chroniklis to know Iow exhort,
Thair sall e find baith good and evil report:
For every Prince efter his quality,
Thocht he be deid, his deids sall never die.
Sir gif e please for to use my counsall,
our fame and name sall be perpetual.

At the command of King Humanity,
I wairne and charge all members of Parliament:
Baith sprituall stait and Temporalitie,
That till his Grace thay be obedient,
And speid them to the Court incontinent,
In good ordour array it royally,
Quha beis absent or inobedient
The Kings displeasure they sall vnderly.
And als I make ow exhortatioun,
Sen e haifheard the first pairt of our play:
Go take an drink, and make Collatioun,
Ilk man drink till his marrow, I ow pray.
Tarry nocht lang, it is lait in the day,
Let sum drink Aisle and sum drink Claret wine:
Be great Doctors of Physic I hear say,
That michtie drink comforts the dull ingine.
[] And e Ladies that list to pisch,
Lift up our taill, plat in an disch:
And gif that our mawkine cryis quhisch,
Stop in an wusp of stray.
Let nocht our bladder burst I pray ow,
For that war euin aneuch to slay ow:
For it thair is to cum, I say ow,
The best pairt of our Play.

OF our almis good folks for Gods luife of heavin,
For I have motherles bairns either sax or seavin:
Gif e'ill gif me na good for the luife of Iesus,
Wische me the richt way till Sanct-Androes.

Quhair have we gottin this gudly companeoun?
Swyith out of the field falls raggit loun.
God wait gif heir be an weill keipit place,
Quhen sic an wild beggar Carl may get entres.
Fie on ow officiars that mends nocht their failies,
[] I gif ow all till the devil baith Provost and Bailies
Without e cum and chase this Carl away
The Devil a word e'is get mair of our play.
Falls huirsun raggit Carl, quhat Devil is that thou rugs

Quha Devil maid the an gentill man that wald cut not thy lugs?

Quhat now? me thinks the carl begins to crack,
Swyith carl away or be this day Ise break thy back.
Cum down, or be Gods croun falls loun I sall slay the.

Now sweir be thy brunt schinis the Devil ding them fra the.
Quhatsay e till their court dastards be thay get hail clais
Sa sun as thay leir to sweir and trip on thair tais.

Me thocht the carl callit me knave evin in my face
Be Sanct Fillane thou salbe slane, bot gif thou ask grace:
Loup down or be the good Lord thow sall los thy heid.

I sal anis drink or I ga thocht thou had sworn my deid.

Loup now gif thou list for thou hes lost the ledder*

It is full weil thy kind to loup and licht in a ledder.
Thou sal be fain to fetch agane ye ledder or I loup
I sall sit heir into this tcheir till I have tumde the stoup.
Swyith beggar bogill haist the away,
Thow art over pert to spill our play.

I will not gif for al our play worth an sowis fart,
For thair is richt lytill play at my hungry hart.

Quhat Devil ails this cruckit carl?

Marie meikill sorrow:
I can not get, thocht I gasp to beg nor to borrow.

Quhair devil is this thou dwells or quhats thy intent?

I dwell into Lawthiane an mile fra Tranent.

Quhair wald thou be carl, the suth to me schaw?

Sir evin to Sanct-Androes for to seik law.

For to seik law in Edinburgh was the neirest way,

Sir I socht law thair this money deir day.
Bot I cold get nane at Sessioun nor Seine,
Thairfoir the mekill din Devil droun all the meine.

Shaw me thy matter man with al the circumstances*
How that thou hes happinit on their unhappy chances.

Gude-man will e gif me of our Charity
And I sall declair ow the black verity.
My father was an auld man and an hoir,
And was of age fourscoir of eirs and moir.
And Mald my mother was fourscoir and fyfteine,
And with my labour I did thame baith sustain.
We had an Meir that caryit salt and coill,
And every ilk eir scho brocht us home an foill.
VVee had thrie ky that was baith fat and fair,
Nane tydier into the toun of air.
My father was sa waik of blude and bane,
That he deit, quhairfoir my mother maid great maine
Then scho deit within an day or two,
And thair began my poverty and wo.
Our good gray Meir was baittand on the field,
And our Lands lord tuik her for his hyreild
The Vicar tuik the best Cow be the head,
Incontinent quhen my father was deid.
And quhe the Vicar hard tel how that my mother*
Was dead, fra* hand he tuke to him an other,
Then Meg my wife did murne both evin morrow
Till at the last scho deit for very sorrow:
And quhen the Vicar hard tell my wife was dead,
The third Cow he cleikit be the head.
Thair vmest clayis that was of rapploch gray,
The Vicar gart his Clark bear them away.
Quhen all was gain I micht make na debeat
Bot with my bairns past for till beg my meat.
Now have I tald ow the blak verity,
How I am brocht into this misery.

How did ye person, was he not thy good friend?

The devil stick him, he cursed me for my teind
And halds me it under that same process
That gart me want the Sacrament at Pasche.
In gudefaith sir, thocht he wald cut my throt,
I have na gear except an Inglis grot.
Quhilk I purpois to gif an man of law.

Thou art the daftest fuill that ever I saw*
Trows thou man be the law to get remeid,
Of men of kirk* na nocht till thou be deid.

Sir be quhat law tell me quhairfoir or quhy?
That an Vicar sold take fra me thrie ky.

Thay have na law except and consuetude,
Quhilk law to them is sufficient and good.

An consuetude against the common weill,
Sold be na law I think besweit Sanct Geill.
Quhair will e find that law tell gif e can?
To take thrie ky fra an pure husband man.
An for my father, and for my wife an other,
And the third Cow he tuke fra Mald my mother.

It is thair law all that thay have in use
Thocht it be Cow, Sow, Ganer, Gryse or Guse,

Sir I wald speir at ow an questioun,
Behauld sum Prelats of this Regioun,
Manifestly during thair lusty* lyfis,
[] Thay swyfe Ladies, Madinis and other men's wyfis.
And sa thair cunts thay have in consuetude,
Quhidder say e that law is evil or good?

Hald thy tongue man, it seims that thou war mangit,
Speik thou of Priests but doubt thou will be hangit.

Be him that buir the cruel Croun of thorne,
I cair nocht to be hangit evin the morn.

Be sure of Preistis thou will get na support,

Gif that be true the seind resaue the sort.
Sa sen I se I get na other grace,
I will lie down and rest me in this place.

Bona dies, Bona dies, Devoit peopill, good day I say ow,
Now tarry an lytill quhyll I pray ow,
Till I be with ow knawin:
Wait e weill how I am namit?
An nobill man and vndefamit
Gif all the suith war schawin.
I am sir Robert Rome-raker,
An perfect public pardoner
Admittit be the Paip:
Sirs I sall schaw ow for my wage
My pardons and my pilgramage,
Quhilk e sall se and graip:
I give to the devil with good intent,
This vnsell wickit New-testament.
With them that it translait it:
Sen layik men knew the verity,
Pardoners gets no charity,
Without that thay debait it.
Amang the wives with wrinks and wiles,
As all my marrowis, men begyles,
With our fair falls flattrie:
ea all the crafts I ken perqueir,
As I was teichit be an Freir,
Callit Hypocrisy.
Bot now allace, our greit abusioun
Is cleirlie knawin till our confusioun,
That we may sair repent:
Of all credence now I am quyte,
For ilk man halds me at dispyte,
That reids the New-test'ment.
Duill fell the brain that hes it wrocht,
Sa fall them that the Buik home brocht:
Als I pray to the Rude
That Martin Luther that falls loun,
Black Bullinger and Melancthoun,
Had been smorde in their cude.
Be him that buir the crown of thorne,
I wald Sanct Paull had never been borne,
And als I wald his bulks:
War never red in the kirk,
Bot amangs freirs into the mirk,
Or riuen amang ruiks.
My patent pardouns e may se,
Cumfra the Cave of Tartarie,
VVeill sealed with oster-schellis.
Thocht e have na contritioun;
e sall have full remissioun
With help of Buiks and bellis.
Heir is an relic lang and braid,
Of fine Macoull the the richt chaft blaid,
With teith and al togidder:
Of Collings cow heir is an horne,
For eating of Makconnals corn,
Was slain into Baquhidder.
Heir is an coird baith great and lang,
Quhilk hangit Iohne the Armistrang,
Of good hemp soft and sound:
Good halie peopill I stand for'd,
Quha ever beis hangit with this cord,
Neids never to be dround.
The culum of Sanct Bryds kow,
The gruntill of Sanct Antonis sow,
Quhilk buit his haly bell:
Quha ever he be heiris this bell clinck,
Gif me an ducat for till drink,
He sall never gang to hell.
Without he be of Baliell borne,
Masters trow e that this bescorne?
Cum win this pardoun, cum:
Quha luifis thair wyfis nocht with thair hart
I have power them for till part,
Me think ow deif and dum.
Hes naine of ow cursed wickit wyfis,
That halds ow into sturt and stryfis,
Cum take my dispensatioun:
Of that cummer I sall make ow quyte,
How be it our selfis be in the wit,
And make an falls narratioun.
Cum win the pardoun now letse,
For meill, for malt or for money,
For cock, hen, guse or gryse:
Of relicts heir I have an hunder,
Quhy cum e nocht this is an wonder?
I trow e be nocht wise.

Welcum home Robert Rome-raker,
Our halie patent pardoner:
Gif e have dispensatioun,
To pairt me and my wickit wife,
And me deliver from sturt and strife,

I sall ow pairt but mair demand,
Sa I get money in my hand,
Thairfoir let se sum cune:

I have na silver be my life,
Bot five schillings and my schaipping knife,
That sall e have but sun.

Quhat kind of woman is thy wife,

An quick Devil Sir, an storm of strife,
An Frog that files the wind:
[]An fistand flag, a flagartie fuffe,
At ilk an pant scho lets an puff,
And hes na ho behind.
All the lang day scho me dispyts,
And all the nicht scho flings and flyts,
Thus sleip I never an wink:
That Cockatrice, that commoun huir,
The mekill Devil may nocht in duir
Her stuburnnes and stink.

Thief carl thy words I hard rycht weill
In faith my freindschip e sall feill,
And I the fang:

Except e war baith fair and good,

Fair dame gif e wald be an wower,
To part ow two I have an power,
Tell on are e content?

Fra that falls huirsone till depart,
Gif this thief will consent.
Causses to part to part I have anew,
[]Because I gat na chamber-glew,

[]Howbeit that swingeour can not swyfe,
He is baith cauld and dry.

Quhat will e gif me for our part*
An cuppill of sarks with all my hart,
The best claith in the land:

To part sen e are baith content,
I sall ow part incontinent,
Bot e mon do command.
My will and final sentence is,
Ilk an of ow vthers arsse kis:
Slip down our hois, me thinkis the carl is glaikit,
Set thou not by howbeit scho kiss and slaik it,
Lift up her clais, kis her hoill with our hart,

And pas e west evin like an cuckald loun,

Hoaw master, hoaw, quhair are e now?

For I have fund an great horse bane,
An fairer saw e never nane,
Upon Dame Fleschers midding.

Good for the fever quartain:

All the wyfis will baith kis and kneill,
Betuixt this and Dumbartane,

Quhat say thay of me in the toun?

Sum sayis e are an very loun:
Sum sayis, Legatus natus:
Sum sayis 'ar an falls Saracene,
And sum sayis e are for certain
Diabolus incarnatus.
Bot keip ow fra subiectioun,
Of the cursed King Correctioun.
For be e with him fangit:
Because e are an Rome-raker,
An commoun public cawsay-paker,
But doubt e will be hangit.

Quhair sall I ludge into the toun?

With good kind Cristiane Anderson,
Quhair e will be weill treatit.
Gif any li nmer ow demands,
Scho will defend ow with her hands,
And womanly debait it.
Bawburdie says be the Trinity,
That scho sall beir ow cumpanie,
Howbeit e bide an eir.

Take e the taine and I the the other:
Sa sall we make greit cheir.

And make na langer tarry:

With my richt hand my haill body I sane,

To make me help let me se gif he can.
Halie master, God speid ow and good morn,

And thou sall have my pardon euin fra-hand.

Of Gut or gravel thou sall never have pain.
Now win the pardon limmer, or thou art lost:

An thousand eir? I will not live sa lang,
Deliver me it master and let me gang.

An thousand eir I lay upon thy head,
With tetiens quotiens: now make me na mair plead:
Thou hast resaifit thy pardon now already.

Bot I can se na thing sir be our Lady:
Forsuith master, I trow I be not wise:
To pay ere I have scene my marchandryse.

My marchandryse schaw me withouttin sunie.
Or to the Bischop I sall pas and pleinie
In Sanct-Androis, summod ow to the Seinie*

Qi hat craifis the carle'me thinks thou art not wise.

How sall I get that pardon let me heir?

Stand still and I sall tell the haill story:
Quhen thow art deid and gais to Purgatory,
Being condempit to pain a thousand eir:

Now be content* e are an mervelous man:

Na than gossop, gif me my grot again.
Quhat say e masters call e this good resoun?
That he sold promeis me an gay pardoun:
And he resaue my money in his stead,
Syne make me na payment till I be dead:
Quhen I am deid I wait full sikkerlie,
My silly saull will pas to Purgatory:
Declair me this? now God nor Baliell bind the,
Quhen I am thair cursed carl, quhair sall I find the?
Not into heavin, bot rather into hell:
Quhen you art thair thou can not help thy sell.
Quhen will thou cum my dolours till abait?
Or I the find my hippis will get an hait.
Trowis thou butchour that I will by blind lambis:
[]Gif me my grot the devil dryte in thy gambis.

Suyith stand abak, I trow this man be mangit:
Thou gets not this carl, thocht you suld be hangit

Gif me my grot weill bund into an clout,
[]Or be Gods breid Robin sall beir an rout.

Quhat kind of dassing is this al day?
Suyith smaiks out of the the field, away.
Into an presoun put them soon,
Syne hang them quhen the play is done.

Famous peopill take tent and e sall se
The thrie estaits of this natioun:
Cum to the Court with an strange gravity,
Thairfoir I make ow supplicatioun:
Till e have heard our haill narratioun,
To keip silence and be patient I pray ow,
Howbeit we speik be adulatioun,
We sall say nathing bot the suith I say ow.
Good virtuous men that luifis the verity,
I wait thay will excuse our negligence:
Bot vicious men denude of charity,
As feineit falls flattrand Saracens.
Howbeit thay cry on us an loud vengence,
And of our pastime make an falls report.
Quhat may we do bot take in patience?
And us refer unto the faithful sort.
Our Lord Iesus Peter nor Paull,
Could nocht compleis the peopill all*
Bot sum war miscontent:
Howbeit thay schew the verity,
Sum said that it war herisie,
Be thair may falls judgment.

Now braid benedicite,
Quhat thing is on that I se?
Luke Solace my hart:

Brother Wantonness quhat thinks thow?
on are the thrie estaits I trow:
Gangand backward.

Backward, backward, out wallaway?
It is greit schame for them I say,
Backward to gang:
I trow the King Correctioun,
Man make an reformatioun:
Or it be lang.
Now let us go and tell the King,
Sir we have scene an mervelous thing
Be our judgment:
The thrie estaits of this Regioun,
Are cummand backward throw this toun,
To the Parliament*

Backward, backward, how may that be?
Gar speid them haistelie to me:
In dreid that thay ga wrang:

Sir I se them onder cummand,
Thay will be he heir evin fra hand,
Als fast as thay may gang.

Sir hald ou still skar them nocht*
Till e persaue quhat be thair thocht,
And se quhat men them leids:
And let the King Correctioun,
Make an scharp inquisitioun,
And mark them be the heids.
Quhen e ken the occasioun,
That makes them sic persuasioun;
e may expel the cause:
Syne them reform as e think best,
Sua that the Realm may live in rest*
According to Gods lawis.

Gloir, honour, laud triumph and victory
Be to our michtie prudent excellence:
Heir are we cum all the estaits thrie,
Ready to make our dew obedience.
At our command with humbill observance,
As my pertene to Spirituality.
With counsel of the Temporalitie.

Sir we with michtie curage at command
Of our superexcellent Majesty,
Sall make service baith with our hart and hand,
And sall not dreid in thy defence to die:
We are content but doubt that we may se
That nobill heavinlie King Correctioun,
Sa he with mercy make punitioun.

Sir we are heir our Burgessis and Merchands,
Thanks be to God that we may se our face:
Traistand we may now into divers lands,
Convoy our gear with support of our grace.
For now I traist we sall get rest and peace,
Quhe misdoars are with our sword overthrawin
Then may leil-merchands live upon thair awin.

Welcum to me my prudent Lords all,
e are my members suppois I be our head:
Sit down that we may with our just counsall,
Aganis misdoars find soveraine remeid.
We sall nocht spair for favour nor for feid,
With our avice to make punitioun:
And put my sword to executioun.

My tender friends I pray ow with my hart,
Declair to me the thing that I wald speir,
Quhat is the cause that e gang all backward?
The verity thair of fain wald I heir.

Soveraine we have gain sa this money a eir
Howbeit e think we go indecently,
VVee think we gang richt wonder pleasantly.

Sit down my Lords into our proper places:
Syne let the King consider all sic caces.
Sit down sir scribe, and sit down dampster to:
And fence the Court as e war wont to do.

My prudent Lords of the thrie estaits,
It is our will abuife all other thing,
For to reform all them that makes debaits,
Contrair the richt quhilk daily dois maling.
And thay that dois the Common-weil down thring
With help and counsel of King Correctioun,
It is our will for to make punisching:
And plain oppressors put to subiectioun.

Quhat thing is this sir, that e have devysit
Schirs e have neid for till be weill advysit
Be nocht haistie into our executioun,
And be nocht our extreime in our punitioun.
And gif e please to do sir, as we say,
Postpone this Parliament till an other day.
For quhy? the peopill of this Regioun,
May nocht endure extreme correctioun.

Is this the part my Lords that e will take*
To make us supportatioun to correct:
It dois appeir that e are culpabill,
That are nocht to Correctioun applyabill.
Suyith Diligence gaschaw it is our will,
That everilk man oppressed geif in his Bill.

All maneir of men I wairne that be oppressed,
Cum and complain and thay salbe redressed.
For quhy, it is the nobill Princes will,
That ilk compleiner sall gif in his Bill.
Out of my gait, for Gods saik let me ga*
Tell me again good master quhat e say.

I warn al that be wrangouslie offendit,
Cum and complain and thay sall be a nendit.

Thankit be christ yat buir the croun of thorne
For I was never sa blithe sen I was b^ne*

Quhat is thy name follow* that wald I feil?

Forsuith thay call me Iohne the comon-weil.
Good master I wald speir at ou an thing,

Stand by the gait, let se gif I can loup,

Speid the away, thou taryis all to lang:

Good day, good day, grit God saif baith our graces
Wallie, wallie fall thay two weill fairde faces.

Shaw me thy name good man I the command,

Marie Iohne the common-weil of fair Scotland

The commoun weill hes been amang his fais:

Quhat is the cause the common weil is crukit?

Because the common-weill hes been overlukit

Quhat gars the luke sa with an dreirie hart?

Because the thrie estaits gangs all backward.

Sir common weill know e the limmers that the leids?

Thair canker colours I ken them be the heads*
As for our reverent fathers of Spirituality,
Thay are led be Couetice and cairles Sensuality.
And as e se Temporalitie hes neid of correctioun*
Quhilk hes lang time been led be public oppressioun*
Lo quhair the loun lyis lurkand at his back,
Get up I think to se thy craig gar an raip crack.
Lo heir is Falset and Dissait weill I ken,
Leiders of the merchants and silly crafts-men.
Quhat mervell thocht the thrie estaits backward gang?
Quhen sic an vile cumpanie dwells them amang.
Quhilk hes reulit this rout money deir dayis,
Quhilk gars Iohn the comon-weil want his warm clais
Sir call them befoir ow and put them in ordour,
Or else Iohn the common-weil man beg on the bordour.
[]Thou feineit Flattrie the fiend fart in thy face,
Quhen e was guyder of the Court we gat litill grace.
Rise up Falset and Dissait without any sun,
I pray God nor the devils dame dryte on thy grune.
Behauld as the loun lukis evin like a thief,
Money wicht warkman thou brocht to mischief.
My soveraine Lord Correction I make ow supplication,
Put their tryit truikers from Christis congregation.

As e have devysit but doubt it sa be done
Cum heir my Sergeants and do our debt soon.
Put their thrie pellours into pressoun strange,
Howbeit e sold hang them e do them na wrahg.

Soverane Lords we sall obey our commands:
Brother upon their limmers lay on thy hands.
Rise up soon loun thou luiks evin like an lurden:
our mouth war meit to drink an wesche iurden.

Cum heir gossop, cum heir, cum heir,
our rackles life e sall repent:
Quhen was e wont to be sa sweir?
Stand still and be obedient.

Thair is nocht in all this toun,
Bot I wald nocht this taill war tald*
Bot I wald hang him for his goun,
Quhidder that it war Lord or laid.
I trow this pellour be spur-gaid,
Put in thy hand into this cord,
Howbeit I se thy skap skyre skaid:
Thou art an stewat I stand foird.

Put in our leggis into the stocks,
For e had never an meiter hois:
Their stewats stinks as thay war Broks,
Now are e sikker I suppois.
My Lords we have done our commands,
Sall we put Covetice in captivity?

e hardly lay on them our hands,
Rycht sa upon Sensuality,

This is my Grainter and my Chalmerlaine,
And hes my gould and gear under her cuiris:
I make an vow to God I sall complain,
Unto the Paip how e do me iniuris.

My reverent fathers take in patience,
I sall nocht lang remain from our pesence
Thocht for an quhyll I man from ow depairt,
I wait my spreit sall remain in our hart.
And quhen this King Correctioun beis absent,
Then sall we two return incontinent.
Thairfoir adieu. --

Adieu be Sanct Mavene,
Pas quhair e will we are two natural men.

Adieu my Lord --

-- Adieu my awin sweit hart.
Now duill fell me that we two man depart.

My Lord howbeit this parting dois me pain,
I traist in God we sal meit soon agane.

To cum again I pray ow do our cure,
Want I ow two I may nocht lang endure.

My Lords e know the thrie estaits,
For Common-weill suld make debaits:
Let now amang us be devysit,
Sic actis that with good men be praysit.
Conforming to the common law,
For of na man we sold stand awe.
And for till saif us fra murmell,
Schone Diligence fetch us Gude-counsell
For quhy he is an man that knawis,
Baith the Cannon and Civil lawis.

Father e man incontinent,
Pass to the Lords of Parliament.
For quhy thay are determinat all,
To do na thing by our counsall.

That sal I do within schort space,
Praying the Lord to send us grace:
For till conclude or we depart,
That thay may profeit esterwart,
Baith to the Kirk and to the King,
I sall desire na other thing.
My Lords God glaid the cumpanie,
Quhat is the cause e send for me?

Sit down and gif us our counsel,
How we sall slaik the greit murmell,
Of pure peopill, that is weill knawin,
And as the Common-weill hes schawin.
And als we know it is the Kings will,
That good remeid be put thairtill.
Sir Common-weill keip e the bar,
Let nane except our self cum nar.

That sall I do as I best can,
I sall hold out baith wife and man*
e man let this puir creature,
Support me for till keip the dure.
I know his name full sickerly,
He will complain als weill as I.

My worthy Lords sen e have taine on hand
Sum reformatioun to make into this land:
And als e know it is the Kings mind,
Quha till the Common-weil hes ay been kind:
Thocht reif and thift were stanchit weill aneuch,
it sumthing mair belangis to the pleuch.
Now into peace e sold provyde for weirs,
And be sure of how money thousand speirs,
The King may be quhen he hes ocht ado,
For quhy my Lords this is my ressoun to.
The husband men and commons thay war wont,
Go in the battle formest in the front*
Bot I have tint all my experience,
Without e make sum better diligence:
The Common-weill mon other wayis be styllit*
Or be my faith the King will be begyllit.
Their pure commouns daily as e may se,
Declynisdoun till extreme poverrie:
For sum are hichtit sa into thair maill,
Thair winning will nocht find them water kaill.
How Prelats heichts thair teinds it is weill knawin,
That husband-men may not weill hald thair awin.
And now begins an plague amang them new,
That gentill men thair steadings taks in few.
Thus man thay pay great ferme or lay thair steid,
And sum are plainly harlit out be the heid,
And are destroy it without God on them few.

Sir be Gods breid that taill is very true.
It is weill kend I had baith nolt and horse,
Now all my gear e se upon my cors.
Correction, Or I depairt I think to make an ordour

I pray ow sir begin first at bordour.
For how can we send us aganis Ingland
Quhen we can nocht within our native Land,
Destroy our awin Scots, common trator theifis,
Quha to leill laborers daily dois mischeifis.
[] War I an King my Lord be Gods wounds,
Quha ever held common theifis within thair bounds:
Quhairthrow that daily leilmen micht be wrangit
Without remeid thair chiftanis suld be hangit,
Quhidder he war an knicht, an Lord or Lord
The Devil draw me to hell and he war spaird.

Quhat other enemies hes thou let us ken?

Sir I compleine upon the idill men:
For quhy sir it is Gods awin bidding
All Christian men to wirk for thair living.
Sanct Paull that pillar of the Kirk,
Sayis to the wretchis that will not wirk
And been to vertews laith
Qui non laborat non manducet. This is in Inglische tongue or leit:
Quha labouris nocht he sall not eit.
This been against the strange beggars,
Fiddlers, pypers, and pardoners:
Their Iugglars, Iestars, and idill cuitchours,
Their carriers and their quintacensours:
Their babil-beirers and their bairds,
Their sweir swyngeours with Lords and Lords:
Ma then thair rents may sustain,
Or to thair profeit neidfull been,
Quhilk been ay blythest of discords,
And*deidly feid amang there Lords.
For then they sleutchers man be treatit*
Or else thair querrels vndebaitit.
This been against their great fat Freiris,
Augustenes, Carmleits and Cordeleirs:
And all vthers that in cowls been cled,
Quhilk labours nocht and been weill fed.
I mean nocht laborand Spirituallie,
Nor for thair living corporallie:
Lyand in dennis like idill doggis
I them compair to weil fed hoggis*
I think they do them selfis abuse,
Seeing that thay the world refuse:
Haifing professed sic poverty,
Syne fleis fast fra necessity.
Quhat gif thay poverty wald profess?
And do as did Diogenes,
That great famous Philosophour,
Seeing in earth bot vain labour,
Alutterlie the world refusit,
And in an tumbe him self inclusit,
And leifit on herbs and water cauld,
Of corporal fude na mair he wald.
He trottit nocht from toun to toun,
Beggand to feid his carioun.
Fra time that life he did profes,
The wald of him was cummerles.
Rycht sa of Marie Magdalene,
And of Mary th'Egyptiane:
And of auld Paull the first Hermeit,
All their had poverty compleit.
An hundredth ma I micht declair,
Bot to my purpois I will fair:
Concluding sleuthfull idilnes,
Against the Common-weill express.

Quhom upon ma will e compleine?

Marie on ma and ma again.
For the pure peopill cryis with cairis,
The infetching of Justice airis:
Exercit mair for couetice,
Then for the punisching of vice.
An peggrell thief that steillis an kow,
Is hangit* bot he that steillis an bow
With als meikill gear as he may turs,
That thief is hangit be the purse.
Sic pykand peggrall theifis are hangit,
Bot he that all the world hes wrangit,
An cruel tyrane an strange transgressour,
An common public plain oppressor,
By buds may he obtain favours
Of Tresurers and compositours.
Thocht he serve greit punitioun,
Gets easy compositioun:
And throch laws consistoriall
Prolixt, corrupt and perpetual.
The common peopill are put sa under,
Thocht thay be puir it is na wonder.

Good Iohne I grant all that is true*
our infortoun full sair I few:
Or I pairt aff this Natioun,
I sall make reformatioun.
And als my Lord Temporalitie,
I ow command in time that e
Expel oppressioun aff our lands.
And als I say to ow merchands,
Gif ever I find be land or sie,
Dissait be in our cumpanie:
Quhilk are to Common-weill contrair,
I vow to God I sall not spair
To put my sword to executioun,
And make on ow extreme punitioun.
Mairover my Lord Spirituality,
In gudlie haist I will that e
Set into few our temporal lands.
To men that labours with thair hands.
Bot nocht to an gearking gentill man,
That nether will he wirk, nor can:
Quhair throch the policy may incresse.

I am content sir be the mess:
Swa that the Spirituality,
Sets thairs in few als weill as we.

My Spiritual Lords are e content?

Na, na, we man take advysement
In sic maters for to conclude,
Ouir haistelie, we think nocht good.

Conclude e nocht with the Comon-weil
e salbe punischit be Sanct Geill.

Schir we can schaw exemptioun,
Fra our temporal punitioun:
The quhilk we purpois till debait.

Wa than, e think to strive for stair.
My Lords quhat say e to this play?

My soverane Lords we will obey,
And take our part with hart and hand,
Quhat ever e pleis us to command.
Bot we beseik ow Soveraine,
Of all our cryms that are bygaine
To gifvs an remissioun,
And heir we make to ow conditioun,
The Common-weill for till defend
From hence-forth till our lives end.

On that conditioun I am content
Till pardon ow sen e repent,
The Common-weill take be the hand,
And make with him perpetual band.
Iohne have e any ma debaits
Against the Lords of Spiritual stairs?
Iohne, Na sir I dar nocht speik an word
To plaint on Preistis it is na board:

Flyt on thy fow fill I desire the:
Swa that thou schaw bot the verity.

Grandmerces then I sall nocht spair,
First to compleine on the Vickair.
The pure Cottar being like to die,
Haifand young infants two or thrie:
And hes two ky but any ma,
The Vicar most haif an of thay:
With the gray frugge that covers the bed,
Howbeit the wise be purelie cled,
And gif the wife die on the morn,
Thocht all the bairns sold be forlorn,
The other kow he cleiks away
With the pure cot of raploch gray.
Wald God this custom war put down,
Quhilk never was found it be ressoun.

Are all thay tails true that thou tells?

True sir, the Devil stick me else*
For be the halie Trinity,
That same was practeisit on me.
For our Vicar God give him pine,
Hes it thrie tydie kye of mine.
An for my father and for my wife an other,
And the third cow he tuke for Mald my mother.

Our Person heir he takis na other pine,
Bot to ressaue his teinds and spend them syne.
Howbeit he be obleist be good ressoun,
To preich the Evangell to his parochoun.
Howbeit thay suld want preiching sevintin eir.
Our Persoun will not want an scheif of beir.

Our bishops with thair lusty rokats quhyte,
Thay flow in riches royally and delyte
Like Paradise bend thair palices and places,
And wants na pleasour of the fairest faces.
Als their Prelates hes great prerogatyues,
For quhy thay may depairt ay with thair wives:
Without any correctioun or damnage,
Syne take an other wantoner but marriage*
But doubt I wald think it an pleasant life,
Ay on quhen I list to part with my wife.
Syne take an other of far greiter beauty,
Bot ever alace my Lords that may not be,
For I am bund alace in marriage,
Bot thay like rams rudlie in thair rage.
Vnpysalt rinnis amang the silly owis,
Sa lang as kind of nature in them growis.

Thou lies falls huirsun raggit loun,
Thair is na Priests in all this toun,
That ever vsit sic vicious crafts.

the fiend ressaue thay flattrand chafts:
Sir Domine I trowit e had be dum.
Quhair Devil gat we this ill fairde blaitie bum?

To speik of Priests be sure it is na bourds:
Thay will burn men now for rakles words,
And all thay words are herisie in deid,

The mekil fiend resaue the saul that leid.
All that I say is true thocht thou be greifit,
And that I offer on thy pallet to preif it.

My lords quhy do e thoil that lurdun loun,
Of Kirk-men to speik sic detractioun.
I let ow wit my Lords it is na bourds,
Of Prelats for till speik sic wantoun words.
on villain puttis me out of Charity.

Quhy my Lord* sayis he ocht bot verity
e can nocht stop an pure man for till pleine
Gif he hes faltit, summoned him to our Seine.

ea that I sall, I make greit God a vow
He sall repent that he spak of the kow.
I will not suffer sic words of on villain.

I han gar gif me my thrie fat ky again.

Falls carl to speik to me stands thou not awe?

The fiend resaue them that first devysit that law
Within an hour efter my dade was deid
The Vicar had my kow hard be the heid.

Falls huirsun carl I say that law is good,
Because it hes been lang our consuetude:

Quhen I am Paip that law I sal put down
It is an sair law for the pure commoun.

I make an vow thay words thou sal repent.

I ow require my Lords be patient.
We came nocht heir for disputatiouns,
We came to make good reformatiouns.
Heirfoir of this our propositioun,
Conclude and put to executioun.

My Lords conclude that al the teporal lands
Be set in few to laboreris with thait hands.
With sic restrictiouns as sall be devysit,
That thay may live and nocht to be supprysit.
With an ressonabill augmentatioun,
And quhen thay heir an proclamatioun:
That the Kings grace dois make him for the weit,
That thay be ready with harness, bow and speir.
As for my self my Lord this I conclude.

Sa say we all our ressoun be sa good.
To make an Act on this we are content:

On that sir Scribe I take an instrument.
Quhat do e of the corspresent and kow?

I will conclude nathing of that as now
Without my Lord of Spirituality,
Thairto consent with all this haill clergy.
My Lord Bischop will e thairto consent?

Na, na, never till the day of Judgment.
We will want nathing that we have in use,
Kirtil nor kow, teind lamb, teind gryse nor guse.

Forsuith my lord I think we suldconclude,
Seeing this kow e have in consuetude:
We will decern heir that the Kings grace,
Sall write unto the Paipis holiness:
With his consent be proclamatioun,
Baith corspresent and cow we sall cry down.

To that my Lords we plainly disassent,
Noter thair of I take an instrument.

My lord be him that al the world hes wrocht,
We set nocht by quhider e consent or nocht:
e are bot an estait and we are two,
Et vbi mayor pars ibi tota.
My lords e haif richt prudentlie concludit,
Take tent now how the land is clein denudit:
Of gould and silver quhilk daily gais to Rome,
For buds, mair then the rest of Christindome.
War I an King sir be coks passioun,
I sold gar make an proclamatioun.
That never an penny sold go to Rome at all,
Na mair then did to Peter nor to Paull.
Da e nocht sa, heir for conclusioun
I gif ow all my braid black malesoun.

It is of treuth sirs, be my christindome,
That mekil of our money gais to Rome.
For we merchants I wait within our bounds,
Hes furneist Priests ten hundredth thousand punds.
For thair finnance, nane knawis sa weill as we:
Thairfoir my Lords devyse sum remedy.
For throw their playis and their promotioun,
Mair for denners nor for devotioun.
Sir Symonie hes maid with them an band,
The gould of weicht thay leid out of the land.
The Common-weil, thair throch bein sair oppressed
Thairfoir devyse remeid as e think best.

It is schort time sen any benefice,
Was sped in Rome except greit Bischopries.
Bot now for an unworthy Vickarage,
An Priest will rin to Rome in Pilgramage.
An cavell quhilk was never at the scule,
Will rin to Rome and keip an Bischops mule:
And syne cum home with money colorit crack,
With an buirdin of benefices on his back.
Quhilk been against the, law an man alane,
For till posses ma benefices norane.
Their greit commends I say withoutin faill,
Sold nocht be given bot to the blude Royal:
Sa I conclude my Lords and sayis for me,
e sold annull all this plurality.

The Paip hes given us dispensatiouns:

ea that is be our falls narratiouns.
Thocht the Paip for our pleasour will dispense,
I trow that can nocht cleir our conscience.
Advysemy Lords quhat e think to conclude,

Sir be my faith I think it very good,
That fra hence furth na Preistis sall pas to Rome.
Because our substance thay do stillconsume.
For pleyis and for thair profeit singulair,
Thay haif of money maid this realm bair.
And als I think it best be my advyse,
That ilk Priest sall haif bot an benefice.
And gif thay keip nocht that fundatioun,
It sall be cause of deprivatioun.

As e haif said my Lord we will consent,
Scribe make an act on this incontinent.

My Lords, thair is an thing it vnproponit
How Prelats and Preistis aucht to be disponit:
This beand done we have the les ado;
Quhat say e sirs* this is my counsall lo:
That or we end this present Parliament,
Of this matter to take ripe advysement.
Mark weill my Lords, thair is na benefice
Given to an man, bot for an good office.
Quha taks office and syne thay can nocht vsit,
Giver and taker I say are baith abusit.
An Bischops office is for to be an preichour,
And of the law of God an public teachour.
Rycht sa the Person unto his parochoun,
Of the Evangell sold leir them an lessoun.
Thair sold na man desire sic dignities,
Without he be abill for that office.
And for that cause, I say without leising,
Thay have thair teinds, and for na other thing.

Friend quhair find e that we suld prechours be

Luik quhat Sanct Paul wryts unto Timothie
Take thair the Buik let se gif e can spell.

I never red that, thairfoir reid it our sell.

Fidelis sermo, siquis Episcopatum desiderat, bonum opus desiderat, oportet eum
irreprehensibilem esse, vnius vxoris virum, sobrium, prudentem, ornatum,
pudicum, hospitalem, doctorem: non vinelentum, non percussorem: sed modestum.
That is This is a true saying, If any man desire the office of a Bishop, he
desires a worthy work: A Bishop therefore must be vnreproueable, the husband
of one wife, c.


e temporal men be him that heryit hell,
e are ovir peart with sik maters to mell.

Sit still my Lord, e neid not for till braull,
Their are the very words of th'Apostill Paull.

Sum sayis be him that wore the croun of thorne,
It had been good that Paull had neir been borne.

Bot e may know my Lord Sanct Paul's intent,
Schir red e never the New testament?

Na sir, be him that our Lord Iesus sauld,
I red never the New testament nor auld.
Nor ever thinks to do sir be the Rude,
I heir freiris say that reiding dois na good.

Till ow to reid them I think it is na lack,
For anis I saw them baith bund on our back:
That samin day that e was consecrat,
Sir, quhat meinis that?

The fiend stick them that wat.

Then befoir God how can e be excusit?
To haif an office and waits not how to us it.
Quhairfoir war gifin ow all the temporal lands?
And all their teinds e haif amang our hands.
Thay war giuin ow for other causses I weine,
Nor mummil matins and hald our clayis cleine.
e say to the Appostils that e succeid,
Bot e schaw nocht that into word nor deid.
The law is plain* our teinds suld furnisch teichours:

ea that it sold, or sustain prudent preichours.

Sir God nor I be stickit with an knife,
Gif ever our Persoun preichit in all his life.

Quhat devil raks the of our preiching vndocht?

Think e that e suld have the teinds for nocht?

Trowis thou to get remeid carl of that thing?

ea be Gods breid richt soon war I an King.

Wald thou of Prelats make deprivatioun?

Na I suld gar them keip thair fundatioun,
Quhat devil is this, quhom of sold Kings stand awe?
To do the thing that thay sold be the law.
War I an King be coks deir passioun,
I sold richt soon make reformatioun.
Faileand thairof our grace sold richt soon find,
That Priests sall leid ow like an belly blind*

Quhat gif King David war leiuand in their dayis?
The quhilk did found sa money gay Abayis:
Or out of heavin quhat gif he luikit down?
And saw the great abominatioun:
Amang their Abesses and their Nunries,
Thair public huirdomes and thair harlotries,
He wald repent he narrowit sa his bounds,
Of eirlie rent thries coir of thousand pounds.
His successors makes litill ruisse I ges,
Of his devotioun or of his holiness.

How dar thou carl presume for to declair,
Or for to mell the with sa heich a matter?
For in Scotland thair did it never ring,
I let the wit an mair excellent King.
Of holiness he was the very plant,
And now in heavin he is an michtfull Sanct.
Because that fyftein Abbasies he did found,
Quhair throw great riches hes ay done abound
Into our Kirk and daily it abunds,
Bot kings now I trow few Abbasies founds.
I dar weill say thou art condempnit in hell,
That dois presume with sic maters to mell.
Falls huirsun carl thou art ovir arrogant,
To judge the deids of sic an halie Sanct.

King Iames the first Roy of this Regioun,
Said that he was an sair Sanct to the croun.
I heir men say that the was sumthing blind,
That gave away mair nor he left behind.
His successors that halines did repent,
Quhilk gart them do great inconvenient.

My Lord Bishop I mervel how that e,
Suffer this carl for to speik heresy?
Forbe my faith my Lord will e take tent,
He servis for to be brunt incontinent.
e can nocht say bot it is heresy,
To speik against our law and liberty.

Sancte pater I make ow supplicatioun,
Exam on carl, syne make his dilatioun:
I make an vow to God omnipotent,
That bystour salbe brunt incontinent.
Venerabill father I sall do our command,
Gif he seruis deid I sall sun understand.
Falls huirsun carl schaw furth thy faith,

Me think e speik as e war wraith,
To ow I will nathing declair,
For e are nocht my ordinair*

Quhom in trowis thou falls monster mangit?

I trow to God to se the hangit:
War I an King be coks passioun,
I sold gar make an congregatioun,
Of all the freirs of the four ordouris,
And make ow vagers on the bordours,
Schir will e give me audience,
And I sall schaw our excellence:
Sa that our grace will give me leife
How into God that I belief.

Schaw furth our faith and feign e nocht.

I belief in God that all hes wrocht,
And creat every thing of nocht.
And in his Son our Lord Iesu,
Incarnat of the Virgin true:
Quha under Pilat tholit passioun,
And deit for our Salvatioun.
And on the third day raise again,
As halie scriptour schawis plane.
And als my Lord it is weill kend,
How he did to the heavin ascend:
And set him down at the richt hand,
Of God the father I understand.
And sall cum judge on Dumisday,
Quhat will e mair sir that I say?

Schaw furth the rest, this is na game.

I trow Sanctam Ecclesiam,
Bot nocht in their Bischops nor their Freirs,
Quhilk will for purging of their neirs.
[] Sard up the ta raw and down the other,
The mekill Devil resaue the fidder.

Say quhat e will sirs be Sanct Tan,
Me think Iohne an good Christian man.

My Lords let be our disputatioun,
Conclude with firm deliberaioun.
How Prelats fra thine sall be disponit:

I think for me evin as e first proponit.
That the Kings grace sall gif na benefice,
Bot till an peichour that can use that office.
The silly sauls that been Christis scheip,
Sold nocht be givin to gormand wolfis to keip.
Quhat been the cause of all the heresies,
Bot the abusioun of the prelacies?
Thay will correct and will nocht be correctit:
Thinkand to na prince thay will be subiectit.
Quhairfoir I can find na better remeid,
Bot that their kings man take it in thair heid.
That thair be given to na man bischopries,
Except thay preich out throch thair diosies.
And ilk person priech in his parochon,
And this I say for final conclusion.

We think our counsall is very good,
As e have said we all conclude.
Of this conclusioun Noter we make an act:

I write all day bot gets never an plack.

Och, my Lords for the halie Trinity,
Remember to reform the consistory,
It hes mair neid of reformatioun,
Nor Ploutois court sir be coks passioun.

Quhat cause hes thou falls pellour for to pleine
Quhair was e ever summoned to thair seine?

Marie I lent my gossop my mere to fecth home coills
And he her drounit into the querrell hollis.
And I ran to the Consistory for to pleine,
And thair I happinit amang an greidie meine.
Thay gave me first an thing thay call citandum,
Within aucht dayis I gat bot lybellandum*
Within an month I gat ad opponendum,
In half an eir I gat interloquendum,
And syne I gat, how call e it? ad replicandum:
Bot I could never an word it understand him.
And than thay gart me cast out many plackis,
And gart me pay for four and twenty actis.
Bot or thay came half gait to concludendum,
The fiend an plack was left for to defend him.
Thus thay postponit me two eir with thair train,
Syne body ad octo bad me cum again.
And than their ruiks thay roupit wonder fast,
For sentence silver thay cry it at the last.
Of pronunciandum thay maid me wonder fain,
Bot I gat never my good gray meir again.

My Lords we mon reform their consistory lawis,
Quhais great defame above the heavins blawis.
I wist an man in persewing an kow,
Or he had done he spendit half an bow.
Sa that the kings honour we may advance,
We will conclude, as thay have done in France.
Let Sprituall maters pas to Spritualitie,
And Temporal maters to Temporalitie.
Quha faileis of this sall cost them of thair good,
Scribe make an act, for sa we will conclude.

That act my Lords plainly I will declait,
It is again is our profeit singulair.
We will nocht want our profeit be Sanct Geill.
Temporalitie our profeit is against the Common weil
It salbe done my Lords as e have wrocht,
We cure nocht quhidder e consent or nocht.
Quhairfoir servis then all their Temporal Judges?
Gif temporal maters sold seik at ow refuges.
My Lord e say that e are Sprituall,
Quhairfoir mell e than with things temporal?
As we have done conclude sa sall it stand,
Scribe put our Acts in ordour evin fra hand.

Till all our acts plainly I disassent,
Notar thairof I take an instrument.

My Soverane I beseik our excellence,
Use Justice on Spritualitie:
The quhilk to us hes done great violence,
Because we did rehers the verity.
Thay put us close into Captivity,
And sa remanit into subiectioun:
Into great langour and calamity,
Till we war fred be King Correctioun.

My lord I haif great cause for to complain,
I could get na ludging intill this land:
The Spiritual stait had me sa at disdane,
With Dame Sensual thay have maid sic an band.
Amang them all na freindschip sirs I fand,
And quhen I came the nobill innis amang,
My Iustie Lady Priores fra hand:
Out of her do rtour durlie scho me dang.

With the advyse sir of the Parliament,
Hairtlie we make ow supplicatioun:
Cause King Correctioun take incontinent,
Of all this sort examinatioun.
Gif thay be digne of deprivatioun,
e have power for to correct sic cases:
Chease the may cunning Clerks of this natioun,
And put mair prudent pastors in thair places.
My prudent Lords I say that pure craftsmen,
Abufe sum Prelats are mair for to commend:
Gar exam them and sa e sall sun ken,
How thay in vertew Bischops dois transcend.

Thy life and craft make to their Kings kend,
Quhat craft hes thow declair that to me plain?

An tailor sir that*can baith make and mend,
I wait nane better into Dumbartane.

Quhairfoir of taileours beirs thou the still?

Because I wait is nane within an mile,
Can better use that craft as I suppois:
For I can make baith doublit coat and hois.

How cal thay ou sir with the schaiping knife?

An sowtar sir, nane better into Fyfe.

Tel me quhairfoir an sowtar e are namit?

Of that surname I neld nocht be aschamit.
For I can make schone brotekins and buittis,
Gif me the copy of the Kings cuittis.
And e sall se richt sun quhat I can do:
Heir is my lasts and weill wrocht ledder lo*

O Lord my God this is an mervelous thing
How sic misordour in this Realm sold ring.
Sowtars and tail ours thay are far mair expert
In thair pure craft and in thair handy art,
Nor are our Prelatis in thair vocatioun:
I pray ow sirs make reformatioun.

Alace, alace, quhat gars their temporal Kings
Into the Kirk of Christ admit sic doings?
My Lords for lufe of Christs passioun,
Of their ignorants make depriuatioun.
Quhilk in the court can*do bot flatter and fleich,
And put into thair places that can preich.
Send furth and seik sum devoit cunning Clarks,
That can steir up the peopill to good warks.

As e have done, Madame I am content,
Hoaw Diligence pas hynd incontinent.
And seik out throw all towns and cities:
And visie all the universities.
Bring us sum Doctors of Divinity.
With licents in the law and Theology.
With the may cunning Clarks in all this land,
Speid sun our way and bring them heir fra hand.

Quhat gif I find sum halie provincial?
Or minister of the gray freiris all?
Or any freir that can preich prudentlie,
Sall I bring them with me in cumpanie?

Cair thou nocht quhat estait sa ever he be,
Sa thay can teich and preich the verity,
May cunning Clarks with us is best beluifit,
To dignity thay salbe first promuifit.
Quhidder thay be Munk, Channon, Priest or Freir,
Sa thay can preich faill nocht to bring them heir.

Than fair-weill sir, for I am at the flicht,
I pray the Lord to send ow all good nicht.

Sir we beseik our soverane celsitude,
Of our dochtours to have compassioun:
Quhom we may na way marie be the Rude,
Without we make sum alienatioun
Of our land for thair supportatioun,
For quhy? the markit raisit been sa hie
That Prelats dochtours of this natioun,
Are maryit with sic superfluity:
Thay will nocht spair to gif two thousand pound,
With thair dochtours to an nobill man:
In riches sa thay do superabound.
Bot we may nocht do sa be Sanct Allane,
Their proud Prelats our dochters sair* may ban;
That thay remain at home sa lang vnmaryit:
Schir let our Barrouns do the best thay can,
Sum of our dochtours I dreid salbe miscaryit.

My Lord our complaint is richt ressonabill,
And richt sa to our dochtours profitabill:
I think or I pas aff this natioun,
Of this matter till make reformatioun.

Ga by the gait man, let me gang,
[] How Devil came I into this thrang:
With sorrow I may sing my sang,
And I be taine:
For I have run baith nicht and day,
Throw speid of fut I gat away,
Gif I be kend heir, wallaway
I will be slain.

Quhat is thy name man be thy thrift?

Huirsun thay call me common thift:
For quhy I had na other schift,
Sen I was borne,
In Eusdaill was my dwelling place,
Money an wife gart* I cry alace:
At my hand thay gat never grace,
Bot ay for lorn.
Sum say is an king is cum amang us,
That purposis to head and hang us:
Thair is na grace gif he may fang us
Bot on an pin.
Ring he, we theifiswill get na good,
I pray God and the halie Rude,
He had been smoird into his cude,
And all his kin.
Get this cursed King me in his grippis,
My craig will wit quhat weyis my hippist
The Devil I gif his tongue and lippis,
That of me tellis:
Adieu I dar na langer tarry:
For be I kend thay will me carry,
And put me in an sierie farie,

Will na good fallow to me tell,
Quhair I may find
The Earl of Rothus best haiknay,
That was my earand heir away:
He is richt starck as I heir say
And swift as wind.
Heir is my brydill and my spurris,
To gar him lance ovir land and furris:
Micht I him get to Ewis durris, I take na cuir:
Of that horse micht I get an sicht,
I haife na doubt it or midnicht,
That he and I sold take the flicht
Throch Dysert mure.
Of cumpanarie tell me brother,
Quhilk is the richt way to the Strother,

Gif I micht speid:

To get my Lord Lindesay is broun Ionet:

Forsuith the kings majesty,
Hes set me heir as e may se:
Micht I speik Temporalitie,

Put in our leg into my place,
And heir I sweir be Gods grace,

Syne let ow wend.

Than master deir gif me our hand,
And make to me an faithful band,
That e sall cum agane fra hand
Withoutin faill:

Take thair my hand richt faithfully
Als I promit the verelie,
To gif to the an cuppill of kye
In Liddisdaill.
Haif I nocht maid an honest schift,
That hes betrasit common Thift?
For thair is nocht under the lift,
An curster cors:

Hes stolen an thousand scheip and ky,
By meiris and horse.
Wald God I war baith sound and haill,
Now liftit into Liddisdaill
The Mers sold find me beif and kaill,
Quhat rak of bread:
War I thair liftit with my life,
The Devil sold stick me with an knife
And ever I come again to Fyfe,
Quhill I war dead.
Adieu I leife the Devil amang ow,
That in his fingers he may fang ow:
With all leill men that dois belang ow,
For I may few:
That ever I came into this land,
For quhy e may weill understand,
I gat na gear to turn my hand:

Sir, I have brocht unto our Excellence,
Their famous Clarks of greit intelligence:
For to the common peopill thay can preich,
And in the Scuilis in Latin tongue can teich*
This is an Doctor of Divinity,
And their two Licents men of gravity.

Of godly lawis, conforme to thair vocatioun:

Into the quhilk I salbe diligent.
And quha saever beis inobedient,
And will nocht suffer for to be correctit,
Thay salbe all deposit incontinent,
And from our presence they sall be deiectit.

Begin first at the Spritualitie,
And take of them examinatioun,
Gif they can use their divyne dewetie,
And als I make ow supplicatioun,

Of them make haistie depriuatioun:
Sa that the peopill be na mair abusit.

Of thair office till any King make count?
Bot of my office gif e wald have the feill,

For I take in my count twyse in the eir,
Wanting nocht of my teind an boll of beir.

With all that dois perteine my benefice,
Consider now my Lord gif I be wise.

An thing thair is my Lord that e may know.
Howbeit I dar nocht plainly spouse an wife,

And all my dochters maryit upon lords.

To that intent that thay with all thair hart,
In richt and wrang sal plainly take my part.

Of my office e hear na mair quhill Pasche.

My Lords this Abbot and this Priores
Thay scorn thair gods, this is my reason quhy,
Thay bear an habit of feineit halines,
And in thair deid thay do the contrary:
For to live chaist thay vow solemnitly,
Bot fra that thay be sikker of thair bowis
Thay live in huirdome and in harlotry,
Examine them Sir, how thay observe thair vowis.

Sir Scribe e sall at Chastities requeist
Pas and exam on thrie in gudlie haist.

Father Abbot this counsall bids me speir,
How e have vsit our Abbay thay wald heir.
And als their Kings hes giuin to me commissioun,
Of our office for to make inquisitioun.

Tuiching my office I say to ow plainly,
My Monks and I, we leif richt easelie:
Thair is na Monks from Carrick to Carraill
That fairs better and drinks mair helsum Aill.
My Prior is an man of great devotioun,
Thairfoir daily he gets an double portioun.

My Lords how have e keipt our thrie vows

Indeid richt weill till I gat home my bows.
In my Abbay quhen I was sure professor,
Then did I leife as did my predecessor.
My paramours is baith als fat and fair,
As any wench into the toun of Air.
I send my sons to Pareis to the scullis,
I traist in God that thay salbe na fuillis,
And all my douchters I have weill providit,
Now judge e gif my office be weill gydit.

Master Person schaw us gif e can preich?

Thocht I preich not I can play at the caiche:
I wait thair is nocht an amang ow all,
Mair ferilie can play at the fut ball:
And for the carts the tabils and the dyse,
Above all persouns I may beir the pryse.
Our round bonats we make them now four nuickit
Of richt fine stuiff gif ow list cum and luikit.
Of my office I have declarit to the,
Speir quhat e pleis, e get na mair of me.

Quhat say e now my Lady Priores?
How have e vsit our office can e ges?
Quhat was the cause e refusit harbrie?
To this young lusty Lady Chastity.

I wald have harborit her with good intent,
Bot my complexioun thairto wald not assent:
I do my office efter auld use and wount,
To our Parliament I will make na mair count.

Now cause sum of our cunning Clarks
Quhilk are expert in heavinlie warks,
And men fulfil it with charity
That can weill preiche the verity,
And gifto sum of them command
An sermon for to make fra-hand.

As e have said I am content,
To gar sum preich incontinent,
Magister noster I ken how e can teiche,
Into the scuillis and that richt ornatlie:
I pray ow now that e wald please to preiche,
In Inglisch tongue, land folk to edify.

Soverane I sall obey ow humbillie,
With an schort sermon presently in this place:
And schaw the word of God vnfeineitlie,
And sinceirlie as God will give me grace.
Si vis ad vitam ingredi serva mandata. Devoit peopill Sanct Paull the
preichour sayis,
The fervent luife and father lie pity,
Quhilk God almichtie hes schawin money wayis
To man in his corrupt fragility,
Exceids all luife in earth, sa far that we
May never to God make recompense conding
As quhasa lists to reid the verity,
In halie Scripture he may find this thing.
Sic Deus dilexit mundum. Tuiching nathing the great prerogative,
Quhilk God to man in his creatioun lent:
How man of nocht creat superlative
Was to the Image of God omnipotent
Let us consider that special luife ingent,
God had to man quhen our foir-father fell,
Drawing us all in his loynis immanent,
Captive from gloir in thirlage to the hell.
Quhen Angels fell, thair miserabil ruin
Was never restorit: bot for our misery,
The Sun of God secund person divyne,
In an pure Virgin tuke humanity:
Syne for our saik great harmis suffered he
In fasting, walking, in preiching, cauld and heit,
And at the last an schamefull death deit he,
Betwixt two theifis on Croce he eild the Spreit:
And quhair an drop of his may precious blude
Was recompense sufficient and conding,
An thousand warlds to ransoun from that wod
Infernal fiend, Satan, notwithstanding
He luifit us sa, that for our ransoning,
He sched furth all the blude of his body,
Riven rent and sair wondit quhair he did hang,
Naild on the Croce on the Mont Calvary.
Et copiosa apud eum redemption. O cruel death, be the the venomous
Dragon, the Devil infernal lost his pray:
Be the the stinkand, mirk, contageous,
Deip pit of hell mankynd escaipit fray.
Be the the port of Paradise alsway
Was patent maid unto the heavin sa hie:
Opinnit to man and maid an ready way,
To gloir eternal with th'haly Trinity.
And it for all thisluife incomparabill,
God askis na rewaird fra us again
Bot luife for luife: in his command but fabill,
Conteinit are all haill the lawis ten:
Baith ald and new and commandments ilk an,
Luife been the ledder quhilk hes bot steppis two:
Be quhilk we may clim up to life again,
Out of this vaill of misery and wa.
Diliges Dominum Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo proximum tuum sicut teipsum: in
his duobus mandatis. c. The first step suithlie of this ledder is,
To luife thy God as the fontaine and well
Of luife and grace: and the secund I wis,
To luife thy nichtbour as thou luifis thy sell,
Quha tynis an stop of their two gais to hell,
Bot he repent and turn to Christ anon,
Hold this na fabill, the halie Evangell
Bears in effect their words every one.
Si vis ad vitam ingredi serva mandata Dei. Thay tyne their steps all thay quha
ever did sin
In pride, invy, in ire and lechery:
In covetice or any extreme win,
Into sweirnes or into gluttony.
Or quha dois nocht the deids of mercy,
Gif hungry meit and gif the naikit clayis.

Now walloway thinks thou na schame to lie*
[] I trow the Devil a word is true thou sayis:
Thou sayis thair is bot two steppis to the heavin
Quha faileis them man backwards fall in hell,
I wait it is ten thousand mylis and sevin
Gif it be na mair, I do it upon thy sell.
Schort leggit men I se be Bryds bell,
Will nevir cum thair, thay steppis been sa wide:
Gif thay be the words of the Evangell,
The Sprituall men hes mister of an gyde.

And I belief that cruikit men and blind,
Sall never get up upon sa hich an ledder:
By my good faith I dreid to lie behind,
Without God draw me up into an tedder.
Quhat and I fall, than I will break my bledder:
[] And I cum thair this day the Devil speid me:
Except God make me lichter nor an whether,
Or send me down good Widcok wingis to fly.

Cum down dastart and gang sell draiff,
I understand nocht quhat thow said.
Thy words war nather corn nor caiff,
I wald thy tongue again war laid*
Quhair thou sayis pride is deidlie sin,
I say pride is bot honesty.
And Covetice of warldlie win
Is bot wisdom, I say for me.
Ire, hardiness and gluttony,
Is nathing ellis but lyfis fude:
The natural sin of lechery
Is bot true luife, all their are good.

God and the Kirk hes giuin command,
That all good Christian men refuse them:

Bot war thay sin I understand,
We men of Kirk wald never use them.

Brother I pray the Trinity,
our faith and charity to support:
Causand ow know the verity,
That e our subjects may comfort.
To our prayers peopill I recommend,
The rewlars of this nobill regioun:
That our Lord God his grace mot to them send,
On trespassours to make punitioun.
Prayand to God from fiends ow defend,
And of our sins to gif ow full remissioun:
I say na mair, to God I ow commend.

My lords, I persaue that the Sprituall stait,
Be way of deid purpois to make debait:
For be the counsall of on flattrand freir,
Thay purpois to make all this toun on steir.

Traist e that thay will be inobedient,
To that quhilkis* decreitit in Parliament?

Thay se the Paip with awful ordinance
Makis weir against the michtie King of France:
Richt sa thay think that prelats suld nocht sunie
Be way of deid defend thair patrimony.

I pray the brother gar me understand,
Quhair ever Christ possessit an fut of land.

ea that he did father withoutin fail,
For Christ Iesus was King of Israell.

I grant that christ was king abuse al kings
Bot he mellit never with temporal things:
As he hes plain lie done declair him sell,
As thou may reid in his halie Evangell.
Birds hes thair nests, and tods hes thair den,
Bot Christ Iesus the Saviour of men
In all this world hes nocht an penny braid,
Quhair on he may repois his heavinlie head.

And is that true? --
-- es brother be Alhallows:
Christ Iesus had na property bot the gallows.
And left not quhen he eildit up the Spreit,
To by himself an simpill winding scheit.

Christs successors I understand,
Thinks na schame to have temporal land.
Father thay have na will I ow assure,
In this world to be indigent and pure:
Bot sir sen e are callit sapient,
Declair to me the cause with true intent*
Quhy that my lusty Lady Verity,
Hes nocht been weill treatit in this country?

Forsuith quhair Prelats uses the counsall
Of beggand freirs in money regioun,
And thay Prelats with Princes principal,
The verity but doubt is trampit down.
And Common-weill put to confusioun.
Gif this be true to ow I me report:
Thairfoir my Lords make reformatioun,
Or e depart hairtlie I ow exhort:
Sirs, freirs wald never I ow assure,
That any Prelats vsit preiching:
And Prelats tuke on them that cure,
Freirs wald get nathing for thair fleiching.
Thairfoir I counsall ow fra hand,
Banische on freir out of this land,
And that incontinent:
Do e nocht sa withoutin weir,
He will make all this toun on steir,
I know his falls intent.
on Priores withoutin fabill,
I think scho is nocht profitabill,
For Christis regioun.
To begin reformatioun,
Make of them deprivatioun,
This is my opinioun.

Sir pleis e that we two invaid them,
And e sall se us soon degraid them,
Of coill and chaplarie?

Pas on Jam richt weill content,
Syne banische them incontinent
Out of this country.

Cum on sir freir and be nocht fleyit,
The King our master mon be obeyit,
Bot e sall have na harm:
Gif e wald travel fra toun to toun,
I think this hude and heavy goun
Will hald our wambe ovir warm*

Freir Now quhat is this that their monster meins?
I am exemptit fra Kings and Queens,
And fra all humane law:

Take e the hude and I the gown,
This limmer luiks als like an lown,
As any that ever I saw.

Their freirs to chaip punitioun,
Haulds them at their exemptioun,
And na man will obey:
Thay are exempt I ow assure,
Baith fra Paip, king and Empreour,
And that makes all the pley.

On Dumisday quhen Christ sall say
Venite benedicti: The Freirs will say without delay
Nos sumus exempts.
Sir be the halie Trinite,
This same is feineit Flattrie,
I ken him be his face:
Beleiuand for to get promotioun,
He said that his name was Devotioun,
And sa be gylit our grace,

Cum on my Lady Priores,
We sall leir ow to dance:
And that within an lytill space,
An new pavin of France.
Now brother be the Mass,
Be my judgment I think
This halie Priores
Is turnit in an cowclink.

I gif my friends my malisoun,
That me compellit to be an Nun
And wald nocht let me marie:
It was my friends greadines,
That gart me be an Priores,
Now hartlie them I wary.
Howbeit that Nunnis sing nichts and dayis,
Thair hart waitis nocht quhat thair mouth sayis
The suith I ow declair:
Makand ow intimatioun,
To Christis congregatioun,
Nunnis are nocht necessair*
Bot I sall do the best I can,
And marie sum good honest man,
And brew good aill and tun:
Marriage be my opinioun,
It is better Religoun,
As to be freir or Nun.

My Lords for Gods saik let not hang me
Howbeit that widdiefows wald wrang me
I can make na debait:
To win my meat at pleuch nor harrowis,
Bot I sall help to hang my marrowis,
Baith Falset and Dissait.

Than pas thy way greath the gallous
Syne help for to hang up thy fellow is,
Thou gets na other grace:
Of that office I am content,
Bot our Prelates I dread repent,
Be I fleimde from thair face.

Now Flattrie my auld companeoun,
Quhat dois on King Correctioun?
Knawis thou nocht his intent?
Declair to us of thy novellis:
e'ile all be hangit, I se nocht ellis,
And that incontinent.

Now walloway will e gar hang us?
[] she Devil brocht on cursed king amang us,
For mekill sturt and strife:

I had been put to deid amang ow,
War nocht I tuke on hand till hang ow,
And sa I saisit my lyse.
I heir them say thay will cry down,
All freirs and Nunnis in this Regioun,
Sa far as I can feill:
Because thay are nocht necessair,
And als thay think thay are contrair,
To Iohne the common-weill.

With the advice of King Humanity,
Heir I determine with ripe advysement,
That all their Prelats sall deprivit be,
And be decreit of this present Paliament,
That their thrie cunning Clarks sapient
Immediately thair places sall posses:
Because that thay have been sa negligent,
Suffering the word of God for till decres.

As e have said but dout it salbe done,
Pas to and make this interchainging soon.

My Lords we pray ow to be patient,
For we will do the Kings commandment.

I make an vow to God and e us handill,
e sallbe cursed and gragit with buik and candill:
Syne we sall pas unto the Palp and pleinie,
And to the Devil of hell condemn this meine*
For quhy sic reformatioun as I weine
Into Scotland was never hard nor seine.

We mervell of ow paintit sepulturis,
That was sa bald for to accept sic cuiris.
With glorious habit rydand upon our Muillis,
Now men may se e are bot very fuillis.

We say the Kings war greiter fuillis nor we
That us promovit to sa greit dignity.

Thair is an thousand in the kirk but doubt,
Sic fuillis as'we gif thay war weill socht out,
Now brother sen it may na better be,
Let us gasoup with Sensuality.

Madame I pray ow make us thrie good cheir,
We cure nocht to remain with ow all eir.

Pas fra us fuillis be him that hes us wrocht
e ludge nocht heir, because I know ow nocht.

Sir Covetice will e also misken me?
I wait richt weill e will baith gif and len me:
Speid hand my friend spair nocht to break the lockis,
Gif me an thousand crouns out of my box.

Quhairfoit sir fuil gif ow an thousand crowns*
Ga hence e seime to be thrie very lowns.

I se nocht else brother withoutin faill,
Bot this falls world is turnit top ouir taill:
Senall is vain that is under the lift,
To win our meat we man make other schift.
With our labour except we make debait,
I dreid full sair we want baith drink and meat.

Gif with our labour we man us defend,
Then let us gang quhair we war never kend.

I wit their freirs that I am thus abusit,
For by thair counsall I have been confusit.
Thay gart me trow it suffysit* allace,
To gar them plainly preich into my place.

Allace, this reformatioun I may wary,
For I have it two dochters for to marie*
And thay are baith contractit be the Rude,
And waits nocht how to pay thair tocher-gude.

The Devil make cair for this unhappy chance,
For I am young and thinks to pas to France.
And take wages amang the men of weir,
And win my living with my sword and speir.

Or e depairt sir aff this Regioun,
Gif Iohne the Common-weill an gay garmoun:
Because the Common-weill hes been overluikit,
That is the cause that Common-weill is cruikit.
With singular profeit he hes been sa supprysit,
That he is baith cauld, naikit and disgysit.

As e have said father I am content,
Sergeants gif Iohne an new abuilement.
Of Sating, Damais or of the Velvot fine,
And gif him place in our Parliament syne.
All virtuous peopil now may be reioisit,
Sen Common-weill hes gottin an gay garmoun:
And ignorants out of the Kirk deposit,
Devoit Doctors and Clarks of renoun
Now in the Kirk sall have dominioun:
And Gude-counsall with Lady Verity
Are professed with our kings Majesty.
Blist is that Realm that hes an prudent King,
Quhilk dois delyte to heir the verity,
Punisching tha me that plainly dois maling,
Contrair the Common-weill and equity.
Thair may na peopill have prosperity,
Quhair ignorance hes the dominioun,
And comon-weil be tyrants trampit down.
Now masters e sall heir incontinent,
At great leysour in our presence proclamit
The Nobill Acts of our Parliament,
Of quhilks we neid nocht for to be aschamit*
Cum heir trumpet sound our warning tone
That every man may know quhat he have done.

IT is devysit be their prudent Kings,
Correctioun and King Humanity,
That thair Leigis enduring all thair Ringis,
With the avyce of the estaits thrie
Sall manfully defend and fortify
The Kirk of Christ and his Religioun,
Without dissimulance or hypocrisy:
Under the pain of thair punitioun.
Als thay will that the Acts honorabill,
Maid be our Prince in the last Parliament,
Because thay are baith good and profitabill,
Thay willl that every man be diligent
Them till observe with vnseineit intent.
Quha disobey is inobedientlie
Be thair law is but doubt thay sall repent*
And painis conteinit thairin sall vnderly.
And als the Common-weil for till advance,
It is statute that all the Temporal lands,
Be set in few efter the form of France
Till virtuous men that labours with thair hands*
Resonabillie restrictit with sic bands,
That thay do service nevertheles
And to besubiect ay under the wands:
That riches may with policy incres.
Item this prudent Parliament hes devysit,
Gif Lords halds under thair dominioun
Theifis, quhair throch puir peopil bein supprisit:
For them thay sall make answeir to the croun,
And to the pure make restitutioun:
Without thay put them in the judges hands*
For thair default to suffer punitioun,
Sa that na theifis remain within thair lands.
To that intent that Justice sold incres
It is concludit in this Parliament,
That into Elgin or into Innernesse
Sall be an suit of Clarks sapient,
Togidder with an prudent Precident
To do justice in all the Norther Airtis,
Sa equally without impediment,
That thay neid nocht seik justice in their pairts.
With licence of the Kirks halines,
That justice may be done continually,
All the maters of Scotland mair and les,
To their two famous saits perpetually
Salbe directit, because men says plainly,
Their wantoun Nunnis are na way necessair,
Till Common-weill nor it to the glory
Of Christs Kirk, thocht thay be fat and fair.
And als that fragill ordour feminine,
Will nocht be missit in Christs Religioun,
Thair rents vsit till an better fine:
For Common-weill of all this Regioun.
Ilk Senature for that erectioun,
For the vphalding of thair gravity
Sall have five hundredth mark of pensioun.
And also bot two sall thair nummer be
Into the North saxteine sall thair remain,
Saxtein rycht sa in our may famous toun
Of Edinburgh to serve our Soveraine:
Chosen without partial affectioun
Of the may cunning Clarks of this Regioun:
Thair Chancellar chosen of an famous Clark,
An cunning man of great perfectioun,
And for his pensioun have an thousand mark.
It is devysit in this Parliament,
From this day furth na matter Temporal
Our new Prelats thairto hes done consent
Cum befoir Judges consistoriall,
Quhilk hes been sa prolixt and partial:
To the great hurt of the community:
Let Temporal men seik Judges Temporal*
And Sprituall men to Spritualitie.
Na benefice beis giffin in time cumming,
Bot to men of good eruditioun:
Expert in the halie Scripture and cunning,
And that thay be of good conditioun:
Of public vices but suspitioun,
And qualefiet richt prudentlie to preich,
To thair awin folk baith into land and toun
Or ellis in famous scuillis for to teich:
Als because of the great plurality
Of ignorant Priests ma then an Legioun.
Qi hair throch of Teicheouris the heich dignity,
Is vilipendit in ilk Regioun*
Thairfoir our Court hes maid provisioun,
That na Bshops make teichours in time cumming:
Except men of good eruditioun,
And for Preistheid qualefeit and cunning*
Siclyke as e se in the borrows toun
An Taileour is nocht sufferit to remain,
Without he can make doublet, coat and gown,
He man gang till his prenteischip again:
Bischops sold nocht ressaue me think certain,
Into the Kirk except an cunning Clark:
An idiot priest Essay compaireth plain,
Till an dum dog that can nocht byte nor bark.
From this day furth se na Prelats pretend,
Under the pain of inobedience
At Prince or Paip to purchase an command
Again the kow because it dois offence:
Till any Priest we think sufficience
And benefice for to serve God withal,
Two Prelatssall na man have from thence,
Without that he be of the blude Royal.
Item this prudent counsall hes concludit,
Sa that our haly Vickars be nocht wraith
From this day furth thay salbe clean denudit
Baith of corspresent cow and vmest claith.
To pure commons because it hath done skaith
And mairouer we think it lytill force,
Howbeit the Barrouns thairto will be laith,
From thine-furth thay sall want thair hyrald horse.
It is decreit that in this Parliament
Ilk Bischop* Minister, Prior and Persoun*
To the effect thay may take better tent
To saulis under thair dominioun,
Efter the form of thair fundatioun,
Ilk Bischop in his Diosie sall remain:
And everilk Person in his parachoun,
Teiching thair folk from vices to refrain.
Because that clarks our substance dois consume
For bills and process of thair prelacies:
Thairfoir thair sall na money ga to Rome
From this day furth or any benefice:
Bot gif it be for greit Archbischopries,
As for the rest na money gais at all:
For the incressing of thair dignities,
Na mair nor did to Peter nor to Paull.
Considering yat our Priests for the may part
Thay want the gift of Chastity wese:
Cupido hes sa perst them throch the hart,
We grant them licence and fry liberty,
That thay may have fair Virgins to thair wyfis:
And sa keip matrimonial Chastity,
And nocht in huirdome for to leid thair lyfis.
This Parliament richt sa hes done conclude
From this day forth our Barrouns temporal,
Sall na mair mix thair nobil ancient blude
With bastard bairns of Stait Spiritual:
Ilk stait amang thair awin selfis marie sall,
Gif Nobils marie with the Spritualitie,
From thine subject thay salbe, and all
Sal be degraithit of thair Nobility.
And from amang the Nobils cancellit:
Unto the time thay by thair liberty,
Rehabilit be the civil magistrate
And sa sall marie the Spirituality.
Bichops with bischops sall make affinity,
Abbots and Priors with the Priores:
As Bischop Annas in Scripture we may se,
Maryit his dochter on Bischop Caiphas.
Now have e heard the Acts honorabill,
Devysit in this present Parliament,
To Common-weill we think agreabill:
All faithful folk sold heirof be content,
Them till observe with hartlie true intent,
I wait nane will against our Acts rebel,
Nor till our law be inobedient,
Bot Plutois band the potent prince of hell.

I gif ow my braid bennesoun,
That hes givin Common-weill a goun:
I wald nocht for an pair of plackis,
e had nocht maid this nobill Actis.
I pray to God and sweit Sanct Geill,
To gif ow grace to use them weill:
Were thay weill keipit I understand,
It war great honour to Scotland.
It had been als good e had sleipit,
As to make acts and be nocht keipit:
Bot I beseik ow for Alhallows,
To heid Dissait and hang his fellows.
And banische Flattrie aff the toun,
For thair was never sic an loun.
That beand done I hold it best,
That every man ga to his rest.
Correctioun* As thou hes said it salbe done,
Suyith Sergeants hang on swingeours soon.

Cum heir sir Thief, cum heir, cum heir
Quhen war e wont to be sa sweir?

Slip in thy head into this coird:
For thou had never an meiter tippit,

Allace this is an felon rippit.
The widdifow wairdanis tuke my gear,
And left me nether horse nor meir:
Nor earthly good that me belangit,
Now walloway I man be hangit.
Repent our lyfis, e plain oppressors,
All e misdoras and transgreslours:
Or ellis gar choose ow good confessors,
And make ow forde:
For gif e tarry in this land,
And cum under Correctiouns hand:

Adieu my brethren common theifis,

Adieu Grosars, Nicksons and Bellis
Oft have we run out-thoart the fellis.
Adieu Robsonis, Haues and Pyslilis

Adieu all theifis that me belangs*

Speid hand man with thy clitter clatter.

For Gods saik sir let me make watter.
Howbeit I have been cattel-gredie
It schamis to pische into an widdie.

Cum heir Dissait my companeoun
Saw ever an man liker an loun?
To hang upon an gallows:

This is aneuch to make me mangit,
Duill fell me, that I man be hangit,
Let me speik with my fallows.

Adieu my masters merchant men,

Fra time e want Dissait.
I leirit ow merchants money an while,

Upon an markit day:
And gar them trow our stuff was good,
Quhen it was rottin be the Rude,
And sweir it was nocht sway.

And leirit ow for to ban and sweir,
Quhat our gear cost in France:
Howbeit the Devil an word was true,

Wald turn ow to mischance.
I leirit ow wyllis many fauld,
To mix the new wine and the auld,
That faschioun was na folly:
To sell richt deir and by good*chaip,
And mix Ry-meill amang the saip,
And Saiffrone with Oyl-dolie.
Foret nocht ocker I counsall ow,
Mair then the vicker dois the kow,
Or Lords thair doubill maill:
Howbeit our elwand be too scant,
Or our pound wecht thrie vnces want,
Think that bot lytill faill.
Adieu the greit Clan Iamesone,
The blude Royal of Clappertoun,
I was ay to ow true:
Baith Andersone and Patersone,
Above them all Thome Williamsone,
My absence e will few.
Thome Williamsone it is our pairt,
To pray for me with all our hairt,
And think upon my warks:
How I leirit ow an good lessoun,
For to beguile in Edinburgh toun,
The Bischop and his Clarks.
e young merchants may cry allace,
For wanting of our wonted grace,
on cursed King e may ban:
Had I leifit bot half an eir
I sold have leirit ow crafts perqueir,
To beguile wife and man.
How may e merchants make debait?
Fra time e want our man Dissait,
For ow I make great cair:
Without I rise fra deid to life,
I wait weill e will never thryfe,
Farther nor the fourth air.

Cum heir Falset mence the gallows,
e man hang up amang our fallows,
For our cankart conditioun:
Money an true man have e wragnit,
Thairfoir but doubt e salbe hangit,
But mercy or remissioun.

Allace, man I be hangit to?
Quhat mekill Devil is this ado?
How came I to this cummer?
My good masters e crafts men,
Want e Falset full weill I ken,

Quhen e want me e want our grace:
Thairfoir put into write:
My lessouns that I did ow leir,
Howbeit the commons eyne e bleir,
Count e nocht that an myte.
Find me an Wobster that is leill,
Orane Walker that will nocht steill,
Thair craftines I ken:
Or an Millair, that is na fault,
That will nather steill meall nor malt,
Hold them for halie men.
At our fleschers take e na grief,
Thocht thay blaw lean mutton and beife,
That thay seime fat and fair:
Thay think that practick bot an mow,
Howbeit the Devil a thing it dow,
To thame I leirit that lair.
I leirit Taileours in every toun,
To schaip five quarters in an goun,
In Angus and in Fyfe:
To vplands Taileours I gave good leife,
To steill an silly stump or sleife,
Unto kittok his wife.
My good master Andro Fortoun,
Of Taileours that may weir the croun,
For me he will be mangit:
Taileour Baberage my soon and air,
I wait for me will rudlie rair,
Fra time he se me hangit.
The barfit Deacon Iamie Ralfe,
Quha never it bocht kow nor calfe,
Because he can nocht steall:
Willie Cadeoch will make na plead,
Howbeit his wife want beife and bread,
Get he good barmie aill.
To the brousters of Cowper toun,
I leife my braidblack malesoun,
Als hardy as I may:
To make thin aill thay think na fault,
Of mekill barm and lytill malt,
Agane the market day.
And thay can make withoutin doubt,
An kind of aill thay call Harns-out,
Wait e how thay make that?
An curtill queine an laidlie lurdane,
Of strange wesche scho will take an iurdane,
And settis in the gyle-fat.
Quha drinks of that aill, man or page
It will gar all his harnis rage,
That iurdane I may few:
It gart my heid rin hiddie giddy,
Sirs God nor I die in an widdie,
Gif this taill be nocht true.
Speir at the Sowtar Geordie Silly,
Fra time that he had filled his belly,
With this vnhelthsum aill:
Than all the Baxter will I ban,
That mixes bread with dust and bran,
And fine flour with beir maill.
Adieu my masters Wrichts and Maissouns,

Adieu blak-Smythis and Lorimers,

Gold Smythis fair-weill above them all,

With money an sittill cast:

Fine Ducat gold with hard Gudlingis,
Like as I leirnit ow last.
Quhen I was ludgit vpaland,
The Schiphirds maid with me an band,
Richt craftelie to steill:
Than did I gif an confirmatioun,
To all the Schiphirdis of this Natioun,
That thay sold never be leill.
And ilk an to reser an other,

How thay make in thair conventiouns,
On montans far fra any touns,
To let them never mend.

To find ten leill amang an hunder
The treuth I to ow tell:
Adieu I may na langer tarry,

Or ellis the rycht to hell*
Wais me for the good common thift,
Was never man maid an mair honest schift,

That ky mair crastelie could staill,
Quhair thou hings on that pin.
Satan ressaue thy saull Dissait,

Andals my father brother:

To make them service weill I ken,
Thaill never get sic an other.
Gif any man list for to be my mait,
Cum follow me for I am at the gait:
Cum follow me all catyfe covetous Kings,
Reauers but richt of vthers Realmis and Rings.

And bring with ow all public oppressors.

With him in hell salbe our recompense.
All cruel schedders of blude innocent,
Cum follow me or ellis rin and repent*
Prelats that hes ma benefeits nor thrie,
And will nocht teich nor preiche the verity*

With Pontius Pilat I sall prepair our Judges
All e officials that parts men with thair wyfis,
Cum follow me or else gang mend our lyfis:

With wanton Scribs and Clarks intill an raw.

Syne body ad octo bids them cum again.
And e that taks rewairds at baith the hands,

Cum follow me all cursed unhappy wyfis,
That with our gudemen daily flytis and stryfis,
And quyetlie with rybalds makes repair,
And taks na cure to make an wrangous air.

With Iesabell of Israell the Queen.

Wald God scho war befoir me into hell:

Out of hell the Devil scho wald ding out.

Let never priests be hamelie with our wyfis.
My wife with priests sho doith me greit onricht
And maid me nine times cuckald on an nicht.

For quhy falset maid never an better end.

Have I nocht chaipit the widdie weil?

For I had nocht been wrangit:
Because I servit be Alhallows,
Till have been merchellit amang my fellowis:
And heich above them hangit.

With my hypocrisy:
Quhen I had on my freirs hude
All men beleifit that I was good*
Now judge e gif I be.
Take mean rackles rubyatour,
An thief an tyrane or an tratour,
Of every vice the plant.
Gif him the habit of an freir,
The wyfis will trow withoutin weir,

Genners mair hait nor charity,
Thocht thay be blak or blew:

An wolf cled in an wedders skin,
Judge e gif this be true.
Sen I have chaipit this fiery farie,
Adieu I will na Langer tarry,
To cumber ow with my clatter:
Bot I will with an humbill spreit,
Gang serve the Hermeit of Lareit:
And leir him for till flatter.

Good day my Lords and als God sane,
Dois na man bid good day again?
Quhen fuillis are fow then are thay fain,

With muck upon our mow:

Betwixt me and an Sow.

Throw speid of fut I gat awa,
Bot in the midst of the cawsa,

Scho lap upon me with an bend,
Quha ever the midings sold amend,

For that is bot Gods bidding.
As I was pudlit thair God wait,
Bot with my club I maid debait:
Ise never cum again that gait,

That suffers sic confusion*
That thay war harbreit with Mahown,
Or hangit on an gallows.

Of on midding to make remeid,
Quhilk pat me and the Sow at feid,
Quhat may I do bot flyte?

Pas on my servant Diligence,
And bring on suill to our presence.

That sall be done but tarrying,

The King, quhat kind of thing is that?
Is on he with the goldin Hat?

Gif e be King God ow good day,

Quhom on Folly? --

Marie on an Sow.
Sir scho hes sworn that scho sall sla me,
Or ellis byte baith my balloks fra me:
Gif e be King be Sanct Allan,

Had I nocht keipit me with my club,
The Sow had drawin me in an dub.

An King callit Correctioun.

Now wallie fall that weill fairde mow,

Of all Swyne for to be skaithles

Folly hes thou an wife at home?

ea that I have, God send her schame:
Itrow be this scho is neir deid,

To schaw her seiknes I think schame,
Scho hes sic rumbling in her wambe:
That all the nicht my hart overcasts,
With bocking and with thunder-blasts,

Peradventure scho be with bairne:

Allace I trow scho be forfairne.
Scho sobbit and scho feil in sown,
And than thay rubbit her up and down:
Scho riftit, routit and maid sic stends,
Scho eild and gaid at baith the ends.
Till scho had castin an cuppill of quarts
Syne all turn it to an rickill of farts.
Scho blubert, bockit and braik it still,
Her arsse gaid evin like an wind mill.
Scho stumblit and stutterit with sic stends,
That scho recanti at baith the ends.
Sik dismell drogs fra her scho schot,
Quhill scho maid all the fluir on flot.
Of her hurdies scho scho had na hold,
Quhill scho had twmed her monyfauld:

Better bring her to the Leitches heir:

Trittill trattill, scho may nocht steir,
Her very buttoks makes sic beir,
It skars baith foill and filly:
Scho bocks sik baggage fra her breist,
He wants na bubbils that sittis her neist,
And ay scho cryis a priest a priest,
With ilk a quhillie lilly.

Recoverit scho nocht at the last?

ea bot wit e weil scho fartit fast.
Bot quhen scho sichis my hart is sorry,

Bot drinks scho ocht? --

An quart at anis it will nocht tarry,
And leif the Devil a drap:
Than sic flobbage scho layis fra her,
About the wallis, God wait sic wair,
Quhen it was drunkin I gat to skair,
The lickings of the cap.

quhat is in that creill I pray the tell?

Marie I have Folly Hats to sell.

I pray the sell me an or tway:
Folly Na tarry quhill the market day*
I will sit down heir be Sanct Clune,
And gif my babies thair disiune.
Cum heir good Glaiks my dochter deir
Thousalbe maryit within an eir,
Upon an freir of Tillilum,
Na thou art nather deaf nor dum:
Cum hidder Stult my soon and air,
My joy thou art baith good and fair:
Now sall I efnd ow as I may
Thocht e cry like an Ke all day.

Get up Folly but tarrying,
And speid ow haistelie to the King
Get up me think the carl is dum.

Now bum baleriebum bum.

I trow the trucour lyis in an trance
Get up man with an mirrie mischance:
Or be Sanct Dyonis of France,
Ise gar the want thy wallet:
Its schame to se man how thow lyis,

Wa it again now this is thryis:
[] The Devil wirrie me and I rise,
Bot I sall break thy pallet.
Me think my pillok will nocht lie down,
Hold down our head e lurdon loun,
on fair las with the Sating goun
Gars ow thus bek and bend:
Take thair an neidill for our case
Now for all the hiding of our face,
Had I ow in an quiet place.
e wald nocht wane to flend.
Their bony armis that are cled in silk,
Are evin als wantoun as any wilk,
I wald forbeir baith bread and milk
To kis thy bony lippis:
Suppois e luke as e war wraith,
War e at quiet behind an claith,
e wald not stick to preife my graith,
With hobbling of our hippis.

Suyith harlot haist the to the King
And let allane thy trattilling.
Lo heir is Folly sir already,
An richt sweir swingeour be our Lady.

Thou art not half sa sweir thy sell,
Quhat meins this pulpit, I pray the tell?

Our new Bischops hes maid an preiching,
Bot thou heard never sic pleasant teiching:
on Bischop will preich throch the coast,

Than stryk an hag into the post,
For I hard never in all my life,
An Bischop cum to preich in Fyfe.
Gif Bischops to be preichours leiris,
Wallaway quhat sall word of freiris?
Gif Prelats preich in brugh and land,
The silly freirs I understand
Thay will get na mair meall nor malt,
Sa I dreid freirs sall die for fault.
Sen sa is that on nobill King,
Will make men Bischops for preiching:
Quhat say e sirs, hold e nocht best?
That I gang preich amang the rest.
Quhen I have preichit on my best wayis,
Then will I sell my merchandise,
To my bretherin and tender maits,
That dwells amang the thrie estaits.
For I have heir good chaifery,
Till any fuill that lists to by.
God sen I had an Doctors hude.

Quhy Folly wald thou make an preiching?

ea that I wald sir be the Rude,
But either flattering or fleiching.

Now brother let us heir his teiching,
To pas our time and heir him raise.

He war far meiter for the kitchen,
Amang the pottis sa Christ me saife.
Fond Folly sall I be thy Clark,
And answeir the ay with amen:

Now at the beginning of my wark,
The fiend ressaue that graceles grim.
Stultorum numerus infinitus. Salomon the may sapient King
In Israell quhan he did ring,
Their words in effect did write,
The number of fuillis are infinite.
I think na schame sa Christ me saife,
To be an fuill amang the life,
Howbeit an hundredth stands heir by,
Preventure als great fuillis as I.
Stultorum. I have of my Genelogie,
Dwelland in every country,
Earles, Duiks, Kings, and Empriours,
With money guckit Conquerours:
Quhilk dois in Folly perseveir,
And hes done sa this many eir.
Sum seiks to warldlie dignities,
And sum to sensual vanities
Quhat vails all their vain honours,
Nocht being sure to leife two houris?
Sum greidie fuill dois fill an box,
An other fuill cummis and breaks the lox:
And spends that other fuillis hes spaird,
Quhilk never thocht on them to wairde.
Sum dois as thay sold never die,
Is nocht this folly, quhat say e?
Sapientia huius mundi stultitia est apud Deum. Because thair is sa many
fuillis,
Rydand on horse and sum on muillis:
Heir I have bocht good chafery,
Till any fuill that lists to by.
And specially for the thrie estaits,
Quhair I have money tender maits:
Quhilk causit them as e may se,
Gang backward throw the haill country.
Gif with my merchandise e list to mell,
Heir I have Folly Hattis to sell.
Quhairfoir is this Hat wald e ken?
Marie for insatiabill merchant men.
Quhen God hes send them abundance
Are nocht content with sufficiance.
Bot saillis into the stormy blastis,
In Winter to get greater castis:
In money terribill great torment,
Against the Acts of Parliament.
Sum tynis thair gear, and sum are drounde,
With this sic merchants sold be crounde.

Quhom to schaips thou to sell that hude?
I trow to sum great man of good.

This hude to sell richt fain I wald,
Till him that is baith auld called:
Ready till pas to hell or heavin,
And hes fair bairns sax or seavin:
And is of age fourscoir of eir,
And taks an lass to be his peir:
Quhilk is nocht fourteine eir of age,
And ioynis with her in marriage:
Geifand her traist that scho nocht wald,
Rycht haistelie make him cuckald*
Quha maryes beand sa neir thair dead,
Set on this Hat upon his head.

Quhat Hude is that tell me I pray the?

This is an haly Hude I say the,
This Hude is ordanit I the assure,
For Sprituall fuillis that taks in cure,
The saullis of great Diosies,
And regiment of great Abesies,
For gredines of warldlie pelf,
Than can nocht justly gyde them self.
Vthers sauls to saife it settis them weill,
Syne sell them a win saullis to the Devil.
Quha ever dois sa, this I conclude,
Upon his heid set on this Hude:
Diligence, Folly is thair any sic men
Now in the Kirk that thou can ken?
How sall I ken them? --

Na keip that clois,
Ex operibus eorum cognoscetis eos. And fuillis speik of the Prelacie,
It will be hauldin for herisie.

Speik on hardly I gif the leife:

Than my remissioun is in my sleife.
Will e leife me to speik of Kings?

ea hardly speik of all kin things.
Conforming to my first narratioun,
e are all fuillis be Coks passioun.

Thou leis, I trow thisfuill be man git.

Gif I lie God nor thou behangit.
For I have heir I to the tell
An nobill cap imperiell,
Quhilk is nocht ordanit bot for doings,
Of Empreours, of Duiks and Kings.
For princely and imperial fuillis,
Thay sold have luggis als lang as Muillis.
The pride of Princes without in faill,
Gars all the world rin top ovir taill.
To win them warldlie gloir and good,
Thay cure nocht schedding of saikles blude.
Quhat cummer have e had in Scotland,
Be our auld enemies of Ingland?
Had nocht been the support of France,
We had been brocht to great mischance.
Now I heir tell the Empreour,
Schaippis for till be an Conqueror.
And is muifing his ordinance,
Against the Nobill King of France.
Bot I know nocht his just querrell,
That he hes for till make battle.
All the Princes of Almanie,
Spain, Flanders and Italie.
This present eir are in an flocht:
Sum sall thair wages find deir bocht.
The Paip with bombard, speir and scheild,
Hes send his army to the field.
Sanct Peter, Sanct Paull nor Sanct Androw,
Raisit never sic an Oist I trow.
Is this fraternal charity,
*Or furious folly, quhat say e?
Thay leird nocht this at Christis Scuillis:
Thairfoir I think them very fuillis.
I think it folly be Gods mother,
Ilk Christian Prince to ding down other:
Because that this hat sold belang them,
Gang thou and part it evin amang them,
The Prophecy withouttin weir,
Of Merling beis compleit this eir:
For my gudame the Gyre Carling,
Leirnde me the Prophecy of Marling:
Quhairof I sall schaw the sentence,
Gif e will gif me audience.
Flan Fran resurgent, simul Hispan viribus urgent,
Dani vastabunt, Vallones valla parabunt.
Sic tibi nomen in a mulier cacauit in olla:
Hoc epulum comedes --

Marie that is an il sauorit dische.

Sa be this Prophecy plainly appeirs,
That mortal weirs salbe amang freirs:
Thay sall nocht know weill in thair closters.
To quhom thay sall say thair Pater nosters.
Wald thay fall to and fecht with speir and shield
The fiend make cuir quhilk of them win the field.
Now of my sermon have I maid an end,
To Gilly-mouband I ow all commend.
And I ow all beseik richt hartfullie:
Pray for the saull of good Cacaphatie:
Quhilk laitlic drownit himself into Loch leavin,
That his sweit saull may be above the heavin.

Famous peopil hartlie I ow require,
This lytill sport to take in patience,
We traist to God and we leif an other eir,
Quhair we have failit we sall do diligence,
With mair pleasure to make ow recompense:
Because we have been sum part tedious
With matter rude, denude of eloquence,
Likewyse perchance, to sum men odious.
Now let ilk man his way advance,
Let sum ga drink and sum ga dance:
Menstrell, blaw up an brawll of France,
Let se quha hobbils best:
For I will rin incontinent,
To the Tavern or ever I stent:
And pray to God omnipotent,
To send ow all good rest.
