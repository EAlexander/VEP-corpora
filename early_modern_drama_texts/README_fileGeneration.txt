This corpus was curated by the efforts of the Visualizing English Print Project (VEP), made possible by a grant 
from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and a license agreement with the University of Michigan Libraries. For its 
source files, the VEP used Text Creation Partnership (TCP) TEI-P4 XML-encoded electronic text editions of early 
print books from ECCO-TCP, EBBO-TCP Phase I, EEBO-TCP Phase II, and Evans-TCP corpora. As of this corpus release 
date, ECCO-TCP, EEBO-TCP Phase I, and Evans-TCP corpora are in the public domain. EEBO-TCP Phase II texts, on the 
other hand, are protected under an agreement with the University of Michigan Libraries. Any EEBO-TCP Phase II content, 
though indicated as part of this VEP corpus, cannot be released to the public given the protection granted to the text 
transcriptions of EEBO-TCP Phase II texts. The words of Phase II content are public domain; however, transcriptions and 
encoding thereof are protected by the agreement and available to ProQuest subscribers and partner libraries. ProQuest 
retains exclusive right for five years to distribute Phase II texts to customers. Once the five-year window expires, 
then the texts will be released freely to the public. Information provided for Phase II texts is granted through license 
with Michigan University Libraries for scholarly analysis.



The TCP XML source files for this corpus underwent several transformations to prepare their text transcriptions for 
computational processing. The workflow for text extraction was supervised by VEP PI Mike Gleicher 
(gleicher@cs.wisc.edu) in collaboration with Jonathan Hope (jonathan.r.hope@strath.ac.uk). The XML files were processed by several Python scripts to ensure standard character encodings 
and spelling standardization. The python scripts were the collective work of Wei-chen Chen (zarcen@cs.wisc.edu), 
Erin Winter(wintere@cs.wisc.edu), Eric Alexander (ealexand@cs.wisc.edu), and Deidre Stuffer (stuffer@wisc.edu). Files of 
extracted text were batch processed through VARD (v2.5.4)to standardize the TCP's transcriptions of early modern English. 
VEP deploys a version of VARD trained by Deidre Stuffer (stuffer@wisc.edu) on an early modern drama corpus 
for Jonathan Hope. These plain text files were then processed through Ubiqu+Ity (v 1.1; dictionary v3.21), a dictionary-based 
text tagger. Ubiqu+Ity serves as a frontend application that utilizes DocuScope dictionaries, which classify linguistic 
patterns into categories of rhetorical effects. DocuScope is the work of David Kaufer and Suguru Ishizaki at the English 
Department of Carnegie Mellon University.
