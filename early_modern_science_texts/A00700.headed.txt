TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE, VERTVOVS, AND LEARNED LORD HENRY, Earl of
Northumberland: (*) Lord Percie, Lucie, Brian, Fitzpaine and Poynings: Lord of
the Honours of Cockermouth and Petworth c. Knight of the most honourable order of
the GARTER. All true felicity both in this life and in the world to come most
heartily wished.
IF that saying of Plato (right noble Lord) be true, that our Country
challenges an especial interest in our very uttermost ability, which any way
may tend to profit benefit the same: then will it sufficiently countenance
the poor received Talent of mine, in that being so strictly charged by so
great and grave a Philosopher, I ought not to bury in oblivion my knowledge
whatsoever, but rather as freely bestow mine endeavour on her, as she did
frankly impart the light thereof to me.

For though it be a common phrase in the mouths of men altogether ignorant in
the precious value and profit of Sciences: That the study of Letters is a
bottomless Gulf, and so long and so uneasy a journey, that they which rashly
think to finish it, oftentimes are drowned in the midway, and so under this
pretence, account it better not to know much, yea, nothing at all: Against such
slothful suggesters of men in a deadly obscurity while they live, let me
avouch that saying of Aristotle, Man (saith he) was created to understand and
to do, for knowledge begets judgment, and by judgment men execute all
good and virtuous actions.

O Science (saith Plato) howe would men love thee, if they did but know thee?
for even as health is the conservation of the body, so is knowledge the sure
and only safe-garder of the soul. And Cicero being of the same opinion,
saith: O knowledge, the guide of our life, the only cause of virtue, and
enemy to vice: What is the life of man without thee?

If then (right learned Lord) such a maine current stream of unconquerable
reason, washes to nothing the empty and confused wits, of such as are enemies
to the excellency of Art, and makes most fertile (like the ouer-flowings of
Nylus) the judgements of the that are governed thereby: (though far from me
be the thought of arrogating the very least title of Art to my self, yet as
one that desires to receive the breath of life from her sacred dwelling, and
holds with the learned in all ages, that man is as a bruit beast without
her:) then let me thus far presume under your noble favour, to show that I
have not altogether trewanted in my life time, but howe I have bestowed those
permitted hours of exercise, that more weighty affairs in the world afforded
me, both to declare my reverend zeal to so high a mystery, and vnfeyned
affection. I bear to your honour.

The work was first written in French, by an excellent Scholar, Oger Ferrier,
a Physician, borne in Tolouze, dedicated to Queen Katherine of France, mother
to the King that last deceased. And being now by me changed into an English
habit, that it might receive no indignity by dedication, I have stamped your
noble name in the fore-head thereof, that it may be said (in despite of the
proudest carper or controller,) This is the God-chylde of a peerless
God-father.

And as I doubt not of your honourable acceptauce, so I am likewise persuaded,
that what hath wanted on my behalf in translation, or any other imperfection
beside, shall be as nobly censured: in which resolution I humbly kiss your
hand, and continue as forward in affection, as any to your Honours welfare.

Thomas Kelway. One of her Highness Trumpets in ordinary.

TO THE COVRTEVS Reader.
I Am to request (gentle Reader) one favour at thy hand, that if this work of
the judgment of Nativities seem harsh and unpleasant to thee, thou would
not therefore wound the same with injurious words, to charge thy self with
more folly then needs: but if thou find it above thy knowledge or capacity,
say as honest minded Chion said: Let my betters judge of these matters. For I
must and do confess, that it is not a Book for every mans reading, and he
that reads with derision, because he understands not, must blame his own
insufficiency, and not the book: for if he could learn as much in an hour,
as cost a learned man many years to compass, then would his humour be pleased,
and the work not reproached. But let such loiterers understand, that knowledge
requires the whole circuit of a mans life, and live he never so long, yet may
he learn: but if it might be attained in a Summers day, a number would be
excellent, that through default thereof remains utterly ignorant.

To use many words, I account needless, knowing that the reproof of the
unlearned, is rather the badge of their own weak brain, then any blemish to
a work of worth: Therefore let them censure as they please, the learned (I
know) will judge like themselves, of whom I had rather be deservedly
controlled, then by the other be ignorantly commended.

OF THE IVDGEMENTS ASTRONOMICAL UPON NATIVITIES. The first Book.
CHAP. I. Of the Celestial figure of a Nativity.
FOR to judge of Ascendants and Nativities, after the traditions of the
ancient and learned Astrologians, it is convenient first to explain the
Celestial figure, and in the same, to apply the seven Planets, with the head
and tail of the Dragon Lunaire, together with the part of Fortune, and the
part of the spirit and others, more appertaining to the high notable
significations of the stars; Then, to set down plainly the Celestial
figure, you must in the first place, note the year, the day, the hour, with
the most nearest minute of time of the nativity that you have undertaken. The
number of the hours and mynutes, you must set them down after the manner of
the numbering of the Astrologians, within their tables: always set down the
hower's afternoon, as well by day as by night, and never say, one hour, two
hours, three hours after midnight, but number xiij. hovvers, xiiij. hours,
xv. after noone. This done, search in the Ephemerids in the table of the year
of your nativity, in the right month day proposed, the degree of the sign
wherein the Sun is: look afterward in the Table of houses, which serve for
the latitude of your Country, and search there the said degree of the Sun
under the lyne of the tenth house. And having found in the same place the same
degree of the Sun, you shall find directly upon the left hand of the same
Table, a number of hours and minutes, the which write apart. To which number,
you must add the hours and mynutes that hath been given you of the same
nativity, and that which rests by your addition, you must seek in the table
of houses: and there where you find the same number of hours mynutes coming
of the same addition, you must take to a right lyne the points and beginnings
of the six houses, which you shall find marked: the which you shall direct
upon your figure, beginning at the point of the tenth, and continuing towards
the left hand.

The beginning of the other six houses, you must take the opposite signs; and
if it happen that the number of houses and mynutes, come to more then
twentiefoure hours, it is then convenient to substract twentiefoure hours of
the same time, and the residue seek out as we have aforesaid. If the hour of
the same nativity, be upon the point of twelve hours of noone, you must take
the houses in a right line of the degree of the sun, in the table of your
latitude, without making any other addition, or substraction, and that when in
the figure estimatiue: within the which, it is needful by all means to apply
the moving of the Moon exactly calculated, according to the vulgar cannons
of the Ephemerids, for to verify afterward your nativity by the hour of
the conception. As follows.

CHAP. II. Of the verification of the bower of the nativity.
Leaving the Animodar of Ptolome and the meetings of Schoner, and all other
uncertain ways (although they have their Authors) to verify the hours of
nativities, I will presently follow the method of Hermes, approved by long
experience, and confirmed by Ptolome in his Centiloque, and by Abraham
Auenesrus, by Alphonce Leopolde, Haly, and other most expert Astrologians.
Hermes saith, that the ascendant of a nativity, hath been the place of the
Moon at the time of the coception; and that the ascendant of the conception,
is the place of the Moon at the hour of the nativity. Who would be moore
near certified of the hour mynute of a nativity, and of the true ascendant,
it is convenient that you follow the doctrine of Hermes by the method following.
First of all that you look into the figure estimatiue, whether the Moon be
above the Horrizon or beneath. If she be above the Horrizon, count the distance
that is between the point of the seventh house and the Moon: if she be
beneath the Horrizon, count the distance which is from the first house unto the
Moon, which distance of signs and degrees, you must search in the table that
follows, under the title of the Moon, above the Horrizon or beneath, as
truly you have found in the said figure. In a right lyne of the said distance,
you shall find the time that the infant hath remained within the womb of his
Mother, in a certain number of days, the which you must reckon from the day
of your nativity backward; and there where the number ends, you must mark
the day of the conception, if the Moon be found in the sign of the ascendant
estimatiue. If you find her not in the same place, go backward or forward
certain days of your account, until you have found the Moon within the
said sign, not far from the degree ascendant in the said figure. The day
considered, and in what hour, go forward to the East point, the place where
you have sound the Moon in the figure estimatiue, and at that hour you must
calculate the moving of the Moon. For this degree and mynute in the which you
found her, you must place it in the ascendant of your nativity.

And to know the hour in the which the place of the Moon of the nativity,
rose to the East point at the time of the conception, take first the overthwart
ascention of the said place of the Moon, within the table of the directions of
your country, in the book of Iohn de Regiomonte, of the same ascention take
away 90. degrees, ( ad to the whole circle which is of 360. degrees, when the
substraction cannot be otherwise made) the residue shall be the right ascention
of the height of the point of the Merydian circle: take afterward the right
ascention of the Sun, and take out by the substraction of the right ascention
of the said point of the Merydian, and add 360. degrees if it be necessary,
turn that which is left into hours and minutes, in giving to 30. degrees two
hours, to fifteen degrees one hour, to one degree 4. minutes of an hour, to
fifteen minutes one minute of an hour; by this means you shall exactly come
to the hour of the conception, to the which you must calculate the place of
the Moon, and the same well calculated, put it to the point of the first
house, in the figure of the nativity.

Diverse for this verefication do dress and garnish the motions of the Planets
four figures. One of that hour estimatiue of the nativity, the other, of the
precedent conjunction or opposition of the brightness: the third, of the
verification by the Animodar: the fourth, of the conception. The which besides
the unprofitable and superfluous labour, err greatly, thinking to find out the
time of the conception by the Animodar of Ptolome, the which experience from
day to day shows to be false, and that it hath no ancient Author to
maintain it, or hath made mention of this new doctrine, being full of
contention and disproved verity.

CHAP. III. The manner to set down perfectly the said figure verified.
Having put to the point of the first house, the degree minutes of the Moon of
the time of the conception, take the overthwart ascentions of the said degrees
and minutes: take out afterward 90. degrees of the said ascentions, and add
thereto 360. degrees, if otherwise the substraction cannot be made: that which
remains, shall be the right ascentions of the highest point of the circle
Meridian, the which search in the table of the right ascentions, in the book
of Alphonce, or of Iohn de Regiomonte, c. and put to the point of the tenth
house, the degrees minutes of the sign you find, answering to the right
number of the said right ascentions. The point of the fourth is always against
the sign and degree of the tenth: likewise the point of the seventh, to the
point of the first. The other houses sufficed, take the Ephemerids, because
they do not desire exact calculation, seeing that the most part of the
Astrologians, desire more to take of the equal portion of the Eclipse then of
the horizontall sect.

For to know the exact hour of the said figure, verify first the said right
ascentions of the Meridian, and take from them the right ascentions of the
Sun, that which remains turn into hours and minutes, giving to xv.
degrees one hour, to every degree four minutes of an hour. c. as we have
said before. At this hour you must newly count the moving of the Moon, and
of the Sun, of the other Planets: and upon this figure you must ground the
parts and judgements Astronomical.

CHAP. IIII. Of the parts of Nativities.
AFter you have well sought the Planets in the said figure verified, you must
consider their above certain proportions of the Planets and parts of the
heaven, taken of their distances, as follows.

The parts concerning the significations of the first House.
The part of the quality of the life, is taken by the distance of Iupiter from
Saturne, counting as much space from the ascendant, as when the nativity is by
day: for when it is by night, they take it to the contrary, the distance of
Saturne unto Iupiter, following the natural order of the signs, counting
likewise as much space since the ascendant.

The part of life by day and by night, is taken of the degree of the precedent
conjunction, or opposition of the lights unto the Moon, counting from the
ascendant.

The part of the Spirit (many do call the part of earthly things and secrets,
the other, the part of things to come, the others, the part of the Sun) in the
day fro the Move unto the Sun, from the ascendant, in the night to the
contrary.

The part of the understanding, by the day, is fro Mercurie unto Mars, from the
ascendant, at night to the contrary.

Of the second House.
The part of Fortune by the day, is from the Sun unto the Moon, from the
ascendant, at night to the contrary. Ptolome doth take it as much by day as by
night, from the Sun unto the Moon.

The part of the goods as well by day as by night, is from the Lord of the
second house, unto the said second house, taken upon the quality of the
Eclipse, fro the ascendant.

Of the third.
The part of brothers, by the day, is from Saturne unto Iupiter, from the
ascendant, at night to the contrary.

The part of the love of brethren, by the day, is from the Sun unto Saturne,
from the ascendant, at night to the contrary. If Saturne be under the beams
of the Sun, take Iupiter in his place.

Of the fourth.
The part of father, by the day, is from the Sun unto Saturne, from the
ascendant, at night to the contrary. This same is like the love of brethren:
then if Saturne be underneath the beams of the Sun, in his place take Iupiter.

The part of inheritances and possessions, by day and by night, is from Saturne
to the Moon, from the ascendant.

The part of fortune in tillage and sowing, by day and by night, is from Venus
unto Saturne, from the ascendant.

Of the fifth.
The part of Infants, is as the part of the quality of the life.

The part of male children by day and by night, is from the Moon unto Iupiter,
and is numbered from the ascendant.

The part of daughters, by day and by night, is from the Moon unto Venus, and
is taken from the ascendant.

Of the sixth.
The part of diseases inseparable, in the day, is the distance of Saturne unto
Mars, and it is cast from the degree ascendant, and in the night from Mars,
which is contrary.

The part of servant, by day and by night, from Mercurie unto the Moon, is
from the ascendant.

The part of prison and captivity by day, from the lord of the place of the
Sun, unto the Sun, and is reckoned from the ascendant. By night, from the
Lord of the place of the Moon, unto the Moon.

If the Sun by day, or the Moon by night, be in their proper houses or
exaltations, they shall be signifiers of this part.

Of the seventh.
The part of the marriage of men, by day and by night, from the Sun unto
Venus, is from the ascendant.

The part of the marriage of women, by day by night, from Venus to Saturne, is
from the ascendant.

The part of marriage common to men to women, by day and by night, is from
Venus unto the point of the seventh house, accounting from the ascendant.

The part of kindred, by day and by night, from Saturne unto Venus, is from the
ascendant.

The part of discord agreement, by day, is from Mars to Iupiter from the
ascendant: by night to the contrary.

Of the eight.
The part of death, by day and by night, from the Moon unto the degree of the
eight house, taken upon the equality of the Eclipse accounting from the place
o^ Saturne.

The part of the mortal Planet by day is from the Lord of the ascendant, unto
the Moon, from the ascendant, by night to the contrary.

The part of the perrillous year of death, or poverty, or of any other
mis-fortune by day, and by night, is from Saturne unto the Lord of the
fore-said conjunction or opposition of the light, from the ascendant.

The part of all envies, by day, is from Saturne unto Mars, by night to the
contrary, accounting fro the place of Mercurie.

Of the ninth.
The part of faith and of religion by day, is from the Moon unto Mercurie,
from the ascendant, by night to the contrary.

The part of ways by land by day and by night, is from the Lord of the ninth
unto the ninth, taken upon the equality of the Eclipse, from the ascendant.

The part of travail by water by day, is from Saturne unto the fifteenth
degree of Cancer, from the ascendant, at night to the contrary.

If Saturne do meet in the said fifteenth degree of Cancer, he shall be
signifier of this part, with the ascendant.

Of the tenth.
The part of nobility by day, is from the Sun unto the nineteenth degree of
Aries, accounting from the ascendant, by night, from the Moon unto the third
degree of Taurus. If the Moon by night be in the said degree of Taurus, or the
Sun by day, in the said degree of Aries, they shall be signifiers of the said
part.

The part of government by day, is from Mars unto the Moon from the ascendant,
by night to the contrary.

The part of Magistrates, as the part of the understanding, written upon the
first house.

The part of conquest victory, as the part of father.

The part of sudden advancement, by day, is from Saturne unto the part of
Fortune, from the ascendant, by night to the contrary; If Saturne be burned,
take in his place Iupiter.

The part of estimation, by day and by night; is from Mercurie unto the Sun,
accounting from the ascendant.

The part of governments and seats of war, by day, is from Mars unto
Saturne; from the ascendant, by night to the contrary.

The part of the profession and action, by day and by night, is from Saturne
unto the Moon fro the ascendant.

The part of honour proceeding of the profession, by day and by night, is from
the degree of the Sun, unto the degree of the tenth house, from the
ascendant.

The part of the industry of the hands, by day, is from Mercurie to Venus, from
the ascendant, by night to the contrary.

The part of the fear of Merchandise, by day, is from the part of the spirit,
unto the part of Fortune, from the ascendant, by night to the contrary.

The part of felicity, and profit, by day, is from the part of Fortune unto
Iupiter, from the ascendant, by night to the contrary.

The part of the mother, by day, is from Venus unto the Moon, from the
ascendant, by night to the contrary.

Of the eleventh.
The part of friends, by day and by night, is from Mercurie to the Moon, from
the ascendant.

The part of praise, by day, is from Iupiter unto Venus from the ascendant, by
night to the contrary.

The part of honourable companies, by day, is from the part of Fortune unto the
Sun, from the ascendant, by night to the contrary.

Of the twelfth.
The part of enemies, by day by night, is from the lord of the xij. house unto
the said xij. taken upon the equality of the Eclipse, from the ascendant.

The second part of enemies, as the part of diseases inseparable, written in
the sixth house.

The part of pain, travail and affliction, by day and by night, is fro the
part of the spirit, unto the part of fortune.

CHAP. V. Of the latitudes and aspects of the Planets.
Having applied the Planets in the said figure, and ordained as we have said
in the former chapter, the parts proceeding of the proportions of the said
Planets, you must consequently draw out of the Ephemerids their latitudes, put
apart all the aspects which is among them, and towards the said parts and xij.
houses; also the radiations, after the last proposition of the book of
Directions of Iohn de Regiomonte: upon the which note, that the aspects
opposites, have always diverse latitudes to them of their Planets, although
they keep the same number. As if Saturne had two degrees of latitude
septentrionall, his opposition hath two degrees of latitudes meridionall. The
quadrant aspect hath no latitude, for it falls always upon the Eclipse.

The Trine aspect, retains the half of the number of the latitude, in
contrary part: for if a Planet have one degree of latitude meridionall, his
trine shall have thirty minutes of latitude septentrionall. The Sextile
retains the same side, with the half of the number. You must also note, that
these aspects of Saturne and of Iupiter, do not extend but unto nine degrees,
or for the most longest unto twelve; those of Mars unto eight, or for the most
part to ten. The Sun extends his beams to xv. degrees, Venus and
Mercurie almost to eight. The Moon unto twelve, the head tail of the Dragon,
likewise extend their forces unto twelve degrees.

Moreover, it is to be noted, that the opposition is a plain aspect and
perfect enmity: the Quadrate of less enmity: the Trine of perfect love: the
Sextile of imperfect love. That which always receives exception in Iupiter
and Venus, (of the which opposites and quadrate aspects) profit the Sun the
Moon with reception, or without reception, and to others also with reception.

CHAP. VI. Of the fortunes and infortunes of the Planets, and parts of Heaven.
AFter this, you must consider the forces weakness of the Planets, parts and
Houses, and conferring the ones significations with the other, you must collect
the fortunes and infortunes of every place, as follows.

Here follows the infortunes.
The Planets and other places of the Heaven, be called unfortunate, when they
be burned under the beams of the Sun. Burnings are called Saturne and
Iupiter, when between them the Sun they have less then twelve degrees. Mars
when he is burned of the Sun, hath at the least xj. degrees and a half.
Venus and Mercurie, when they be near the Sun, xj. degrees. The Moon when
she is not burned, by xiij. And yet you find other terms, when you will take a
Planet for to give the years. Then the three superiors are esteemed burnt,
because they are near the Sun by xv. degrees, and if they be occidental. For
when they be oriental unto ten degrees, they are burnt from the ten unto
xv. under the beams. Venus and Mercurie occidental near to the Sun by
seven degrees, or oriental by five, be burned, from thence unto twelve under
the beams. The Moon near by twelve degrees is burnt, from thence unto xv.
under the beams. And you must note, that the said accidents are not hurtful
when they fall in the signs of Aries, and of the Lyon.

Unfortunate also are the Planets, when they go backward, and when they be
joined with Saturne or with Mars: or when they receive evil aspects of them.

When they are joined with any fixed star of violent nature.

When they are in their detriments or fallings, (that is to say) in places
opposite to their houses or exaltations.

When they are in their declining houses.

When they are first standers, (that is to say) when they be in the degree and
minute wherein incontinently they begin to go backward.

When they are in the way of burning, which begin at the 19. degree of Libra,
and end in the third degree of Scorpio.

When they be with the tail of the Dragon.

When they are joined with a backward Planet, or otherwise unfortunate.

When they are Peregrines, without being received. They are called Peregrins,
when they have no dignity or place where they be. Of the reception we will
speak afterwards.

When they be meridionall descendents.

When any of the three superiors are occidental, or Venus Mercurie oriental,
when they be in evil aspects of the Sun.

When they do not regard any other Planet.

When they be opposits to the Lord of the sign where they be.

When they be set, (that is to say) between two evil Planets, although they
have 30. degrees of distance.

When they be in evil houses or terms.

When they be in the twelfth sign of their principal houses.

When they be under the Horrizon in the day, or above the Horrizon in the
night: if they be Diurnes, as Saturne, Iupiter, and the Sun.

When they be above the Horrizon in the day, and beneath at night. If they be
Nocturnes, as Mars, Venus, Mercurie, and the Moon.

When they be in signs and degrees feminine, they be masculines, or in signs
and degrees masculine, they be feminines. Feminines are Venus and the Moon,
Mercurie and Androgine, the others are masculines.

When they be in degrees which are called Azemenae, or in degrees stinking,
dark, or smoky. That which is marked in the Ephemerids, in the table of the
dignities of the Planets.

Infortunes particular to the Moon.
When she decreases.

When she is within the eight House, out of her principal dignities.

When she is within the seventh, and that as to the life. And as for any other
significations she is not unfortunate in the seventh.

When she is in the xix. degree of a sign.

When she is slack in her course, (that is to understand) when she goes in
twenty-foure hours, less then thyrteene degrees and xi. minutes.

The fortunes of the Planets.
Fortunate be the Planets, and other places of Heaven, when they be in angles,
or at the least in houses succeeding.

When they be in a good aspect of Iupiter, or of Venus, or at the least in
evil, with reception.

When they be joined to the Sun within sixteen mynutes.

When they be in a good aspect of the Sun, of the Moon, or of Mercurie
fortunate.

When they be joined with any fixed star of a loving nature.

When they be directs, or at the least, in the second station, (that is to
understand) when they be in degree and minute, in the which begins
incontinently the direction.

When they be within their proper houses or exaltations.

When they be in their triplicities and terms together, or triplicity and face
together.

When they be in houses, wherein they naturally take pleasure, as Mercurie in
the ascendant, the Moon in the third, Venus in the fifth, Mars in the sixth, the
Sun in the ninth, Iupiter in the eleventh, and Saturne in the twelfth.

When they be in any of their dignities, or if they be peregrines, when they be
received. Received; that is, the Planets, which receive aspect of him, which in
their place hath at the least four dignities, the which reception is
fortunate, when she is made of a good aspect.

At all times the receptions of Iupiter and Venus be always favourable,
although they be not made of good aspects.

night. If they be nocturnes.

When they are in signs and degrees masculine, they be masculine, or in signs

When they be in degrees fortunate clear degrees, which are called Lucides.

Particular fortunes of the Moon.
When she increases.

When she is within the house or exaltation of the Sun.

When she is very swift in her course, (that is to understand) when she goes
more then thirteen degrees 11. minutes in 24. hours.

CHAP. VII. If the child shall live or no.
ALL this above considered, you must first look, whether he that is borne, is
for life in this world or no. That which principally will show us the light
of the time, (that is to say, the Sun by day, and the Moon by night) are the
Lords of the triplicity of him, and the ascendant with his Dominator.

When the Dominator of the ascendant, shall be unfortunate by the Lord of the
eight house, the Child cannot live: and less, if the Lords of the
triplicitie of the temporal light be unfortunate.

When within the first house shall be any fixed star of violent nature, or
any ill fortune, (that is to say, Saturne or Mars) without having at the least
four dignities, and the temporal light shall be unfortunate, the child shall
die quickly. If you find not any fixed star of amiable nature, or if Iupiter
and Venus, or the Sun or the Moon, do not communicate unto him their
beams. For and if the aspect be of love, or of enmity with reception, the
child shall live.

If the Dominator of the ascendant be burned, the child shall dye before 9.
days be acomplished, and more sooner if he be burned within the eight house,
or in this estate, if he be joined with the Lord of the eygth. Except when he
is burned in his own house or exaltation, or within the house or exaltation of
the Sun.

When the Moon, being the temporal light, shall be unfortunate within the
first house, without any aspect of the fortunes, without the conjunction of any
fixed stars of amiable nature, the hope of life shall not be great.

When the Moon shall be unfortunate within the fourth house, and he that hath
the misfortune shall be also unfortunate, out of his principal dignities, the
Infant cannot live, the mother shall be in great danger of death at her
deliverance, and principally if the ascendant be the house or exaltation of the
Moon.

When the infortunes are conjoined within the eighth house, it signifies very
short life: except when Mars and Saturne be in Capricorne.

Many joint Planets within the first house, bring not good testimony of life,
although they be all fortunate.

When the Domynator of the ascendant, and the temporal light, and the Lords of
their triplicities be not altogether unfortunate, the child may easily live.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Giver of life, named of the Arabians Hyleg.
THe giver of life is taken out of the principal places of the Figure (that is
to say) of the Sun, of the Moon, and of the Ascendant, of the part of
Fortune, of the degree of the last conjunction or opposition of lights; the
which having well noted, we consider first, if the nativity be diurnal or
nocturnal? For if she be diurne we begin at the Sun, the which within the
first, tenth, or eleventh house, in a masculine or feminine sign, shall be
fit to give life, if it have any giver of time that doth regard it: If it be
in the nynth, eygth, or seventh house, it may also be the giver of life, if it
be in a Masculine sign, and not in a Feminine: in other places it cannot be
the giver of life, but by constraint. It is always necessary for such an
act, that the giver of time regard the giver of life, otherwise, the said
giver of life shall be as person that hath good will to do his friend good
hath not wherewithal; And so when the Sun shall be without aspect of any
giver of time, you must leave it there, go to the Moon, which may give the
life within the first house, in the sign Masculine or Feminine, and within the
tenth, eleventh, seventh, fourth, fifth, second and third house, in signs
Feminines and not Masculines, receiving aspect of any giver of time. If the
Moon have not all the said conditions, you must come to the degree ascendant,
if the nativity be coniunctionall (Coniunctionall is said the nativity,
before the which lastly the lights have been conjoined) and if the said
degree receive aspect of his gyuer of time, he shall be gyuer of life:
otherwise not. Wherefore you must examine the part of Fortune, the which shall
give life in the Angles and houses succeeding, with the aspect of the giver of
time, otherwise you must come to the degree, to the which lastly the lights
have been conjoined: the which within the Angles or houses succeeding shall be
giver of life, if he receive aspect of his giver of time.

It is here necessary that the giver of time have dignity of house, or of
exaltation in places of the part of Fortune, and of the said degree
coniunctionall. By this order you must seek the gyuer of life, when the
nativity is coniunctionall. When she is preuentionall, (Preuentionall is
said, before the which lastly the lights have been opposites) after you have
considered the Sun and the Moon, you must consequently contemplate the
place of Fortune, more than the degree ascendant, and lastly the degree of the
oppositions of the lights, see that it have 2. degrees in the opposition, one
of them of the Sun, and the other of the Moon. The Astrologians command to
consider it, that at the time of the opposition it hath been in the first
house, or elsewhere above the Horizon.

When the Nativity is nocturniall, we follow the same order, (except that
first we consider the Moon, secondly the Sun, c.) This gyuer of life, when
either by direction, or by profection, or by other way, meet any evil aspect
of the infortunes, or of the stars fixed of violent nature, or any of the
notable coniunctions, or Eclipses of the lights, it causes then some
sickness, and very suddaynly brings death, when the Fortunes do not
intermingle the favourable beams.

CHAP. IX. Of the giver of years, called of the Arabians Alcocoden.
THE gyuer of time or giver of years, is the same that hath dignity of house,
exaltation, triplicitie, or term in the place where is the giver of life. As
if the Sun were in the xj. in the sign of Sagitarius, (there where he may be
gyuer of life,) and Iupiter were in the sign of Aquarius, he shall regard the
Sun of the Sextile aspect, and look that he have dignity of the house in
the sign of the Sun, he shall be giver of years. It is then necessary, that
these two things concur together, to the end that one Planet be giver of
years, that is to say, that he hath dignity nevertheless of term (for the
dignity of face is not sufficient enough for one so great effect) in sign and
degree, in the which shall be the giver of life, and that he regard the said
giver of life, of one aspect or other.

This gyuer of time, well lodged upon the point of Angles, gives him old
years, in points of the houses succeeding: is means, is Cadants, is
smallness, and for as much as he shall be long from the beginnings of the said
houses, so much the more or less he must diminish the number of his old
years, means, and smalnes, after the difference taken of the next houses with
the difference of years. And first of all if it be within any angle of heaven,
not always to the first point, you must proceed also, and take in the first
place the distance of the said angle, and of the next house succeeding. Note
afterward, how many degrees the said giver of years is fro the point of the
angle. Then take the difference of his old years and means, multiply this
difference by the number of the said elongment, and part it by the distance of
the said angle, of the house succeeding: that which rests, take for the exact
number of the years of life, promised by the said giver of years. If he be
within any house, succeeding out of the points and beginnings of the same, you
must first take the distance of the house succeeding, and of the next Cadant:
then note how many degrees the said giver of years shall be elonged from the
point of the said house succeeding; afterward take the difference of years,
means and smalnes, the which multiply by the second number, and part it by the
first: the residue shall be the time of life which was promised by the said
giver of years. If it be in Cadant houses it shall be upon the points of
them, or after, he gives but only small years: Except when he is within 5.
degrees near to the point of the said angles, then you must reckon as it
follows. Take the difference of the old years, and smalnes of the Planets
that gives the years, and divide them into 5. parts; afterward look in which
of the said 5. degrees shall be the said Planet. For if it be in the first and
most near the point of the angle, (that is to say) if he be elonged from the
said angle one degree only, then is it convenient to take out of his old
years, one of the said 5. parts: if he be elonged by 2. degrees, you must take
out 2. parts: if he be elonged 3. degrees, you must substract 3. parts, c. You
must note that the Moon in the viij. gives but small years. And that the
Sun within the 9. and Iupiter in the 11. and Venus in the 5. and Mercury by
the whole ascendant, and the Moon in the 3. give their old years as
perfectly, as if they were upon the points of the angles: For they be places
wherein principally they do rejoice. Iupiter, Venus, and Mercury within the 9.
give their years indifferent: and the Moon in the 11. gives them old. Mars in
the 6. and Saturne in the 12. they are indifferent, because in the said places
they greatly delight themselves: wherefore if they were not evil, they would
there give old years.

Upon this propose it is convenient also to note, that one burnt Planet
cannot be a giver of years: and the Moon in the prime of the beams of the
Sun, cannot give life nor time. If a Planet, which otherwise may be a giver
years, be burnt in his proper house or exaltation, receiving there the Sun,
causes the Sun to take the charge to be the giver of years. If it come to
pass that the Sun or the Moon be in their proper houses or exaltations,
they may be givers of life time together, with out need to desire aspect of
any other Planet. If one place being significator of life, have many givers of
years, we will take him that hath most dignities in the same place, and if
they be equal in dignities we will take him that hath his aspect most whole,
and his beams most nearest the said giver of life. If they find two or three
or many givers of life, that have their givers of years, they must always
consider and direct, as the first and principal, following the years of the
Planets.

Old years. Mean years. Small years. Of 57 43 30 Saturne. 79 45 12
Iupiter. 66 40 15 Mars. 120 69 19 Sol 82 45 8 Venus. 76 48 20 Mercury. 108 66
25 Luna.

CHAP. X. Of them that augment and diminish the number of the said years.
THey which augment the number of the said years, are Iupiter, Venus, the
Sun, the Moon, Mercurie fortified; the which fortunately regarding the gyuer
of years, with an amiable aspect adding to their small years, (that is to
understand) the Sun x. and ix. Venus viij. the Moon xxv. c. Likewise If the
gyuer of time be conjoined with any fixed star of amiable nature, it takes
of the said star the number of the small years of the Planet, of the which
the said star holds his nature. If the said Planets regard the giver of
time with an evil aspect with reception, they add as before, which they do
not when they have no reception: Except Iupiter and Venus, that in every sort
of aspects, with reception or without reception, always adding to their small
years, for to see that the gyuer of time be not Saturne or Mars, towards the
which the reception is necessary, if the aspect be of enmity.

The said Planets evil placed and unfortunate, in the place of the whole
small years, in adding the half, or the third, or fourth part, or certain
number of months, of weeks, or of days, according to the greatness or
smallness of their infelicity. The amiable aspects of ill fortunes, with
reception, give their years small: without reception, they do neither good
nor evil. If the giver of years be retrogarde or meridionall descending, or
in his fall or detriment, or in the way burned, that takes from it the fifth
part of that which he had given being otherwise disposed. That which happened
also to the 3. superior Planets, when they be occidental, to the Moon when
she decreases, and when she is in the xx. and ix. degree of a sign, and when
she is slack in her course. The Sun regarding the Moon with the aspects of
enmity without reception diminished. Saturne, Mars, or Mercurie depriued,
looking to the evil aspect of the giver of light they take away the number of
their small years: Except they recover; For then by opposition they do but
half the evil: By quadrate aspect, they diminish but the fourth part. The
tail of the Dragon taken from the Moon xij. years, I have found it often by
experience, that the fortunes (that is to understand, Iupiter Venus) or the
Sun and the Moon, and Mercurie fortunate in the first house, or near to the
giver of life, adding to their small years, although they do not regard the
giver of time: and to the contrary, that the infortunes in the said places,
take away the small years, without regarding the said giver of time. Except
when they were well honoured in the said places, or when they were Lords of
the Nativities.

CHAP. XI. Of the Lords of the Nativity.
YOu must take the Lord of the Nativity, out of the places of the which we
have taken the giver of life, (that is to understand) of the place of the Sun
and of the Moon, of the degree ascendant of the part of Fortune, and of the
degrees of the precedent conjunction or opposition of lights. Of all these
places likewise it is to be considered, what Planet hath most dignities, for
he shall be Lord of the Nativity, that which the giver of years shall
signify the time of our life, according to the situation felicity or
infelicity, as we have before said of the giver of years. And if the one give
more than the other, you must take the difference of both, and the half ad or
diminish: according as shall be necessary.

CHAP. XII. Of the understanding and manners of a Man.
HOW to know the felicity or infelicity of the Spirit, the nature of the
same, you must look in the place of Mercurie and of the Moon, the Planet that
in these two places hath most dignities, shall be signifier of the spirit. The
which if it be Saturne well disposed, shall signify the man of a great and
profound knowledge, of good counsel, and of good gravity or a strong opinion:
close, secrete, solitary, dissembling his good and evil, a lover of just men,
and of good age: rejoicing upon the treasures, heritages and labourings;
holding discourse of antiquities and of great affairs, admirator of buildings.
Sometimes a little merry, incontinent sad: sometimes laughing or murmuring
by himself alone, a little slothful, a little envious, and not always
keeping his promise. If he be unfortunate, he shall be noted envious, sad,
solitary, fearful, mellancholie, faint-harted, a raylor, jealous, a
malefactor, evil, a blasphemer, a liar deceiver, a Usurer, holder of opinions:
rejecting the counsel of others: fearing that all the world doth deceive him:
uncivil, a villain, a slouine, dishonest, flying the company of men unless
it be to deceive them, and to draw any profit, having no other friend but his
villainous gain, using sometimes sorcery.

Iupiter signifier of the spirit, well disposed, shows the man sweet,
courteous, honest, gracious, amiable, faithful, pitiful, liberal, of good
behaviour, of good hart good love: following nobleness and all honesty: loving
God, abounding in friends, dreaming always upon some virtuous thing, and
withdraws himself sometimes solitary, to think upon some goodness: using in
all and by all his affairs, a great equity, prudence and modesty, having
great courage to accomplish. If he be unfortunate of himself, and not to
meet with other stars, in the place of good love, he will give sometimes
foolishnes in the place of honesty, pride in the place of liberality,
prodigality in the place of loving good will, doth yield him an hypocrite,
seeming to follow nobleness, when indeed he will dispraise all the world: in
the place of honesty, it will make him dream of tyranny.

If the said Iupiter be unfortunate of other Planets and not of himself, he
takes all their vices, and covers them with his said virtues in manner of
an evil hypocrite. If Mars well fortunate be the said significator, he shall
cause the man to be of a high courage, hardy, ireful, furious, a hazarder, a
conductor of wars, the first in business, and only in deeds and
cogitations given to arms: strong, stubberne and mighty, trusting too much to
his own puissance, not fearing any peril, and blessed in all his deeds. If
he be unfortunate, it makes the man timorous, a thief, a liar, blasphemer,
mutenous, cruel, a murderer, hardy, proud, arrogant, not to be borne
withal, despising his own proper goods, and the goods of other, using force
and violence against his Parents, and against all the world: a diuilish man,
without shame, without counsel, without virtue, without love, without any
fear or reverence of God, furious, seditious, given and prompt to all
mischief.

If the Sun be significator in his good disposition, it makes the man
mannerly, wise, prudent, of good counsel, a lover of nobleness, following glory
and honour, given to justice and governments of Towns and Cities, loving
hunting, worthy, and of great estimation. If it be unfortunate, it shows
great pride, excessive ambition, and tyranny, and doth nourish the thought.

If Venus signify the quality of the spirit in good disposition, it makes
the man pleasant, merry, dancing, laughing, content, amiable, gracious, of
good conversation, and a little jealous. If unfortunate, it makes the man
frowning, and too merry, of evil maintenance, using dishonest words, given to
voluptuousnes, and jealous of that which belongs not unto him.

If Mercurie be fortunate, it gyves good understanding, good memory, great
perseverance, great subtlety of spyrite, good discourse of reason, full of
wit, very apt to know the Mathematicals, and the secretes of nature; it makes
the man a Poet, an Orator, well spoken, writing well, and a great trader. If it
be evil disposed, it makes him presumpteous, of little knowledge, with great
estimation of his person, inconstant, a liar, a mocker, a deceiver ordinarily,
fine, fantastical, and vicious.

If it be the Moon that is fortunate, she makes him that is borne, pacified,
modest, of good hart, or good will, and easy to endure any thing that one will
do. Unfortunate doth show inconstancy, lightness of spyrite, faint-harted,
prodigal, faythlesse. If the said signifiers, are not greatly fortunate or
unfortunate, it is convenient to rebate the said significations good and
vicious, after the quality of their good and evil dispositions.

If any Planet be participant in the signification of the manners, or if it
have great communication of aspect with the principal significator, then
considering the vices and virtues of him, that (according to his good or evil
disposition) we do join them to him which gives the principal. As if
Saturne well disposed, be principal significator, and Mars unfortunate be
participant, or regard Saturne of one whole aspect with reception, then it is
convenient to mingle some little of the nature of Mars unfortunate, with the
significations of Saturue fortunate.

The Astrologians do advertise us, that if the Lord of the ascendant be well
placed, and the said significator of manners evil disposed, you must more
consider upon that which the Lord of the ascendant signifies, then upon that
which the said significator doth promise. Moreover, they consider more
particulerly, the place of Mercurie and of the Moon, and the aspect which they
receive. If Mercurie be in the ascendant, it makes the Man ingenious, and of
great and profound knowledge, a great Philosopher, a Mathematician, an Orator,
a Poet, a Divine; principally when he is in the place in the which Saturne hath
at the least 4. dignities, or when he receives aspect of Saturne.

Mercury in the twelfth, receiving aspect of the Moon, hath very near as
great force for to give wit and knowledge, as if he were in the first. And
where that Mercurie is, if he regard the Moon, and both two, or the one or the
other, regard the ascendant or the Lord of the ascendant, this is sign of a
good and subtle spyrite. And if Saturne, Iupiter and Mars, or other Planets,
do communicate to him their favourable beams, if they mingle their good
virtues, if they regard the evil aspect, they intermingle their vices: except
Iupiter and Venus, which of evil aspect do never annoy them, and less when he
hath reception.

If the Sun be temporal light, it may signify the quality of the spyrite
with the Moon and Mercurie in the form above said. If Mercurie be occidental
within the house or exaltation of the Sun, having aspect of the Moon, or of
the ascendant, or of his Lord, it is the sovereign sign of good and high
spirits, of men of al knowledge, given to great enterprises and virtues, as
Poets, Orators, Mathematicians, Counsellers, Administrators of Common-weales,
and Governors of Realms: principally when he is fortunate in every angle of
Heaven.

Mercurie within the seventh house fortunate, gives good understanding, and
ripe judgment: it makes the man subtle, watchful, and of good counsel,
with great craft to govern his affairs. Mercurie in the ninth or third house,
gives knowledge and contemplation. The part of the understanding of the
spyrite with their Lords fortunate, signifies good spirits and good manners.

Mercurie in the sign of Pisces, doth not any way love learning: the contrary
happens, when he is in the sign of Virgo and of Gemini, by all the places of
the figure of Heaven. Saturne within the houses of Mercurie, is always
contemplative: Mars, a little deceiver. Mercurie within the houses of Saturne
fortunate, is always studious, within those of Mars, he is full of evil
words, and often false.

When the lyghts and significators of manners shall be oppressed with ill
fortune, the child shall be of a very strange and perverse nature. The Moon
opposite to the Sun, makes him hate all men. If the Sun and the Moon with
the ascendant and his Lord, be all in feminine signs, the manners of him
shall be feminine, and he shall be a man of little hart. If they be in signs
masculine at the nativity of a woman, her deeds shall be manly, and she shall
be a woman of great enterprise.

If Venus be in the sign of the Lyon, or under the beams of the Sun, or in
conjunction or other aspect of Mars, she makes that the man shall be suddenly
stricken in love. And if in that estate she be within the first or tenth house,
without any aspect of Iupiter, he shall be voluptuous without having shame;
and when she shall be in the sign of Scorpio, the aspect of Iupiter towards
Venus, gives always chastity, and love of virtue.

CHAP. XIII. Of riches and poverty.
FOR the riches and poverty, it is convenient first that you look to the
second house, for if she and her Lord be fortunate, we say that the child
shall be rich, and if they be unfortunate, he shall be poor on that side. Then
afterward you must consider the part of Fortune, the which with his Lord well
disposed, promises great store of goods, without other witness. If they be
evil disposed, you must come to the part of goods the which with his Lord
fortunate enriches, unfortunate gives nothing. Likewise you must judge of the
part of felicity and of his Lord. And that thing which the other places
signify, you must always have recourse to the natural significator of
riches, which is Iupiter, the which well placed and fortunate, gives goods in
abundance: principally if he be Lord of the nativity, or Lord of the hour,
or of the ascendant, or of the second house, or of the part of Fortune, or of
the part of goods, or of the part of felicity, or of temporal light, or of
the tenth house, otherwise he gives nothing.

When the aboue-sayde Significators shall be unfortunate, the child cannot be
rich, if the tenth house (of the which we will speak hereafter) do not
promise him some good luck. Men find also often by experience, that when a
Planet is within his own house or exaltation, or in his joy, (without being
unfortunate, or else where environed with the fortunes or their beams) that he
gives goods, although he be not Significator of riches. If in the fourth house
be his lord or other fortunate Planet, he promises inheritances. If any fixed
star of the first or second greatness be joined to the temporal light, or to
the degree ascendant, or to the points of the other angles, or to other Planets
in the said places placed, she doth raise the man of base estate, to great
authority and honour: and if he be of the race of Princes, it will make him a
puissant Lord and King.

When a like Planet shall be Lord of the ascendant, of the second house, the
child shall be covetous of money gain, as that which happens when
Capricorne is ascendant. When the Lord of the second house shall be within the
first, the goods come without labour. Likewise when the Lord of the second
house gives strength to the Lord of the ascendant. When the Lord of the
ascendant shall be in the second, the goods shall not come without travail:
nor when the lord of the ascendant shall give strength to the Lord of the
second. Saturne, Mars, Mercurie depraved, the Sun and the tail of the Dragon
lunarie, within the second, destroy the man, and disperse his goods; except
when they have at the least four dignities, or when they be received. When the
Lord of the ascendant shall regard with evil aspect the second house, or the
part of goods and of fortune, or their Lords, the child of his own proper will
shall disperse his goods. If the Lord of the ascendant be unfortunate in the
second house, the child shall be too large a giver, and prodigal. If any
mis-fortune have domination upon the ascendant, and in the second, the child
shall be destroyed by others, which shall destroy his goods and rob him. When
the said Significators of goods shall be unfortunate, the child shall be all
his life in payne and travail, without any advancement or profit.

Abraham Auenesre saith, that if the Lord of the second be burnt, and Iupiter
evil disposed, that the child shall be Four Planets in their falls or detrymets,
do show great miseries, as it was in the natiuite of Iohn Duke of Saxony, who
was take prisoner of Charles the 5. This good Duke had 3. Planets in their
detryments, and one Perigren.
always poor. And Hermes saith: when the Lord of the profession (of the which
we shall speak in the 27. chap.) shall be burnt, or retrogard, or in the sixth
or xij. house, and not any Planet regarding the Moon, the child shall seek
his living from door to door like a beggar. Iupiter, Venus, and the head of
the Dragon in the second, always enrich. Venus in the fifth promises some
good. The Sun in the nynth fortunate, gives benefices, or other goods of the
side of the men of the Church. Mars in the sixth well disposed, gives good or
nourishment to Beasts, and exercise of Physic. The Sun in the sign of
Leo, will never suffer the child to be poor.

CHAP. XIIII. By what means riches and poverty comes.
Having well noted the places which promise and bring riches, in regarding the
situation of the said significators, we will know by what means ought to come
the good and the evil. For if the significator be in the first house received
and fortunate, it easily enriches the person by his industry and proper
labour: and if he be in the said place unfortunate, it is that his industry and
labour doth profit him nothing; and the sooner from thence to loss and damage.

If he be in the second house well disposed, it profits to talk with
Merchants, and lend merchandise money, and of them make gain. And if he be
there evil disposed, the said business brings great damages. If he be within
the third house fortunate, it brings the goods from the side of Brothers and
Sisters, and Cousins allies, or fro the side of the men of the Church in taking
charge of their affairs: or to traffic here and there about his Country. If
he be in the 4. well placed, he is enriched of inheritances goods of our fathers
predecessors, of laborings tilling of ground, of houses, oftentimes doth meet
with treasure. If it be within the fifth, it profits to be a good Dancer, a
good Player, to be brave, gracious, pleasant and delightful, and sometimes to
be voluptuous: always well, because of God-fathers and God-mothers, and of
their proper children; or because of gifts, or to make some voyage and do some
embassage. Those things that come appertaining to bravery and volupteousnesse,
and making ready delicates, odours perfumes, of this house they very suddenly
draw their profit. If the said significator be in the sixth well placed, he
shall make his profit in nourishing, and buying and selling of Sheep,
muttons, and other small beasts, or shall become rich by the diligence and
faithfulness of his servant, or shall gain by the exercise of Physic. The
Gaylors and others which have the charge of prysons, draw oftentimes their
profit from this house.

If the significator be in the seventh fortunate, it promises great good of
the side of women, by marriages or like agreements: and oftentimes to have
pleaded gained his suit in the law, or having been in the wars and pilled
the enemies. If it be in the eight well disposed, it gives great dowry and
great good, because of women, and sometimes heritages, of the which he shall
not greatly think of. If it be in the ninth fortunate, he shall be enriched of
the goods of the church, or by traffic travelling in strange Countries.

If it be well in the tenth, he shall have his profit of the side of Kings,
Princes, and Lords, and be made of them Governors of Towns, and honourable
Officers; or be enriched by their own vocation and profession.

If it be within the eleventh in good disposition, he profits by reason of
friends, and by favour of men in authority.

If it be in the twelueth, fortunate, it gives gain by nourishing and selling
of Horses, Mares, Oxen, Kine, Cammells, and other great beasts: or to have
charge of prysonners: or of the persecution of enemies, with profitable
victory in the end; As oftentimes it happens to some, which accusing others,
and cannot prove the crimes intended be condemned to make a good amends to
the party: after all which persecution, the party doth find himself
content.

Saturne by himself, enriches by heritages labours, nourishing of all
Cattle, and with trading with ancient men, or with Countrymen, Mariners,
other wild men: in Corn, Wines, Oils, Fysh, Oade, Rosen, Alum, Leather,
Tiles, Stones, Plaster, Chalk, Lyme, and such merchandise.

Iupiter, by Offices, benefices, and business of men of the Church, and all
gains that are made without deceit. Except when he is unfortunate, for then
under the shadow of virtue, he doth his affairs craftily.

Mars, by wars, suits, or thefts, or by slaughter, and selling of Cattle: or
if it be in aspect of Venus, by physic.

The Sun, by honourable offices, dignities Lordships, by great credit, by
charges to keep and gather the money of Princes and Common-weales.

Venus, by musique, pleasure, grace and virtue, by bravery, by play, and
sometimes by voluptuousnes, and sometime to serve some great Lady.

Mercury, to speak well and write well, and to be very skilful, to be a
Secretary, a Register, a Poet, an Orator, and a good advocate, to be a
Geometrician, Arethmetrician, Astrologian, and a good trader. The moon for
voyages, navigation, wandering, and trading in far Countries, to have the
chardge of small affaieres of the common wealth.

If the said Significator be unfortunate in the same places, they bring damage
and interests, and if they be within the houses of Saturne, Iupiter or other
planets, we judge the profit interest after the nature of Saturne, Iupiter,
and other planets which shall be lords of the same places.

CHAP. XV. Of the time when the riches and damages shall come.
THe said riches shall come, when the Significators of goods shall meet by
direction, in body or in aspects of amity. As if Venus in some nativity
promise goods, they shall come when Venus by direction shall touche the place
of Iupiter, or the degree of the second house, or the part of fortune, or their
good aspects: Likewise you must judge of damages in goods. For when a
significator of damages and interests doth meet by directio a significator of
goods, or his aspects of enmity, then certainly comes the loss and damage. As
when Saturne or Mars meet Iupiter in the part of fortune, the part of goods
and other places which signify riches, the which also you must direct to the
said ill fortunes, or to their evil aspect sygnifying always some loss.

By the revolutions also you may know the time of good and evil fortune. For
when Iupiter in the nativity shall be in the sign Libra well disposed, always
and as many times, as you shall find him in the revolution in the sign, in the
same fortune certainly he shall then bring the goods that he promised, at the
hour of the Nativity.

To the contrary, if he be unfortunate by Saturne or Mars in the Nativity,
always and as many times as he shall be in the revolution over against the
said vnfortunators, then the said damage shall come in the sort and manner as
was signified in the nativity.

If the Significator of goods be Oriental, the goods come in youth, if it be
Occidental, in age. If it be in the first house he shall be rich in his first
age, if it be between the first and the tenth, upon the time of twenty and
seven years. If it be in the tenth, between thirty and five and thirty. If
it be between the tenth and seventh, about forty and forty eight. If it be
in the seventh he shall be rich in his old age. You must also look to the three
Lords of the triplicitie, and to every Significator of goods. For the first
lord signifies the first age, the second of the time of thirty or forty
years, the third the last age. Wherefore if the first lord of the triplicitie
of one significator of riches be fortunate, the said goods signified shall
come at the first time: or if he be unfortunate, the damage then shall stick,
by this means you may apply the other lords, to the ages following, and
according to the good or evil disposition you must judge of the fortune of
every one.

CHAP. XVI. Of Brethren.
MArs and Saturne within the third house out of their principal dignities and
not received, signifies that the child shall have no brother nor Sister. And
if they be in their principal dignities, or if they be fortunately received,
they may then give some brethren, but by reason of the which he shall always
be in sorrow, strife, and contentions. The tail of the Dragon or lunaris,
makes him see the death of his brethren, when she is in the third house.
That doth the Lord of the said house also, when he is in the tenth or eight,
and when he is burned or otherwise evilly disposed.

If in the ix. be any Planet well dignified, and the Lord of the third house
be unfortunate, his brethren shall dye before him, if he do not find in the
same house some favourable Planet, or if the Lord of the said house be not
amiably regarded of fortunes.

Iupiter, the Sun, Venus, the head of the Dragon, the Moon, and Mercury,
fortunate in the third house, do give many brethren, happy, pacified and
fortunate. Mars, regarding the said house, or his Lord of evil aspect,
signifies strife and debate among the brethren. That which signifies also
the Lord of the said house, in the vij. and xij. And Mars opposite to the
ascendant, or to the Lord of the ascendant, and to the temporal light, and
when a like Planet is Lord of the iij. and vij. or xij. house. The part of the
amity of brethren with his Lord fortunate, signifies concorde: unfortunate,
discord among brethren. The part of brethren, and the third house, with
their Lords in watery signs, denotes many brethren and sisters: and if they be
fortunate, they signify concorde and good love together: unfortunate, denotes
the contrary.

CHAP. XVII. Of the Father and the Mother.
THe Lords of the fourth, and of the part of the Father, burnt out of their
proper houses and exaltations, signify that the Father cannot long live; The
ill fortunes within the 4. signify that the father shall dye presently after,
if within the said house they be not dignified, or if the fortunes do not
enterlace their favourable beams: Likewise you must judge of the mother, when
the said Constellations shall be in the 10. The fortunes in the 4. signify
long life to the Father, and happy fortune: likewise of the mother, when they
be within the x. The Sun unfortunate within the iiij. or viii. house,
testifies that the Father shall not live long: likewise you must judge of the
mother when the Moon shall be so disposed. If the Lord of the 4. be in the 11.
the child shall see the death of his Father. If the Lord of the x. be in the
5. he shall see the death of his mother. Venus or the Moon in the 4.
unfortunate, gives peril to the mother at her deliverance. The Lord of the
4. in the 7. or 12. house, or in evil aspects of ill fortunes, signifies
strife and quarrels between the Father and the Son. Likewise you must judge
of the mother, when the Lord of the 10. shall be in the same disposition. The
part of the Father fortunate, denotes long and happy life to the Father:
unfortunate, he shall dye very quickly. The part of the mother, signifies as
much of the mother, after her good or evil disposition.

Commonly the Astrologians have regard to the Sun and to Saturne for the
Father, and to Venus and the Moon for the mother; If the nativity be by day,
they take the Sun for significator of the father: if it by be night they take
Saturne, if the Sun be not in any angle of heaven: For if it be in the 1. or
4. they prefer him always to Saturne. If the Sun be in the 1. in the
nativity of the 1. child, the figure of the nativity of the Father and of
the Son shall be both one. The significator of the Father, joined to the
Fortunes, or receiving their amiable aspects, denote good fortune and long life
to the Father: the contrary you must understand when they be unfortunate.

If the Lord of the ascendant, and the Lord of the 4. do look with an evil
aspect; the Son and the Father shall be in discord, principally if Mars
intermeddle with his pernicious beams. For the mother you must look
principally to Venus, if the nativity be by day: or to the Moon if it be by
night; And after their good and evil dispositions, you must judge the good or
contrary fortune of the mother.

CHAP. XVIII. Of inheritances and earthly goods.
THE Fortunes, or other Planets fortunate, within the fourth or eight house,
denotes inheritances and possessions: the ill fortunes do deny or despise
them. Saturne, natural significator of heritages, lands and possessions, well
disposed, doth give great goods and lands, and makes the man happy in
labouring and tyllage; That also signifies the significators of riches, when
they be well disposed within the houses of Saturne. And the part of heritages,
and the part of fortune in sowers tyllers when they be fortunate, with their
Lords. If the said significator be unfortunate, you must judge the contrary.

When one self Planet is lord of the first and fourth house, the child
shall have inheritances which shall enrich him, if the said lord be fortunate:
and if he sell and dispearse them, he is unfortunate. The lord of the
ascendant, or the Moon within the fourth fortunate, and amiably by Iupiter or
Venus regarded, denote that he shall find some great sum of money under the
earth, principally, if Saturne cast his Trynes or Sextile beams: or that of
Mines of gold and silver he shall be made rich.

The tail of the Dragon in the south, makes him to sell dispearse his goods.
That doth also the head of the Dragon, when she is in a sign earthly or
waterish: In airy signs or fiery, she gives great goods and lands.

CHAP. XIX. Of Infantes.
THe Fortunes in the fifth, give the children: the vnfortunes denies them.
Except when they be in their proper house or exaltations, for then they give
evil children; that which they do also, when regarding the said house, or
the lord of the same, with eeuill aspects. If the Lord of the first be burned,
he gives the children abortiues, or which presently after their birth, dye. If
the said lord be in the xij he shall see the death of his children. If he be
in the vij. or xii. or if a like Planet be Lord of the v. vij. or xij. he
shall have suits and questions with his children. The lord of the ascendant,
in evil aspect of the lord of the v. denotes as much. Before you give
judgment of the Children, you must consider the x. and the vii. house, and the
parts of children with their lords. The significators of the children in
Masculine signs, signifies Male children. in feminines, denote daughters:
Likewise you must judge when they be coupled with planets, masculines, or
feminines.

CHAP. XX. Of Servant.
THe significations of servant must be taken of the place of Mars Mercurie,
of the sixth house of the part of servant, and of their lords. The which
fortunate gives faithful servants, unfortunate give them evil. When the
lord of the ascendant the lord of the syxt shall be in good aspect together to
the sygnificators of riches, the child shall be come rich by the industry and
faythfulnesse of his servants. Likewise when the fortunes be within the syxt
house: to the contrary, when the Significator of riches shall be unfortunate in
the syxt house, he shall be undone by his servants. Likewise when the ill
fortunes shall be in the said house. If the lord of the vi. be in the x. he shall
yield his servant more greater masters then himself. If the lord of the
vi. house be in the sign of a humane figure, his servants shall bear him
reverence and be at his commandment.

What kind of conditions every Planet doth yield.
Fortunate.
Sad of a deep cogitation. Secrete. Solitary. Laboursome. Painful. A heaper
of goods. Patient. Sparing. Careful of his own preferment.

Unfortunate.
An abject. A fugitive. Base minded. A vile man. Negligent. Fearful. Sad or

things untaught.

sowing deceit. A slanderer. Forgetful. Foolish. Full of wicked counsel and
malice.

Thus may you gather the natural disposition of any man, either present or
absent: according to the nature of the Planets as is above specified. As for
the lights, the from her to her doth make their manners most apparent, from
her to her more obscure.

CHAP. XXI. Of Diseases.
YOU must first of all consider the places of Saturne and of Mars, and of the
Lord of the sixth house. And according to the sign in the which they be, you
must judge the sickness to be in the place marked by the said sign. As if
Saturne were in the sign of Libra, it denotes that the sickness is in the
reins of the nature of Saturne: because that Libra is the sign that hath
government over the reins, as shall be declared in the second Book. Likewise
you must judge of other Significators, after the government of the sign in the
which they be.

The sickness and accidents coming by Saturne, Mars and other Planets, shall be
explaned in the second book. Mars in the ascendant, gives always some
notable hurt upon the face, or upon the head, and often near the eyes, when
he is near the lights. Saturne in the first house, yields the man to be
very sad, and melancholy, and vexes the mind, causing horrible ill and
fearful imaginations. The tail of the Dragon in the first, darkens much
the sight and often yields the men blind, when the Luminaries or the fortunes,
do not intermingle their favourable beams. Saturne and Mars in the tenth,
signify sickness in the neck, in the seventh, in the buttocks: as Fistuloes,
Emrods, Ulcers, and hurts c. In the sixth, diseases in the feet: in the
twelfith, hurts and grieses in the legs, as I have often tried. Saturne
unfortunate, signifies diseases in the parts appertaining to Saturne. Iupiter
and the other, signify as much when they be evil disposed. Of the parts
which belong to the Planets we will speak of in the second Book.

They which have the Lumynaries, or any of the principal places in the figure
unfortunate in the figne of Scorpio, are subject to the French-pocks. The ill
fortunes in the sign of Gemini, give always some great and violent blows
upon the shoulders, legs arms. The Moon unfortunate in the sign of Aries,
signifies great pain in the head. Saturne and Mars joined to the Lumynaries,
or to the Lord of the ascendant, trouble the sight, and spoil the eyes with
some blow. The Sun in the nativities Diurnes, signifyeth the right eye, the
Moon the left: in the Nocturnes, to the contrary. If the degrees of the first
house, or the Lumynaries be joined with any troublesome star, the eyes shall
be dark, and the sight troubled; likewise if they be in the signs which the
Astrologers call Azemena and filthy dregs. c.

Saturne in the sixth house burned in a warry sign, denotes some form of
leprosy. Saturne in the ascendant, makes some notable deformity in the face,
when he is near the Moon. The ill fortunes, and the Moon and Venus in warry
signs, signify leprosy, ulcers cankers on the body, and villainous spots in
the face. Saturne in the ninth, and the Moon in the eight unfortunate, denote
trouble of mind and solly. Venus joined to Mercurie unfortunate by Saturne or
Mars, without aspect of Iupiter or of the Sun, signify notable grief in the
parts of generation. If Venus Mercury be under the beams of the Sun, they
signify as much. Saturne with the Moon burned, causes Palsies and
Impostumes. Mercurie unfortunate, gives always some impediment in the tongue:
and so doth Saturne also when he is unfortunate in the temporal lights. The
Sun unfortunate, denotes weakness of the hart: principally when he is lord
of the sixth house, or Lord of the part of sicknesles. The ill fortunes with the
tail of the Dragon, cause looseness and the flixe of the belly. They that
have the Sun or Mars in the signs of Aries or Gemini, be subject to the
Stone. The retrogradation and burning of Saturne and Iupiter, spoil the
hearing, and the teeth.

When the Moon Mercury do not look between them, and do not regard the
ascendant, nor the Lord of the ascendant, the child shall be troubled in his
understanding. The retrogradation of all the five Planets, signifyeth the
falling sickness. The ill fortunes joined in the ascendant in evil aspects of
the Moon or the Lord of the ascendant, denote entire folly. The part of
sicknesses with his Lord fortunate, preserves from sickness, unfortunate, give
many evils.

CHAP. XXII. Of Marriage.
FOR the marriage, you must look the vij. house and his Lord, the places of
Venus and the Moon in the nativities of men, and in the places of the Sun
and of Mars in nativities of women: and the parts of marriage, and the place of
Iupiter. If the said Significators be fortunate, the marriage shall be happy,
if they be unfortunate, it shall be full of envies, reproaches and evils. If
some be fortunate, and some unfortunate by certain times, now happy, and then
unhappy, it shall be manifest. Many Planets in the seventh house, give many
women: likewise when many Planets regard the said house or his Lord. If Venus,
the Lord of the seventh house be burned, or otherwise of Saturne oppressed,
the child shall never marry. Iupiter and Venus within the 6. or 8. signifyeth
that he shall marry a widow. Iupiter burned, signifies as much. Otherwise, if
Iupiter behold Venus, and the other significators of marriage, it promises
maids and virgins. If Venus or Iupiter, or the Lord of the seventh house be
joined to Saturne, or if Saturne be within the seventh house, the woman shall
have some note of infamy; (that is to understand) she shall be of a strange
religion, or shall be a bastard, or shall be of the race of Lepors, or of some
other, by whom the Parents have received some shame, or she shall be deformed,
and her Parents shall be of a very weak condition. Mars in the said house, or
beholding with evil aspect the Significators of marriage, intermingle strife
and contentions between the man and the wife: the same doth also Venus in the
seventh or twelfth house.

Mars in the ninth, as much in the nativities of women as of men, denotes some
manner of separation of marriage. And Venus in the ninth, signifies that the
man shall hate his wife, not so much for the vice which he shall find in her, but
of a desire to be solitary. The Significators of marriage unfortunate, or
within the houses Cadents, signifies the woman to be of a simple race, or the
husband in the nativities of women.

If Venus and the Lord of the seventh house, join with the Significators of
riches, beholding the Lord of the ascendant with an amiable aspect, she gives
much goods by reason of women. The Significators of marriage within the third or
ninth, or else where Peregrines, signify that he shall marry out of his
Country. The fortunes within the seventh house, denotes happy marriage, the
ill fortunes unhappy. The Lord of the seventh within the second, denotes
that he shall see the death of his wife. The Significators of marriage
occidental, witness that he shall marry late, or in his youth take a wife
older then himself. Oriental, denotes that he shall marry in his youth, or
in his age marry a young wife. Likewise you must judge of husbands in the
nativities of women.

CHAP. XXIII. Of a dowery and other goods by the means of marriage.
BEcause the eight house is succeeding to the seventh, by good reason it
signifies the profit of the significations of the seventh, (that is to say)
of marriage. If then in the eight there be any fortunate Planet, or any part
fortunate, the child shall have great dowry by his wife, and of that side
shall meet with great inheritances great goods. To the contrary, if Saturne
and Mars be unfortunate in the said house, he shall have small dowery, and the
same shall never be fully paid.

When the fortunes be in the said house unfortunate, he hath hope of great
goods the which in the end he shall not enjoy. The Lord of the said place
unfortunate, denotes as much: and if he be fortunate and coupled with the
Significators of riches, it denotes great goods and great profit on that
side. It happens well sometimes when the seventh house is fortunate, and the
eight unfortunate. As that which signifies a little dowery desperation of
other goods towards his wife, that always he shall be enriched by the
diligence, industry, and faithfulness of his wife.

CHAP. XXIIII. Of the Death.
YOU must first consider if there be any Planet in the eight house, for it is
convenient to take it for Significator of the death. If within the said house
there be never a Planet, take them for Significators that be in the seventh,
preferring him always that is best dignified. If within the seventh you find
none, draw the Sgnifycator of the death from these places which follow.

Of the ascendant and of his Lord.

Of the eight house and of his Lord.

Of the part of Death and of his Lord.

Of the eight Sign, from the place of the Sun of his Lord.

Of the eight Sign, from the Moon and of his Lord.

Of the place of the first Lord of the triplicitie of the fourth angle.

Of the place of the Planet which hath dignity of term, to the degree of the
seventh house.

The Planet which in all these places shall be most dignified, shall be
principal Sgnificator of death.

If Saturne being in the eight or seventh house, or otherwise more dignified
in the above said points of the figure, he is principal significator of the
death. If he be well disposed, it witnesses, that the same party shall dye
of the Dropsy, of some great stopping of the liver, and of the Spleen, or of a
quarterne Fever, of the flixe of the belly, of Pthisick, or of some burning
Fever, and of Impostumations of the ears. c. If it be greatly unfortunate, and
together with the Lord of the ascendant, and the luminaries temporally be evil
disposed, it denotes violent death by Impostumes, Palsies, falling down of
humours, suffocations, ouer-flowen with water. When it is in watery Signs, by
some fall or ruin: when it is in earthly Signs, by great blows: for to be
hanged when it is in ayerie Signs.

If Iupiter be Significator of the death, it denotes that he shall die of a
Pluresie, of a Squinance, or of some hot appostumations of the liver, or of
the lunges, or of other sicknesses coming of wind or of blood; and that if he
be fortunate. For when he is evil disposed and unfortunate, it makes him die
by the hand of justice, by the commandment of the Prince, by sentence of the
Judge or of the Marshall, by ouer-flowing in waters, to be whipped and
scourged, by long imprisonment.

If it be Mars well disposed, by continual tertian Fevers, by flixe of blood,
by Carbuncles and pestilences, by Impostumes coming of choleric matters,
burnings by too much using of women. If he be very evil disposed, it makes him
to be hanged and strangled, or smothered, or otherwise killed in his bed, or
on his horse. When he is an airy sign or partaker within the water, when he
is a watery sign or fallen fro on high, or of some ruinous murderer. When he
is a terrestrial, or burned: when he is a fiery Sign: principally if the Lord
of the ascendant and the luminaries temporally be unfortunate by Mars. If it be
the Sun well disposed, he shall die of some hot disease. If it be
unfortunate, by the commandment of the Prince, or by sentence of the Judge,
or he shall dye among a great company of men, subject to death, or in prison,
or in a Dungeon, or in some other stinking and filthy place. If it be Venus
well disposed, he shall die of too much eating fruits, or with too much
continuing his voluptuousnes, or of some Fistula or Impostume. If she be
unfortunate, it denotes death by venom, principally when she is burned, or
joined to Saturne, or of too much burning affection of love, or of great
griefs of the French pockes. If it be Mercurie fortunate, it makes him dye by
sadness, by great apprehensions, by the Yellow iaunders, by pthisickes, by
the burning Fever, or by too much watching. If he be greatly unfortunate, it
signifies that he shall die by madness, the Falling-sicknes, by violent
Coughs, with breaking in sunder the veins, by foolish mellancholie, by
Jealousy.

If it be the Moon well disposed, with too much eating moist meates, by
drinking water, by too much continuing his pleasure; If she be unfortunate, you
must consider the nature of him which is unfortunate. For if it be Mars he
shall dye by fire, or by hurt: or by abortisment if it be a woman. If it be
Saturne, by ruins, falls, pestilences, and like accidents.

Before concluding of what death the party shall dye, you must consider the
disposition of the Lord of the ascendant, and of the luminaries temporal: For
if they be well disposed, the death shall not be violent, although the
principal significator be greatly unfortunate. If the said significator be
unfortunate, together with the luminaries temporal, or the Lord of the
ascendant evil disposed, we esteem certainly that the death shall be violent,
if Iupiter or Venus do not intermingle their favourable beams, and then the
said person shall fall in great danger of the said violent death, from the
which he shall always escape miraculously.

If one of the ill fortunes be in the sign of Cancer, and the other in the
sign of the Lyon, the death shall be violent; Likewise, if any of the said
ill fortunes be in the sign of the Lyon, and the luminaries temporal, or the
Lord of the ascendant be unfortunate, and one of the ill fortunes be in the
first house, and the other in the seventh or fourth, or one of them in the
tenth and the other in the fourth.

The Sun, or the Moon, or the Lord of the ascendant, joined with Mars, have
right in one fixed star, which the Astrologers cal the head of Meduse, or
otherwise the head of the devil, makes him by the hand of the Executioner to
leese his head.

When the Sun, and the Moon, and Saturne, and Mars, occupy the 4. angles of
heaven, or at the least 3. the personne shall dye a horrible death: for he
shall leese his head, or be cut in four quarters, or be drawn with four
horses: principally, if in the said angles be the signs of Gemini, Pisces and
Aquarius. Mars in the ninth or eight in the sign of Aquarius or of Gemini,
opposite to the Moon, or the Lord of the ascendant, without good aspect of
fortunes, makes him perrish by Sulphur or fire from heaven. Saturne in the
twelfth, sixth, eight, or fourth house unfortunate, the lord of the said houses
makes him dye in prison, or else where in great payne and travail: principally
when the luminaries temporal, or the Lord of the ascendant be unfortunate in
any of the said houses.

The tail of the Dragon being joined to the Significators of death, denote
poisons, venims, and violent medicines, or ill applied, and flixe of the belly.
Mars within the fourth, eight, twelfth, or sixth unfortunate, their lords and
the luminaries temporal, or the Lord of the ascendant, witness violent
death, by the shedding of blood or otherwise.

The Significators of death within the ninth or third house, signify that the
person shall die by the way, or in a strange Country: except they be in their
own proper houses or exaltations, for then he shall die in his house, bring
his evil from the high ways. The said Significators in their proper houses or
exaltations, make him die in his house, if they be Peregrines, they make him
dye out of his house.

The Moon joined to a fixed star, named the Claire of the balance
meridionall, denotes violent death. That doth she also when she is joined
with other stars that have the nature of the luminaries. Mars in the viij.
house with the head of the Dragon, makes him to be hanged and strangled. Many
Planets within the seventh house, make him dye of some strange and terrible
kind of death. Saturne, Mars, and the head of the Dragon in the first, Venus
and Mercurie with the tail in the seventh, make the body in a thousand
pieces.

If the principal Significator be burned in his own proper house or
exaltation, without being otherwise unfortunate, it makes him dye suddenly of
some feeblenes, or other sudden and secrete accident, without other violence.
The fortunes well disposed in the eight house, preserve him always from
violent death.

CHAP. XXV. Of voyages by Land and by Sea.
IVpiter, Venus, the Sun and Mercurie fortunate in the ninth house, denote
that he shall be happy in viages by Land and by Sea. Saturne and Mars signify
to the contrary; and principally Saturne doth hinder the viages by water, and
Mars the ways by Land. If within the ninth house there be never a Planet, you
must consider the Moon, and the Lord of the ninth, and the parts of the ways
and viages by land and by water, with their Lords, the which fortunate, gives
profitable nauigations: unfortunate, denote the contrary. Likewise you must
judge of the third house and of his lord, when they be well or evil disposed.
The head of the Dragon in the ninth, favours greatly to the fortune of
viages, and the tail to the contrary.

CHAP. XXVI. Of the constancy in his Religion.
ALso as the head of the Dragon, the luminaries, and Mercurie in the ninth
house well disposed, denote entire faith and constancy in his Religion,
Saturne, Mars, and the tail of the Dragon do hinder it. Saturne of his nature
is most inclined to the Law of the Iewes: and Mars to the law of the Turks
Mahometists; the tail of the Dragon, causes him always to err from the
truth of the law. The lord of the nynth, and the part of the faith, with his
Dominator fortunate, yields a man constant in his faith: unfortunate makes
him variable.

If the part of the spirit be in the sign of the Lyon at the birth of a
Christian, he shall be very constant in his religion, if the Sun be
fortunate: if he be unfortunate by Saturne, to go from his faith, and to
address it to that of the Iewes. If he be unfortunate by Mars, it makes him
more to incline to the law of the Turks and Mahometists. If the said part be
in the houses of Saturne at the nativity of a Iewe, or in the houses of Mars
at the nativity of a Turk, they shall deny their law: if the said lords of
the said part be retrogrades, or otherwise ill disposed. Saturne in the nynth
at the nativity of a Iewe, doth nothing diminish his faith. Saturne in the
said house when he is fortunate, signifies Dreams to be true. Mars and the
tail of the Dragon signify them vain and false. The other significators do
aslure them to be true.

CHAP. XXVII. Of the action and profession.
HOW to know of what profession the child shall be, you must chiefly
consider if any Planet be in the tenth house, for he shall be Significator of
the profession: otherwise, you must come to the part of Fortune, and to his
lord, to the part of the profession, and to his lord, to the tenth house, and
to his lord, and to the places of Mars, Mercurie and Venus.

The Planet that upon these places shall have the most dignities, shall be
Significator of the profession. The which if it be Saturne, it shall signify a
Husbandman, a good house-keeper, a Receiver of rents, and many times a
Governor of Towns, when he is in angles fortunate. Iupiter denotes the
officers, Judges, Benefices, Prelates, Bishops, Governors of the goods of the
Church. Mars signifies Captains, men of war, Coyners, Forgeours, and other
that use to work with fire and iron: and Physicians when he is in the aspect
of Venus.

Sol represents Princes, Lords, Magistrates, Hunters, Treasurers and Archers.
Venus Players, Dancers, Perfumers, Appothecaries, and in aspect of Mars,
Physicians. Mercurie, Advocates, Notaries, Registers, Poets, Rymers,
Philosophers, Mathematicians, Diuiners, wryters, Messengers and traders.

The Moon, Ambassadors, Counsellers, Consuls, Rulers of Common wealth,
Travellers, Hunters. If there be many Significators, or if the principal be
coupled with many Planets, you must mingle the significations of the one and of
the other, and of the said mixture, gather together the profession coming of
the concurrence of the stars. You must also consider in what house the said
Significators be, if they be within the second, the profession shall be of
feats of merchandise and traffiques: if within the third or ninth, of feats
of religion, or gathering the goods of the Church. If in angles, of Dominations
governments. If in the fifth of Embassages, legations, and other things of
pleasure. If in the sixth, of feats of diseases, of servant and of Cattle.
c. If the part of the honour coming of the profession, be with his Lord
fortunate, the Infant shall obtain great credit and honour because of his
profession. If they be unfortunate, if he do never so well, he shall never
gain to himself honour in the feats of his profession.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of dignities, offices, and honours.
FOR the dignities, offices, charges and honours, you must have respect to the
tenth house, to the luminaries temporal, to the part of nobleness, to the part
of government, to the part of Magistrates, others appertaining to the tenth
house, with their Lords. The Planet that in the said places shall have most
dignities, shall be Significator of the said considerations in good or evil,
according to his good or evil disposition: particulerly also you must follow
the said places one after another to know of what side principally the said
dignities, offices and honours ought to come.

Saturne in the tenth house, or in the ascendant in nativities by day,
signifies great advancement and honour after thirty years, when he is not
evil disposed: in nativities by night, it denotes continual fear, to
receive damage of Princes and Kings. Mars in the said places in nativities by
night, signifies also great advancement, by day more then Saturne.

The part of government and his Lord within any of the angles, witness great
favour of Kings. Likewise you must judge of the other part that we have
deducted upon the tenth house. Mercurie in the tenth well disposed and
fortunate, promises dignities, offices and honours, by reason of knowledge.
Venus and the Moon because of women. Iupiter for his virtue. The Sun and the
head of the Dragon in the same house, denotes as much. The two luminaries in
their houses or exaltations placed in the figure of Heaven, do denote great
advancement honour.

That which Iupiter doth also when he receives the virtue of all the other
Planets, communicates his own to Saturne and the Sun; and the fortunes and
the luminaries when they be in the angles of Heaven. Many Planets in the
fourth house, denotes great honour after death. If in the points of the angles
be any fixed star of the first or second greatness, or other having the nature
of lumynaries, it is a great sign of incredible advancement. That which
happens also when the said stars be joined to the lumynaries temporal, or
to the part of Fortune, or to his Lord, or to the Planets and parts that be
in the angles.

They which have Saturne in the tenth burnt, or the Lord of the tenth burnt, or
be by Saturne oppressed, or that have the tail of the Dragon in the tenth,
receive commonly some form of dishonour, and often be depriued of their
estate, when the Fortunes do not intermingle their favourable beams: except
when they be also unfortunate in their proper houses or exaltations, or in the
signs of Aries and the Lyon.

You must note that Saturne Mars, hinder greatly the good fortunes, until that
the man hath passed the number of years corrispondent to the number of the small
years of the said Planets: and if they hinder any more time, it shall be until
that the man shall accomplish the number of years answering to the number of
degrees, of the overthwart ascentions of the Sign, in the which they shall be
at the nativity.

CHAP. XXIX. Of companions and Friends.
YOU must for the Companions and Friends, have respect to Iupiter, the
eleventh house, the part of friends, the part of honourable companions. The
Planet having most dignities in the said places, shall be principal
Significator of friends: the which after his good or evil disposition, shall
denote honourable, faithful, and profitable friends: or unprofitable,
disloyal, and of base condition. Iupiter and the Sun in the said house,
signify honourable companies and profitable: so doth Venus, the Moon and
Mercurie also in the said place. Saturne in the eleventh fortunate, witnesses
grave friends, ancient and honourable. Mars, men of war, Captains and
Lords.

Saturne or Mars in the eleventh out of their principal dignities, depriued of
the beams of the favourable Planets, signify some great suit against his
friends, or some great evil by reason of them: as it happens commonly to
the Aunswerers and Suerties. The parts of honourable companions and of praise,
with their Lords fortunate, signifyeth profit and honour on the side of
friends: unfortunate denotes the contrary. The part of friends denotes as
much.

The head of the Dragon in the eleventh house, gives favour of friends: the
tail denotes a thousand mischiefs by reason of them.

CHAP. XXX. Of suits and Enemies.
THE fortunes in the seventh and twelfth house, give victories against
enemies, when they be in good aspect to the lord of the ascendant. And commonly
those which have these 2. houses with their Lords fortunate, be happy in their
suits: the contrary you must judge, when they with their Lords be
unfortunate. The ill fortunes in the said places, signify much strifes and
enemies. That doth also the parts of enemies, and of discord and accord, when
they and their Lords be evil disposed.

The Lord of the twelfth house fortunate, it denotes little puissance of
enemies: unfortunate denotes the contrary. If one of the two ill fortunes be
in the twelfe, and the other in the sixth, in evil aspect of the lumynaries
temporal, or of the Lord of the ascendant, the child shall be killed by his
enemies. They which have Saturne, or Mars, or the Moon opposite to the Sun in
the Sign of Cancer, be commonly contrary to all the world. Mars in any of the
four angles, ingendereth naturally strife, suits, debates, and enmities
against all the world: except when he is in a good aspect of Iupiter and Venus.
For then he doth expel his ire and anger against the vices, of great zeal
maintains the right of every one.

The Lord of the ascendant, or the Moon, or the Sun unfortunate in the
twelfe house, denotes great persecutions and calamities of the enemies. The
Lord of the ascendant by the lord of the twelfe oppressed, testifies that he
shall die by the hand of his enemies.

The Lord of the twelfe, and the Planets that be in the seventh twelfe house,
signify the quality of enemies, (that is to understand) the Sun signifies
the Princes great Lords, the Moon all the world, and Mars the men of war. c.

CHAP. XXXI. Of imprisonments and c^ptiuities.
THE Lord of the ascendant, or the Moon or the Sun greatly unfortunate in
the 12. 6. 8. and 4. house, do signify imprisonments, and death within the
prysons, or in captivity: principally when they be burned out of their
principal dignities, and out of the signs of Aries and the Lyon, and when
they be oppressed by Saturne lord of one of the said houses. Saturne and Mars
in the angles of Heaven, signify always some imprisonment: and principally
Saturne. Mercurie in the angles under the beams of the Sun, receiving an
evil aspect of ill fortunes, signifies as much. If Mercurie or the lord of
the ascendant give his virtue to Saturne, being in the eight house, it
signifies that the child shall dwell long in prison and captivity.

If the lord of the ascendant be in the twelfe in a sign of a humane figure,
without aspects of fortunes or of luminaries, he shall be captive and a slave
in his youth. If the lord of the nynth be burned in any of the angles of
Heaven, he shall be taken by the highways, and put in prison.

The parts of prison, and of pain, travail and affliction with their lords
burnt, or otherwise unfortunate, signifies imprisonment and captivity. That
doth also the vnfortunes when they be well dignified in the said places.

The parts of all envies, and of the perrillous year doth signify as much,
when they with their Lords be greatly unfortunate.

The said parts with their Lords fortunate, preserves from prison, and from
captivity.

CHAP. XXXII. Of Horses, Sheep, and other beasts.
THE fortunes and Planets fortunate within the 6. and twelfe house, yield the
men happy in horses and nourishing of beasts. The lords of the said houses
fortunate, and coupled with the Significators of riches, signify as much.
Naturally the sixth house denotes Sheep, and Goats, and other small beasts,
the 12. Horses, Oxen, Kine, Camels, other great beasts. The ill fortunes
within the said houses, or the lords of the said houses unfortunate, signify
loss and damage of the said beasts.

Saturne and Mars in the twelfe, makes the horses to fall with notable loss.
The which they do also when they be elsewhere in the Sign of Sagitarius. The
lord of the nativity in the twelfe house in evil aspect of the Lord of the
twelfe, makes him fall from his horse in great peril of death, when the
fortunes luminaries do not yield their amiable aspects.

If the twelfe be of Sagittarius or the Lyon, the lord of the ascendant, or the
Sun, or the Moon be unfortunate, he shall fall from his horse and dye, if
the fortunes within the eight house do not hinder the evil.

CHAP. I. Of Directions.
THE art of Directions so dilygently entreated upon by John de Regiomount, that
their is no more place fitly to speak of the same. Except that with the aid
of God we have purposed to translate into French his problems and documents
appertaining to the said matter. Nevertheless we will here touch the the
principal point. To direct (which term I use being being most commonly used
and of long time received, although it be not proper) it is no other thing
then to stay the meeting of one place of the heavens with another consequently
following, acording to the natural order of the signs, that the moving of the
first mobile. The first place is named the significator, the second the
promittor: as if the ascendant were in the xx. degree of Sagittarius Saturne in
thex of Capricorne, one might direct the ascendant to Saturne the ascendant
shall be significator of life, Saturne promittor of death or sickness, the the
judgment shall be danger of death, there is another form of directio attributed
to the parts planets retrogrades, which do make following the natural course
of thei^ mobile, to the contrary of the consequence of the signs, of the which
the craft is like to the 1. there is no difference but that we have called
Significator, which is here promittor, and the Promittor is here Significator.

The point meridionall of the tenth house, you must direct by the right
ascentions. The point of the ascendant, by the ascentions obliques, found in
the Table of the latitude of your Region. The points and stars that shall be
between the Merydian and the Horrizon, by the oblique ascentions under the
circle in the which they be, the which you call, The circle of Position, the
which for to find, and likewise to have the ascentions of every place having
latitude or no, you must follow the methode following.

First, you must take the longitudes of Planets, fixed stars, and other
places that you would direct (that is to say) the sign, degree, and mynute
that they ^olde in the Zodiac and in the Ephemerids, or other tables
Astronomical. c.

Secondly, you must calculate their latitudes, in degrees and mynutes placed in
the Ephemerids.

Thirdly, their declination by the first problem of the book of directions
of Regiomont.

Then, their right ascentions by the third problem of the said house.

Then again, the distances of the circle Meridional by the nineteenth
problem.

Incontinent, the circles of their positions, by the twentieth problem,
consequently the dyfferences ascentional by the Table expressed.

And finally the oblique ascentions by the tenth Canon, if the said stars be
between the point meridionall of the tenth house, and the point of the fourth,
or the discentions of obliques by the eleventh problem, if they be between
the point of the fourth and the tenth.

This done, take out the number of the oblique ascentions of the Significator,
of the number of the oblique ascentions of the Promittor, take to the Table of
the position of the Significator, or the contrary, if you direct the parts and
Planets retrogrades; that which rests of degrees minutes, turn into years,
months days: and by this means, you shall have exactly the time of good or
evil that shall happen unto you by direction, intending that one degree is
here signified a year, five mynutes a month, one minute 6. days some od
hours, he that would help the seconds he shall touch the end more
perfectly.

For to know the sicknesses and danger of death, you must direct the five
vital places that we have considered, searching the gyuer of life, in fixed
stars of violent nature in the point of the fourth, sixth, seventh and eight,
and the tail of the Dragon, to the ill fortunes and their evil aspects in the
parts of death, and by and by to the Sun, and to the head of the Dragon.
Likewise for the same consideration, you must direct the said pernicious
places to the five vital places. And they meeting, they judge that the man is
in great danger of death, when the Fortunes do not show forth their
favourable beams.

For the goods, honour, dignities, friendships, and other considerations, you
must direct the one significator of goods with the other, and the one
significator of honour with the others, of the which we have made mention in
the first Book, following the particular judgements of the nativities.

CHAP. II Of the Seperator or Burner, called of the Arabians, Algebuthar.
THE Seperator or Burner, is the Planet which hath dignity of term degree,
to the which the year is answerable, mutiplied with the ascentions of one
Significator.

For to find the Seperator of the like, you must take the Oblique ascentions
of the ascendant, and add unto the same the years of your age, and search it
all in the Table of the latitude of your Region, to look to which sign and
degree the said number answers, for unto that point shall come the
perfection of your life. Look afterward which is the Planet which hath
dignity of term in the said degree, for of the self same shall be the
Seperator of the life.

By the same means you may seek the Seperators of the honour, goods, gains,
friends, and of other like, upon the circles of their positions. The which is
convenient to seek following the aforesaid methode of directions.

CHAP. III. Of the Lords of the Triplicities.
YOU must also note all the Lords of the Triplicities, in places which
signify good and evil, as well in significations of life, as of goods,
friends, honour, marriages, pylgrimages c. If they be well disposed in the
revolution, they shall signify well, touching the signification of the place
of the which they be Lords. If they be unfortunate, they signify evil. That
is to understand, the Lords of the tryplicities of vital places, will signify
of the life: of the places of fortune, riches profit: of places of honour, of
the honour, good or evil, according as they be fortunate or unfortunate at the
hour, of the revolution.

CHAP. IIII. Of Revolutions.
THE Sun returning to the same point in the which he was at the hour of the
nativity, makes the revolution every year. He therefore that wold know the
hour and mynute of the revolution, he must look in the Ephemerids, at what
hour and mynute the Sun began to enter into the degree minute and second,
in which he was at the hour of the nativity.

If the Ephemerids do not suffice you for this matter, go to a Table made
for the same purpose, by Peter Pitat, in the beginning of the same Ephemerids,
by him corrected and augmented. Jerome Cardin uses another, which I find very
exact: the which he hath written in his book. Of the restitution of times and
celestial motions, in the fyft Chapter.

CHAP. V. Of the judgements upon the revolutions.
FIrst look howe the Seperator of life is disposed in the figure of the
revolution: for if he be unfortunate, he denotes sickness and other dangerous
accidents; If he be fortunate, he holds him healthful and glad all the
year. So likewise you must judge of the Seperator of goods, friends, dignities
other effects. It is to understand, that they give good fortune in the said
significations, if they be well disposed: or else loss evil fortune if they be
unfortunate.

In the second place, look if the Lords of the Tryplicities of the vital
places be well disposed: and of places which signify riches, honour,
travails, brethren, Parents, wives and children, do so much. For in the same
significations the man shall be happy or unhappy, according as the said Lords
shall be well or evil disposed. And principally you must consider the Lord that
shall reign over your age: for the first Lord of one tryplicity governs the
first age; the second, the midst of the life; the third, the latter year.

Thirdly, you must consider which is the Planet which governs over the year
of your age, that which the Arabians call Fridate.

Fourthly, the Lord of the Sign in which shall come the same year of
perfection.

In the fifth place, the Lord of the circulation, accounting by the Lord of the
hour of the nativity.

Then the Lord of the circulation, accounting by the Lord of the ascendant of
the nativity.

And if in the ascendant of the nativity there be any Planet, you must
likewise make circulation.

Furthermore, you must look if any Planet return to the same sign and house,
in the which it was at the nativity; for then it intends the same effect
which it hath signified in the nativity, principally when it returns to the
same sign. You must also have regard to the aspects which are made in the
revolution, if they be like to them of the nativity: for that shall be a renewing
of the effects of the said aspects.

And you must not forget the changing of the places. For if a happy Planet
be in the revolution in the place where an evil Planet was in the nativity,
the evil signified by the said evil Planet in the nativity, shall be
deferred that year by the presence of the happy Planet. To the contrary, if a
Planet promise any good fortune in the nativity, and in his place in the
revolution be any unfortunate Planet, the same good signified in the nativity,
shall be diminished in the reuolutio, or lost by reason of the said ill fortune.
The mis-fortune in the places of mis-fortune augments the evil, the good
fortunes in the places of good fortune, augments the good fortune.

For to judge of the said considerations, you must have recourse to that which
we have said in the two former Books of general and particular
significations of the Houses, Signs, Planets, aspects, particular situations
of the Planets in signs and houses: having always before your eyes, the
disposition of stars in the figure of the nativity. For if a Planet be in
the nativity greatly unfortunate, and in the revolution well disposed, it
cannot much profit because of the first infelicity.

Likewise you must judge of those which be fortunate in nativities, which
being unfortunate in reuolucions, do no great damage. There be some that
contemplate hereupon, many other things, the which by experience I have often
found unprofitable, false, and superfluous.

CHAP. VI. Of the years governed by the Planets, called of the Arabians
Fridarie.
IF the natiuite be by day, then the Sun governs the first ten years,
Venus eight years following, Mercurie thirteen years after that: then the
Moon, the nine following. Saturne eleven years, Iupiter twelve, Mars seven,
the head of the Dragon three, the tail of the Dragon two. When it is by night,
you must begin at the Moon, the which governs the first nine years, then
Saturne, Iupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercurie, the head of the Dragon, and the
tail, the numbers by order as we have said before.

Many by great curiosity, have added to this company other Planets to every
government, the which I find by good reason to be reprehended by the
Chaldeans. For experience hath often taught me and other very expert in this
Science, that this subtlety is too curious, vain and superfluous.

CHAP. VII. Of profections.
FOR the profections you must resolve the twelve houses of your nativity in
equal parts upon the Eclipse, so far as the ascendant is in the first
degree of any Sign: the second house shall be in the first degree of a sign
following, and the third, in the first degree of a third sign: and to
conclude, that every house begin by the first degree, as the first house.

Also, every house will contain thirty degrees, the first thirty degrees of
the first house, shall appertain to the first year wherein the infant is
borne; the thirty of the second, to the second year: the thirty of the third
to the third year, so consequently until twelve. Twelve years passed, you
must begin again at the first, and then come to the second, third, fourth c.
and so from twelve to twelve you must renew the same circuit.

If you find the revolution within the thirty degrees serving to your year,
it signifies some good or evil, according to his nature or good or evil
disposition, signification of the place, of which shall be the said profection;
that is to say, of the places of life, sickness, death, or good health; of the
places of goods, riches, loss, or poverty. c. Commonly they seek the
profection of five places of one nativity, that is to say, of the place of the
Sun for honour; of the place of the Moon for the qualities of the spirit,
towards the body and external goods; of the place of the part of Fortune,
for gain and profit; of the tenth house for the actions; of the ascendant for
the life.

If the Sun be gyuer of life, it must be considered as gyuer of life and
giver of honour likewise, the which you must do also in other places, when they
import many significations. If then you find any Planet within the thirty
degrees of your profection, and would know what month or day the accident by
him signified shall happen.

Look what distance you have between the first point of your profection, and
the said Planet, if there be xv. degrees between them, the said accident
shall happen out in the end of six months: if there be twentie-fiue degrees,
at the end of ten months, for here two degrees and a half, value one
month, one degree values twelve days and four hovers, thirty min^es value
six days, five minutes one day.

Of this there is a very exact table among the documents of Peter Pytat upon
the Ephemerids. Example of the profections. Suppose that the ascendant of a
nativity was the fifteen degree of Scorpius, I would know where the
profection shall light of the ascendant at the end of ten years after the
childborne. I account ten signs from the ascendant, after that, I find the
fifteen degree of Virgo serving after ten years, accomplished to xj.
current. I say then that in the said time, the profection of the ascendant is
come in the fifteen degree of Virgo; shall end that year in the fifteen
degree of Libra: and also shall contain thirty whole degrees, within the which
if any Planet be found, it shall signify good or evil of the life, according
to the nature disposition as if in the said time.

Mars being to the fifth degree of Libra, I would say that the infant should
be troubled that year at the end of eight months, because that Mars was in
the place profectionall of life, distant from the first point twenty dedrees.
We have showed before that two degrees and a half value one month, five
degrees two months, and fifteen degrees six months, and by course twenty
degrees eight months. You must note, that the profections ought to fit to
the years currant or complete. It is to be understood the tenth sign, as for
incontinent after nine years complete, which is ten years currant, c.

CHAP. VIII. The Lords of the circulations from the hours of the Nativities.
THE Babylonians hold for a great secrete, the Circulation of the Lord of the
hour of the nativity? It is to be understood, that the Lord of the said hour
signifies of the life as the ascendant, and the Lord of the hour following,
of goods as of the second house: and the Lord of the third hour of brethren
as the third house, and so consequently of others.

In Revolutions, they give the Lord of the hour of the nativity to the first
year, the Planet following to the second, and so consequently following the
natural order of the Planets. As if one were borne in the hour of Venus, that
Planet should reign the first year, the second year, Mercurie, the third,
the Moon, the fourth, Saturne, the fifth, Iupiter, the sixth, Mars, the seventh
Sol, the eight, Venus, the ninth, Mercurie, and so by order. And you must note,
that we take here the years currant, and not complete, for to fit the said
circulation of the Planets.

CHAP. IX. Of the circulation of the Lord of the Ascendant, and the Planets
which are in the Ascendant.
THE circulation of the Lord of the Ascendant, and the Planets and parts which
be in the Ascendant, they be even as we have said of the Lord of the hour of
the nativity, and by the same order you must place them. The years of the age
of the Child, by judgment, we have made mention and proof of Revolutions.

CHAP. X. Of Eclipses and great coniunctions appertaining to Revolutions of
Nativities.
THE Eclipse of the Sun, and the coniunctions of the Superior Planets,
causes commonly many evils, after the congruence of the stars, and nature of
the signs and Planets reigning in the said places, to men causes
sicknesses, when they be within the five next degrees of the Ascendant, or to
the gyuer of life: if they touch the other parts, Planets or houses, they
pronounce evil fortune, appertaining to the significations of the same places;
principally, if in the same time of the nativity, any such constellations were
in force. If they touch the places perfectionals, they do almost the same
effect as in nativities.

CHAP. XI. Of the particular meetings of the whole year.
COncerning the particular meetings of all the year, Ptolomeus, Iohn de
Regiomonte, Ganrique, and many others, do rest harde upon the Profections,
Mensturnes and Diurnes, of the which you have a perfect Table in the Book of
Directions of John de Regiomonte, having more subtlety curiousnes then truth,
as I have often found by experience. It answers better my opinion Schonor,
which every day considered, if any Planet touch the places of the Planets,
parts houses, of the nativity or their good or evil aspect, that I do apply
to the places profectionall. As for example, let the ascendant of a nativity,
or the place of his profection be the twelfe degree of Libra, the Sun in the
fifteenth of Gemini, Mars in the fifteenth of Leo: always, and as often as the
Sun or the Moon do pass over the xv. degree of Leo, the man shall be
moved by angry accidents, as of displeasure, of some alteration, payne of the
head, Fever, hot Impostumes, Tetters. c. Likewise when it touches the fyft
degree of Scorpius, or of Taurus, there where the quadrate aspects be within
the place of Mars, or the fifth of Aquarius, which is the place opposite to
Mars. If any Planet touch the fifth degree of Libra, or of Gemini (there where
the Sextile aspects be) or the fifth of Sagitarius and of Aries, (which make the
Tryne aspects of the said Mars) it shall signify some favourable meetings of
Captains and men of war.

If the ill fortunes touch not the said twelfe degree of Libra, as we have
said in the Ascendant, that shall be sign of some evil meeting, as well to life
as to the body. Likewise you must judge of other attouchments, according to the
nature of the aspects, by us explained in the second Book. You must
contemplate the places profectionals. For I do apply every degree and minute
to the days in the which their signification fall, and regard the good evil
aspects of the Planets every day, if they touch the degree profectionall. As
for example, of the said nativity in the which was the Ascendant Libra,
suppose that the profection was come to the twelfe degree of Cancer, in the
ninth year complete and the tenth currant. The thirteenth degree of Cancer,
serves to the twelfe day after the proper day of the revolution.

Wherefore I consider then the aspects of the Planets towards the said
thirteenth degree. Likewise so I do of other degrees and minutes, fitted to
those days in the which they govern. And so much for Revolutions.

FINIS.
