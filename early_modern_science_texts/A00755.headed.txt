VERO NIHIL VERIVS


To the Right Honourable his singular good Lord and Patron, EDWARDE DE VERE,
Earl of Oxenforde, Viscount Bulbecke, Lord of Escales and Bladesmore, and
Lord great Chamberlaine of England: Iohn Hester wishes health of body,
tranquillity of mind, with continual increase of most godly honour.
TRY, AND THEN TRVST, saith the old Adage: but I must hope for trust without
trial: because as I can compare you, (Right Honourable) to none more fit, the
to ALEXANDER the Macedon: So must I humbly request your good Lordship, to
imitate that famous worthy: who being sick, was advertised by letters, that
his Physician would empoison him. The good Prince notwithstanding being offered
the medicine by the accused, first took it, and drank it up, and then gave
the Physician the letter of his accuser to read: but perceiving no alteration
of countenance in the man, he took good courage, and by that same medecin
(although extreme in operation) presently recovered his former health. In like
manner (Right Honourable) having translated and gathered together this
compedious short way of Chirurgerie, as I thought none so meet, to whom I
might consecrate these fruits of my travails: So must I most humbly desire
your good Lordship to peruse it, and then to make trial of the contents
thereof: which being devised and practised by a worthy and famous Captain,
called Signior LEONARDO PHIORAVANTI of Bolognia, doth show both the names and
natures of each wound, with the order and manner to cure them in half the
time which is or hath been used heretofore, by either ignorant or arrogant
Professors and Practicioners of that noble and profound Science, which as they
more esteem a great gain to them-selues, then a little ease to their
patients, and a long protracting of the cure for a large payment: So I know
although I ease the rich, relieve the poor, and teach the ignorant: yet are
there such, which being more wilful then skilful, will bear me a private
grudge for this public commodity, and will attempt more then either they can
or are able to answer: the which to avoid, I most humbly crave your Honourable
patronage, that according to your name and poesy, your name and property may
be to protect the truth: So shall both the Translator the less doubt his foes,
the Book benefit more his friends, and they both most rejoice of so worthy a
Patron. Whose life God prolong with health and increase of honour, and after
the course of this pilgrimage finished, enstall you among his chosen, to reign
with him in eternal felicity.

The most affectioned of all those, which owe your L. dutiful service, Iohn
Hester.

To the gentle Reader.
ALthough diverse learned men of no less Judgment then Practise, have here
before translated and set forth sundry books, containing the most wholesome
and profitable precepts of Physic and Chyrurgerie, where-in they seem to have
opened and at large declared al such things as seemed necessary and expedient
to be had known, in this our vulgar English tongue: yet nevertheless, I
calling to memory the notable sentence of Cicero: That every man is not all
only borne for himself, but chiefly to profit his native country, then his
parents, afterward his children and friends, seeking a means where-by I might
profit this my native country, thought it best to translate this little
treatise upon Chyrurgerie, gathered out of the works of the most famous Knight
Doctor, both in Physic Chyrurgerie, Master Leonardo Phiorauanti, have applied
my whole labour dilygece to set ye same forth as truly and as nigh the Authors
mind as I could, notwithstanding but there do some faults remain therein,
because of diverse terms of the Art, the which I am not practised in: of the
which if instructions be given, they shall the next impression be amended.

Therefore gentle Reader, take this book in good part, for there-with thou
shalt profit more then of any other that hath been set forth heretofore,
because it is only the mere troth, and pure practise approved by experience,
and heere-with I make an end, committing thee and us all to almighty God, who
prosper us in all our works.

Gentle Reader, ye shall understand that if GOD prosper me in health, I mean
to set out all the works of this Author: which are.24. books, comprehended
in eight volumes. In the which are contained the whole art of Physic and
Surgery, to the honour of God, the profit of my country.

FINIS TABVLAE.
HOW THAT OUR PHYSIC AND Chyrurgerie is better, then that, the which the
Ancients have commonly used.
THere is no doubt, but that our new Physic and Chyrurgerie, is better then
that, ye which the Ancients have used: because it helps the sick with more
ease and speed, and much more safer, and to show the troth, the Aunciets had
never knowledge of our Dia Aromatico, nor of Electuario Angellica, nor of our
Pillole Aquilone, nor did not make our siropo solutiuo, nor yet our magno
licore, with a number of other medicines found out by me, the which are written
in the end of this book, with the which I have done wonderful cures, as thou
may read in my Thesoro de la vita humana, and truly most necessary for all
professors of this Art, because therein thou shalt find so many goodly
experiences, and it would cause the world to wonder thereat. But to turn to
our purpose, I say that the Ancients the which had not knowledge of our
remedies, they wanted also knowledge of the true Physic, and Chyrurgerie, as
by ye experience thou may see, I say not this to speak evil of those wise
ancient Doctors, that were inuentours there-off, but I say it to say the
troth, and many shall be my testimony of this troth. Because in many countries,
where our work that are Imprinted are come, they begin to practise after our
order. And this order of curing: I repute it not to my science, but a work
that God would reveal unto the world, thorough my means, and to show the
troth, there hath been none, that hath found the medicines for wounds with so
much ease and brevity as I have done.

Who hath ever found the true Remedy for the Gout, for the Ouartain, for
Fluxes, and all sorts of Fevers, as I have done? or what is he yt ever brought
the whole Art of Physic and Chyrurgerie into.viij. small volumes, as I have
done? What is he that ever writ of the Pestilence, and of his qualytie and
remedies and orders to be used in the same, as I have done. And if there be any
that doth not credit me, let them make experience of all that I have said,
and I promise you and swear as I am a true Knight, they shall find more truth
then I will write at this time, being as I have said, a work given of God, for
a universal benefit of all the world, and forasmuch I exhort every one of the
professors of Physic Surgery, to follow this our truth, because they are
of so great experience, yt it seems miraculous unto man, as I have seen many
years ago, to my great honour, and satisfaction of the people of the world,
thus doing working, thou shalt come to know yt our Physic Chirurgerie is more
better wholesome, then ye which hath been used of the Ancients until this
present time.

Certain remedies, for al Capitaines and soldiers that travel eitherby water
or land.
THere are.3. infirmities, that offend the soldiers in the camp above al ye
rest, the which are these, Fevers, Wounds, Fluxes of the body, the which thou
may help in this order following, with these medicines, that is our
Quintaessence of wine, our Balsamo, Magno licore, Quintaessencia solutiua,
Specie Imperiale, the order to use the is thus. When any hath a fever or a
flux, then presently when ye disease begins, let him blood in one of the.2.
veins under ye tongue, cutting it overthwart, this thou shalt do in ye
evening, the ye next morning, take a dose of our imperial powder mixed with
wine, and this ye may do with-out any diet or straight order, that being done,
give him.3. mornings together, half an ounce of our Quintaessence solutiue
with broth. But if it be a flux, and that the Patient is not cured, let him
stand in a cold bath of salt water of the Sea.3. or.4. hours or more, and he
shall be perfectly help.

Then as concerning wounds, as well cuts as thrusts, and as well gallings with
arrows, as hargabush shot, and other sorts, thou shalt cure them thus. The
first thing that ye shall do to them, is to wash them very clean with urine,
and then dry them well, then put there-in our Quintaessence of wine, presently
join the parts together, sow or stitch them close, then put there-vpon 5.
or.6. drops of our Balsamo, and upon the wound lay a cloth wet in our Magno
licore, as hot as he may suffer it, and this ye shall do the first day: Than
the next day follow this order: First put thereon our Quintaessence, and a
little of our Balsamo, then our Magno licore very hot, never change that
medicine, and thus doing the wound shall heal with great speed, and in a
quarter of the time, that the common Chyrurgians is able to do it, by the
grace of God.

A short discourse of the most excellent Doctor knight, Master Leonardo
Phiorauanti Bolognesse, upon Chirurgerie, with a declaration of many things
necessary to be known. Never written before in this order, where unto is added
a number of notable secrets found out by the said Author.
The Proheme.
IT is to be understood, that when the Almighty creator had made ye world,
he also created all manner of beasts, as well on earth as in the water, with
other fowls, after which saith the holy Scripture, he created man after his
own Image and similitude, and to him gave power over all things created, and
with the same, grace and reason. Through the which he was apt to rule have
knowledge of all through the spirit of God, as to have knowledge of al things
where-vnto he gave his mind understanding, as it is at this present to be
seen among men in the world that have knowledge of divers and sundry
things, all necessary for those that will live in the world with honour: For
some understand the art of husbandry, which was the first art used in the
world, for so much as without it we cannot well live as it is plainly seen.
There are other that have knowledge in keeping beasts of all kinds apt or meet
for mans body, as Goats, Kine, Hogs, Hens, Geese, Horse, Mules, and such
like. There are other that have knowledge in Navigation, without ye which also
the world would be vnperfet, as it is seen by experience. There be other that
have knowledge in Cosmography, whereby they know diverse parts of the world
whether men may travail. There be other that have knowledge in the art of
wars, whereby they may help to defend their Prince and countries, in
executing of justice. There be other that understand Astrology, by the which
they know ye course of Planets and their effects: Other understand the
Mathematica, whereby they measure land and all other things: Other study
Music, to accord voices together, other understand Physic to help the
diseased bodies of human creatures, and also annymales of divers and sundry
infirmities. There be other that understand Chyrurgerie, to help al manner of
sores yt hap unto men: upon which Surgery, we will write a brief discourse
pleasant reason, will leave apart the science yt is doubtful, because there is no
science in the world wherewith a man may do good if there-with be no practise or
experience, as a man may say. The which experience is master of all things, as
it is plainly seen, and therefore we will give you to understand which of those
parts be best or most necessary in this Chirurgerie, either to help those
that are hurt, or the science, or experience. And we will show the mere troth
without any dissimulation or fraud, as I have always done in my works which
are Printed, and at this present do intend to do, if almighty God give me
grace, and quicken my spirits or wits in writing that which shall be to his
honour, and profit to the world.

TO THE Reader.
Having taken upon me to write a brief treatise of Chirurgerie, in the which I
will write the mere verity, that with as much brevity as may be, because the
troth occupies but little room, for the Philosopher writes that the troth is
such a light as all men do hide, covering it with diverse abuses, as the Poets
many times do: for when they write one of their tales they go about to hide
it, and thus to our purpose. Those that write great volumes cannot choose many
times but hide the troth, for in much matter there enters both good and bad,
therefore I will write no more then is necessary, declaring what Chirurgerie
is, and in what order it should be used with all his accidents, showing what
wounds are, with Impostumes and ulcers, how they engender, and when they are
engendered, howe to cure them and disolue them. A discourse which will please
many because it is only troth, of great importance: Let every one therefore know
that science with experience do appear to be one thing, and at this present
every one is certain thereof, that the experince of Physic as well as of
Chirurgerie, cannot be good without science, or Methode, as a man may term it.
But I say that experience is better then Science, in these two arts, that is in
Physic and Chirurgerie, for science only shows the virtue the which may be
done with practise that hath no theorike. Of which I have written sufficiently
in my Capricy medicinalle, Imprinted at Venice, and that this which I write is
troth, I will prove it, for I say, that no can help with the only Methode,
but always it is necessary that there be some experience or practise therefore
those that do delight to understand, let them follow this my short treatise,
in the which I will entreat of things most necessary to be known, will show
how easy it is to work in that art, declaring al the dificult matters, so that
every one may see and perceive it plain, and afterwards I will show howe to
make many new medicines, as well for wounds, as for the other sorts of sores,
which have not been used neither of old Doctors, nor of new: the which
remedies are of such virtue strength, that the world will wounder at them for
their notable quick working, and hereafter I will write what Chirurgerie is.



WHAT CHIRVRgerie is.
CHIRVRGERIE is both Science and practise, and to say the troth he that will
know the composition of mans body, must of necessity have some science, and be
Anatomist, although the same Science be a thing to be learned by practise,
for I have seen many times those which were unlearned to be expert in the
Anatomy of mans body, and those were painters and drawers, the which was
necessary for the to know to frame their figures accordingly: and therefore I
take not that for science but practise, for science is only that where-with
the causes of every infirmity is found out, and is of small effect to our
purpose, because Chyrurgerie helps not only the cause, but also the effect
after it is known, and therefore I may say that Chyrurgerie is no other then a
pure and mere practise, and that it is only necessary for the Chyrurgian to
know how to stich a wound well, to mundifie an ulcer, and to keep it fro
putrefaction, and keep it from alteration, so that there run no evil humours
unto the place offended, and to know all kind of Unguents that are apt to
heal al kind of wounds and ulcers, which thing must be known by practise.
And likewise to make all manner of Unguents necessary for Chyrurgerie, for that
cause I conclude most truly, that our Chyrurgerie is only practise or
experience. And that which causes me to believe it, is, that I have always
seen the most part of Chyrurgians, when they should have any case in
Chyrurgerie, they knew not what Huguenot would help the sore, cut many times
they prove this, and that, and so continue until they have found one, that is
convenient for the sore, where-vnto it is applied, and therefore this is a
certain sign, that they know not by Science there medicines to help the
sore, but with experience they search it. Therefore if it be so, it is a sign
that I have said the troth, and so conclude that Chirurgerie is a practise to
help sores on men's bodies, and also on beasts, when occasion shall serve.

What Wounds are.
Wounds are those which in Latin is called Vulnus, of the vulgar Vulnere, and
they are of two kinds, that is, simple compoud. The simple are those that are
only in ye flesh, the compound are those where are cut sinews, veins, muscles
and bones, and these are of diverse and sundry kinds. And the difference that
is among them is, by the variety of the place where they are wounded, and by
the difference of the weapon where-with they were hurt, for some go right, some
ouerthwarte, some long, some broad, some are thrusts or stocate, that offend
diverse parts of the body. The simple are of small importance, because if ye
keep them clean and close shut, nature will heal the without any kind of
medicine. But those where veins are cut, have need of some Art or practise,
with the which they may stop the blood, in any wise not to suffer ye wound
remain open, but to sow it up very close, so that the vein may heal. Also
those where sinews are hurt are of great importance, and would be healed with
great speed, so yt the sinews may join with more ease. But those where bones
are hurt, are of greater importance, for if the bone be separated fro the
other, of necessity it must be taken ^rth, before the wound be healed. So that
by this means every one may know what wounds are, and their kinds.

Of Vlceres, and what they are.
Ulcers are of diverse and sundry kinds, and are engendered of many causes, as
hereafter I will show. But first I will write of those kind of Ulcers that are
caused of wounds. You shall understand that wounds in what part of the body
soever they be, being impostumated, or cancrenated, they change their names,
and are no more called wounds, although the original was a wound. For when it
is cancrenated, it is called Vlcera corasiua, because it goes eating and
creeping on the flesh. But when the would is impostumated and full of matter, it
is called, Vlcera putrida, that is putrified, it is because it is filthy
stinks. But when it is neither cancrenated nor yet apostumated, but that
through some evil disposition the wound is closed, and that there comes in
it evil qualities without alteration, then it is called Vlcera sordida,
because therein is evil qualytie, it appears but a little, but it is evil to
heal. There be other sorts of ulcers also, the which are caused of diverse
sundry kinds of tumors, the most evil mischievous, are those that are of
tumors caused of the pocks, for unto those there runs abundance of evil
humours that augmet the ulcer, they be the worst sort, for they can not be
healed by themselves, except the body be well purged and evacuated of al the
humours that are offensive. There is another kind of ulcer the which comes of
an Impostume, as well hot as cold, and those are more gentle and easy to be
helped, if ye know the medicines that are apt to help and dissolve those kind
of ulcers.

These are the three kind of Ulcers that commonly happen unto men and women
through diverse causes, as it is said before, so that these are the principal
causes of those maligne ulcers.

Of Impostumes, and their kinds.
IMpostumes are a certain kind of tumor that is called in diverse manners,
because they come in diverse places of ye body, as those sorts of Impostumes
that come in the groyne, which in Venice is called Pannoche, in Rome Tencone,
in Naples Dragonselly, in Spain Incordi, and the Ancient called them Buboni,
and some with other names. There are other that come in all parts of the body,
and when they come they cause great payne, and then they ripen and break of
themselves for the most part, and these in Naples are called Autrax, and in
Rome Chicolini, in Venice Un nasito, in Lumbardie Un bungo, and in Spain Un
nacido mui viliaco. There is an other kind of Impostume, that is engendered of
a contusion or broose, and is properly called Apostumato pro Amacatura. In the
head there grow certain kinds of sores that are called Talpa or Topinare, ye
which are of small importance, for they may be healed in short time, as it
is seen in childrens heads yt are oft troubled there-with, and also in their
throats, and for the most part about the ears.

Of Fistoloes, and their kinds.
ALl manner of sores that do not cicatrize perfectly and have communication
with the inward parts, are called Fistoloes, and we term them in Italian Sofio
or Spiraculo, as ye may see by experience, and this is perilous when a
Fistoloe closes, being in the body and specially those fistoloes that are in
the fundament, for Nature her self doth engender it for ease. But these
fistoloes that come in divers parts of the body are troublesoe, but not
perilous, also al such sores as tarry long before they be incarnated come to
fistoloes, many times it comes through long curing, by tenting with their
tents, the which are cause that nature makes a Callow leaves the sore so
hollow, that it will never be filled with flesh, but so remain hollow, as it
is seen easily by experience. There be other sorts of fistoloes in form of a
sore, and they be those sores that most commonly come on the legs, the which
do purge a long time, and are also very hard to heal, because if ye heal one
of them presently, there will rise another hard by it, and that is a kind of
fistoloe. There is another kind of fistoloe that is caused of those sores that
are upon the bone, the which by his continuance do break and consume the skine
and the bone, and these many times remain fistolated, but who so takes away
the cause of the sore, nature it self will preuaile mightily and heal it, as
may be seen daily by experience, in those that be so troubled. The fistoloes
that come in the eyes, are called Fistola Lacrimosa, and they have some
communication with the inward parts, and are evil to be healed. Because first
the cause must be taken away inwardly, and then nature will heal it by it
self, as I have seen by experience, so that these are the kind of fistoloes
most known unto all men, and the causes of these fistoloes are two: and for my
part I am fully persuaded it is so. The first is of wounds evil healed, that
remain Fistolated. The second cause I find to be of sores caused of the pox,
and to show a troth, ye shall cure them of the Pox, and their fistoloes will
heal of themselves without any other help, as it is daily to be seen:

There may be many other causes the which as yet I know not, but these two are
a sufficient reason, and to be considered of the professors of this art, if
they desire to come to any excelencie: and therefore I will reason no more of
the matter, because the science and my experience will reach no farther.

Of all sorts of scabs.
THere be divers kinds of scabs, but I will only entreat of those in
which I have had most experience, and will set them forth as plain as I can,
that every one thereby may have profit. The first kind of scabbe is that
which is caused of Riplexione of the body, by eating much meat of great
nourishment, and then not to digest it, so in that cause nature to ease it
self, sends forth that humidity, and when it joins to the skin it
ingroseth and causes an Impostume, and passing to the outward parts it is
already corrupted, and so causes the Pustules, as by experience may be seen,
and this kind is a viscous and fat humour with great humidity. There is
another kind of scabbe that is always dry with readnesse, and is small, with
great heate and itching, and the same in my judgment is caused by much heate
of the Liver and adustion of blood, and may be healed easily. There is another
kind of great scabbe, that hath a great dry crust on them and they grow
big, and the same is of the french pox being new taken. There is another
kind like serpigo that goes creeping, and hath a dry crust, and hath no
matter under it: and the same is also of the french pox Inueterated. There are
also divers other kinds, the which I will leave at this time, because they are
of small importance, and may be helped with those medicines which are fit for
the kinds aforesaid.

Of Formicola and his effects.
THose kind of ulcers that are commonly called Maldi formica, are so called
because they are a kind of maling Ulcers and corrosive that goes creping upon
the flesh, and makes many holes that are lifted up on the sides and are red,
and these for the most part are caused of the pox as may be seen by
experience, and those sores are evil to be healed, because thereunto runs
abundance of humours, the which cannot be resolved but with inward medecines,
that is, with exquisite purgations that purify the blood, and that cutteth
away the evil humours that run thereunto, cause great alteration with
burning. This kind of sore comes many times in the head, and when it
comes in that part, it is called Tigna, or the white scalle, and to show
that this is the troth, ye may see that those medecines which heal Formicola,
doth also heal the white scalle, for this is a kind of the pox, as by the
effects ye may plainly see, for if any should say the contrary, I would
answer him again that this may well be, because the same infirmity may be
taken in the mothers womb, or as soon as the child is borne it may take it
of the Nurse that gives it suck, if she be infected with that disease, so
that I conclude it may be so. But there are a number of that kind of disease,
which I let pass because I have seen no experience of them.

A discourse of wounds and other kinds of inward sores.
Wounds that are within the body, as in the stomach or belly or in
Testinalles, in the bladder, rains, or guts: The Milt, Liver, Lungs, Heart
or other muskles or Arteres, as there be a number, I confess to know nothing
therein, and I will show you the reason, you shall understand that when a
wound doth offend the interior parts, the Physician, or Chyrurgion or great
Anatomist what so ever he be, cannot know all those parts offended in the
body, for after the weapon is with-in the body, it may turn and with the
point hurt other parts a far off the wound, and offend diverse particular
parts one different from the other, therefore I beseech you excellent
Chyrurgions, when such a case comes, how do you know or discern which parts
are hurt, but to say yt troth, I believe in that case they know al alike, but
what should I say of ye cure of such a wound, if the Chyrurgion know not where
it is, nor of what importance, but works by imagination, and if that nature
doth preuaile, and that the wound doth heal, it is by the good fortune of the
physician, so yt for wounds inwardly I conclude no other at this time, but will
leave it to those that know more then I, and hereafter I will discourse of
ulcers and impostumes inwardly what they are and how to cure them with our
order: ye shall understand that there are a number of kinds of ulcers and
impostumes that may engender inwardly, but it seems to me so hard to
understand, that I can determine nothing that were true, and the cause is this,
that we have seen an infinite of Physicians and Chyrurgions that have visited
one Impostumated or Ulcerated, and the Physician could not know the place,
and particular of that impostume or ulcer, if that the patient do not tell him
and show him, and cause him to feel with his hand, and this is most true,
therefore if one cannot resolve him of outward things that he may see feel
with his hand, how can he resolve him when one of those accidents is within
the body, where the patient knows not himself, which is grieved. Truly I
would gladly know what judgment they would give of that matter, for because if
there be any Impostume or ulcer in any part of the body, the sick shall feel
great offence and pain, nevertheless he cannot tell where it is, nor what part
is hurt, so that I conclude, if that the Patient know not, much less the
Physician knows, and of this I have made a large discourse in Caprici
medicinalle, for as I have said before, in this case I know nothing.
Nevertheless when it shall come to his place, I will write a discourse of the
order to cure the most part of Ulcers and Impostumes, but touching wounds, I
will promise no more the I have said before. Also I will write excellent
remedies of great experience, with the which all wounds, so they be not
mortal, may be helped and healed, and also the reasons convenient in that
matter.

An order to use in healing all manner of diseases apperteining unto the
Chyrurgian.
Wounds and all other sorts of sores, are of sundry and diverse kinds, as is
aforesaid, nevertheless the order to help them is not much different one from
ye other, if we should say only the troth without abuse. For ye shall understand
that Nature is the master of al things created, the Physician and Chyrurgian
are helpers of that Nature, as the Ancient professors of the Art have
affirmed. Than seeing this is so, what need we to make so much ado, having
Nature that works so gently, if it be not hindered by the minister, therefore
if we will speak of wounds, I say that the minister hath three operations to
do, and no more, and the rest leave to nature that works gently. The three
operations that the Master hath to do, are these: To defend the wound so that
there runs no humours to it, and that it putrefy not, and to keep it
clean, and when the minister hath done that, letto Nature work that which she
will work well, and if any desire to see if it will be so in effect, ye may
see by a dog, for if he hath a great wound upon his body, he heals it
without any medicine, only with diet keeping it clean with his tongue, and
this is most true, that those which do help wounds by enchantment, do
nothing but keep the wound clean, cause the patient keep a diet, so nature
works as well on man as on a dog, therefore let none marvel of this
authority of a dog, although I approve the like of a Christian. But for so
much as it would be good to help Nature, that it might work with more
speediness, as husbandmen do and gardeiners, who because they would have
Nature to work the better quicker in their ground, do cast there-on diverse
sorts of dounges, c. The which is done only to help Nature to work the
quicker, and to conclude, I say that the Chyrurgian should do the same in
helping of wounds. But as for ulcers of diverse sorts, it were necessary to
find out the cause, because they come of diverse causes, for when ye cause is
found, it will be more easy to be helped, because ulcers cannot come but by
great distemperaunce of nature in our bodies, as by great heat or cold, or by
replexions of ye body. Therefore in this case it is necessary to purge the body:
first, to ease Nature which is offended, to extinguish the superfluous heat or
cold that is in the body: That being done ye minister or helper of Nature hath
three things to do. The first is to mortify or kill ye sore, the second to
mundifie, the third to incarnate, then nature will cicatrize it, these three
operations are to be used in ulcers. Also Impostumes are caused of diverse
accidets, in the which it is also necessary to seek out the cause, where-by to
know what purgations are fit to purge ye body of the superfluous humours, then
the minister hath.3. things to do in yt case. First to bring it to maturation
quickly, then when it is ripe and broke to mundifie it well, and thirdly to
incarnate it, these are the.3. operations that are to be done in an impostume
to help nature to work well, and so following this order thy work shall prove
well go ye right way, as heerafter I will show in his place ye operatios to use
in ye effect with ye order to help the, also to make thy unguents, showing
their qualytie virtue, will prove by reason those things that are doubtful, so
that every one shall be satisfied in that matter.

Of medicines to be used in all kind of wounds outward with ease and
brevity.
Having declared what outward wounds are, it is also necessary to show ye
order how to cure them, with as much speed ease as it is possible, therefore I
will begin first with simple wounds yt are only in the flesh, without offence of
veins, sinews, or bones, although these need no help, but only to join ye
lips close together, if need be to stitch them close, then let nature work,
ye which in short time will heal them, but if thou by Art wilt help nature,
thou shalt anoint them with oil of frankincense once a day. But wounds where
veins are cut, have need of present help, and artificial means and
sufficient remedies to help it with as much speed as may be, so that the
veins cut may join again together, without any great offence of the would,
that is done in this order. The first thing is to join the parts close
together stitch it well, not as the common Chyrurgians do, but as they do use
to stitch bags, and when it is stitched close, annoynt it only upon the
wound with our Magno licore, and lay there-on a cloth wet in ye same Oil very
warm, then take Hipericon with the seed, Millefolli, Viticella, Ana, and make
theroff a powder, the which thou shalt strowe upon the wound being dressed, and
round about it, for this medicine doth assuttiliate the matter that runs
unto the wound, and takes it forth with great ease and without pain of the
wound, for this is the most suffereigne medicine in that case, that Nature with
Art may make, hath been proved a thousand times by experience in diverse places.
But those wounds where bones and sinews are hurt, have need of great
artificie and cunning, because they be of importance. But when the sinews be
only offended, it were necessary to stitch them presently, as I have said of
those where veins are cut, but not to dress it with Magno licore, but in
steed thereof to take our Oleum benedictum, and Oil of frankincense, of each
a like, for those Oils do exceedingly comfort the sinews that are cut, and
when it happens that a sinew hath a puncture or is cut half way, in yt case
it were necessary to cut it ouer-thwart, because it shall bring no Spasmus to
the wound, but if so be than that the bone be hurt, and that there be any part
to come forth: it were necessary to leave the wound open, until the bone
comes forth, and then to incarnate it, and this thou shalt do with our
artificial balm, for the same (...) for wounds, and lay thereupon the Cerote
of Gualtifredo di medi, the which heals it with speed, and so with these
orders thou may help all the aforesaid sorts of wounds, and the defensive
to use in these wounds is this. Rec. Aqua vitae made of pure wine that will
burn all away, and put therein Hipericon, Millifollie, Viticella, Betonica,
and then wet a cloth in that infusion and lay it for a defensive round about
the wound, and so thou shalt have thine intent to the great satisfaction of
the patient. Wounds in the head, are helped as those are, where the sinews are
offended, there are also divers other sorts of wounds which are helped with the
aforesaid remedies.

To help ulcers of all sorts.
Seeing that ulcers are of diverse sundry kinds, it were necessary to know of
what kind and quality they are, so that thou may help them in form and
order convenient, and first I will write of the corrosive vlceras of a wound
Cancrenated, mal di Formicola, and other sorts of ulcers that go creeping
upon the flesh. The cure of these kinds of ulcers is to apply quickly our
Caustike to mortify the evil, the which thou shalt do thus, wet a little
bumbaste in our Caustike, and therewith wash all the sore, then leave it so
open 24. hours without binding it fast, when 24. hours are past, wash the
sore with strong Vinegar water, of each a like quantity, with charge that
there remain none of the Caustike in the sore, then lay thereon butter washed,
with a coleworte leaf until the asker or dead flesh fall away, then take our
Cerote Magistrale, with a little Precipitate strawed thereon, and their annoynt
it with Magno licore, and lay it upon the sore* for this (...) helps al
manner of coraliue ulcers without any other help, and every plaster will
serve three or four days, taking them off, every 24. hours, and make them
clean, and then lay them on again, and as for the filthy ulcer that I have
showed off in his Chapter, ye shall dress them only with our Vngento magno.
The which without any other help will heal them quickelye: But ye must every
four days touch them with Aqua fortis, drawn from Precipitate, the which
watter draws forth the offensive matter, and leaves it purified and clean,
and in all other sorts of Ulcers, our Balm artificial, our Magno licore,
Oil of Wax and Terpentine, the black Cerote of Gualtifredo, di medi, our
Cerote Magistrale with Precipitate, are able to help, be they never so euell.

The order to be used in curing Impostumes of diverse sorts.
THere be many sundry kinds of Impostumes that comes to man body, that
are caused, of divers sundry accidents, and therefore must be cured by divers
orders and with sundry medicines according to his kind, because some
Impostume is caused of a contusion or bruised flesh, some are certain grieves,
that Nature would discharge her self off, and so sends forth that matter,
some are caused of cold, other of melancholic humours, and other are caused
of corrupsion of the Pockes, and these are the kinds of Impostumes that
commonly come, and hereafter I will show the order to cure them, one after
another.

And first of those that are caused of a contusion because it is bruised flesh,
for every contusion must be putrified and brought to matter, therefore make a
Maturatiue and bring it to supperac^, and when you know there is matter,
presently lance them and dress them with this medecin as well within as
without, the which without any other help will heal any great contusion. But
you must make the Huguenot fresh every day, and with new Eggs, ye shall mix
the youlke of an Egg with our Magno licore, and there-with dress them. And as
for those Impostumes that come by indisposition of Nature, are certain,
Sboryne, a word so called in Italian, by the which nature would preuaile, it
were necessary to let those have their cures according to Nature, until they
break of themselves, and when they are brooken dress them within with this
Huguenot. Rec. Oil of Roses, ounc. 6. Litarge of gold in fine powder, ounc. 2.
Storax liquida ounc. 1. Terpentine, ounc. 2. yellow Wax ounc. 3. mix them and
boyle them on the fire until it be black, and if it be to hard put thereto
more oil of Roses, make it in form of an huguenot, and therewith dress those
kinds of Impostumes, and lay thereon the Cerote Diapalma, and there-with will
be wrought miracles. Also for those Impostumes caused of cold, ye shall use
hot medicines and ^tractiue: the Cerote of Oxicrocij is excellent in those
kind of impostumes, our Balm artificial, or the water, such like things as
are temperate by Nature. But those Impostumes that have their Original of the
french pockes, are evil maling, because their cause is ^a^ing and euell, and
therefore their cure is with great purging, to let the impostume ripe of
himself, when ye lance it, dress it within, with our vnguento magno, mixed
thus. Rec. vngueto magno, ounc. 2. magno licore ounc. 1. precipitate ounc. s.
mix the well together, therewt dress yt impostume, ye which will heal quickly
well, and lay thereon our Cerote Magistrale, with this charge that in all the
cures aforesaid ye purge the body well, so that the humours run not unto the
place offended, and use defensiues according to the kind of Impostume, as Oil
of Frankesence, of Terpentine, of wax, of honey, Aqua vitae, al these are
excelet defensiues by themselves, anointing them round about the Impostume.

The order to cure all manner of Fistoloes.
FIstoloes as I have said before, are of diverse kinds, and caused of divers
accidents, and so likewise they have need of divers medicines, and first I will
write of those fistoloes that come of wounds evil healed, and that have made
a callowe in that order that nature cannot scicatrise and so remain
fistolated, and ye cure of these kind of fistoloes is to put therein a Rupture
that doth cut and mortify the callow, and causes it to fall away, and then
with incarnating medicines, incarnate them and scicatrise them and this is the
true cure of these fistoloes. But those kind of fistoloes that nature causes,
to ease her self of some accident, commonly do come in the lower parts about
the fundament and they be very perilous, and not to be healed as they before
were. But they must be with purging the body, stomach, and head, the which
is to be done thus. First purge them x. or xij. days with our Magistral
Syrope, then give them our Aromatico, and drink thereon a little white Wine,
then purge the head with a perfume made of Mirra, and Cynaber, after these
things be done ye shall rectify the Liver with some decoccion fit for
that purpose, as of Lignum sanctum, or Salsa peryllia, or such like, that work
effect, for this medicine doth also help Fistola lacrimosa, that commonly come
about the eyes, or ears. There be other Fistoloes in form of a sore, which
must be helped with purging, and lay upon the sore our Cerote magistrale with
Precipitate anoint it with Magno licore, for with this Cerote only may all
fistolated sores be healed, for it doth mundifie and afterwards cicatrize it,
there be also diverse such like matters that are cured easily, if ye apply
thereunto those medicines that are appropriate.

To help all manner of scabs.
THe kinds of scabs be many, and caused of diverse causes, and their cures
are also diverse ways. Those that are caused of replection of the body and of
gross blood, ye which is caused by eating abundance of such meates as are of
great nourishment, ye which if thou wilt cure them, it were necessary to purge
them with our Siruppe Solutiuo.x. or.xij. days, then give him or her one dram
of our Aromatico in ye morning fasting, and drink ther-on a cup of sweet
wine, then let him sweat three or four times, and after anoint him with our
Vnguento magno two or three times, it will heal him of those kind of scabs.

Now to cure that kind of scabbe that is red and small, and causes great
itching, you shall make a decoction of herbs that cool the liver and purify
the blood, as Borage, Buglosse, Endiue, Mayden-haire, Liuer-wort, Harts-tongue,
Agrimony, Citrach, Succory and such like herbs, then purge with Aloes, the
juice of Elder roots, Iera pigra solutina, and such like as doth cool the
liver and blood, then anoint them with Vnguento di Litargirio, therwt you shall
help all those kind of scabs. There be also certain great scabs over all
the body, the which are very thick, those are a kind of the Pockes, the which
may be helped with giving the our Pillole contra il mal Francese, the quatitie
is according to the discretion of ye Physician, and these Pills ye shall take
three times every third day, and then annoynt them with our Vnguento magno, and
he shall be helped. There is an other kind of scabbe that goes creeping with a
dry crust like unto petigine, and those are the mere Pockes inueterated, and
the order to cure them is thus, give them our Sirop against the melancholic
humour, because it purges the blood and cools the liver, and dissolveth that
viscous humour that ingendereth that crust, that being done give them our
Aromatico, anoint them with our Magno licore, and he shall be perfectly helped
in shortt space. There are other kind of scabs that come through great
cold, and those are healed only with anointing them with Oil of
Frankincense three or four times.

To help Mal di formica.
THose be certain ulcers which go creeping in the upper part of the flesh and
have many orifices or mouths, and these are caused of the Peckes being
inueterated, the which are cured in that order that the Pockes is; and that is
this. First, purge the body with* our Electuario Angelica, the which purges
away gross and maligne humours, and euacuateth the stomach of choler and
fleam, this being done, cause the patient to sweat, for that will a subtiliate
the humours, and cause them to come forth, that being done, take our Cerote
magistrale and stroe there-on Precipitate, and then annoynt it with our Magno
licore, and lay it upon the sore, and there let it lye.24. hours before ye
change it, then make it clean and lay it on again, for that Plaster may
serve four days, making it clean every.24. hours, and when the Plaster will
draw no more matter, you shall use our Vnguento magno, the which will help it in
short time. But if it do happen that this order do not cure the, then it would
be necessary for them to be anointed with the unction for ye Porks, and to
annoynt them so long till the mouth be sore, and when that sign doth appear,
annoynt them no more, for he will spit or vaper at the mouth, for twelve or
fifteen days, and as soon as he vapoureth, make a Bathe and wash him well,
and wash the mouth with wine and with-out all doubt it shall help him God
willing, now hereafter I will write of certain things which are used of
common Chyrurgians, with a brief discourse upon them.

Of the Tow which is laid upon wounds of common Chyrurgians.
THe pleggits of Tow which is laid upon wounds when they are first stitched is
made in this order. Rec. The white of an Egg, Salt, and Rose-water, and beat
them together, and when the wound is stitched, they lay it ther-on, because the
blood should stint, and the wound remain shut, so that it may be helped with
more ease. Now touching this, I will show the reason why they use it in their
first cure, ye shall understand that every like desires his like, to succour
him or keep company with him, and therefore the Ancient, our ancient
professors of Art, willed the white of an Egg to be occupied in wounds,
because it is a substance of flesh like unto the other flesh, and to declare
the troth I will prove it by natural reason, for ye shall understand that the
white of the Egg is that part which engenders the flesh, the skin, and the
feathers of the hen, and the yolke engenders only the guts and other
entrails of the animal, then seeing the white is that which engenders the
flesh only, it is like unto flesh, as it is said before, then the salt is a
material which preserves al things from putrefaction, as is seen by
experience daily, and for that consideration it was put in this composition to
preserve the flesh, the Rose-water by nature is cold and dry, and by his
coldness defends the inflammation, and by his dryness is repercussiue
mitigateth, so that these are the reasons why the said Tow is laid upon wounds,
but I would to God that such things were used as by their excellent operations
would help and heal from the beginning to the latter ending, to leave of such
trifling orders.

Of the disgestiue with the which they dress wounds after the aforesaid Tow.
AFter that the tow is taken away from the wound they dress it with a
composition called disgestiue, because it digests ye wound although this
medicine be some what scrupulus against science, the reason is this, ye shall
understand that when a man is wounded, the place before was sownde, and
therefore being wounded, our true duty is to help ye same wound and not to
digest or rot it, as commonly all Chyrurgians do, for by rotting of it in
that order, it is perilous, and more dangerous to be cured, as is daily seen
by experience, and this no man can deny. But now I will follow our regiment
in showing what this disgestiue is, the which is made thus.

Rec. The youlke of two Eggs, Terpentine washed ounce 1. Oil of Roses ounce s.
mix them in an Huguenot, and this is the disgestiue wher-with they dress it
until the sore have made quitter or matter enough, and then they use to dress
it with medicines much differing from the same, but I marvel much at the
diversity of this matter, that this disgestiue being applied to a putrified
ulcer, works diverse effects, for it heals it divinely: and moreover, ye
shall understand that if it be applied unto when they be incarnated, it will
scicatrise them marvelously, for truly these are things worthy to be
known, and he that understands the reason I account him to be wise, for if
this disgestiue be laid on fresh wounds it putrifieth and rots them,
again being laid on a filthy sore it doth mundifie and heal, and then if it
be applied on a wound incarnated, it Scicatriseth it and heals, for this I
have done diverse and sundry times, the which is to be woundred off.

Of the mundification huguenot wherewith they dress the wounds after they are
digested to mundifie them.
WHen wounds are come to digestion and that they purge, always they change
unguents, and they apply Vnguentes that have virtue to mundifie the wound and
make it clean, so that it may the better incarnate, and that huguenot is called
properly a mundificatiue, the which is made of Barley flower is the
mundificatiue they use 8. or 10. days to-gether for if the wound were not
well modified, it would never incarnate-well so that this huguenot is most
necessary in that operation in respect of the ingredience.

Of their incarnatiue wherewith they dress the wound after it is modified.
WHen that the wound is modified, so that, thereunto comes small quantity
of matter, than it is necessary to apply vnguentes that incarnate, so that they
may cicatrize with more ease, and this kind of incarnatyue is in the most use
among the common Chirurgions, the which is made of Terpentine, Wax, and
Franckenscence, and a little Oil of Roses mixed of the fire, and this is their
incarnatiue.

A rare secret, the which this author did send unto a very friend of his,
being in the wars in Africa, the which helps all wounds, either by cut,
thrust, galling with arrows, or hargabush shot, or otherwise.
THe first thing that ye shall do is to wash the wound very clean with vryne
and than dry it very well, then put there-in our Quintaessence of wine, and
presently join the parts close together, and stitch or sow them well, but in
any wise sow nothing but the skin, for other-wise it would cause great
pain, then put thereon five or six drops of our Balsamo, and upon the
wound lay a cloth weate in our Magno licore, as hot as he may suffer it,
and this do the first day, then the next day follow this order, first put
thereon our Quintaessence a little Balsamo, and then our Magno licore very hot
never change this medicine until he be whole*

Of those unguents that Cicatrize wounds.
THe unguents that cicatrize wounds after they are incarnated be of divers
kinds, although they work one effect in cicatrizing or causing a skine. The
digestion that is written off before, being applied upon a wound incarnated,
it doth cicatrize it with speed, the like doth Diachilon vnguentum de tutia.
The Cerote called Gratia dei, although these be sundry compositions one
differing from another, yet in effect they serve all to this cicatrization as
ye may see by experience, this they do because they be temperate and of good
qualities and so they help nature to work more quielitier, and they are called
helpers of nature. But these kind of unguents that work by them-selues, as
Vnguento Apostolorum, the Causticke, Aegyp^atum, the rottery such like unguents
as work with violence, and suppress nature, and do that which nature cannot
do by it self without help, but all those vnguentes that are not violent,
neither in heate or cold, are apt to cicatrize wounds, and all sores, that
are modified and incarnated.

A remedy to help a wound with great speed, of our invention.
Wounds of diverse and sundry forts are very perilous of life, but to help
them quickly because the patient may take no harm, ye shall use this secret,
wash the wound with our water of balm, and cleanse it well, and lay thereon
clothes wet in Oil of Frankincense made by distillation, and therewith thou
shalt heal any great wound in short time, as I have proved diverse and sundry
times, in sundry causes.

An excellent secret to heal wounds of Gun shot or Arrows without any
danger.
IF thou wilt help the aforesaid wounds it were necessary first to join the
parts close too, and wash it with our Aqua celestis, and lay thereon our
Oleum balsami, there-with thou shalt save the lives of many wounded persons.

A discourse upon old wounds that are not yet healed and their sovereign
remedy.
WHen that wounds are euel healed and that they impostumate, and that the
arm, or leg, or other parts where they were wounded is indurated and full
of pain, thou shalt use this secrete of our invention never known before of
old nor new writers, for it is of great virtue and many times proved: first
ye shall wash the wound well and make it clean round about, then wash the

To dissolve a broose in short time, when it is new done.
THese are called contusions, unto the which nature sends quickly great

ther-on a cloth wet in ye same, for this is a miraculus medicine experimented
proved by reason, for an experiment without reason is as a man without clothes,
and therefore if thou wilt know great rare secrets never written before, look
in my Spechio del scientia vniuersalli, and in my Thesoro del vita humana, and
there-in thou shalt find strange things, proved by reason and experience, the
which books God willing, I mean to set forth in the Englsh tongue to the
profit of my Country.

To help a wound quickly that is in peril of any accident.
Wounds in some parts of the body are very dangerous of life, and specially
where sinews be cut or pierced, or veins or muscles hurt, or bones broke,
and by an infinite of other particulars, which being open or evil healed, the
patient may be in danger of life, because the wind enters in, and they
cause paints and inflammation, and therefore to avoid all these afore-sayd
matters, so that the wound shall have no detriment, use this remedy. First
join the parts close together, and put ther-in our Quintaessence, and lay
there-on a cloth wet in our Balm, and bind it fault that the air get not in,
for it is very hurtful, ye shall understand that these are two of the
excellentest medicines that may be found, because our Quintaessence doth
assuttiliate the blood, and takes it forth, and takes away the pain, the
Balm doth warm and comfort the place offended, and will not suffer any matter
to run ther-vnto by any means, for this is most true, as I have proved
diverse sundry times, and always have had good success.

To stop the flux of blood in wounds with great speed.
when there is any great flux of blood in wounds by reason of some ^eyne that
is rut, and that the Chyrurgians would shop it, it were necessary to stitch it
well, but not as the common Chyrurgians do with wide stitches, but stich it
very close and hard, and put ther-in our Quintaessence, and upon the wound
strew the blood of a man dried in powder, and lay upon the blood a cloth wet
in our Balm artificiaill, very warm, and upon that bind the wound with
ligaments very straight, and every day twice, wash it with our Quintaessence,
and round about annoynt it with our Balm, and also cast ther-on our secret
powder for wounds, and that do morning and evening, every day without opening
of the wound, and in that time the wound will remain well, and the-veynes will be
in a manner healed so that they will not bleed, giving you charge that the
wounded man-keepe no diet, because ye virtue being weak, ^elaueth the veins,
and that causes the flux of blood.

An other remedy to stay the slux of blood in a wound.
WHen there is a great slux of blood in a wound, the perfectest remedy, is to
stitch it very close, then take mans blood being dried and made in powder, and
cast it upon the wound, and bind it somewhat straight, and so let it
remain.24. hours when ye unbind it, take heed that ye remove nothing, and
cast on more dried blood upon the wound* anoint it round about with our
Oleum Philosophorum de Terpentina Caera, and bind it up again other 24.
hours, then bind it gently, and annoynt ye wound with Oil of Frankincense,
so in short time it will be whole, giving, thee great charge that ye put in
no tent or such like, and then thou shalt see miracles.

Of our Cerote magno, that helps against all sorts of sores and wounds.
THis Cerote is of great virtue, and heals all manner of sores and wounds if
it be spread on a cloth and laid there-on, and the order to make it is thus.

Rec. Galbanum..1. Ammoniacum..2. Oppoponax..2. Aristolochia longa..1. New

keep every one by him-selfe, then dissolve the gummes in distilled Vinegar,
according to Art, and then vaper away the Vinegar again, strain the gummes
through a cloth, then take the wax with as much sweet oil and melt them on the
fire, when they are melt, put there-vnto ounce.2. of Litarge of gold finely
searced, and stir them continually until it be boiled, the which ye shall
know by this token. Put a feather there-in, if it be boiled enough, it will
burn straight ways, or else let it boyle until it burn it, then take it from
the fire and let it cool a little, than put in the guns stir them well
together, set it on ye fire again, it will rise with a great noise, therefore let
it boyle until it do fall down again, that take it from the fire put there-vnto
all ye aforesaid powders, and stir it until it be cold, and there-with thou
shalt work marvelous cures, if it be made well, according to Art.

Of our magistral Huguenot that helps diverse sorts of sores.
THis Huguenot is appropriate for many kind of sores because it comfortech the
sore takes away the payne and draws the matter from the lower parts or
bottom of yt sore. The which matter is cause of the payne, it keeps it also
from accidents, giving you charge that it be made artificially, for other-wise
it will not be of so much virtue, and this is the Huguenot.

Rec. Litarge of gold, ounce.4. Oil of Roses, pound 2. Boyle them in a Copper
pan so long, as if ye put a feather there-in, it will burn it, then it is
sod, then put there-to of new Wax, ounc. 6. Storax liquida, ounce 2. common
bunny, ounce 3. then let it boyle a while until they be well incorporated, the
take it from ye fire, put ther-to Olibanum, Mirra, Mercury Precipitate, Oil of
Wax, Oil of Terpentine, Oil of Frankincense, ana ounce 2. mix them well till
they be incorporated, then put thereto pure rectified Aqua vitae, ounces 4. and
mix them well, and then it is ended: this is of my invention, where-with I
have done very strange cures.

To make Oil of Frankincense.
TAke a retort of glass, well luted, and fill it half full of Frankincense,
for every pound of Frankincense put there-vnto ounces 3. of common Ashes
finely serced, then distill it in sand, and the first that comes forth will
be water, the which will be clear, then increase the fire, and there will come
forth an Oil of the colour of a Rubye, the which keep close in a glass,
the first water is of marvelous virtue in diverse operations, but one
miraculous experiment I will not leave to write off, because it is a thing
very necessary, is this. For those that have chilblanes, or kibes, or chophes
in the hands or feet that comes through cold, ye shall first perfume the
parts that are sore over the fume of hot water, so that they may sweat, then
dry them and wash them with the aforesaid water, and put on a pair of
gloves, and in short time they shall be whole, it helps also the white scall
and scabs, and such like things. The Oil serves in many operations, and
specially in all cold diseases, if they be inwardly, give thereof every
morning one scruple to drink, and if they be outward annoynt. Also it helps
all manner of wounds be they never so great.

If ye annoynt them therewith, and keep them close from the air: And in any
wise use no tenting to keep them open but wet a cloth therein, and lay it
thereon, and in short space they will be healed, also it dissolveth a broose in
short space if ye annoynt it often therewith, this oil serves also for
painters to make varnish.

Of Oil of Wax and his effect.
THis Oil of Wax is marvelous excellent, for so much as it serves for the
most part against all diseases: which Oil Raymond Lulli doth approve to be a
more heavenly and divine medecin then human, and is most rare for wounds,
but it is not good for common Chirurgions because it helps a great wound in
x. or xij. days at the most, but as for small wounds it heals them in 3. or
4. days anointing only the wound therewith, and lay there on clothes wet
in the same. Also this oil works miracles against diverse diseases inwardly,
if ye give theroff one drame with white wine, as for those whose heaire heard do
fall away it is a rare thing and of great profit, and the order to make it is
thus.

Rec. A retort of glass well luted and put therein what quantity of Wax you
will, so that it be not half full, and for every pound of Wax put thereunto
4. ounces of ye powder of bricks, then set it in a forneyes, and give it gentle
fire until all the substance be come forth, the which oil will be congealed
hard, the which is his perfection, for if you will distill it so many times
that it congeal no more, it will be too hot sharpe, and not to be used within
the body in any wise, but the first distillation you may use safely inwardly
and make Vncions for any kind of disease where need shall require, and
always it will be good, and do no hurt in any wise in any disease, and
therefore this Oil ought to be had in great regard of all men.

To help the tooth atch, that is caused of rotten teeth, or that comes of a
dissention of the head.
THe teeth being rotten or corrupted always causes great pain and many times
it comes of a dissention from the head and such like humours as Cattars,
Erisipella, but let it come of what cause it will I will show a remedy of
great importance, and it is very short, ye shall take our Aqua realle and hold
it in your mouth a good white and then spit it out again, and this ye shall
do for three days together every day once, then afterward it were necessary
to wash your mouth in the like manner with our Aqua balsami for the space of a
month, so the tooth atch shall be taken away with ease, for this is our secrete
and may be used in all times of the year.

Against a stinking breath.
THe breath may stincke through many causes, as by ulcers in the mouth or by
corrupt and rotten teeth, and sometime it comes of the stomach, and that is
evil to be helped, and therefore if thou wilt help these thou must use diverse
remedies, and first to help those that have their mouths ulcerated, ye shall
give them a quantity of our Pillole aquilone, and then let them wash their
mouths with our Aqua realle, and so the ulcers shall be helped, and the mouth
shall not stincke. But when the stench comes of rotten teeth, use the
aforesaid remedy or medicine that is written, for the tooth atche, the which
will make the teeth as white as snow, and will acke no more, but when the
stincke comes from the stomach, it were necessary to purge the body with our
Sirope Solutiuo, six or seven days, and then to take our Aromatico, that
being done, take rectified Aqua vitae ye water of honey and Oil of Terpentine
of each a like, mix them well together, and every morning drink thereof,
ounce s. fasting, for the space of a month or there about.

To help those that have a great cough in the stomach.
THe cough doth come of diverse and sundry causes, but let it come of what
cause it will, it always offends the stomach and the head, for always
when the stomach is offended of necessity the head is offended, because it
hath communication with the stomach, so that the stomach is cause of the
pains in the head, and therefore it is necessary to help the stomach first,
that thou shalt do with our Pillole aquilone the which is written in this book
following, and if so be you cannot take pills, take our Aromatico, this being
done, if there be no fever, give him every morning 1. ounce of our electuary
magistrale per la toss, and every night annoynt his stomach with Magno
licore, and also his head and nostrils, but if it happen that the aforesaid
things help it not, then take blood of the Liver vain, and purge the body
with our Sirope against the melancholic humour, and so by the grace of God they
shall remain healed.

To help those that can-not hold their water.
THis proceeds of two causes principally, the first is of superfluous heat of
the body, through ye which heat, nature doth assuttiliate too much that humid
part, and continually doth send it down into the bladder. The second cause is,
that the powers are too much relaxed or opened, by the which operation the
urine doth pass with-out retention, and these are the two causes why the urine
can-not stays, and this comes commonly to young children, because they are
very hot of complexion, and the order to help them, is this.

Give them our Pillole Aguilone three times, the quantity is from one dram, to
one and a half: that being done, ye shall make them a decoction of Hisop of
the mountain, and put ther-in sugar, this they shall use.x. or.xij. days at
the least, for this mundifieth the place offended, and disposes it to
solution. Then after this is done, ye shall give him for.x. days together
half a dram of Masticke with a little Plantaine water, for this is hot and
restringeth the powers, and ingrosseth the Vryne, and so the Patient shall
remain whole of that infirmity, by the virtue of the afore-sayd three
medicines, and it is a very easy cure and sovereign for that purpose. But
some-time there happens a flux of vryne some-what like this, and it is not of
the afore-sayd causes, but of causes much different from them, for this is in
men and women of age, and this I find to be caused of the Pockes that causes
the flux, and they void certain threads which some call Gonorea, and the
remedy there-off is only with great purging and sweating, and then to anoint
them five or six nights with our Vnguento magno, keep them warm in bed
until ye have ended to annoynt him, and then go to the stowe, and he shall be
helped of that infirmity.

To help those that can-not make water.
THe vryne is stayed through diverse and sundry causes, and the principal are
three, of the which one is the stone that ingedreth in the bladder, for always
it hangs down in the neck of the bladder, and stops the Meat^ or powers
that the vryne can not pass, the which grieves the patient marvelously. The
other is caused of gravel or gross and viscous humours that cannot pass the
powers, and so cause that retention of vryne with great payne. The third is
caused of an obstruction or restriction of the powers or cunduites, where the
vryne doth pass, and so keeps the vryne with-in, with great payne so that
these be the three chiefest causes of the retention of vryne.

The cure of the first cause which is the stone, is to purge them well, and
then to use our most sovereign remedy that is written in this book
following, the which is of great virtue to break the stone, as I have proved
many times, but when this medicine is not able to break it, then it is
necessary to cut it forth, this is all concerning the first cause.

To help the second cause, it were necessary to use purgations that purge the
reins well, then to give them our Aromatico, and then to annoynt the reins
six days every day once with Vnguento magno, and with this medicine thou
shalt help him perfectly.

To cure the third cause it were necessary to purge with aperatiue things, then
to annoynt his reins and under the members and belly with our Balm
artificial, and give him to drink the powder of Hog lice or Centum pedes,
that are found under stones, and by the grace of God he shall be perfectly
whole.

To help those that have great burning of their urine.
THe burning of the vryne may come of diverse sudrye causes, but I find four
principal, of which one is ye stone in the bladder being great or small. The
second cause is a certain heat ye which corrupts the place where it passes
and carries forth as it were certain long thirds the which causes that
burning. The third cause is a certain viscousnesse the which holds to the
botome of the Vrinal, and it will not well break, and this is called Gonorea. The
fourth cause is certain fluxes of Urine caused of some kind of the Pockes, as
ye may see by those that use company with evil women and take harm, for
presently this burning comes, and therefore this shows me plainly to be
the Pockes that causes that burning of vryne.

But if thou wilt help the aforesaid four causes thou may do it with ease
having the true Art of a good Physician, and the remedy of the first cause
coming of the stone, is to take it forth of the bladder.

The second cause, is to be helped with purging with our Siropo solutino, then
after that, to use our oil of Vitriole compound taking thereof every
morning.1. ounce, and so they shall remain helped.

The third cause is helped with taking every tenue days a quantity of our
Aromatico, and so with this only remedy they shall be helped.

The fourth cause is helped with medicines appropriate for the Pocks, and to
annoynt them with Vnguento magno.

To help those that have great payne of the Gout.
THe Gout is a corrupt and maligne infirmity, and properly engendered of
corruption, as it is plainly seen in those that are troubled there-with, to
prove it to be true, Nature doth show it well, because you may see how great
the alteration is of that accident, seeing that humour is caused of a windy
humour and alteration of the blood, as is seen by experience, I believe the
same disposition hath his original and beginning of the stomach, for so much
as all those that are troubled with that disease, the first sign that
appears unto them, is a great payne in the stomach.3. or 4. days or more
before the grief comes, and then the payne increases exceedingly, so that
by the said sign, I judge this accident can-not proceed of other place then
the stomach, and to affirm it better, ye shall understand that those which
are troubled there-with, can find no better remedy then to evacuate the
stomach from all corruption, and therefore if thou wilt help them of that
accident, the first thing yt ye shall do is to give them a quantity of our
Aromatico in the morning fasting, and drink there on a little white wine, that
being done, it would be necessary to make a fomentacion with Nettells, that
be well boiled in water, and then to annoynt them with our Balsamo
artificiato, and so for that time the Gout will be gone, and will remain away
for a long time.

But if God permit me life, I will hereafter set forth the order to help the
Gout, that it shall never come again, with a certain order to be observed in
the same, found out by this Author, and hath been proved an infinite number of
times in diverse places, on diverse noble men as ye may well understand in his
Thesoro della vita humana.

A remedy against the pestilence, that preserves those that use it.
THe pestilence is a certain corrupt humour ye which is cause of the evil
disposition of the air that is corrupted, and poisoned, and it is so
contagious that in 36. hours it corrupts the body, causes them to dye, and
therefore if any will defend them from that infection they may do it by the
help of God and the Physician with these medicines, the first thing is to
confess our selves unto almighty God, and to pray heartily unto him, and then
as concerning Phisical medicines, three things are to be used, which may save
the lives of many. The first thing is to evacuate the stomach, the second to
sweat, the third vnccion. And touching yt first, ye shall use every 3. days
our Pillole aquilone for they evacuate the contagiousnes and will not let it
corrupt the body. For the second ye shall cause them to sweat by
artificial means, for that euacuateth a certain matter very apt to corrupt.
And the third is to annoynt all the body with our Balm artificial, for that
preserves the body, and defends it from the contagiousnesse, so that by
these 3. means men and women may be preserved from that violent death.

To help Pellaria, that is a disease which causes the hair and beard to
fall away.
THis Pellaria is a certain kind of fantastical infirmity the which we by
practise do know ye cause, the which is by using company with women corrupted
with the pockes, and by the same practise we see that those whose hair doth
fall away, do fall into great infirmities of the pockes, although not all,
yet the most part, and therefore if thou wilt help that accident, it were
necessary to purge them with our Siropo Solutiuo, 8. or 10. days together,
that being done, give them our Aromatico, and then annoynt the place where the
hair is fallen away every evening with our balm artificial, so that with the
use of these three medicines the patient shall remain perfectly whole of that
matter, because the sirope purges the whole body universally, and the
Aromatico purges the stomach and the head, and the Balm comfort and
defends the place where the hair is fallen, so that it shall fall no more,
for this I have proved an infinite of times. You shall understand that there
be two other kinds of Pellaria the which will not be helped in the aforesaid
order, for the one comes of a great fear, the other comes because they
have had Mal di massuca, and their heads be corrupted by that means, and for
these two I know no remedy but to let nature have her course.

To help a Carnosite in the yard.
THe Carnosite that comes in the yard hinders the vryne so that it can-not
pass, and grows in the mouth of the bladder, and is a kind of matter
engendered in that place, the which is much like unto an Emerode that comes in
the neck of the intestine about the fundament, and because it is a gross and
ulcerated matter the urine passes with difficulty and great burning, the
which is very painful, unto those that have it, but if thou wilt help that
inconvenience it were necessary to purge the body well, and to keep a diet, and
to drink the Decoccion of Hipericon made with hunnye, and use to eat dry
meates as much as is possible, and then make certain little Wax Candles of
Wax and Frankincense, and then make this huguenot.

Rec. Read lead ounce 1. white honey ounce 1. butter two ounces, white Wine
as much as will suffice to incorporate them in a liquid form, on a soft fix,
and then take ten quills that hath blood in them out of the winge of a
young Pigion that is fat, and therewith stir the huguenot when it boils, and
when one quill is dried take another, and so change them until the Wine be
consumed, and then it is made, and when thou wilt occupy it, take one of the
said Candles of Wax and upon the end put of this huguenot, and put it into
the yard until it touch the Carnosite, and this thou shalt use day, by day
until the Candle pass without any impediment, and then the patient shall be
helped, for this is most true, and I have proved it an infinite of times to my
great credit and content of the patient.

To help the white scall.
THis disease being so odious, is a corrupt humour the which is not only in
the head as many do think, but it depends of the inward parts and hath
communication with the head, and this humour is like unto the Fume, for
continually it vaporeth up, and when it can assend no more because it is
hindered in the skin, then it settles and ingrosseth and causes the head to
break forth in that grievous order as is seen. But I will show a secret to
help it, so that it shall never come again, and the order it thus. You shall
give them our Siropo Solutiuo 8. or 10. days together, that being done give
them our Pillole Aquilone three times, the which pills must be taken every
three days once, that being done, take Sinaber finely beat, two ounces,
Olibanum, Mura, ana one drame, mix them together, divide it into 5. parts
make thereof five perfumes in five mornings, and cover their heads with a cloth
so that it touch not the head, then let the powder be cast on by little and
little until it be spent, upon a chasing dish of coals, and so let them stand
covered one hour without moving, and this do every one of the times, that
being done annoynt the head for the space of a month with Oil of Wax and
Terpentine, and they shall be helped, for this is a remedy that cannot fail, for
I have proved it an infinite of times, in Palermo, in Mesina, in Naples, in
Rome, and in Venice, and always I have had good success to my great credit,
and profit of the diseased person.

To help those Caruolli that come upon the yard, and their causes.
THose Caruoli that come upon the yard, are of diverse kinds, as by reason
and experience thou may see, but ye most part are taken by using ye copany
of lewd corrupt women, infected with the pocks, and those are the worst kind, for
they are the first original of ye pockes, of those caruolli come Pannochie or
botches, certain great scabs, Pellaria, aiches, tumors, an infinite of other
evil effects these are ye first kind. There are another kind the which
commonly come of their own accord by reason of heat, and those are easy to be
help, and are not perilous or painful. There is an other kind, the which
is as though it were scorched or burnt, the which comes thorough debilytie of
the yard, having company with women, and these are also of small importance.

The first kind are certain Ulcers that come upon the end, and some upon
the proper substance of the yard, some upon the skin, and the order to cure
them is thus. Ye shall mortify them with-in with-out with our Causticke, and
when they are mortified, ye shall dress them with our Magno licore, and they
shall be whole quickly.

But ye shall well note, that many times after they are healed before.xv. days
do pass, there will come a certain alteration in the throat, so that they
canne scarce swallow their meat, and this alteration many times endures viii.
or x. days, and than it resolves by it self, and that is a certain sign of
Pellaria.

And therefore if thou wilt avoid that inconvenience that the hair fall not
off, as soon as ye feel any of the a afore-sayd griefs, then presently take a
quantity of our Electuario Angelica, and then take our Siropo magistrale.4.
or.5. days, and annoynt thy head.x. or xij. days with our Magno licore, so
by these means thy hair shall not fall. Because our Electuario Angelica doth
evacuate the stomach, and cleanses the head, dries up the matter, the which
is already alterated by that diseases. Also our Siropo magistrale, doth
evacuate the body, and purify the blood, and slakes the fury of the
disease. Our Magno licore preserves the hair from drying and falling.

There commenth many times, after those Caruoli are healed certain Impostumes
in the groyne, of the which we will speak off in an other book particularly.
The other kind of Caruolli that come upon the yard, are help only by
washing the with some bath that is restrictiue and comfortatiue. The other
kind which is like scorching or burning, are help by keeping them clean, and
anointing them with a Liniment of Tutia camphorata.

And thus I make an end, giving to understand to those that practise, how
that they may avoid that disease called Pellaria or falling of the hair or
beard, for this is one of my secrets, where-off I mean to write a great number
if God permit me.

A discourse of those sores that come of the Pockes, and how to help them
quickly.
THe Pockes as I have written of diverse times, being a putrified and corrupt
disease, the sores coming there-off, of force must be of his nature, that is
corrupt and stinking, therefore if thou wilt help them and take away their
pain quickly thou shalt use three operations, the first is to give them our
Pillole Aquilone, and then to wash the sore with oil of Sulphur, then lay
ther-on our Cerote magistrale, with Precipitate, and annoynt it with Magno
licore, and there-with thou shalt help the quickly, because those Pills are
appropriate for that disease, the oil of sulphur draws forth the filth from
ye senter, the precipitate draws forth the gross matter, so that of force it
must heal.

The cure of one that had the Pockes in his head.
BEing in Naples, among al other that I cured, there came unto me a Spaniard
called Il signor Diego di Menas, a man of the age of.36. years, of complexion
choleric aduste, the which had the Pockes, and in his forheade he had a
certain tumour the which had perished a great part of the skull, and was open,
and he had been taken in hand of diverse men, none could do him good, I seeing
that toke him in hand, gave him our Siropo solutiuo.8. or.9. days together,
afterward I gave him our Aromatico, and the gave him the roots of Cina in
decoction, and then perfumed him with Olibanum, Mastick, Mirrha, Scinaber, and
so by these means he was help of ye infirmity, but the bone remained bare, I
laid ther-on our Cerote magistrale, and so in short time, the bone did
seperate of his own accord, and one day I took it off altogether, and was so
great that it covered the fourth part of the head, than presently this signor
Diego went abroad, showing what was taken from his head, as diverse can
testify.

The cure of a wound in the head and in the hand.
THere was a certain Gentleman called Gionan Iacopo Veniciane, the which had a
great wound on the head, and in one of this hands, the which being taken in
hand of diverse Chyrurgians, was brought to a very evil case by reason of great
alteration in the wounds, and the Physician that had hm in hand, was one
called Realdo polumbo cremense, the which dressed his head with Wine and Oil,
and the hand with Turpentine and Oil of Roses. Than I being in company told
him, yt it were good to change those medicines, because in wouds of ye head,
those medicines were not convenient, for ye oil being crud putrifieth, and the
wine is repercussiue, and will not suffer the putrefaction to come forth, that
the oil ingendereth, and for that reason the said medicine would not be
used.

And as for the medicine for his hand, I say that the Turpentine is not
convenient, for where there is offence of skin, veins, sinews, and bones,
Turpentine is not good, because it is hot and putrifactiue, by means of the
Oil, and causes inflammation, and therefore it ought not to be used.

But if thou wilt help the head and hand both, ye shall use a kind of
medicine that comfort the place offended, and that doth assuttiliate the
matter and incarnate, to the which the said Realdo answered and said, my
reason was good, if I could find remedies that will do that effect, the
which I sent for to my house, and used them in this order.

First, I did put our Quintaessence into his wound in the head being cold, and
then a little of our Balsamo cold, the which seemed strange to Realdo, and
then I laid there-on our Magno licore, and upon the cloth I laid a little of
our secret Powder, and the like I did to the hand, and so in.14. days the
wounds were whole, to the great marvel of a number.

A great secret particular for the flux, and dissenteria.
THe fluxes of the body are no other but a distemperaunce of Nature, and are of
two kinds, the one is caused of an evil qualytie and distemperaunce of the
liver, and that is called Flusso epatico. The other is caused of great heat,
Fever, and distemperment of Nature, and this is called Disenteria, that is, a
distemperment of the guts, both these sorts are harde to be help of the
ancient doctors, as it is well seen by experience, of those that practise,
for they will help them with repression and restrictiues, but that is not the
way if we shall believe Galen, the which writes, Fluxus Fluxus curat, the
which is most true, for I have cured a thousand of the flux with giving them
our Aromatico, and three or four dosses of our Siropo Solutiuo, therefore
Galen saith true.

But the Disenteria is cured with giving them our Electuario, Angelica, and
then every day after dinner stand in a bathe of water of the sea cold, two
hours at the least, and so in this order thou shalt help any crud kind of
Disenteria in short time and with great ease, use this as a secret.

The cure of one that was poisoned with Arsenycke.
THere was a certain man poisoned with Arsenycke given him in a mess of Rice
pottage, in an euyning at supper, and as soon as it was in his stomach he
began to groan and sweat, and vomyte, in such order as it was strange to
see, and it happened that at the said time there was a learned man in the
house, who seeing this man in that case suspected him to be poisoned, and so
sent for me, and when I came, the poor man was all-most dead, then presently
I called the wife of the house and told her that her husband would dye, and
that she should have the Law for poysoninge of him, but if that she would
tell him what poison she had given him perhaps he might recover him again,
with many words more, so to conclude she told him that she had given him
two grains of Arsenycke in Rise pottage, then presently I called for a cup
of Sack, and caused him to drink, and then he vomyted and went to the stool,
and then I anointed him with our Oil of Hiperecone, and Scorpions, all the
body over, and styll caused him to drink that he might evacuate that poison,
but all his mouth and throat remained swollen, and he did spite great
abundance, and I caused him to use that vngnent, and every morning gave him
Theriacle with wine every three days, I gave him a quantity of Pillule
Aggregatiue, and last of all I caused him to use Aqua vitae compound, and so
ere forty days he was perfectly whole, and rid of a terryble disease the
which he had a fore he was poisoned.

The cure of an Ulcerated leg.
THere was a certain man of the age of six and thirty years, of complexion
choleric and sanguine, the which had his left leg all ulcerated, in such
order that the Physicians and Chirurgions of the city would have cut it
off, but in any wise I would not consent there-vnto, but took it in hand,
and gave him first our Magistrall Sirope, in the morning eight or nyne days
together, and in the mean time I washed the leg with Wine where-in was
boiled Mallowes, Consolida maiore, Cardus benedictus, and Honey, and then wet
clothes therein and laid them on twice a day, than I caused him to use a
decoccion of Lignum vitae and the bark with Iua artetica, Cardus benedictus,
Pollipodi, Ripontico, Wine, and Sugar, and his common drink was wine and water
boiled on the festes of the same, and this he used four and twenty days than
I perfumed him with Cinaber three times, and ere three months were past he
was perfect whole, for his disease came of the Pockes, and those sores are
commonly called Mal di formica.

The cure of the gout on a certain Gentle-man.
IN the aforesaid year, in the month of August I was called to visit a
noble Gentle-man called Ill seignor Don Christofalo della roca, a man of five
and thirty years, of complexion chollerike and sanguine, the which was sore
troubled with the gout, and because it was in the beginning of August, our
auncyent Doctors have for bodden to take any solibell medicine in that time.
In respect of the Caniculare days. Nevertheless I called Armellio, and
Leonardo Testa, two excellent Physicians, the which gave their counsel to
take no medicine, never the less I proved that the gout was extreme whote,
and for that I ordained a cold Sirope to mitigate the superfluous heate, the
which was made of Lyuerworte, Hearts tongue, Dates, Raysons, Figs, Sugar,
and Succorye water, and Aromatised it with Musk and Rose water, of the which
he took every day four ounces, and for the alteration of the gout, I
washed it three or four times a day with our Aqua del Balsamo, because it
penetrates and opens the powers, a suttiliateth and dries the humour
offensive, also I ordained him bread of Barley, because it coleth the blood and
is of good digestion, and caused him to refrain from all fat brothes and his
drink was temparate, and to this one of the Doctors did agree, but the other
would not, never the less the Gentleman was content with my advise, then I
began to give him the afore-saide decoccion, with our solible Quintaessence,
and there with he had every day two or three stools, and I washed the gout
three or four times a day with our Aqua Balsami, and the first day he began
to feel ease, and the second he felt more, so that in seven days all his
pains was taken away, and then I applied ther-vnto our secret of secrets,
for that kind of disease, the which in three days delivered him: then I
caused him to use certain medicines to defend the gout for coming again,
and so he continued whole to his great satisfaction.

Of the causes of the Scyatica, and how ye may help it.
THe Sciatica is a disease so called, because it comes in that place of the
body called, Sio, and is caused of an evil qualytie and gross humores, that
are stayed in that place, because they cannot pass down, and this is seen by
experience daily, for where that pain is, there is alteration, and the cure
thereof is with Glisters, Vomittes, Purgations, and Vnctions, because the
Glister doth evacuate those places next unto it, and so eases the humour, the
vomit cleanses the stomach, the purgaciones do evacuate the body
downewardes, the vnctions dissolve the wind, and so by these means thou may
help the Scyatica, as I have done many times to my great honour, and
satisfaction of the patient.

A most excellent remedy to help the flux of the body, with a certain
discourse there-on.
IF thou wilt help the flux of the body, it were necessary to know first from
whence it proceeds, for he that knows not the cause, is less to be
credited to cure the effect, and therefore I will show thee what the flux is,
and from whence it comes, then I will show the order to cure it, also to make
the medicines.

The flux of the body is caused of a superfluous heate conceived in the
stomach, the which make a continual solution inwardelye, as ye may see by
experience of those that are troubled there-with, for so long as the cause is
not taken away, all their meat doth turn into that matter, the which if it
be so, that is true which I do say, that the fluxes are a distemperance of
the body, caused of hot and corrupt humours in the stomach, and therefore if
thou wilt cure it, it were necessary to extinguish the heat and to take away the
corruption, the which thou shalt do with the redness of Mart Militare,
written in this book following, for that is the most sovereign remedy that
can be found. But first ye shall take twelve grains of our Petra
Philosophalla, with half an ounce of Mel Rosarum, and then take for four
mornings together one scruple of ye rednes of Mart, with half an.. of sugar
Rosat, ther-with thou shalt work miracles,

A discourse as concerning corns in the feet or else where, with their
remedies.
THis callowes matter, is a certain hot humour, of the which Nature would
discharge hir-selfe, and when that humour is driven forth of Nature, it goes
unto the lower parts, into the end of the toes, for in that extreme part of
the toes, that skin that is called Epiderma, is hard, and will not suffer it
to pass or exalare, and there many times it ingendeth a tumor in the skin
with great hardness, and many times that tumor doth increase and cause such
pain, that it doth not only hinder their going, but hinders them from sleep
in the night, and this kind of tumor is called commonly Callo or Corns in
English, and I thought it good to call them Crest, because they are always
growing, and is of great importance among the Chyrurgians, for an infinite
number of persons are troubled there-with, therefore I will show thee our
secret to help them quickly, and with great ease, which secret was never
known before of any. First, ye shall pare them with a sharpe knife until the
bottom, and there ye shall find a certain thing like matter, but if ye find
no matter, ye shall pare it until ye blood doth appear, than touch it once with
oil of sulphur, and then dress it with our Balsamo artificiato, once a day
until it be whole. Keep this as a secret.

Of an infirmity of importance that comes upon the extremity of the toe,
upon the nail.
THere are many men that are troubled with a certain infirmity under ye nail
of their great toe, the which seems as though ye nail grew in the flesh, the
which is not so, but the flesh grows over the nail, and although this
seems to be a thing of nothing, that the Ancients have had small
consideration theroff. Nevertheless it is an infirmity of great importance,
and to be considered of, because many are troubled there-with, specially men of
authority, in specially those that are troubled with the Gout. I cal to
remembrance, that in the time that I was in Naples, I cured a great number,
specially those that were of great authority, to my great honour and profit.
The first thing that I did I cut the nail on yt part which was grieved, and
toke it away the which was done easily and with little pain, the which thing
being done, I touched it with our Caustike, and so let it remain three days
together, an than I dressed it every day with our Magno licore until it was
whole, the which was in short time.

A discourse upon the Hemerhodes, with the order to cure them with most
excellent medicines of our invention.
THe Hemerhodes are a certain kind of evil tumor, caused of the blood in the
veins Emorodiale, and these come always in the extremity of the Intestinals
about the fundament, some of them cause great pain, some of them do burn
excessively, or do scald. The which comes thorough the quality of the good
evil humours. As ye may see by experience how yt some have such burning yt they
cannot rest in the night, the other have such payne that they cannot sit, ye
other are so scalded that they cannot abide it, ye shall understand this
infirmity is more painful in one complexion than in another, and the cure
there-off is difficile. Nevertheless it may be cured, and the order is this.

First take our Aromatico, then take our Siropo solutiuo three or four days,
then take our perfume three or four times on the fundament, that being done,
annoynt the place with our Balm artificial, for that dries and takes away
the payne altogether, and so the Patient shall remain perfect whole.

There is also a great secret in the tooth of a Horsefish if it be worn on a
mans finger, to take away the Hemerhodes, the which tooth I have known proved
at the least.7. or.8. times, for I have a ring made theroff and have used it.

A great secret to help those that are burst or have the Rupture.
THis is rare secret, never known before of any man, and in specially for
those that have not been burst long time, that the Rupture hath not yet made a
callow, and the order to cure it, is thus.

First ye shall give them our Aromatico, every ten days once, and every
morning fasting give them one ounce of fine Tartar beaten in powder with water
or wine to drink, and lyke-wise in the evening two hours before supper give
him as much, and his bread shall be Biscuit made of Rye, also he must wear a
truss made fit for that purpose, and use this remedy.

Rec. Rectified Aqua vitae with-out fleam, ounce xij. Rosen of the Pine tree
that is dry, Ohbanum, Masticke, Sarcocolla, ana ounc. semis. Mix them
altogether, and with this water wash the Rupture every day twice, and then cast
there-on presently the powder of a herb called Bislingua and Balsamina, ana,
and than wet a cloth in the said water, and lay it there-on, and bind the
truss very hard, and keep thy house with as much ease as thou may and
strain not thy self in any wise, and thus with-in.100. days thou shalt help
any great Rupture, keeping the aforesaid order.

A rare secrete and divine, to help those that are troubled with the spleen.
THe Mylte is alterated comes harde, by reason of a superfluous humidity, the
which it receives, by the evil disposition of the liver and lunges, and
therefore if thou wilt help it, it were necessary to use medicines abstersiue
and drying, to give them our Aromatico once, and then to use this electuarye,
the which is of marvelous virtue, in that operation.

Rec. Squamma ferri one ounce, Scolopendria, one ounce, Spignarde, Lapis
Lasuly, ana, two scruples, Sinamon, ounce half, beat them fine and make
thereof an electuary with purified honey, according to art, ther-off take
every morning a spoonful, as much at night, two hours before supper, annoynt
ye place where the Mylte lies, with our Balsamo artificiato, so by the grace
of God and means of these medicines, thou shalt be helped quickly.

A another great secret to help the spleen with great speed
THe Mylt as is a foresaid, is grieved thorough abundance of humidity he
which it receives, and therefore thou must only seek to dry that humidity,
and for that purpose, I will show thee 2. great secreates, where-with thou
shalt work miracles, and are of great reason and experience. The one is to be
let blood under the tongue in one of these 2. veins: that is, on that side
where the Mylte lies, that being done, ye shall take Mustard myxe it with
the urine of a boy, and lay it between two clothes, and lay it on the sore
place one night, and than if it be not well, use it still until it be helped,
for this I have proved an infinite of times.

The cure of a certain Spanyard called, Carabasall di Cordonet the which was
troubled with the Pockes.
THis soldier being of the age ot two and thirty years, was myghtely
troubled with the Pockes with extreme pains and sores, among the which he had
all his thigh so eaten away as though he had been gnawen with dogs, with
most extreme payne, and the way that I cured him was thus. I gave him 12.
grains of our Petra Philosophalle, with Sugar Rosate, the which caused him to
vomyte and to evacuate downe-warde, of the which he found great ease, that
being done, I prepared him our decoction of Lignum sanctum solutiue, the which
is written off hereafter, with a certain drink made with wine and Lignum
vitae, and this he used five and twenty days, and then I anointed, him with
our vnguento Magno, and in the space of forty days he was perfectly helped to
the sight of all men.

The cure of the stytch in the side with retention of vryne.
THere was a certain gentleman called, Marco di Chiuffune of the age of six
and thirty years, the which was troubled with a terrible stytch in the side,
and had proved many medicines none did him pleasure, the which after, I toke
him in hand, I gave him our Aromatico, and after that the pain slacked, than
I caused him to annoynt all those parts with the Oil of Nutmegs, and the Oil
of Eggs mixte together, and so he remained quite whole, for in this order I
have cured an infinite of persons to my great honour.

A cure of a certain Spanyard wounded in the head in Naples.
THere was a certain Spanyard called Zamora, of the age of four and thirty
years, of complexion cholorike and sanguine, the which was wounded in the left
side of the head, with inscicion of the bone, also ye shall understand, that
in Naples the air is most evil for wounds in the head, by reason that it is
so subtle, and for that cuase the doctors did fear the cure, nevertheless I
dressed him with out Magno licore, and Balsamo, artificiato, keeping the wound
as close as was possible, anointing it only upon the wound, and so in
fourteen days he was perfectly whole, to the great wonder of a number, of
Chirurgions of that city.

The cure of a certain gentleman that had Mal di formica.
THere was a certain Gentleman Neapolitan, the which was called Ill signior
Giouan Francisco Gaetauo, of the age of 38. years, the which was marvelously
tormented with a sore arm and a sore leg, called Mall di formica, and he was
of complexion choleric and melancholyke, and these sores went creeping upon
the flesh, healing in one place and breking in another, and in his arm he had
nyne sores, and in the leg fourteen, and this Gentleman had sought help
the space of 2. years could find none, and had twice taken the diet, and yet
could find no help, the which Gentle-man I took in hand, and the first
thing that I gave him was this, one ounce of Gerapigra Galenie with twenty
grains of our Petra Philosophalle, the which provoked both vomit and sege
divers times, that being done, I gave him our Siropo Solutiuo, xij. mornings
together, that being done I gave him a medicine with our Petra Philosophalle
and Eleborus niger, the which caused him also to vomit and purge downe-wardes,
that being done I caused him to make a sirope of Lignum sanctum, and the bark,
Iua Artetica, and Cardus benedictus, in the which I put seven pound of wine,
and one of Sugar, and then I caused him to make a drink with water, wine, and
honey to drink continually, and that I caused him to use five and twenty
days, and then I anointed him with our Vnguento Magno, five times without
fire, the which huguenot caused him to spit a boundance of filthy matter, and
at the last it caused him to spit blood, then I caused him to make a bathe
the which is written in our Regiment of the pestilence, called the joyful
Jewel: I laid on the sores our Cerote Magistralle, and thus with in 38. days
he was perfect whole.

Certain cures that this author did when he travailed into Afryca.
IN the year 1550. he travailed into Africa, and there he was chosen by Il.
S. Don Pietro di Toledo vicere di Napoli, to be Physician unto the camp under
Don Gracia his son, and so in the year.1551, in the month of May he
departed from Naples with all the army of the Emperor, Carolo quinto, D.
Austria, so having a prosperous wind, arrived in Barbary by a certain old
city called Monasterio, and there gave an assiege, took it, with-out any
remissio or rasoming, made slaves of all those that were left alive, and it
remained utterly destroyed, but not with-out great mortalytie of our
Christian soldiers, and beside those that were killed, there was a great
number wounded the which were brought into the Galleys, and carried to the I'll
of Sicilia in a certain city called Trapano, the which say they, was builded
by a great Idolater called Tarpos, and there in the hospital those wounded
persons were left, with certain Chyrurgians that were under my jurisdiction,
with certain medicines of my invention, and so in short time the most part
were help, and then the army returned unto Naples again, and refreshed them
with new men and victual. And then on the.15. of June, we set up sail and
sailed, and when we were in the midst of the goulfe between Naples Palermo,
there happened a great misfortune, the which was thus.

In the Galley of Signor Giordano Captain general of the Galleys of the Duke
of Florence, it happened that he being at the table with diverse captains
gentlemen, as they were at dinner, a certain Captain being grieved with an
other, multiplied words, and took a loaf of bread threw it at his face,
without any reverence or respect of the said General S. Giordano. That being
done, the said General rise from the table took him by the bosom, gave him
5. stocados in the breast the which pierced within the body, and there he fell
for dead, that being done, the said General repented him-selfe of his
rashness, and presently sent for me being in the Gally of Don Gracia, to come
and dress him, and so my General caused me to do with all diligence, and
when I came, this poor Captain lay as though he had been dying,
nevertheless I dressed him with great diligence, and the medicines which I
used were these. First I put in to the wounds, of our Quintaessence, and upon
the wound I dressed it, with ur Balm artificial, and gave him a vomit, the
which caused him to cast great quantity of blood, and then every morning I
gave him half an ounce of our Aqua Balsami, thus within two days after we
arrived at Palermo, the Captain was perfect whole, to the great marvel of a
number. After that we departed from Palermo, and went to the city of Trapano,
where the rest of the galleys were, and there continued.4. days, and then on
Saint Iohns even, we went to an Island called Fanignana, and there kept the
feast of Saint Iohn, and then we departed with all the army, and went on the
side of Africa, and on Saint Peters day we landed in the Gardeins of that
city, and there began to offer battle, and there remaining about.24. or.25.
days, the army began to be infected with a certain kind of flux,
where-off a great number dyed, every day. My Generalll seeing that, called
me, and asked if it were possible to find some remedy for that flux, unto
the which I answered willingly, and said, I would devise by the help of God
some remedy, because it was my duty, as well as for th health of the
soldiers of the Emperor, the which thing I did in short time thorough the whole
camp: as I will write hereafter in the next chapter.

The cure of the flux, where-with I help the Army of the Emperor in Africa.
BEing as I have said before in ye camp, where they were marvelously tormented
with a flux, many dyed there-off, and could find no help, although they had
medicines. Than I which had the experience in hand, began to laugh to my self,
the remedy wherewith I help them all, was this. First, I caused them to eat
well, tha on ye morning, I gave them a vomit, and then every day after they had
eaten, I caused the to go into the water of the Sea, and there to remain 4.
or.5. hours, and so doing with-in.4. or.5. days they were help, for I swear
as I am a Knight, that if I had not been there, the whole army had dyed of that
flux, for of.14. or.15. thousand that were there, there was not left, 2.
thousand but they were infected with tha flux or distemperaunce of the liver,
caused of superfluous heate, the which heate distempers the stomach, causes
ye continual flux: ye shall understand that our vomit doth evacuate the
stomach of the putrified humour, the salt water cools the heat, restrains
the flux, so that by these means they were help.

A goodly remedy found out by me, for wounds in the head.
Wounds in the head, were very perilous in that place, so that if a.100. were
hurt in the head, it was not possible to recover.x. and that came thorough two
things, the which were much contrary in that region, for the day was so hot, yt
it burned all things, and the night to the contrary so extreme cold, that it
was intolerable, not to be credited, so by this disteperance when Craneum was
uncovered that ye air might touch it, presently they dyed without any help,
than I seeing that, began to consider of the matter, desiring to find some
mean to help them, so studying, it came in my memory, that the air was cause
of their death, as it was in troth.

Than presently I commanded all those Chyrurgians that were under my
jurisdiction, yt they should not meddle with any wound in the head without my
presence, the which thing was done, as many as were wounded, the first thing yt
I did in steed of cutting or launcing or discovering, according to the common
order, I joined the parts sowed them close dressed them upon the wound with our
Quintaessence, with Balsamo and Magno licore, and so in short time the most
part were help, and there dyed none so desperate as they did before, and
therefore to my Judgment, this was a good invention, and never used of any
before, and this order of curing is very natural, for Nature doth show it in
herbs, plants, and stones, how that they cannot stand dis united: then much
more our flesh cannot stand dis united, with-out great torment of the
Patient, for until it be joined together again, it is unpossible to be help,
then seeing that is true, it is most natural for the wound to be joined
together, and to use those medicines that where they be applied, will not suffer
the humour to come there-vnto, nor putrefy the place that is hurt, and seeing
it is so, as by experience is seen, we must believe this to be a natural and
most wholesome remedy, so that I affirm that the joining of the parts of the
wound in the head and other parts of the body, is most souereine and of great
satisfaction to the sick, for they never feel payne, nor have no fever nor
other sort of accident, for of those I have cured a great number with good
success.

The cure of one that had his nose cut off, and set on again.
IN that time when I was in Africa, there happened a strange case, and that
was thus.

A certain Gentleman a Spaniard that was called Il Signor Andreas Gutiero, of
the age of.xxix. years, upon a time walked in the field, and fell at words
with a soldier, and began to draw his weapon, the soldier seeing yt,
stroke him with the left hand cut off his nose, and there fell down in the
sand, than I happened to stand by, and took it up, and pyssed thereon to wash
away the sand, and stytched it on again very close, dressed it with our
Balsamo Artificiato, and bound it up, and so let it remain viii. days,
thinking that it would have rome to matter: nevertheless when I did unbind
it, I found it fast conglutinated, then I dressed it only once more, he was
perfectly whole, so that all Naples did marvel there at, as is well known,
for the said S. Andrea doth live yet, and can testify the same.

The cure of an arm of S. Giordano Vrsino.
AT the same time, the said S. Giordano Vrsino, and S. Antamo Sauello Romano,
and S. Astor Baglione, with diverse other, toke their horses, rid about two
miles from the camp, and there perceived certain Mores on horseback, the
which did assault these gentlemen, and one More with his lance, did thrust
thorough the arm from ye elbow through the shoulder, then the said S. Giordino
returned to the camp with great pain, and presently I was sent for, and when
I had seen it I put therein our Quintaessence, and upon the wound I laid our
Balsamo and Magno licore, and bound it strait, and so left it, and in five
days it was whole and sound, and than went to the assault most valyantly, as
many can testify, because he was general of Firenze.

A great chance that happened at the assault in Africa.
AT the same time, there was a Gentleman Florentine that was with ye said S.
Giordano Vrsino, that was called Milllematti, the which fought with his sword
and target, and defended many shot of Calyuers and such like, at the last one
persed his targette, and stroke him upon the breast, and bruised him
marvelously, and yet broke no skin, and there-with all he fell to the ground
for dead, and the caryer of dead men or Becamort, as they call them, would
have buried him in a mine, I then being present caused him to be brought to the
tent of S. Astor Baglione, and there I put our Quintaessece into his mouth, and
that caused the blood to liquifie and come forth at the mouth, and laid upon
his stomach a plaster of Ashes and Oil, as hot as he could abide, and that
I changed morning and evening, and always I gave him of our Quintaessence to
drink, so that in short time he was help, and yet lives in health: and this
was one of the most strangest things that ever I saw, that a pellet of a
Caliver could not break the flesh, and that came by certain words that the
said Millematti did carry written upon his breast, as he persuaded me
afterward for the said. In verbis, in herbis, in lapidibus sunt virtutes, c.

The cure of wounds being poisoned, and of other sorts.
WHile that wars dured in Africa, many times the Christians were poisoned
with venomous Arrows and such like, for the Mores commonly when they fight
against the Christians, they stycke the heads of their arrows in a Squill and
poison it with the juice, and when those arrow heads or other weapon goes
into the flesh of a man, it causes so great burning that it brings Spasmus,
and so in short time they dye. And until this time there hath been no other
medicine found, but to cut away all the flesh that the weapon hath touched, or
else to cauterise it two or three times with a red hot iron, to exstinguish
the venom, but I thorough the grace of God have found the true and perfect way
to help them quickelye and with great ease, and without detriment of the
wounded, and the remedy is this, ye shall put our Quintaessence into the
wound, and lay there-on our Magno licore, the which are two medicines that
kill the poison of the Squille, and therefore if any will prove this to be true:
To see the experience, take a peese of a Squilla, and scratch it with thy nail,
and then put thy finger into thy ear, or scrach any other place that ye may
touch the flesh, and presently thou shalt feel a terribell bourning, and to
quench it, presently take of our Quintaessence, and wash the place therewith,
and presently the payne will cease, and therefore use this as a secrete, for
there-with I have cured a great number.

A remedy found out by me against the poison of a fish.
WHen that I caused so many sick of the flux to go into the sea whereby they
were help, there was a certain kind of fish yt as soon as they touched the
flesh of a man, presently it inflamed and the poison so increased, that in two
or three days, it caused corrosive sores, the which caused many to dye, and
many were stonge with that fish the which never could find help, I than
seeing that desperate case, upon a time visited a young man being a Romaine,
the which was hurt on the coddes and yard, with such a spasmus that it was
wonderful to behold, and having a glass full of my Quintaessence in my hand,
I opened the sore and washed it therewith, and presently the pain ceased, then
afterward I dressed it with an huguenot made of the fat of the fish, so there
with he a great number more were help in short time, and these are secretes of
my invention.

Of the taking of Afrika and his destruction.
IN the year.1551. the 11. of September about the 19. hour the general
asault was given to the city of Africa, and in the space of 2. hours it was
take, and destroyed by the soulders of Carolus Quintus, Emperor, where at was
slain a great number of both parts, and there was such a number hurt that it
was to be wondered at, the which were healed with our Magno licore, and
Balsamo, and when the city was taken and all ended, the Galls remained there
all September, and the fourth of October every man went to serve at their
ports appointed, and so we turned to Naples to pass the Winter, but yet we
remained but a while, for there was occasion to go to Siena, the which rebelled
against the Emperor, so we went with Don Pietro da Toledo the which dyed after
at Firenza, c.

The cure of a great wound on the head.
IN this year.1551. in the month of November, there came unto my house a
Spaniard, the which was called Giouan Ruiz di Zamora, the which had a great
wound over the ear, on the left side that reached half over the head, with
great fracture of the bone, the which I presently stitched with diligence, and
put there-in our Quintaessence, and upon the wound I dressed it with Magno
licore, and Balsamo, and made a gentle ligature with a piece of silk, and sent
him home to his lodging, and commanded him to come again the next day about
the said hour, those that were about me, fell a laughing at my words, and said
that he would dye of that wound, because I let him go forth in the air,
to the which I answered that he might safely go forth, and so the next day
he came again, and I took off the lygament, bu not the cloth, and ther-on I
put of our Quintaessence and Balm, and so in three days I touched it not, and
then I took off the Lygament again, and dressed it upon the cloth, and
let it remain until the.8. day, and then I opened it and took away the
cloth and found the wound so healed that ye could scarce perceive any scarre,
and many said that it was unpossible to be healed, for it would come to
impostumation, nevertheless it remained perfectly whole, for.5.or.6. months
that he remained in that city, in the which time I cured a great number in the
same order that were wounded in the head, to the great wonder of those that
dwelt in Naples, for they count all wounds in the head to be mortal, because
the air is so pestilential, for as soon as it touches the scull it
corrupts the wound.

But using our order thou may safely help them, so that the wound be not
mortal, for by keeping it close shut it is preserved.

A very strange thing that happened in the afore-sayd year.
THere was a certain young Mariner of the age of 26. years, the which was
called, Francisco di Giouanni Raguseo, of the I'll of Mezo, the which being in
fight fell down, and the other that fought with him cut him over the side and
back a handful long, insomuch that a piece of the Milt was cut ouer-thwart,
then he was carried to a Chyrurgian, and he stitched him up, than the next day
I was called, and there I found the wound not well stitched, the which I ripped
up again, and found the belly full of blood, and when I saw that, I caused
diverse to make water, and there-with I washed him, and with taking forth of
the blood, there came a piece of the Milte that was cut, the which I washed,
and gave it to a Mariner that stood by, and the Patron of the ship took it
from him and carried it away, then I stitched him up again and left a little
hole or orifice beneath, where the matter might come forth, and dressed him
with our Quintaessence, with Balsamo, and Magno licore, and in the space of.22.
days he was whole perfectly.

The cure of a Fistoloe in the lower parts.
IN the year.1552. in the month of Marche, I was brought unto a man of the
age of forty years of complexion, choleric, and melencholicke, the which
had a Fistoloe in the lower parts, ye which was of this Nature, that it had
alterated the coddes, the member, and al the parts ther-about, with.xi. holes
infistolated* at the which.xi. he made water with great burning intolerable
pain, which are accident of a fever in manner continual, ye which Patient had
ben taken in hand of diverse none could do him pleasure. Than the first thing
that I did, I gave him our Aromatico, that being done, I gave him.xij. days
together our Quintaessencia solutiuo, that being done, I gane him a quantity
of our Electuario Angelica, a then he used one of my secrets, the which I will
not write in this place, that being done I caused him to spit with one of my
confections, written heere-after, and so by these means he was perfectly
whole.

Of many that I cured in Naples.
IN that time that I remained in the famous City of Naples until yt year.1555.
in ye Month of February, then I thought it good to go to Rome where at this
time I cure a number of persons, have help so many by the help of God, the
which if I should record them it would be sufficient to fill a great volume, for
there came such a number to my door, that the people wondered ther-at, with.4.
medicines compounded by me, I help in manner all of every disease, the
medicines were these, one Pil made with our Petra philosophile, Elbero negro,
Olio di sulpho, Olio dimelle, mixed with marchpane, made in pills. The second
remedy was soluble pills, made with Aloe hepatico, Colloquintida, Siena, oil
of vitrioll, made in paste with sugar, common honey, The third remedy was a
unction, made with Sage, Rosemary, Worme-woode, Few, Mint. Nutmegs, Cloves,
Cinnamon, Mastick, Frankecense, Terpentine wax with common oil. The.4. remedy
was our Quintaessence, these.4. remedies, I gave unto those people to help
their griefs: I willed the yt took these medicines to eat well of good meats,
so always they praised these medicines, the which was not without great
reason, because ye pills first evacuate ye stomach of al impedimets, a leaves
nature eased, ye second pills evacuate ye body of the corrupptio.

The Unction comfort the stomach, and helps digestion, and mitigateth
the payne. The Quintaessence comfort the stomach, causes good digestion,
purifieth the blood, and comfort the head, so that be these aforesaid
reasons, ye may understand that these four remedies may help against al
indispositions inwardly, and for cause of those remedies those people honour me
like a Prophet, and always have had me in great reverence, as lunge as I
remained among them.

A cure of Vlcera putrida, the which was in the arm.
IN the year afore-sayd in the month of August, there came to my hand a
certain Gentleman of the Imbassadours of Portingall, that was called, Il
signor Iari, a man of the age of.32. years of complexion melancholyke: the
which had a putrified ulcer about the left shoulder, that he had carried above
three years, and was a big as a hand, and very deeps the which could not be
healed of the common Chyrurgians, nor yet be eased of his payne, than I
reasoning with this Gentleman, told him that the cause of that sore, was
corrupt and putrified blood, and by that means the ^yuer received evil
qualities, and that if he would be help, the cause must be removed, the which
was hard to be done, because the blood must be evacuated a little, and then
the stomach must be evacuated of moyste matter that offends it, and
hinders digestion of the meat, and will not suffer good blood to engender,
than it will also be necessary to evacuate the body downwards, that the
corruption sends no up his vapors to the upper parts of ye body, and hinder
the cure of the ulcer, al this being done, it were necessary to evacuate the
humour between the skin and the flesh; by sweat, so that all the parts of
the body may remain purified, and so by these means the ulcer may easily
mundifie, incarnate, and scicatrise, and shall be a perfect cure, to the which
thing the Gentle-man was willing, for he had as willingly dyed as lived, and
so in the name of GOD I took him in hand, and the first thing that I gave him
was a vomit that purged the stomach, and took away great part of his
pain: then I purged him with our Quintaessencia Solutiuo, eight days
together, that being done I made him a fomentation, that caused him to sweat
well, and to spit abundance, than I caused him to be let blood under the
tongue, and then I anointed all the ulcer with our Causticke, the which
mortified all the filthiness therein, and then I dressed it with Magno licore,
and our cerote Magistralle, and so with these remedies in short space the said
Gentle-man was cured, to the great marvel of the said Ambassador, and all
those that saw it, by reason of that cure came another of the same house unto
me called Il seignor diego Iaimes the which was troubled with a difficulty of
urine, the which troubled him mightily, the which I gave three times our Petra
Philosophalle, and once the juice of Elder barks, and he was help: I cured
another in the same house of a fever with our Oil of Honey, and with Balsamo:
The Ambassador like wise being troubled with the gout, willed me to take him
in hand ye which I did, and cured him so that in three years after which I
continued in Rome he never felt pain, and of these cures I help an infinite
in Spain, as is well known to the inhabitants thereof.

The cure of ethesia in the beginning.
I^ ^he year 1555. in the month of Marche, there came to my hands a young
man of Milayne the which was a painter, of the age of five and twenty years,
the which was fallen into a spice of etisie, and did spit much blood with a
continual fever, the which I cured in this order.

First I let him blood under the tongue on the right side, and after that I
gave him a quantity of our Aromatico with Plantaine water, because the bleding
takes away the superfluous blood of the breast, the which nature sends
forth by it self, and the Aromatico with Plantayne water is cold and dry,
which are most necessary for that disease, for they evacuate the stomach,
repercute and mittigateth yt alteration, those things being done, I caused him
to use our Quintaessence solutiue to evacuate the body in respect of the
putrification already conceived with-in the intestinalles, also I caused him
to use the Quintaessence of the flower of flowers, and I anointed his stomach
with Magno licore, and also he used our Electuarie of Althea, and so by these
means he was help perfectly.

The cure of a certain man wounded in thirteen places.
IT happened that a certain man called Alessandro Oresice, was wounded before
my lodging in 13. places, and there fell for dead, and then by a certain
friend was brought into my lodging, and there I laid him upon a table and
took of his clothes, and sowed all those wonndes which were to be sowed or
stitched, and dressed him with our Quintaessence, and Balsamo, and Magno
licore, and our secrete powder, and so by those means in 15. days he was
perfect whole.

Of remedies that help many diseases.
THere are diverse and sundry diseases, and they be help with divers and
sundry medicines, therefore I will make a note only of those the which are
most used.

And first I will write of those remedies that help the fevers of all sorts,
the which are these, the sirope of Burrage, Buglos, Endiue, Cicory, Hoppes,
Fumitori, Rhabarb, Cassia, Scamony, Sine, Barlye water, sirope of Scytrones,
and such like.

The remedies that help the pockes are these, Aloes, Coloquintida, Turbit,
Hermodactilis, Scamony, Precipitate, Oriola, Oliuella, the unction of Mercurie,
Lignum sanctum, Cina, Salsa perilla, the perfume of Scinaber, a stoue of
herbs, our Ceroto Magistralle, and such like things, those remedies that
help the cough, are Enula Campane, Garlic, Sulfure, Honey, Lapaciolle, the
Oil of Sulfure, and such like, those remedies that help the scabs are the
juice of Aureola, Sulfure, Litarge, Aqua Realle, Roch Allome, those that are
troubled with pains in the body, may use Genciane, Nutmegs, Dictamus albus,
Euphorbio, those that are wounded shall use Terpentine, our Balsamo, Magno
licore, Aqua Balsamo, Elixer vitae, Ceroto magistralle, Oil of Hiperconie of
our invention, and such like: Those yt prouok urine, are yt flowers of Mallows,
Alcakegi, Hogs lise, Cantarides, such like, therefore I will not trouble you
further because I have written sufficiently in my other books in sundry
places, and hereafter I will write of divers, and sundry medicines of our
invention never found out a fore of any man.

Here begins the order to make diverse and sundry medicines of our
invention, never found out before by any man. And first to make our Petra
Philosophalle, that helps against all manner of diseases that happens unto
man or woman, or any other animal terestryall.
THere hath always been a great questioning among the Philosophers, whether
that one medicine might help against all diseases or no. The which I affirm,
and will approve with sufficient reason that the Petra Philosophalle made of our
invention, may help against al the infirmities that comes unto mans body,
and two only reasons I will show thee with brevity, the first of them is
this, that all sorts of infirmities have their Original and beginning of the
stomach, and to know the troth ye may see manifestly, that if the body be
never so little infermid the stomach is also grieved: For ye may see how the
anymalles terestryall, never help themselves of other infirmity than of the
stomach, and when they will help themselves, they eat herbs, the which
causes them to vomit, and this doth signify that they have no other
infirmity, than the aforesaid, so by ye experience of ye animalles I approve
that the infirmity is caused of the stomach, and this is the first reason.
The second is, that all the medicines, where in our Petra Philosophalle is
put, as soon as they are come into the stomach, it draws unto it, all the
evil humours of the stomach, and also of the whole body, and mixes with
them, and so Nature sends them forth by vomit or by sege, or both, and so
the stomach shall be evacuated of that matter, and the body remain free from al
impediments of infirmities, so that by this reason I affirm, that our Petra
Philosophalle may help against all sorts of infirmities, and to know the
troth, I have proved it by experience, in all manner of infirmities, and
always have found it to do much good unto al men, and hurt none unto my
knowledge, and the order to make this Petra Philosophalle, is thus.

Rec. Sal niter, Rock allome, Vitrioll Romayne, of each two pound.

First dry the Vitrioll in a earthen pan, and then beat it to powder, and
mix it with the other matters, and put there-vnto four ounces of Sal gem,
then put it in a goord with his head, a receiver, well luted, and distill it in
a wind furnace, so that ye may make fire with wood, and at the first make
small fire, and so increase it according to Art, and always lay wet clothes on
the head and receiver, and that thou shalt do because the spirits of the
water shall not fly away. Ye shall understand that in the beginning of of
your distillation, the Receiver will wax red like blood, and then turn
white, and at the last, when ye give it strong fire, it will turn red
again, and those are the pure spirits of the Aqua fortis, and then at the
end, the Receiver will turn white again, then it is ended, then let it wax
cold, and then keep it in a Glass close shut, to make our Petra
Philosophalle.

Than take Mercury. lib. 1. Quick lyme, ounces.6. Soap, ounces.4. Common
ashes, ounces.3.

Mix them together in a mortar of stone, then put them into a Retort, and
distil it with a strong fire until all the Mercury be come forth into the
receiver* then take it forth, and keep it in a glass, to make thy
composition, the which is made thus.

Rec. The water that thou made first, and put it into a goord of glass being
well luted, and then put in thy Mercury that thou did distill before. After
that, take Steel in thin plates, ounce.1. Iron also in thin plates, ounce.2.
Fine Gold in leaves, the weight of two French crowns, and put them altogether
in the glass, presently set on the head, for it will begin to boyle, and
cause red fumes like blood, the which thou shalt receive in a receiver, and
presently set thy glass in the Furnace and give it fire until all the water be
come forth with the fume. Them let it cool, and keep that water close in a
glass, then break ye other glass that stood in the fire, and in the bottom
thou shalt find our Petra Philosophalle, the which thou shalt grind finely,
and scarce it in most fine powder, and then wash it well with Vinegar
distilled, and dry it again, and at the last wash it with Rose-water, and
dry it very well, stirring it continually over the fire, then keep it as a
precious Jewel close in a Glass.

For the order to use it, I will write heere-after, in sundry places: Ye shall
understand that the water the which ye distilled away from the stone, will
serve for the same purpose again: But ye must take but half the quantity of
the afore-sayde matters, and when ye have distilled it again from the stone,
ye shall preserve it, for an infinite number of purposes, as I will show thee
heere-after.

To make our Balm artificial, with the order to use it, and wherefore it
serves.
THis Balsamum hath all the virtues of the natural Balm, although not in
qualytie, yet in virtue, and the order to make it is thus.

Rec. Venice Turpentine, pound.1. Oil of Baize, that is perfect with-out
mixture, ounces.4. Galbanu, ounc. 3. Gum Araby, ounc. 4. Olibanum, Mirrha
elect, Gum hedera, of each, ounces.3. Lignum Aloes, Galingal, Cloves,
Consolida minore, Cinnamon, Nutmegs, Zedoaria, Ginger, Diptamnum album, of each,
ounce 1. Musk of Leuant, Ambergres, of each one dram.

Beat all those afore-sayd things together, put them into a Retort of glass
well luted, and put there-to.6. pound of Rectified Aqua vitae with-out fleam,
and so let it stand viij. days, and then distil it by sand, and there will
come forth a white water mixed with oil, and so keep thy fire small, until
there come forth a blackish Oil, then change thy receiver, and set thereto
an other, and increase thy fire until all the spirits be come forth, than
seperate the Oil from the black water, keep them by themselves, the like
shall ye do by the first water. The first water that is white, is called Aqua
del Balsamo, and the Oil separated from that is called, Oleum del Balsamo. The
second water that is black is called Matter Balsami, and the Oil separated
from that water, is called Balsamo artificiato, the which would be kept as a
precious Jewel.

The first water is most excellent to clear and preserve the sight of the
eyes, also the face being washed ther-with, it makes it very fair, preserves
it youthfully, it keeps back age, it breaks the gravel in the reins, and
provokes urine the which is stopped (...) is our Aromatico, because it
euacuateth the stomach by vomit, and the body downward, and his operation
is such, that it doth in manner help any crude sort of infirmity, and the
quantity is from one drame, to two drames, and may be taken in broth, in wine,
in water, or mix it with any pills, or pocion, giving you charge, that when
ye put it in any pocyon that ye leave none in the bottom, of the cup where
ye drink it out, because the Petra Philosophalle is heavy, and will remain
in the bottom, for if that remain it will not work at all, giving you also
charge that the said day that ye give this medicine, that ye let the patient
drink as much crude water as the will, and give them little meat to eat that
day, and this is the order to use this medicine.

To make our Electuario Angelico, and the order to use it, and in what
diseases.
ELectuario, Angelico romano, is so called, because it was compounded of me in
the city of Rome, in the time of the Pope Paulo quarto, and because this
composition works sodeinelye, I called it Angelico, and is most excellent
against many diseases, it is good against all sorts of fevers, giving it
Perminoratiuo, and for the stitch in the side it is most rare, because it
takes away the viscocitie in the stomach, and opens the powers, and is good
against the gout, for if they take it every third day once, in ten days they
shall be hope, it is also good against the cough, Cattar, and for the Mylte, and
for those that have ye pocks, or the running gout, and such like influences,
and the order to make it is thus.

Rec. Safran, Lignum alleos, Sinamon, red Coral ana three drames, Elleborus
niger, without preparation, two ounces Electuario de succo rosarum, Mesue, that
is not too much boiled, vi. ounces, Sugar rosate viii. ounces, Musk of Leuant
one drame, Petraphilosophalle three ounces, our Quintaessence, of wine, two
ounces, purified honey as much as will suffice to make it in form of a
Lectuary, mix them on a small fire in an earthen pan, and when it is made,
keep it in a vessel of glass, for any other vessel will not be good: This
Electuary ye may mix with any sollible medicine, but ye must take it fasting,
the quantity is from two drames to four drames. Ye shall understand yt this
in manner revives the dead by his great virtue, as hath been seen many
thousand times, in Venice, in Rome, most worthy of memory, and therefore if any
Physician desire to get fame in the world, let them use our Electuario
Angellica, the which works miracles on the earth.

Of the vigitable stone, of our Invention, to transemute a body of one
complexion into another, and to make him sound for ever.
THe way to make the vigitable stone is rare, and his virtues are infinite, and
without comparison, the cures that are done therewith are so miraculous, that
the world will not believe them, although it be the mere troth, and the
order to make it is thus.

Rec. Tartar of white Wine that is thick and shining, Turpentine that is
clear and pure: The herb called Alloes that hath leaves as long as an arm,
and dented on both sides, and some cal it semper viue, take of each of these one
pound, and stamp them together, and put them into a vrynal with a head and
receiver, and distyll them in a wine furnes until all the substance be come
forth, then take the fesses out of ye glass and grind them with the said
water, and then distill them as thou did before, and always at the last
give it a strong fire that the fesses may remain well burnt, then take out
the fesses again and grind them with the water as thou did first, and
distill it again, and this thou shalt do 15. or twenty times, until all that
water be consumed, yt the fesses remain white like salt, then lay that fesses
on a smooth stone in a moist place, and it will turn into water, the which keep
in a glass close shut, and that is the water of the vigitable stone, the
which water is of so much virtue, that one scruppell there-of being put into
ij. ounces of Iulepe of Violettes, and given to drink to any that is infirmed
or evil complexcionated, in less then four and twenty days he shall be help
of any griuous discase, and this must be taken in the morning fasting when the
stomach is empty, for than it works better his operation.

This is also an excellent remedy against ye worms, giving it in the a
fore-saide manner, it mundifieth the Liver, and dries ye humidity of yt
Mylte, it dissolveth the cough, and Cattares, it provokes vryne where it is
let, with divers other virtues, the which I will let pass until another
time, for if I should write them all, they would not be credited, and
there-fore we Physicians should not rest to practise in all things that
seems to us convenient, and I promise thee truly that he which shall
occupy this thing, shall work miracles on the earth, and win great fame
and honour. Ye shall understand that this is the stone that the Philosophers
have long sought to fix their medicine mineral, so that making the proiection
they join the medicine with metalling bodies, and not to go away in sum,
because this stone resists all great fires with-out consuming, and sixeth
Sulfure and Orpiment, so that they shall abide the fire, makes them white, if
ye make proiection there-with on Copper, or on Latin, it will turn it into
the whiteness of pure silver, that I have seen with my eyes, so that ye may
see of what importance this vigitable stone is, the which works such goodly
transmutations, as well in mettallyng bodies, as in humain bodies, and
therefore it is to be accounted off, because it may save the life of many that
use it in their medicines.

Our solyble syrup with the order to use it.
SOlyble siropes made in decoction are very wholesome and of great faculty,
specially in the crudite of humours, and the reason is this: because it
disperses the matter, and euacuateth it with great ease, and without danger
or trouble of the Patient, and the order to make it is thus.

Rec. Sage, Rosemary, Wormwood, Cicory, Cardus sanctus, Nettels, Organy, of
each a handful. Figs, Raisons, Dates, sweet Almonds, Sal gem, ana ounc. 4.
Coloquintida, Aloes hepatica, Cinnamon, Mirabolani citrini, ana ounc. 2. Common
honey, two pound.

Stamp them all grosely, and put them to infuse in eighteen pounds of fair
water, then boyle it till half be consumed, then strain it, and distill it by
a filter, and aromatise it with two caretes of Musk and a pint of Rose-water,
and then it is made, the which ye shall keep in a bottle of glass close
stopte, the quantity is from four ounces to six ounces.

In Winter you shall take it very warm. And in the Spring and Autumn, ye
shall take it but warm. In Summer ye shall take it cold, for this purges the
gross humours of the body, and hurts not the stomach, ye may use it in a
fever.4. or 5. days together, and it will help it. In cruditie of humours, as
the French Pockes, Goutes, Cattares, Doglie Artetiche, and such like matters,
where there is no accident of Fever, ye may take it.x. or.xv. days together,
cannot hurt by any means, for it purges most excellent, it is given against
the Cough, against flux of the urine, pains in the head, and carnositie in
the yard, for the Hemerhodes, and in sum it is good against al diseases
caused of corrupt humours, for it hath such virtue, that it draws from al
parts, and euacuateth the humours intestinall, for of this Syrup I have had
great experience, in such persons as were in manner banished and had lost their
taste, and presently using this, they came to good temperature, and I have used
it an infinite number of times, in persons that were ulcerated, and full of
sores, evil bandeled of Fortune, and of the infirmity, and finding no means
to cure them as they should be, I gave them this Sirop fourteen or fifteen
days, and then they were cured, with a number of other things the which would
be too long to write, and therefore I would wish every one to use this, not
only in the afore-sayd matters, but in all other diseases.

Our Siropo magistrale Leonardo, the which sarueth against an infinite number
of diseases, and is a rare medicine.
THis Sirop is solutiue, and very pleasant to use, and can-not hurt in any
wise, the which is seldom seen in other medicines, and the order to make it
is thus.

keep it in a temperate place, and this you must take warm, the quantity is
from two ounces to four ounces, and it is a most safe medicine to be used
with-out keeping of any diet. It helps those much that have Pellaria,
scabs, Hemerhodes, and such like diseases, and may be given unto a woman with
child, with-out any danger, when she shall have occasion to use any.

Our Sirop against the melancholic humour, and specially where there is
ventositie in the stomach.
IT were necessary for those that will make this syrup, to be expert in the
Art, for it would be made with great diligence, and the order to make it is
thus.

Rec. Water of Fumitorie, of Hoppes, of Wormwoode, of Maiden hair, of each
five pound. Then with this water thou shalt make a decoction with these things
that follow.

four hours, for this purges meruaylouslye the melancholycke humours and all
other gross humours, and dissolveth wind, and comfort the heart, c.

Our Potion of Lignum Sanctum, the which is miraculous to dissolve crude, and
malygne humours, with the order to use it, in the French Pockes, and such like
diseases.
Because the Pocks is a disease contagious, putrified, and corrupt, and works
many evil effects, as I have written in my Caprici medicinalle, therefore it
were necessary to prepare most excellent and rare rememdies to dissolve the
same, which medicines are infinite.

But in this Chapter I will write one, that purges the crude and viscous
humours downe-wards, and doth assuttiliate the gross humours, and dries al
sorts of subtle humours that offend Nature and sends them forth by sweat,
it dries the melancholic humour, and dissolveth choler, and is most wholesome
for those that are troubled with that disease, because it dries much and
dissolveth the disease, with many other good effects, as by experience thou
may see, and the order to make it is thus.

Rec. The bark of Lignum sanctum grosely beat pound.1. and lay it to steep
in xiiij. pound of fair water 24. hours, then boyle it until four pounds
be consumed, then put there to, Pollypody of the Oak, two ounces, Cicory one
handful, Aloes epatike four drames, and let them boyle for an hour: Then put
thereunto the leaves of Syue, Epitemum, ana, ounce 1. Coloquintida, drame 6.
Sugar, ounce 8. the let it boyle till half be boiled away, and that there
remain pound 7. then strain it, and put it in a glass with 12. grains of
Musk, and keep it very close stopped, and this is the sirope the which ye shall
take twice a day, that is morning and evening, then make this drink following
ye which shall be ye common drink at all times, to your meat.

Rec. One pound of Lignum sanctum, Raspead, and steep it in x. pounds of whit
wine that is ripe, and let it boil an hour, the put thereto xv. poud of fair
water let boyle a little more, and then strain it, and keep it in a glass
bottle, for this is to be used all they day time, and the order to use these is
thus. First when any feels himslefe grieved with the pocks or any such like
disease, he must keep his bed at the least xx. days, and use to take of the
first sirope or pocyon every morning a good draft being as warm as he may
suffer it, than keeuer him well with clothes that he may sweat as much as he
can, then take off the clothes by little and little, and dry him with warm
clothes, so let him repose for two hours, and then let him eat and his meat
must be dry, as Biscote, rost-meate, Raysons of the Sun, Almonds, and sometime
a raw egg, his drink at meals,a and al the day beside shall be the last made
with wine water, the at night give him of the first sirope as ye did in ye
morning, cause him to sweat, then dry him, and this order thou shalt use xx.
days together not coming forth of thy chamber, by the grace of God thou shalt
be help of any such griuous infirmity, as I have scene ye experience thereof an
infinite of times, to my great honour, for it may be occupied in all
complexions, with safety, as by the ingredience thou may see.

A most marvelous water rare, to cause a man to avoid the gravel in urine, and
to mundifie the raynes.
THe gravel int he raynes of the back is caused, and ingedred of great heate,
drynes in those parts, as thou may plainly see by those which are troubled
therewith, for heir raynes is so hot yt they cannot abide any heavy garment to
lye there-on, and they always make their water with great pain burning:
therefore if thou wilt help that infirmity, it were necessary to refrigerate
the raynes and moisten it with good juice, take away that burning of ye urine,
so in that order the patient shall be help, and this thou may do in short
time, and with great ease with this remedy.

To make the water of Lignum sanctu, most wholesome against the pockes with a
new order.
COmmonly they use to take the water of Lignum sanctum, against the pockes, the
which surely is most wholesome, but it must be taken in good order and form,
and must be made with great discretion, and not as they use it now adays, for
they give it some 3. or 4. times, never the better, although the wood be
sufficient enough to help themm and therefore I would wish every one yt will
use this water to take it in such order as it ought to be, the which I will show
thee hereafter.

Rec. Lignun sanctum Rasped small, pound 1. ye bark being beaten..3. infuse
them in 12. pounds of fair water one night, the next morning put therein li.
1. of honey, the which is put in, because it is aparatiue warm, a helps to

a glass bottle, for this is ye common drink to drink all ye day long, ye
order to take it is thus: first before ye will take this water it were necessary

in this order, take in the morning at the appering of ye day, ounce 8. very

2. hours, then dry him with warm clothes, and so let him remain 2. hours,
the give him to eat, his meat shall be Biscote, Raysons, Almonds, sometime a
little rost-meate, and no other: then in the evening about the 22. hour, ye
shall give him the said sirope as ye did in the morning, neither more nor
less, and cause him to sweat, and about the 24. hour give him only Biscote
and Raysons, and the other common drink that was made last, giving you warning
that ye make this drink fresh every third day, because it shall not hurt the
stomach, and every week once ye shall take a pil of Mart millitare, and that
day thou shalt eat birds flesh, because of weakening, also ye shall take very
great heed to one thing, yt is this, if it happen tha at the beginning of this
cure, there comes a fever or other accydent unto the patient, that in any
wise ye leave not the cure, but follow the order, for that is a certain sign
of health, for many times I have given this water and unto some in the fourth or
5. day the fever came, and tarried many tames, x. or xij. days, and the the
fever went away with the corrupt disease, and all for company, and so in short
time they were cured, so that as I have said before when that syne appears,
is delivered it is a certain sign of health: Also I will advise thee of
another thing, and that is this, if the patient cannot sweat, ye shall
annoynt him all over with the Oil of Quinces, the which will cause him to sweat
a pace: For without sweat the cure will not be perfect, and this order thou
shalt keep at the least forty days together, within the chamber so that
there come no air in, for it will hinder the cure.

it mundisteth all sorts of sores, and helps al wounds with-out payne. It
causes a good memory, it helps the cough, and makes the hart merry, with
diverse other virtues, yt which I leave to ye experimenter.

A compounds Oil against poison, the which is of a marvelous virtue.
IF thou wilt help those that are poisoned, it were necessary to have remedies
of such virtue, that are apt to the solution of the poison, for the poison
works those three effects, as is said before, in the Chapter of the effects
of poison, where-in it is written, how that it is necessary to keep the blood
lyquid, so that it congeal not in the veins, and lyke-wise to let or stay
that water which comes to the stomach, and to let that alteration or
inflammation, as we may term it. And all these operations, are necessary to be
done with most excellent Remedies, in the which there enters part of poison,
for the Proverb saith, that one poison kills an other, and that I will
approve in this Chapter, and the order to make this composition is thus.

Rec. The oldest Oil that thou can find, pound one. Aloes hepatica,
^liabarbaro, Spico nardo, Mirrha, Tormentillae, Dictanum album, Gentiana,
Bistort. Consolida magore, Rubia di tintory, ana,. half. Theriaca,
Methridato, ana, three drams, quick Scorpions to the number of 60. First put
the quick Scorpions into the Oil, let it boyle in Balneo, Marie 4. hours
than put thereunto the other matters, let them boyle altogether other four
hours, then strain it keep it in a vessel of glass close shut, for truly
this is a divine Oil for that accident, in the which ye see enters
Scorpions, the which are venomous, and yet his poison is wholesome for those
that are poisoned.

The like ye may see by those that are burnt with fire, for ye best medicine
that they can find is to burn that place again: Also ye may see that when
great quantity of blood comes forth of a wound, the Surgeon presently
lets him blood in another place to turn ye same. Seeing the yt these are
true, it is also true, yt one poison doth kill another poison. And by this
reason I approve, yt if ye exstingush the poison it were necessary to be done
with his kind, neuer-thelesse it must be prepared so that the matter be not
altered, and become hurtful unto the poisoned person, the order to use this
Oil against poison is thus.

When that a man is poisoned presently annoynt all his body with this Oil, and
give him thereof to drink two drames with white wine Vinigar, morning and
evening, and God willing thou shalt help any poison be it never so strong: It
he be poisoned with Subblimate, or a Diamond, this remedy will not be good
because they are not poisons, but are deadly mineralled, the which by no
means can be digested or their evil effect mitigated. Therefore when one is
poisoned with Subblimate, his remedy is no otherwise, but to make him bathes of
Vinegar, and let him drink milk enough, and eat butter, and drink Siero.

For this is the true remedy, as for an example when that a sore is mortified
with a rottorye made of Subblimate, or Arsenicke, presently it causes great
altealteration, for the which there is no excellenter remedies than Vinegar,
Butter, and Milk: Than seeing yt these remedies are so profitable to be used
outwardly there is no doubt but that they will do the same effect inwardly:
Also it would be necessary to cause them to vomit every day once at the
least, to keep the stomach evacuated of that matter, so that it come not to
choke the infected person, or infect the sinews, so that the party remain not
lame, for a long time after as is daily seen in diverse places.

A marvelous Soap that helps those which cannot spyt but with great pain.
THis composition is called Saponea nostra, because it is made of Soap, but not
of that Soap the which is in the Apothicaries shopes in Venice, but this is a
confection, the which being eat every morning a little quantity, it helps
those that spit with pain, it opens the stomach, and breaks that evil
matter contained therein, and casts it forth at the mouth with the spyttle,
and so leaves the patient well disposed and merry, and the order to make it is
thus.

Rec. White Venice Soap, and beat it in powder,. 1. pure Maisticke 2. drams,
Sinamon, Licores, ana, one drame, fine Sugar as much as will suffice to make it
in tables according to art, yt which are most strange, nevertheless marvel
not there at for I will show the reason, so that every one shall be satisfied.

Ye shall understand that the first ingredience being the Soap, is made with
the Lye of Soda and Calkes, the which things do dry and mundifie al sorts of
Vlcere Sordide, and cools them: Also there in is Oil Olyfe, the which is one
of the most excellentest licours in the world, for this of it self is able to
cut that matter from the stomach, and to mundifie it, than in this compound
there is Masticke, the which is most excellent for the stomach, and draws
down from the head, than the lycoures, and Sinamon are aparatiue comfort
the stomach, so that all these being mixed together, of force it must help
against these infirmities of the breast, and the quantity thereof is from.2.
drams to half ounce.

To make the Quintaessence of Honey.
THis Quintaessence hath all the virtues of the Quintaessence of wine, and is
made in this order, is rather to be counted a divine remedy than human.

Rec. The purest Honey that ye can get, the which is not mixed with any thing
2. pound, and put it into a gowrd of glass, with his head and receuer close
luted, and give it first a gentle fire until there appear certain white
feumes in the head, the which will turn into a red water, by laying of
clothes wet in cold water, upon the head and receiver, than keep in thy fire
according unto art until al the substance be come forth the which thou shalt
keep in a glass close shut, and in short time it will turn into the cooler
of a Rubyne, than distill it vii. times in Balneo mary, and it will leese his
red colour, and be of a very pleasant smell, and remain in the cooler of gold,
and this Quintaessence dissolveth gold makes it potable, and also all manner
of Jewels that is put therein, also if ye give two or 3. drams to any that lye
a dying, presently it will recover him again, as the Quintaessence of Wine
doth: If ye wash any wound or sore therewith it will heal it quickly: It is
good against the cough, cattar, and pains of the Mylt, and many other sorts
of diseases the which I will not write at this time, for few or none will
believe his great aparation or virtue. If ye distill it 20. times with fine
Silver, it will restore the sight unto those that are almost blind. Moreover I
have given this 46. days unto one that had the Palsy and he was help
quickly.

It helps also the falling sickness, and preserves the body from
putrefaction, so that by these means we may see that it is a celestial remedy
given unto us by the almighty God, and therefore I would wysh some virtuous
men to take a little pains in making of this precious liquore, and they shall
see such wonders thereof that the world will marvel there at, as I have
proved many times, to my great honour and profit of the patient. For many
times I have given it the sick that no man did see me, and presently they
thought I had wrought by enchantment by reason of his great virtue, and
therefore all men that profess Physic and Surgery, ought to be provided
of this liquor and such like for their commodity, and profit of the patient.

To make our Elixer vitae, or Aqua Caelistis.
THis Elixer vitae is a medicine of such virtue and strength yt it helps in
manner against all diseases that comes to mans body, for those that are hot
it coleth, and those that are cold it warms, and that it doth by his proper
quality and virtue, for this I have proved a thousand times, and have used it
against sundry diseases, and always have had good success, and the order to
make it is thus.

Rec. Ginger, Zedoaria, Gallingal, Long Pepper, round Pepper, Iunipyr berries,
Citron peeles, Orage peeles, Sage, Basil, Rose-mary, Mint, Margerome, Bay
berries, Penyrial, Gentian, Callamint, the flowers of Elders, red Roses and

Musk of Leuant, one dram. Fine sugar, pound.4.

Mix them altogether, and infuse them in five pound of pure Aqua vitae
with-out fleam, and so let it stand.8. days, than distil it in Balneo Mariae,
until the fesses remain dry, then take that, and sercolate it in a Pellicane,
in horse dounge.40. days, the take the glass with the fesses, and distill it
in sand, until all the substance become forth, the which will be red like
blood, and stinks of the fire, and is thick, the which must be sercolated
as the first, and this is the fiery part, the which is of marvelous virtue,
insomuch that it revives those that are at the point of death, therefore I
will write of some of his virtues, yt which I have proved.

The first water distilled by Balneo, being taken every third day one dram,
preserves the body in prosperous state, and defends from many sorts of
diseases. It helps all sorts of wounds, if ye wash them therewith.3. or.4.
times, and is most excellent against all impediments in the eyes, if ye put
there-in one drop and preserves the sight a long time, so that ye shall not
need to wear spectacles. If a young woman doth wash her face there-with
oftentimes, it preserves her a long time in that state. If ye use to drink
this Elixer it provokes Venerous ades, and disposes women to be delyued with
diverse other virtues, yt which I leave to the experimenter.

The last water the which is red, is excellent good against the pains of the
mother if it be drunk. It dissolveth also the Plurissie, if ye give ther-off
two drams and annoynt the parts grieved there-with. It helps the pains of
the Collyke, and hardness of the Milte.

It is also good against pains in the teethe and stinking breath, and many
such like things. It helps all manner of Fevers, and the reason is, because
it dries up all the evil humours that offends Nature as well with-in as
with-out, so by this reason it is apt to help all sort of diseases. If any
were sick could not speak, let him take one dram of this, with one dram of
the first, and presently he shall speak most miraculous to see, for this I
have proved a thousand times to my great honour and content of the Patient, and
therefore I would wish all those that profess Physic or Surgery to be
prepared of this liquor, and such like, for their own profit, and health of
their neighbour.

To make Aqua Real vel Imperiale, the which makes the teeth white presently,
incarnateth the goumbes, and causes a good breath.
THe teeth being black rusty and full of filth, and the goumes putrified or
corrupt, are the w^ things that may be seen in man or woman, and ar^ very
unwholesome, and the remedy to make the teeth white and to help the goumes,
is thus. Make this water, and use it in the order as I will show thee.

ye mouth, to incarnate ye goumes, to make ye teeth white, causes a good breath
in those which are troubled with the aforesaid matters. For of this water I
have made great quantity: hath ben carried into Spain, into Almany, into
Poland, into Constantinople, in diverse other countries, as though it had been a
divine thing, and not material.

For truly his experience doth cause the world to wonder at it, the use
heere-off I have written in this book, and heere-after I will write it again
in some of my-bookes where occasio shall serve to use it in cures.

A kind of Pill most convenient for the eyes and comfort the stomach.
THose Pills which comfort the stomach, by force must help the sight, for
when the stomach is filled with maligne humours, it distempers those parts
that are about it, and the fumes that ascend up to the head, moysteneth Nerui
optici of the eyes, and by this cause the eyes are offended, therefore it were
necessary for those Pills that help the eyes also to comfort the stomach, the
which must be done by, euacuating the matter hanging by vomit, and the order to
make these Pills, is thus.

Rec. Marchpane made with sugar almonds, dram.1. Petra Philosophalle grain. 10.
Elleborus niger. grain. 6. Diagridij.3. grains, Mix them well in a mortar in
form of a paste, and make there-off.5. Pills, and those thou shalt take in
the morning fasting, for they are of so much force and strength that they help
not only the eyes and stomach, but in manner all diseases, because they
cleanse the stomach, and evacuate the body, the which two things are most
necessary in all diseases.

A discourse upon a composition that preserves a man or woman in health a long
time.
IF thou wilt make a pass that shall have virtue to preserve whole bodies, and
to help the sick, it were necessary to look out simples that have virtue to
do it, and when thou hast found out those drugs that have virtue to preseue,
thou may put thy trust in them: the which I discoursing by the way of reason,
and conferring it by experience, have found out a number of drugs that are
friends unto our nature, and preserves it, of the which I will show thee some
that are of great importance, the which may be approved of reason and
experience, and are these.

Oleo del balsamo, than thou shalt have a past of most marvelous virtue, for if
ye take ther-off every morning one dram, it will preserve him long in health, it
is most excellent for those that be wounded or have any sore upon them,
because it keeps the sore from putrefaction as by the ingredience thou may
perceive.

A marvelous Water to be used of all Surgeons in cureing of their
patients.
IT is necessary for the Surgeon in the cure of wounds and sores, to help
the body, as well inwardly as outwardly, to take away the evil qualities and
corruption of the humours, and to preserve it from putrefaction, and then the
sore will heal with little help, and in short time, and that thou may do
with this Water, the which is vncorriptible and of great experience, and the
order to make it is thus.

Rec. Of that Aqua vitae where-of we make our Quintaessence, pound x. and put
there-in these things following. Sinamond, Lignum alloes, red Sanders, Cardus
benedictus, ana 3. ounces, Cloves, long Pepper, Callomus aromaticus, Saffrane,
ana 2. ounces, Almondes, Grains of the Pine, Dates, ana 4. ounces. Melegette
ounce 1. fine Sugar, pound 4. Musk 4. carrets: let all these stand in a long
necked glass, close stopped, 8. or 9. days, and then distill it in Balneo
until ye have received 5. pounds, the which keep close stopped in a glass,
as a precious Jewel: than distill the rest in sand, until the fesses be dry,
and that will be a red Water, and will stink some-what of the fire or smoke,
the which also keep in a glass: for in time it will leese his stinking smell,
and be most precious. The first Water is of such virtue, that it helps al
putrified ulcers, if yo dress them therewith. The second is also perfect, that
if any man drink every morning 2. drames, it will so preserve him, that it
were unpossible he should have any infirmity. For of this Water I have made
great experience in many kind of diseases, and specially in the plurifie and
petechie. c.

To make our Causticke.
ALthough I have written this Causticke in my Regimet of ye pestilece, called
now in english, A Joyful Jewel. Imprinted by William Wright, dwelling under
saint Mildredes Church. Nevertheless, I thought good to write it in this
place, because every one hath not both these books: and the order to make it
is thus.

Rec. Arsnike cristalline, Sal armoniack, Sublimate, ana, boil them being
finely ground in as much strong vinegar as the matter weighs, until two third
parts be consumed, and that there remain a third: then keep it in a glass

shall serve.

To make oil of Antimony.
Rec. Antimoni and calcine it until it will smoke no more, and that it be of a
grayish colour, and always as it cluttereth, stamp it again: then take as
much common ashes as the Antimoni, finely searced, and put them in-to a
Retorte well luted, and give it fire according unto art, till all the fumes or
spirits be come forth: giving you charge that your Receiver be very great,
least all break. This Oil is of marvelous virtue against Ulcers: if ye give
ther-of 4. grains with any sirop, it helps the fever presently. It helps
Phistolowes: and to be short, it is most wholesome in diverse things. But it
were necessary for the Surgeon to be expert in the use thereof, and to mix
it according to his work. And therefore he that cannot use it well, it were
better to let it alone: because it is a perilous thing unto the unskilful, and
precious unto those that know how to use it.

A precious Licoure above all other.
THis is the most precious Water that may be made in ye world, and his virtues
are such, and so many, that they cause the world to marvel at them. The
Mirra and Aloe with Varnish and with as much of our Quintaessence, being myxed,
the which without fire ashes and coals, cannot be separated, and when the
Air, the Water, and Eearth, are separated, each of them shall be apt to
mitigate pains, dissolve humours, help wounds, dissolve pains with-in the
body, and such like matters. This Water I have used diverse times, and caused
the world to wonder of his operations, and so shall every one do that desires
to follow the right way, and that will be a child of art. Thou shalt
understand that I would have written this playner, but that I write it to those
that have judgment both of the quantities and virtues: because pearls are
not for swine.

at the least five times, and at the last time take them forth, and put them

operations, it mortifies the evil, mundifieth, incarnateth and cicatriseth,

received.4. pound, the which keep close by it self, and when thou wilt occupy
it, put there-off one drop into the eye, when ye go to bed, and in the
morning when ye rise. And thus using it, it will preserve the sight a lunge
time.

Of Lac Virginis, and the order to make it.
THis Lac Virginis, is a solution of Satorne and Sal gemma, the which is a
thing most necessary, for the Chyrurgion to use, and the order ot make it, is
thus.

Rec. Lytarge of gold as much as ye think good, beat it in fine powder, then
put there-on strong distilled Vinegar, and so let it remain two or three
days, stirring it every day, then boyle it until half be consumed, then let
it repose two or three hours, and the vinegar will be clear and of the
colour of gold, then pour it forth into a glass, and keep it, then take
Sal gemma and rain water, ana, and dissolve it on warm ashes, and when it is
dissolved, keep it in a glass, and when thou wilt make Lac Virginis, take of
each of these solutions alike, and mix them together, and thou shalt see a
strange thing. For as soon as they are mixed together, they will turn to a
white Huguenot like Ceruse or white lead, the which serves in diverse causes
according to the intention of the Chyrurgian. The solution of Lytarge by
him-selfe, with as much Oil of Roses being mixed together, makes a delicate
Huguenot, an refriscatiue the which cicatrizeth ulcers with great speed.

To calcine Tutia, and to bring it into a salt.
THou shalt dissolve thy Tutia in this water following.

Rec. Sal niter, Roch allome, Vitrioll, Scinaber, ana lib. 1. Beat them
together, and distill them according to Art. Then take that water, and put
there-in thy Tutia, and let it dissolve upon the warm ashes, and when it is
dissolved, vapor away the water until it remain dry, the which take forth,
put it into an earthen pan vnglased and calcine it with a strong fire. Then
dissolve it in distilled vinegar, and when it is dissolved, vapor away the
vinegar, the salt will remain in the bottom, the which serves much for
Tincture, to make a Liniment for the eyes, the which is most precious and rare,
for if ye mix a little ther-off with Hogs grease and Camphir, and then put
it into the eye, it helps them with such speed, that it is to be wondered
at, and not with-out cause. For his Nature is to give light and to heal things
imperfect. The Tutia mixed with Borax and with our Varnish that we guylde
leather with, and given in proiection upon Venus molte, it causes it to be in
colour not much differing from Sol, of the which thou may make strange
things, for he that knew the virtue and quality of Tutia, as well in Alchimi,
as in infirmities, were to be counted a wise man.

To precipitate Mares, and to bring it in to a red powder, called Crocus
martis, the which serves for diverse purposes.
REc. Sal niter refined, Roch Allom, Vitriol Romain, ana, and there-off make a
water according to Art, with all his spirits, and in that water dissolve
thin plates of Iron or steel, and when it is dissolved, vapor away the
water, until it remain dry in a red powder, then take it forth, and calciue
it in a Furnaice of reverberation.24. hours. Then keep it to thy use, until
thou know more there-off, for it is wounderfull in his operation, as I will
show thee here after.

A secret of Turpentine of Cyprus.
THe Turpentine of Cyprus is a kind more finer then our Turpentine, and
with-out comparison, of more virtue then ours is, and this the Doctors say,
doth dissolve pains and preserves the body, if it be taken inwardly: because
they say, that Turpentine is an vncorruptible Gum, the which is most true.
But in that Gum there is one part thick gross that hinders his operation,
and he that can seperate this gross part from the noble parts, shall do
great wonders there-with: It is needful then with the fire and the means of
our Quintaessence, to make the separation of the Elements, the which are.4.
Water, Oil, Liquor, and Earth. The Water is profitable, the Oil is perfect,
the Liquor is noble, and the Earth that remains is spoiled of no substance,
with those things thou may do high and great cures, when they are applied
according as they ought to be, because many good and profitable things thorough
the want of perfect application in time and place many times do hurt, and to
show the troth I will show thee an example of wine the which is a precious
liquor, the which being drunk in the morning is hurtful to many, to eat
meat betwixt meals is not good, and many such like things, yt when they be
not done with order do hurt, and therefore it is necessary for those that will
understand that matter to be of a good intellygence, as well in making it, as
in using or applying it to the sick.

IF any be disposed to have any of these afore-sayd compositions ready made, for
the most part he may have them at Paules Wharf, by one Iohn Hester
practisioner in the Art of distilliations, at the sign of the Furnaises.
