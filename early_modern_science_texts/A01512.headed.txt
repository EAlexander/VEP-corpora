THE HOSPITAL OF INCVRABLE FOOLS: Erected in English, as near the first
Italian model and platform, as the unskilful hand of an ignorant Architect
could devise.

Ipazzi, e li prudenti, fanno giustissima bilancia.

Printed by Edm. Bollifant, for Edward Blount. 1600

TO MY MOST NEAR and Capriccious Neighbor, ycleped Iohn Hodgson, alias Iohn
Hatter, or (as some will) Iohn of Paules Churchyard, (Cum multis alijs, quae
nunc imprimere longum est:) Edward Blount; wishes prosperous success in his
Monomachie, with the French and Spaniard.
IOhn of all Iohns, I am bold here to bring you into a guest-house or
Hospital, and to leave you there; not as a Patient, but as a Patron or
Treasurer: I could wish, that upon this sudden calling to such an office, you
would not (like one swollen with the fatness of your place) grow bigger or
prouder, nor (indeed) more covetous then you are: but like a man within
compass, whose bare (or rather threadbare) content is his kingdom, tread all
Ambition under your Ancient shoe soales, now the sixteenth time corrected, Et
ab omnibus mendis purgatas. Stay now; for your charge: you shall swear to the
uttermost of your endeavours, without fraud or imposture to relieve and cherish
all such creatures as are by the hand of Fortune committed to your custody, as
also to elect and choose officers of good reputation and sincere practise to
supply inferior places under you as: a Porter, who shall refuse none that are
willing to enter; a surgeon, that will protract the cure long enough upon them,
and that if any desperate Censurer shall stab either at you or me, for
undertaking, or assigning this office or place, you presently take him into the
dark ward, and there let him be looked to, and kept close as a concealment,
till some body beg him; all this you shall faithfully protest to accomplish:
So help you a fat Capon, and the Contents of this Book.

TO THE GOOD OLD Gentlewoman, and her special Benefactress, Madam Fortune,
Dame Folly (Matron of the Hospital) makes courtesy, and speaks as follows.
IN good truth (Madame) I am at my wits end (ere I begin) to think, what
Error, or Fury it is that hath so successively possessed the poor despised
Nation of Poets (these many thousand years) still to defame, traduce your
Ladyshyp with the imputatiue slanders of Niggardise and instability; when I
(which have known you better and more inwardly, then a thousand of these
Candle-wasting-Booke Worms) can affirm you to be the most bounteous,
open-handed, firm, vnswayed, constant Lady under Heaven. But since it is no
other then the breath of such a pitiful family; let it vanish (as one of my
own Mottley household notes well) like Tobacco smoke. And now (most excellent
Patroness) that you may feel (for I know you do not use to see) the desire I
have to be truly grateful for so many Mountains of Benefits clapped upon me
(since I first taught Adam to make him a suite of fig leaves) I do here
present your La. with the translated Species of an Hospital, some few Bedred
fools, lately multiplied out of Italian into English, with a most prosperous
and chemical success. My hopes are that you (out of your gracious and
accustomed blindness) will not so much, as deign to look upon their
diseases, but pass them over with the hand of Favour, as you have often done
other sick creatures of their sanguine complexion. They lack cherishing, good
Lady, let them not want it. I know a good plump Fool comes as welcome to you
at all times, as the wisest Anatomy in a kingdom; you take no pleasure in one
of these lean withered Cato's: it is much more in the way of your praise, that
you should bestow your favours on such as (with adoration) will wear them on
their foreheads, then on those, who (out of their too much knowledge) study to
conceal and make them appear cheap and contemptible. Well Madame, you have
the happiness both to consider and distinguish these things without me; and
yet if the old Dutch-man (he of Roterodam) were to be brought to the rack
now, he would protest me (though I doubt he were scarce a sound Protestant) to
have too mean faculty in counsel; there was a true trick of my self now (if
you mark it) Folly must have a flourish of lightness and ostentation ever. I
fear nothing more, but that I have been too grave all this while, appeer'd
like one dancing in a gown: If I have, pardon me; I beg it with as forced a
look, as a Player that in speaking an Epilogue makes love to the two
pennie-roume for a plaudit. But leaving this, what say you? Are my children of
the Spittle to be received into your good thoughts, or no? they stay on the
oher side of the leaf waiting your pleasure. Me thinks being Fools, they
should be answered according to their folly, which is with silence, which is
with consent.

Prologue of the Author to the beholders.
THe manifest vanity, evident folly, and express madness of some miserable and
unhappy men, who with a mind puffed up with pride, a noddle lighter than an
oak apple, and more void of wit, than cockles of meat in the wane of the
moon, presume notwithstanding extremely upon themselves, in that they are of
this friendly and pleasant sort of Buffones; (for according to the saying of
the Philosopher, where little wit is, thither do men run with greatest
favour and liking) being lifted up to such an height, that like to that
memorable gourd in Ariosto, in short space of time they must needs fall: is the
principallest cause that I being amazed and astonished at this their so great
folly, after my Theater of sundry humours and inclinations, have taken upon me
to build this most famous Hospital, where the renowned folly of these men may
be seen and discerned, written (as it were) in Text letters, and in chambers
or lodgings apart, painted and set forth by me with so beautiful and
workmanlike perspective, that other Fools shall flock about them; and as the
Kings of Fools, they shall receive an open-mouthed applause of them all, to
the end, that while the pipkin boils, the smoke that pleases themselves so
much, may forcibly come steaming out at the crown of their own hats. Yet is
this no reason, but that the general Folly of the world, spurs me forward
to do the same, besides the kinds of particular Follies, the which procure me
that (all human kind participating of the same) I build for each one of them
distinct Cells, wherein they may all commodiously, and with great ease repose
themselves. And in this point, it will appear how godly a man the Author of
this frame was; who besides the building, made at the great instance of so many
weak and poor in brain, with excellent invention hath devised to recommend
them all to some God; under whose protection they might be kept, or as far as
is possible, defended, and helped of their folly. So he will specially beseech
Minerua, to take care of frantic and delirant Fools; Iupiter Hospitalis, of
melancholic and savage; Apollo, of idle and careless; God Abstemius, of those
drunken; Cameronte, of forgetful and fickle headed; God Sentinus, of stupide,
lost, and half dead Fools; the Egyptian Ox of those notted, gross, and
loblolly-lams; the Samian sheep, of shallow-pates and ninnie hammers; the
Goddess Bubona, of lumpish and loggerheaded; the God Fatuellus, of plain
Fools and naturals; the Goddess Themis, of those vicious; Nemesis, of the
malicious and despiteful; God Risus, of the ridiculous; Iuno, of the
vaine-glorious; Mercurie, of dissembling and counterfeit; Hecate, of lunaticall
or Fools by season; Cupid, of loving Fools; Goddess Venilia, of desperate;
Vulcanus, of heteroclite, light-brained, and addle-headed; Fabulanus, of
scoffing Fools; Bacchus, of those pleasant, sweet, sociable, and loving;
Tesiphon, of those angry and froward; Mars, of the furious, brutish, or
bedlemsort; Hercules, of extravagant, extreme, and wilful Fools;
Rhadamanthus, of the pild-pated; Volutina, of monstrous three-elbowed Fools;
Hippona, of them untamed like an horse; Inexorable Minos, of them obstinate
like a mule; and finally, infernal Pluto, of mischievous or diabolical
Fools. In the mean while I conjure the household Gods, that they will have a
care of this family of general Fools; and the Gods Tutelar, that they will
undertake the tuition and protection of this new Hospital. Goddess Ops, that
with convenient remedies, she will succour so many infirm, and naked of wit
and understanding; Goddess Medetrina, that she will cure them well; God
Aesculapius, that with miraculous Hellebore, he will purge them after some
sort; Goddess Sospita, that she will heal them out of hand; God Ianus, that
he will permit every one to enter within the gates of this Hospital, that
they may behold the misery of these unhappy and unfortunate: and that
especially which is performed on the festival day of all Fools, as the
Romaines were accustomed, the Author desires, that the gates may be set broad
open, where they may see the Bacchanals of the Menades, a matter pleasant above
all Or Bacchus Nuns.
others, and rare to behold. With this invention therefore it hath pleased him
to rebate the edge, and rashness of those modern Thersites, who think
themselves Aiaces; of those Pigmeis that esteem themselves Alcides; of those
peevish Fools that judge themselves Nestors; of those field-Crickets that play
the parrots so notably; of those pearched Cuckoos that laugh at all the world;
of those skinlesse Snails that lift up their horns for nothing; of those
Horse-flies of Pigneta, that are bread in dung and dirt; of those Lobbellinoes,
properly leaden-heeled, but light-headed as a straw: for passing through this
Hospital, they shall see that Folly was their mother, Buffonerie their sister,
Ninnerie their companion for term of life, and that between them and Folly
there is a just Logical equipollence, Physical reference, and a Scotisticall
Identity. These be those that first put it into the Authors head to frame this
new building, where the honourable beholders shall have great solace and
pastime, to see the foolish Prosopopaeia of these savage geese, and will take
no small delight and pleasure at the strange and unusual follies, which within
shall discover themselves in these men, who counterfeiting other Catoes among
the multitude, will in the end appear to be nothing, but kings of Crickets,

Not to the wise Reader.
IT being but a Poetical fiction, that this whole world was in the beginning
framed of Chaos, upon better advise and reason one may change opinion, or at
least have his own censure by himself: it seeming unto me a more probable
thing, that from the beginning of Form, which the philosophers hold to be
perfection, this world grows daily to Chaos and confusion. But if the
material frame be any ways answerable to him, who is the epitomethereof (man
being termed Microcosmos) I am sure this assertion may well be maintained. For
Nature (divine ministresse) contending in the creation of all things, to
imprint in them the seal and form of Divinity, she finds no enemy nor
obstacle to this her perfect work but matter, which still increases according
to the augmentation, and growth of things created. Hereupon comes the great
difference between the superior immortal, and the inferior corruptible
parts of man, the faculties of the soul and mind, being choked in all her
divine intentions, by the gross humours and temperature of the body, wherein
as in a dark and loathsome prison, it is while the gail delivery of death
enclosed. And from hence in like manner doth it arise, that this witty, and
worthy Author, obserueth in the tree of human conceit and understanding, so
many grafts of folly and foppery inserted, as that no man how mighty or
profound soever he be in his own sight, is exempted from some measure or
proportion of these dottrell drammes. In religion (which is the highest action
amongst men) is it not a wonderful thing to see the obstinate opposition of
some more fantastic, then truly zealous: one judging every decent
formality, deep and dangerous superstition; another abandoning all true
ground and substance, for naked traditional rite and form. Next unto this in
the second cure of our bodies, how infinite are the follies of Physicians in
the practise of their Art, into whose hands notwithstanding at one time or
other are committed the lives of almen, wading through such a number of
uncertainties before they attain to one sound probatum, and making their
trials experiments upon the poor carcases of men: and yet for all this, look
what through an whole age, hath been received for wholesome healthful
administration, in another succeeding, is rejected as most prejudicial and
pernicious. So that the applications and medicine of their first founders, is
now of no worth, except they have recourse to minerals, wherein likewise as
they confess themselves they have attained to quality; but of quantity are
as yet altogether ignorant. The like may be said of all Arts and professions
amongst men, wherein there is that confusion and incertainty, as the doings of
one are reprehended by another for most vain and foolish. But if you enter
into the particular humours and enclinations of each one, Lord, what a
pell-mell of conceit and muention you shall discover, this seed being so thick
sown in all their operations, that after their deep consultations, firm
resolutions, and provident circumspection, of all this their labour, there
comes up nothing but tares and folly, which the wisest man, after due
consideration so often affirmed. One is ambitious, and having brought his
thoughts and imaginations to a good pass, some instant folly, they being
reared to a great height, (like the Babylonian tower) utterly overthrows them
to the ground. Another puts on the Fox with temporizing humility, and yet
omitting some small circumstances in his complots and contriuance, a momentary
error confounds all his laboured and provident devises. For as violence
settles hatred and disdain in the harts of men, Nam oderint quem metuunt: so
absolute humility breeds contempt; and the Italian Prouer be can tell you,
that Chi pecora si fa, il lupo lo mangia. Well, having in this Hospital
received so good comfort, and succour my self; in religious charity I could
not but make known unto you this worthy Italian work, framed peradventure
upon their year of Jubilee, or grace, and therefore propounded in general to
all men, for relief and cure of their giddy maladies. I crave no pardon of my
errors or faults (yet are they many, and only mine own) being but a Fool,
in reporting to Fools what an other hath censured of human folly: And
therefore you see I neither incite you to gratitude, by Alexanders receiving a
cup of water so thankfully, nor to reward in distributing of your goodwils, by
imitation of that noble Prince, who so kindly remunerated the taking of alowse
from his garment. Tullies sentences lye dead in my mind, and I have utterly
lost the memorial of Lycosthenes Apophthegmes: this I did carelessly, accept
you of it as lightly. Yet consider what patience you have with the wine you
drink in Taverns, and believe me (as a poor Traveller) it is all exceedingly
bastardiz'd from his original purity: and even your Physical drams, that are
so greedily sought after, suffer a little sophistication by the hands of the
Apothecary. Think not much therefore, if so tickle and foolish a commodity
as this is, be somewhat endamaged by the transportation of it out of Italy, but
making some pleasant and profitable collection out of the same, let us leave
all preeminence of folly to themselves, as I ascribe all due reward and
demerite to my original Author. It is certain, that there is few names of men
or places, in all the modern examples of this Book, but have agnomination or
proximitie with the humours qualities of the party described: but this would
have made too homely an hotchpotch in English, and obscured so much wit as
shines through this whole mist of folly, by too palpable and trivial
scurrilitie. If any man find help, or cure of his malady, by devout
invocation on his proper Saint, or Patron, let him ascribe the principal
glory thereof to him, and yet be thankful to his earthly founder.

Il pazzissimo.

Of Folly in general: the first discourse.
COnsidering, I have taken upon my self this burden, to manifest to the
world, the prodigious and monstrous kinds of folly, which with an aspect, and
countenance more deformed then Cadmus his serpent, more ugly then the Chimera,
fuller of poison then the dragon of Hesperides, more hurtful prejudicial then
Corebus his monster, more terrible then the Minotaure of Theseus, of more
horrible presence then Geryon with his three heads, is come down into the
world, to power out amongst us the contagion of her poison, like the beast
Alcida, to the hurt and damage of every one: it is very requisite, that I
describe her after such a manner, as that her very countenance only may be of
force to daunt terrify any one, and that the whole world may be ready to
verify that the Harpies were not so foul, and unclean, Hercules his bull so
pestiferous, nor the sea monster Hesion so dommageable as she; who entering once
into the seat of the brain, she obfuscateth imagination, peruerteth conceit,
alienates the mind, corrupts reason, and so disturbs and hinders a man,
that he can neither read, deliver, nor act any thing as he should do: but on
the contrary, with turbulent conceptions, wavering and inconstant motions,
broken sleep, a sick brain, an empty soacked head, like a withered cucumber,
he vainly like a blind mill horse, whirleth about a thousand fopperies, some
of them no less lamentable then ridiculous: But the greatest inconvenience
that springs from her is this, that continually weakening the brain, she
causes man to remain so blockish, and insensate, that he thinks himself
wisest, when he is most fool; then deeming, that he is an other Mercury, when
he is but a Corydon, or some Menalca, among the vulgar: and this comes to
pass (as Hippocrates in his Aphorisms auerreth) because; Hippocrates.
Quibus it a men's aegrotat ij dolorem non sentiunt: they whose minds be thus
tossed and transported are insensible of grief. Folly therefore is she, who
being spread and dispersed, over all provinces and countries in the world;
sorely vexes mortallmen, and holds in subjection under her tyrannical
empire, an infinite number of people and men, that saying in Ecclesiastes being
too true, that Stultorum infinitus est numerus: infinite is the number of
fools; and even as Arpiages not impiously only, but further unnaturally and
villainously did with his own sons brains, so sets she her monstrous
teeth against one and other, coveting to satisfy the greedy humours of
human fantasy. This pretty peat, spares not kings, hath no respect to
emperors, esteems not captains, makes no reckoning of the learned,
regards not the rich, fears not those noble, there is no consideration can
bridle, or make her refrain from striking, (like a blind man) round about,
and at randone, on every side, whole mortal race. Behold the hand that this
beast anciently bore over the world, so that the people Agathyrses inhabiting
near the Syrtes, or sandy deserts, the first among fools, in sign of their
evident folly, went naked with their bodies painted of sundry colours, like
the Leopards spots: whereupon Virgil in the fourth of his Aeneades saith: The
Cretanes, Drypes, and painted Agathyrsians rage.
The Audabatians being the pictures of true folly, were wont to fight in the
wars with their eyes closed: The Arcadians (right Fools) thought themselves
more ancient then the moon: and for this cause Seneca in his Hippolytus saith:
Contemning thee, that did amidst the stars soshine:
A planet placed there: since th'old Arcadians time:
The Himantopoles void of wit, went creeping upon the earth with their hands
and feet, as serpents do. The Mendesians depriued of all judgment, performed
the greatest honours they could possibly devise to goateheards. The people
Psylli cockscombes in the fourth degree, as Herodotus reports, fought with
armed bads against the south wind, being preiudicial to them: The Tonemphians
half out of their wits, seriously made choice of adogge instead of a king,
and by the motions and waggings of his tail, they presaged empires and
dominions, which they were to possess. But who doth not perceive what folly
reigns amongst men, when the learned, who should be wiser then others,
show themselves otherwhiles more foolish, affirming things which babies would
scarce believe, and all the Magpies in a country would hardly vouchsafe to
chatter such foppish flimflams as they do: Is not that of Plinies a goodly
gullerie, that Phileta Coo, a compounder of Elegies, was of so light and
subtle a body, Plinie.
as that it was requisite to fasten lead to the soles of his feet, to the end
a blast of wind might not carry him quite away? Are not also those other two
famous, which Ausonius and Pontanus write of; that Seneus and Ausonius.
Pontanus.
Tyresias, of men, became women, changing their forms even as a Potter, while
the earth is moist, and supple, of a pot, can make a platter. But yet that
other of Plinies is no less witty: that in the lake of Tarquinum, there were
in times past two groves or woods which were carried round about, sometimes in
form triangular, then fowresquare, otherwhiles all round: Neither smells this
currant, that the herb called Achimenes, being thrown amongst the enemies
squadrons, is of virtue to make them turn their backs in spite of their
teeth. Licinius Mutianus, tells no simple lie, when he reports, Licinius
Mutianus.
that in Argos he saw a certain woman called Arestusa, who married her-selfe
to a man, and the day of her marriage became male, sprowting forth a beard,
with members genitall: And afterwards she also took a wife, being thus (as
he saith) for ever converted into a man. As in like manner that other
delivered by Celius, is not very pleasant at the nose Celio.
end, that a certain sea monster, in his former parts like a man, and behind
resembling a horse, died thrice, and was wonderfully in like manner three
times raised from death: Furthermore that of Aelianus is no less famous then
the rest, when he mentions that Ptolomaeus Philadelphus had an Hart,
instructed after such a manner, as that he plainly understood his master, when
he spoke to him in Greek: No less fantastical AElianus.
is an other of Plinies also, reporting, that in Limira a fountain of Lycia
consecrated to Apollo, the fishes therein being with an oaten, or bagpipe called
thrice above water, they obey the sound thereof, and appear without delay. But
Peter Messia, as others give out, Pietro Messia.
recounts one most palpable, and void of sense, saying, that one Cipus, who
was a king, having diligently observed the fighting of two Bulls, and one day
with deep impressio thereof, laying himself down to sleep, awaking, he found
suddenly sprouted out of his head, the horns of a Bull. This man, it may be,
was a follower of the Philosopher Protagoras his sect, who like a foolish dolt,
was so impudent, as to affirm, that whatsoever seems unto a man, to be in
conceit, is so indeed: so that Plato bestowed a little pains in condemning
this Sot, to a thousand gallows, saying, if this position were true, then he
was of opinion that Protagoras likewise had uttered a notable foolery, this
man affirming, that by his own reason it followed, that he was therefore
himself a fool. But he that would amply discourse of all the foolish toys,
that by learned men have been set abroach, and make mention of all those,
which worldly men have practised, should undertake a burden able to weary
Atlas himself; much more, the feeble wit, and weak memory of a mean writer,
as I am: It suffices that with the wise man, every one may justly exclaim,
Vidi cuncta, quae fiunt sub sole, ecce vniuersavanitas, Salomon.
afflictio spiritus: I have perused all things done under the sun, and behold
all is vanity, and affliction of mind. The Egyptians in truth, were most
foolish, and vain in worshipping Onions, Leekes, and heads of Garlic for
their gods, as Juvenal testifies in his fifteenth Satire: The Babylonians also
wanted wit, when Iuuenall.
they worshipped their god Bell, before whom they set, so much meat to eat,
as would well have served, a thousand persons: And the Romanes might well be
numbered amongst those three elbowed Fools, in offering divine sacrifice to
such an harlot, as was Flora, and adoring Stercutio for a god, no less
vnwoorthily, then shamfully constituting him a patron, and Protector of Aiax,
and his commodities: But what do I reciting of ancient follies, when this our
present age, is a true and lively representation of Fools, yea, and the very
store-house of all the vanities, a man can commit in this world? When were the
dreams of Alchymistes ever in greater estimation, then they are now, when many
great personages will vouchsafe to go ever into the Stoue, or forge, blowing
the bellows at the furnace mouth that they may become one of Geber or Morieno
his sect, every one of them having as much wit, as an horse: When was Raymonds
fond calbalistrie ever more sought after, who with his frivolous art professes
wonders, and that he can make Asses dance after the Morisco, and those to
run most swiftly, that have leaden heals by nature? When were there such a
number of these Almanakes or lying weather Authors being to be sold in the
Burse, or Rialto, even to the ridiculous prognostication of one that supped up
an hundred eggs in a morning, that he might not be driven to take Inn, with
this charitable Hospital of Fools; yet could not this silly wretch avoid the
malignant influence of the stars, and planets, and his own unfortunate
constellation, for he is forced to enter into the Hospital of incurable
Cockscombs, for a farthing Astrologer, because much after this rate, is his
hamper merchandise sold at. When walked there about the world such a number of
Peddlers Quacksaluers, professing some of them physic as if they had the
university certificate, when in the end they prove but country iugglers,
selling dross for drugs, and hose of the Irish glick, for sloppes of the
mariners cut? who ever knew such abundance of them that hunt after strange
secrets, insomuch that in Bergamo there starts me up one that vaunted of a
secret he had, which would convert the Turk, and would have sold it to a
Physician, and a friend of mine, for a Or Fryer Bacon of c.
piece of forty if he so pleased, a matter enough (if he should have known
so much) to have made Fiorauanti of Bologna to despair in himself, for not
placing it amongst his medicinal toys, under title of Angelical divine
Elixir Fiorauantyne: Who ever saw so many od Mechanics, as are at this day,
who not with a geometrical spirit like Archimedes, but even with art,
surpassing the profoundest Cabalistes, who in stead of a pigeon loft, place in
the garrets of houses, portable, and commodious Aiaxes, in stead of convenient
fish ponds, digging fit ditches for snakes and adders Or close stools.
? To conclude, all the world is matter from head to foot, and one beats his
brains about one thing, another, about some other: this man feeds himself in
worldly glory, thinking that in honour, he is a very Arc Triumphal, when
all the worth in him, scarcely amounts to an half penny value; another
ruffles in his without-booke-Rhetoricke, as though he had no paragon for
Latin and Greek; one in deep wisdom of the world tags the points of his
hose with iron, that he may have ready crowns in his chest at command, for
in twenty years past, he gathers little or nothing; another stands upon
puntoes with his drawn sword, like another Gargantua, in that he is exalted to
some catchpoale or hangmans office, as if every one knew not, that to put an
office into a Fools hand, is as much as we should set an ass to play on the
harp: this man is very ginger, dangerous of himself, upon his train, of
three or four raggie held followers, seeming some pompeous proud Pharoe of
parasites, amidst a multitude of Ginnie Monkeys: who makes himself doctor
doddipowle for wisdom, a pedantic quaint quanquam for epistles, desiring
to appear like an half blown glass, as if the play were ended without a
plaudit. And thus every one sets both good and bad upon the board, not
considering what the wise man saith, that Vanitas vanitatum, omnia vanitas:
Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity: But because we shall the better know
in general, if we discourse in particular, by little and little, let us
examine Fools in special, for thus shall we attain to the full and perfect
knowledge of Folly, we seek after.

Of Frantic and doting Fools: the second discourse.
THe general opinion of all learned Galen.
Physicians, and especially of Galen in the first of his Prorrheticks touching
this matter called Frenzy is this: that Frenzy properly is termed an
affection or interior passion, which being accompanied with a violentague, or
sharpe fit, bears always about with it, madness in the brain of the patient:
And this passion (as Aetius writes by authority of Possedonius) Aetius.
is a certain inflammation of the organicall parts of the brain, which
induces a kind of dotage, and grievous percussion of the mind, whereupon they
are said to be frantic and doting, whom such a strong and displeasing
passion surprises. But Trallianus, that excellent Trallianus.
physician in the thirteenth chapter of his first book is of opinion, that
Frenzy is a tumour or inflammation of the brain, or of the membranes thereof:
And Paulus Paulus. Medicus.
Medicus in the sixth chapter of his third Book produces his opinion of the
same after this manner; that Frenzy is an inflammation of the membranes of the
brain; yet so, that sometimes the brain it self, seems together with them
co-inflamed, and that in it may be perceived otherwhiles, a certain heate,
besides that which we call vigour, or heat natural. Galen afterwards in the
second of the causes of Symptoms, plainly maintains, that the residece of
passion, is as well in the brain it self, as in the membranes: and the greater
part of Physicians jump with him, but especially amongst those of late days
Altomar in the sixth chapter of his medicinal Altomar.
methode. Yet the Physicians do make some difference, between Frenzy, and
weakness of brain, although both of them are associated with an fever, or fit,
because dotage or braine-sicknes (as Iohn Fernelius Ambianus in the fifth Book
of his works medicinal writes) is procured sometimes by choler, and
otherwhiles, by a subtle effused blood through the brain, or some other
cause: but Frenzy hath ever his cause, from that inflammation of the brain,
which before we mentioned: and besides deliration is oftentimes a Symptom, or
after passion of an fever, or of some more grievous malady, but of a Frenzy
there is no Symptom, it effecting causing a fit or fever; and this dotage
happens often, whereas Frenzy falls out but seldom; Frenzy being a far
more violent infirmity, then deliration or dotage. But because I mean not to
entreat of Folly, so much according to Physicians, as the vulgar opinion, I
have for this cause, comprehended, Frantic and brain-sicke Fools under one
kind, because we commonly say, when any one goes about a thing arsie-versie,
that such a man dotes, or is Frantic, the same happening to him, which
sorts them, who are properly oppressed with Frenzy or madness: Amongst us
therefore ordinarily, Frantic, and deliring Fools be those, who with a kind
of imitation of their own folly Frenzy, swerve from al sense, in anything
they utter, being inconstant, and so intricating themselves, that another
Sphinx, should have work enough to explain their conceits, Oedipus himself
would sweat, to apprehend the meaning of their words: for there utterance is
ready, and at hand, but then fantasy on the other side in the, is mounted on
a winged Pegasus roving here and there at random. Of this kind of Fools, two
examples only may serve for the learned, the one of a certain man, named by
Seneca in his Epistles, Sparsus, to whom he ascribeth Seneca citeth an example
of a fool doting or delirant.
these qualities: that amongst schollers, he talked like a mad man; and amongst
mad men he discoursed like a scholar: where, in the one, and other, the dotage
of his mind was evident to all men: the other is of Caelius (an Caelio citeth
another.
Author much esteemed) in the ninth Book of his ancient lectures, recited
where he saith, that there was a certain decrepit woman, called by him, Acco,
(and so much the rather it might be a dotage, because the same is more proper
to this, then any other age) who perceiving her face in a glass deformed
through old age, of the discontentment she received by this in her mind, she
became a Fool; in this her mad folly, she spoke to her own face in the
glass, laughed, and talked to it: sometimes she would threaten, otherwhiles
she would promise it somewhat; sometimes she flattered it, and anon after a
frantic manner she would be angry with the same; one while she would
be as merry, as maid Marrian, and by and by, outrageous and despiteful
like an oysterwife. But Modern examples.
amongst the vulgar, the example of one Talpine of Bergamo, an old Dizzard may
well be added, who not being able to continue a quarter of an hour, or one
minute in a purpose, departing from Bergamo, and going to Venice, before the
Signiory or Magistracy of Quarantia Orsortie.
to appeal unto them, about sentence given upon an house, whereunto he
pretended title, as he stood before them, he leaped suddenly out of the house
into a well, maintaining with so great obstinacy, how at least yet he would
seize upon the well of that house, that those signiors, smiling, offered to make
him also Lord, put him in possession of the whole sea, much more of a well: and
thus he gave over his appeal of the well, and carried news to Bergamo, how
this Signiory had made him patron of the sea, and also of the Buccetor. But A
goodly bargs or brigantine wherein the Venetian Signiory recreate themselves
in the Adriatic sea, near to their city.
returning again to his former humours, he had recourse a new unto them,
exclaiming, that he thought it an indignity, when by his Admiralship he might
dispose of so much salt water, for ships to sail upon, and could not have the
fresh water of a well, for provision of his galleies: and those Signiors
perceiving his wit at the highest, for solace and entertainment of the
company, they caused a writing to be made him, subscribed with a coal,
sealed with an horse brand, wherein they declared, that they made a present
unto him of all the water in the rivers of Sergio, Oio, Brenta, Sile, Piaue,
Tagliamento, Grauallone, Adige, of that part of Po, which runs through their
dominion, for the use of this affair; and yet in the end, the Fool for all
this concluded, that he would not have so much water, but his house, or
otherwise, he meant to raze the town of Bergamo, even to the very foundation,
together with the goodly chapel there seated and built. No less a dotage is
that, which is reported of one Santino of Tripalda, upon whom an humour came
that at threescore and four years of age, he would needs go to the
University in Padoa, and lighting at an Inn nearest to the public schools,
there read a Physician at the same time that was then the most famous man of
this University, where he entering into the schools, at lecture time amongst
others, while the Doctor by chance was conversant in the argument of the
brain, this dizzard began to shake his head mightily; and finally, not being
able to contain himself at the presence of many schollers, who in the
beginning by reason of the old mans grave countenance and appearance, knew not
of which foot he halted, he cried out aloud, how he would hold maintain this
conclusion, that the oxen of his town of Tripalda, had more wit, then al the
doctors, schollers that were in Padoa: wherupo, flocking about this apparat
fool, he was presently placed in the chair with much laughter by the
schoolers, very desirous to hear some goodly stuff proceed from this new
archdoctor; and thus entering into the readers seat, whereas they expected one
thing, there succeeded an other, for he began to talk of the means, how to
set upon the Turk and Sophie both at a time; and by and by he leapt to
discourse of the grace of Saint Paul as some prattling Balletters use to do,
and withal, heescapes me quite out of the Turks hands: in the end growing
to this conclusion, that he came to Padoa to be made doctor, and because he
understood, howe the schollers of Padoa occupied themselves about a thousand
matters, he meant to read publicly in that University Orlando Furioso, and
without stipend, so that he might have preeminence of the head schools: all in
jesting manner consenting thereunto, and crying out with a lively voice, long
live Santino of Tripalda, for that in his discussion he showed himself so
sufficient, and coming down from the pulpit or readers place, turning to all
the assembly he said: Friends and companions, every one perform his part,
and I give you place, in the lecture following I mean to return to my town
of Tripalda, doctorized thus by your grace, and favour: They therefore of
Santino, of Tripalda, and of Talpino, of Bergamos wit, be in the number of
those fools, whom the vulgar term frantic, or dizzards: and their Cell in
this Hospital, hath hanging out for a sign a Minerua, because she is the
Goddess that protects this kind of Fools, wherefore prostrate on the earth,
with this ensuing supplication let us implore her aide, for the cure of these
poor bransickes, and witless men.

A prayer to the goddess Minerua for doting and frantic Fools.
TO thee Tritonia virgin, worthily adorned with a 1000. lofty epithets, as of
Itonian, Lyndian Medusean, Ionian, Scillutian, Alcessian, Scyras, Elean,
Pylotean, Polian, Glaucopian, and of the Attean virgin, by the Greekes called
Pallas, in that armed with a spear in thy hand, thou art held for a goddess
of arms, and of the Latines Minerua, because thou rightly aduisest them, that
have need of counsel, I unfeignedly direct these my humble prayers: And if
thou be (as all men esteem thee) the goddess of wisdom, borne of
Iupiters brain, in all reason called operatiue, for that all discreet and
wise operations proceed by thy mean, termed Necina, which is as much as to
say, valiant, because thou art of a constant resolution, and magnanimous in
every one of thy deliberations: made known of all men by the name of Dedala,
which imports as much as witty, because thou art the mother, mistress, and
lady of human wit, I beseech thee receive into thy protection, thesemen, who
forsaken of wit, and abandoned of conceit, by my mean have recourse unto
thee, being wholly nothing but pregnancy and wit: Thouknowest, that whatsoever
they utter is but rudely by them pronounced, they being frantic, and
distraught in such a manner as any action of theirs is commonly reputed
frivolous rash: Cure this frenzy, to the end that with recovered wit, regained
wisdom, and conceit retired and called home, they may extol thee, the
goddess, fountain, beginning, cause of conceit, and intellect. I no farther
at this time instigate thee most wise goddess, no sus Mineruam, as the
proverb saith, least being a fool, I should control thy wisdom, thou
being she, who artable to instruct all the world, and keeping the key of all
others knowledge, of all our discipline and understanding: if thou shalt but
vouchsafe recovery to these miserable wretches, in thy sacred temple shall be
consecrated to thee a dry Pompion rind, which shall hang at thy feet in token
of the understanding thou hast given to thesefooles, who before were as void of
wit, as this gourd is empty of substance: Peace be with thee, and preserve
them that have need of thy help.

Of solitary and melancholic Fools: the third discourse.
THe most renowned Physicians, as well ancient as modern, join in this
fundamental conclusion, that melancholy is to be reputed a kind of dotage,
without fever or fit, which springs from no other thing then abundance of
melancholic humour that occupies the seat of the mind, it being a common
thing with all melancholic persons to have the brain evil affected, either
essentially by nature, or voluntarily by their own consent, as Altomar
affirms Altomare.

where he uses these express words; Melancholica est mentis alienatio,
qualaborantes, velcogitant, vel loquuntur, vel efficiunt absurda, longeque
aratione consilio abhorrentia, eaque omnia cum metu ac maestitia, that is,
Melancholy is an alienation of the mind, of which they that labour, think,
speak, and effect things absurd, and far abhorring from reason or counsel,
performing all this with fear and sadness: the which two last signs
Hippocrates sets down forsecure and infallible notes of humour
melancholic: Although Donato Antonio d'Altomare, by the authority of Galen,
in his second book Decausis symptomatum: of Aetius in his particular chapter
of melancholy, and of Trallianus in the thirteenth chapter of his first book,
proves that melancholic men have only their partimaginatiue offended, and
not cogitation, nor memory, they being deceived for the most part about things
to be seen or discerned, wherein the error of imagination concurreth, and not
of the other two faculties. In like manner all generally confess thus much,
that the kinds of this melancholic madness be sundry and diverse, the which may
well be perceived in the progress of this our work in hand: and amongst the
variable effects of this madness, they assign these: that it is accompanied
with little courage or valour: they possessed therewith be replenished with
fear and sadness, not able to yield any reason thereof: they desire to be
solitary: are in hatred with humane conversation; they abhor recreations,
and contentments for a time; and then again (as Theodorus Priscianus in his
second book of Theodorus Priscianus.
things medicinal affirms) they repent themselves for contemning them,
returning often to the same: they desire death, and many times in act procure
it: all which effects concur not ever in one and the same subject, but
torment sometimes severally and apart, and other whiles jointly, being unite.
Wherefore we may observe infinite kinds of melancholic fools, according to the
superabounding humour, which inciteth one more then an other to greater and more
sottish effects. Galen Galen.
amongst others in his third De locis affectis, testifies of one, who

who is said by the Poets to sustain mount Olympus on his shoulders,
overcharged and wearied with so grievous a weight, should shake it off far
from him, and so he being near might be overwhelmed by the same, could never
stand still in a place, but was ever reculing back, as if this weight had
always been ready to fall upon his head. And Caelius in the twenty six
Caelius.
chapter of his ninth book, recounts one Pisander amongst these sort of
fools, who thinking himself to be dead, was wonderfully afraid of meeting
with his own soul, which he esteemed to be a mortal enemy to his body, and
that he might not come to have any thing to do with it, having so injuriously
entreated him, and treacherously borne it self towards him, in leaving his
body. But what shall we say to Nicoletto of Modern examples.
Gattia, who possessed with this indisposition of the brain, thought one day
that he was become the snuff of a candle, and therefore he willed every one to
blow upon him before, behind, and on each side, fearing he should burn so
much while he were all consumed? No less savage and barbarous is the
melancholic and salt humour of this kind, which sometimes one Toniolio of
Marastica had, who being in fantasy persuaded, that he was a shoe piece,
went upon his buttocks as far as Vincenza, holding his feet in his hand for
fear some cobbler in disgrace, should have set him upon the heals or soles of
his shoes. And surely I believe that humour to be no less gross which took
Bertazzuolo of Nuuolara in the head, whose with being overcast, he one day
thought that he was turned into a Chioggia pompion, and so with his head he
went iobbing against this and that mans nose, crying out, that in any wise no
body should buy him, because it was not yet August, when they are ripe. But I
will shut up the follies of these miserable sort with the ridiculous example of
Petruccio of Prato, who believing verily that he was a grain of mustard seed,
cast himself into a great barrel of made mustard which a chandler had set
before his shop door, endamnifying this poor man to the value of eight or
ten ducats, who would never have believed such a thing. Among these humours
of melancholy, the Physicians place a kind of madness by the Greeks called
Lycanthropia, termed by the Latines Insania Lupina; or wolves fury: which
brings a man to this point (as Attomare affirms) that in February he will
go out of the house in the night like a wolf, hunting about the graves of the
dead with great howling, and pluck the dead men's bones out of the sepulchers,
carrying them about the streets, to the great fear and astonishment of all
them that meet him: And the foresaid author affirms, that melancholic
persons of this kind, have pale faces, soaked and hollow eyes, with a weak
sight, never shedding one tear to the view of the world, a dry tongue,
extreme thirst, and they want spittle and moisture exceedingly: where he also
alleges that he saw two mightily troubled and oppressed with such an
humour: But in this point Foruaretto of Lugo may serve for a notable example,
who suffering this madness in his imagination and cogitatiue parts (for all men
agree not touching the memory) he went one night into the Iewes churchyard,
where there had been lately buried an old Iewe, more then fowrescore years
of age, he having been sick more then six years of a dropsy, and taking up
this body upon his shoulders, he went to a spacious place before the castle
playing with this dead carcase, as if he had been at Ballown, and crying out
sometimes serve, sometimes send it home to me, now strike, then play, he by
little and little raised up all that quarter, and the rumour went from hand to
hand, through all the Hebrew families, that this man had disenterred master
Simon, (for so was the dead Iewe called) whereupon there presently grew a
Synagogue of immeasurable laughter in their presence, when they saw this Fool,
how he took one of his legs by the small in stead of a braser, the body full
garbadge for a Ballowne, at every blow his Hydropicall tunnage issuing forth,
which was a fortnights work for that people, to allay the stinche thereof
only; many of the more obstinate sort, being ready to pay the penalty of a
Carline, for not making clean the market place, rather A little piece of money
in Italy.
then they would purge the perfume of Master Simons carcass, it being no
counterfeit, or pedlarie ware. Melancholic and savage Fools, be therefore of
this Tribe, who have in this Hospital a Cell, much like the Grot, or Cave of
Cumean Sibilla, and before the gate thereof, it hath Iupiter for a sign, whom
as protector of such like people, we will in this invocation following call
upon for aide and help.

A petition to Iupiter for melancholic and savage Fools.
THis troop of weakelings, depriued of all help and advise, directed by thy
name by my mean, have recourse unto thee, thou greatest son of Opis Saturne,
brother companion to Queen Iuno, condignlie called Iupiter, in respect of the
help thou affords them that need; the most excellent and greatest, for thy
infinite goodness wherewith thou gouernest the whole world, a father, a
creator, altitonant king of the gods, lord of the world, rector of Olympus,
corrector of faults offeces, highest father aetherean, Sceptiger, omnipotent,
with many other illustrous titles, because al things at the least point with
thy finger, are ready to obey: wherefore being moved by so great deity, by so
great majesty stirred up, I request thee by that pity the Curetians showed
in nourishing thee in mount Ida, to have commiseration of these poor
comfortless people: and if the love of Europa, or of thy sweet page Ganimede
comfort thee at the hart, thinking on the martyrdom, suffered pain, sustained
and passed vexations of so great pleasures afterwards ensuing, by the same
judicial insight, I conjure thee to ease these afflicted, to comfort these
distressed, and to deliver out of vexation and grief the melancholistes, who
are put over to thee as to their favourable star: If thou be he that begot
Minerua, goddess of wisdom, purge their heads of so great folly, wherewith
they abound. If thou be truly called Panompheus, for that thou hear every
mans voice, atted then not the voices, but even the shrill cries and
exclamations of these abandoned. If thou be the Hospital Iupiter, so
celebrated of Poets, have care of these who in a poor Hospital call out
aloud for thy succour. If thou be that Iupiter Penetrant, held so dear in
old time, let these men's miseries pearce not only to the ears, but even to
the bowels of such a pitiful gods hart. If thou be the Lapidian Iupiter
which workest woonders in stones, what greater miracle can thou perform then
this, to remove from these insensible stones the savage and obdurate humour
they are possessed withal? If thou be that Iupiter whom all men call
Genius, for the inclination and desire thou hast to be fauouable to all, have a
little regard I beseech thee unto them who have need of thy greatest grace. If
thou be that prodigious Iupiter who hath wrought so many miracles in former
ages, perform presently this wonder, that thorns may become roses, thistles
lillies, and nettles gilloflowers: and then with lively voice the whole
Hospital will resound, ever live thou great Iupiter Elician, Anxurian,
Egyocian, Lycian, Dodonean, Latian, Diotean, Predatorian, Vltorean, Pistorean,
Ammonian, Elean, Celean, Atabyrian, Casian, Eleutherian, Nicephorean, Papean,
Lucetian, Olympian, Labryandrian, Lapria, Melionian, Assabian, Hercean,
Larysian, Enesyan, Pluuian, Triphalian: and with solemn hymns they will all
run unto thy temples, offering to thy image a thousand bunches of wild few,
for having purged these men of so great bestialitie as reigned in them:
Confident therefore in thy accustomed assistance, I expect for these impotent,
due help and aide.

Of idle and careless Fools: the fourth discourse.
IN the tribe of Fools, it is requisite we also number certain idle or
careless men, who seem always to be asleep in matters cocerning themselves,
being surprised with such a slothfulnes, that in a manner Diogenianus his
proverb Diogenianus.
in them is verified, which is, they sleep Epimenides his sleep; in their
actions and affairs manifesting themselves, I will not say rude or uncivil,
but even negligent, sluggish, and altogether sleepy headed. That may well be
said of these men, which otherwise is affirmed by the Cimmerias, who are
overshadowed with such obscurity and darkness, that bright shining Phebus hath
taken upon him perpetual banishment out of their minds, Homer thus saying of
those people: The sun on them his beams doth seldom cast:
Nor in his chariot mounts the glittering sky:
To earth descending when the day is past.
And amongst these may we rightly place that Vacia a Romaine citizen mentioned
by Seneca in his epistles, Seneca.
for a special example of carelessenes, who growing old in sloth, gave
orignall to a proverb; For when they would speak of an idle fool, and one
sottishly secure, they would say, Vaciahio sit us est; this is a sordid or
sluggish Vaciahio. It seems also that Ouid alludeth to these men in that
verse: Stulte, quid est somnus gelidae nisi mortis imago? Ouid.

What other is sleep but deaths pale image wan?
For questionless a fool of this kind is so drowsy in all his operations,
as hemay in a manner be said to be dead: whereupon master Iohn Dante having
relation to such miserable people, vtttered these verses following concerning
them: The world of these, no fame, will ay permit:
Mercy, and justice, hold them in disdain:
No words: to look, and leave them is more fit.
But if modern examples be of greater force, to discover Modern examples.
to the world this unhappy sort of men, we may observe that of Cauccio
Lupidio, for one most notable, who entering into an Inn, while his companions
supped merrily, and sat two hours at the table, he was two hours, and a
quarter in tying one of his shoe strings; and when the oaste thinking he had
supped with the rest, called upon him to go to bed, he yet demanded a bodkin
to make a new hole for his shoe tying, judging that this shoe sat not yet
clean enough to his mind. But surely that of Marchetto Piombino, is no less
famous, who going to Rome to seek a master and to learn some trade wherewith
to gain his living, in the way he light by chance upon a stone, the which he
began to spurn before him with his feet; and before he recovered the nearest
gate of Rome, all his companions that set out with him, returning back, found
him yet encombred about rolling that stone before him: finally in presence of
them all, he sat down upon the ground, and said: that when he once came to
Rome walls, he would thrust it so far in, as that afterward, it might never
more annoy such strangers as travelled thither. These miserable, and
unfortunate crew therefore, depriued of wit and understanding, having need of
Apolloes illumination and grace, they maintain the ensign of him, as of their
Protector, before their Cell, whilst they remain in obscurity and holes, in
this darksome Guest-house of their madness; wherefore with solemn
supplications, let us call upon god Apollo in their aid: saying:

An orizon to Apollo for idle and careless Fools.
OSacred Apollo, called by the Graecias Phoebus, who with thy golden hair or
beams comfortest both the one and the other Hemisphere, acceptable to all,
discourteous to none, cast such a light of thy divine beams upon this blind
and careless retinue of fools, that they may perceive themselves by thee in
mind rectified, and thus enjoying thy divine illumination, exalt and magnify
by this means, that thy virtue and power which slew the proud Cyclopes,
wounded the wicked sons of Niobe, and extinguished that cursed serpent
Python, whereupon thou drewest to thy self that glorious title of Pythius:
Thou planter of Amfrisus, inhabiter of Parnassus, lover of Helicone; lord of
fount Caballyne, patron of the Laurel, inuentor of the Harp, master of
Astrology, and prince of Physic, help these poor slimslacks, who have need
of internal remedies, for the restitution of their disturbed brain, destitute
wit, obfuscate understanding, lost memory: and as thou art called Pronopius,
for delivering the Beotias from gnats; Lemnius for curing the Sicilians of the
plague; Erethibius for healing the Rhodians of the Emeroydes, so I beseech thee
by these noble titles correspondent to thy great deity, with the others of
Thimbrius, Cataoneus, Cylleus, Tenateus, Larisseus, Tilposius, Leucadius,
Philleus, Lybissinus, and Symtheus, as also Patareus, of the town of Patara in
Lycia, Cyntheus of Cynthio in the i'll of Delos, Cyrrheus of Cyrrha, Clorius of
Claria in Colophonia, Lycius of Lycia, Crineus of a wood in Ionia so called,
and Marmorius of the castle Marmorio, that it may please thee to add unto
these epythites this one other of the great Physician of Fools idle and
slothful, to the end that thy name throughout the whole world, with exceeding
praises, may be extolled and magnified. But if in commiseration thou regardest
these men, as thou hast done the former nations, in honour of thee, thou shalt
see consecrated before thy image a pair of spectacles of sixty pound weight
in thy Temple of Delphos, as a true sign of thy having recovered, and healed
so senseless a people as these were, and always this one honour shall be
attributed to thee, that the blind see by mean of great Apolloes spectacles
at their noses: dispatch therefore, and make haste of thy help, for thou can
not delay never so little, but these now careless and idle Fools, will in the
end prove absolute dolts, and cockscombes.

Of drunken Fools: the fifth discourse.
IT is an evident, and manifest thing, that amongst the diverse kinds of
matter, that procured by the fume, and vapour of wine, is to be placed; which
constitutes these kind of Fools, whom we commonly call drunkards; they being
of this quality, that when they be heated and chafed with wine, they raise
such tumults and noise, as they resemble herein Steropus or Bruntus in Vulcane
his forge: wherefore Atheneus Atheneus.
the Philosopher in the fourteenth book of his Gymnosophistes, propounds this
question: wherefore Dionysius or Liberus is fained by the Poets to be mad, to
which demand he answers in the first chapter, with these words: Many (friend
Timocrates) feigned Dionysius to be mad, because they that use wine immoderatly,
become tumultuous; which matter was also touched by Ouid in these verses:
Beware of brawls oft stirred up in wine: Ouid.

And of that hand, which strikes out of time.
And Herodotus in this consideration saith, that wine Herodotus.

Xenophon also being to give good Xenophon.
counsel to the great Captain Agesilaus, about abstinence from wine, used
these words: Refrain drunkenness and madness; making, it should seem, no
difference between a drunkard and a mad Fool: for the vapour of wine mounting
up into the brain, takes from a man sight, knowledge, and judgment, and
overwhelms all the noblest faculties of our soul in an instant the which
thing Saint Ambrose touched excellently well in his S. Ambrose.
book of Fasting, saying: Cum ebrij fuerint de continentia disputant, vbi vnus
quisque pugnas suas enarrat, ibi fortia facta praedicat, vino madidus, somno
dissolutus, nescit mente quid lingua proferat, which signifies: when they are
drunk they argue of continence, where every one declares the dangerous
fights he hath been in, there he sets forth his valiantacts, thus drowned
in wine and drowsy with sleep, the mind conceives not what the tongue
utters. Whereupon in the Decretals, not without cause in the thirty ninth
distinction these profitable Gratianus.
words be registered: It is far from a wise mans part to apply himself to
eating, banqueting, and drunkenness: And in this point our Poet Dante, greatly
Dante,
commends the first Saturnian age, when they went not into cellars to broach
hogsheads, but ran with their hands to the fresh water rivers, saying: The
former age which was of purest gold,
Made acornes savoury, with sharpe hunger sauce:
And Nectar sweet, of river water cold.
Oh, happy were this our age, if with such abstinence it were endued, but the
truth is, they are now adays no other, but giddie-headed Pies, chattering
after fifty in the hundred, when the good Rhenish liquor begins to work.
Among those of late days, one example of Margute of Binasco is able to fill
the whole world with laughter; for when he hath drunk but three cups of
muskadell, then he sleeps like god Bacchus, and thus his wits riding on the
spur, at last he arrives with the first post in Lubberland, where at the
first setting of foot, he meets Tom Tospot, taking him for the best
companion in the world: but when the good Canary gets but up to his crown,
then like one of the Menades or Bacchus furious Nuns, he runs up and down
the house, filling every place with such terror, as it seems, another wild
Baiardo hath broken his halter, no man daring to come in the way of such a
headstrong beast as this: yet sometimes he procures to the company great
solace and recreation, as that night he did, when being drunk, and going to
bed, he beheld the moon, and thinking it had been a river, he said to his
companions and friends; Hold me I pray you, for fear I drown my self in this
river. Among the ancients, the Scythians, and Thracians are greatly blamed,
because the greatest glory they took, was in drinking while they were drunk:
wherefore Horace writes of them. The Thracians toss the bowles with merry
glee: Horace.

And Aristotle in reproach of the Syracusanes makes Aristotle.
mention, that sometimes they continued 90. days one after an other in this
irksome custom, of being every day drunk, holding it for a noble glorious
practise. It is written of Nero above all others, that he was so addicted to
ebrietie, as that for this cause he was ignominiouslie in stead of Tiberius
called Biberius; for Claudius, Caldius; and for Nero, Mero, or Wine. But he
that knownes not what an evil ebrietie is, let him only read the description
of Bacchus, set down by the Poets, for by this he shall be clearly satisfied
concerning the error thereof: For Bacchus was painted in form of a boy, in
that, drunkardes forgo their wit and understanding: in woman's form, because
drunkards perform no operation manlike: disroabed and naked, for that a man
can communicate no secret with ebrious men: and drawn in a chariot, because
instability and inconstancy is incident to them: with an ivy garland about
his head, in that, as the ivy weakens and ruinateth walls, so drunkards are
apt to all kind of waste spoil. And thus much may suffice for this race of
fools, who within the Hospital before their Cell, have god Abstemius for an
ensign, because he is the protector and advocate of all drunkardes: wherefore
let us have recourse unto him in this petition following, for their favour and
furtherance,

A petition to god Abstemius for drunken Fools.
WIth few words, but with so much the more groaning of spirit in such great
need, I come unto thee O thou contemner of Lyaeus, adversary to Bacchus, foe
to Liberus, and mortal enemy to Bromius, beseeching thee by that virtue
through which thou did effect, that the Locrians held it for a capital
offence, to be drunken with wine, stirredst up in Mosco Sophista, and
Apollonius Thianeus, thoughts here from so remote and alienate, they hating
the Phigalians above any contagious disease, in that their whole life was in
the bottom of cellars; that thou would reform these men of this foolish
desire they have, to be every day drunk. And if thou grant them this grace
and favour, we at this present make a vow, to hang up before thy image a
bottle full of good Zante cuite, in token of the health thou hast vouchsafed
this foolish crew, more of good will, then for any use thou hast of it. Peace
be with thee, and help those that have need of thy assistance.

Of harebraind and forgetful Fools: the sixth discourse.
AMongst the Physicians of late time, Iohn Fernelius Ambianus, in Fernelius.
defining what madness is, precisely utters these words, that, Amentia est vel
imaginationis, vel mentis occasus, atque priuatio, qua jam ab ipso ortu
perculsi affectique vix inopia mentis loqui discunt; which imports; that
madness is a privation, or falling away of imagination or the mind, wherewith
they stricken and possessed from their birth, scarcely through this impotency
of mind learn to speak: and he adds hereunto: In this kind is a
slippery Huius classis est fluxa, amissa memoria.
and brittle memory, the loss of which memory constitutes those sort of
fools whom we usually term harebrainde or forgetful; and these men in this
one point may easily be discerned; for they retain with them no discourse at
all, nor enjoy not the least spark of meditation, that opinion of Galens
continuing true Galen.
in the Proem of his book of Sects: that Memoriam commendat magna, frequens
rerum meditatio: great and frequent meditation of things confirms memory.
True it is that these fools may spring and arise from some defect in nature,
as also from some extraordinary accident, while a man is adultus, or in
adolescency, as examples by authors produced give testimony to the whole
world. Caelius amongst others speaking Caelius
of those, who by accident have lost their memory, saith, that Messala Corvinus
a singular Orator in his time, two years before he died, lost his memory in
such a sort, that he could not deliver four words together of one matter, or
that might be sensible in the understanding and ears of an hearer. The like
Bibaculus writes Bibaculus.
to have happened to Orbilius Beneuentanus, he that by Marcus Tullius is called
the severe or rigorous master towards his schollers. Among those so sterile of
memory, Cicero sets down the example of Curio the greater, who was of so
little and brittle memory, that Cicero.
sometimes in judgment he forgot the whole cause discussed of. And Seneca
writes of Caluisius Sabinus, that Seneca.
naturally he was endued with so frail a memory, as sometimes he would
forget Vlysses name, now Priamus, and anon that of Achilles, although before
they were settled in his mind. The admirable folly of Corebus, son to Migdo a
Phrigian, concerning memory, is celebrated by Lucianus and Eustasius; for he
contended to Lucianus. Eustasius.
number the most frequent and often waives of the sea, although naturally he
could not go above the number of five. And Plinie for a last example recites how
the Thracians are of so dull a wit, and fickle memory, that they Plinius.
cannot reckon to the number of four. And of Atticus the son of Herode
Sophista, he declares for a certain truth, that he was of so slippery a
retention, as he could not carry in mind the first letters or alphabet of his
own country language. The intemperature of the brain is the cause of al this
(as physicians affirm) which makes all the official, and functiue parts full
of heaviness and indisposition, and so through this hebetude (to use their
term) unapt to keep in mind any thing. Amongst these of our time, the
example of one Melchior Modern examples.
of Riuabassa is most notable, who in his time was so forgetful harebraind a
fool, that when any asked him his fathers or mothers names, he was not
sufficient to call them to mind. And this is that sottish Melchior which one
day at Bergamo fair demanded of his friend whether the Iewes were Christians
or no. As also that other example of Marchetto of Toletino is very ridiculous,
who being invited to dinner by certain gentlemen of Foligno, and by reason of
his age wanting teeth wherewith to chew, he forgot certain artificial teeth,
which bound fast together with a silver wier or thread, he was wont to use,
and returning home, he turned all things topsy turuie, even to a great barn
of corn which he had, thinking that undoubtedly he had left them there
within. These be therefore giddy headed and forgetful fools, who have
allotted unto them within the Hospital a room, which is called the lodge of
oblivion, having before the gate hanging out for a sign, the image of Caron,
as a god propitious and favourable to their necessities, upon whom therefore in
their aide and assistance I call, with this invocation following.

A supplication unto Caron for harebraind and forgetful Fools.
NOw I turn me to old Caron, prince of the Stigian lake, lord of Cocytus,
famous pylate of Lethes, principal keeper of Phlegeton: and by thy boat which
ferrieth over mortal men to the lake of oblivion, I entreat thee that thou
would look back upon this forgetful rabblement, who having lost their
remembrance of things worldly, stand plunged in the water of Lethes, nay
gorged up to the very throat: Vouchsafing help to this madging, thou shalt
before thy grave bearded image, and in the temple consecrated to thy name
amongst the Cizenians, see hanged up a case of crickets, as a sign of thy
helping these fools; who having now worse memories then a cricket, shall
then discover so ample remembrance, that blessed Caron to his great glory, may
remember himself to draw out of that Lethean gulf those men, who are now
continually drowned and buried therein: Bear up therefore the helm of thy
bark, and pass them over at an instant, while the memory thereof is fresh,
and the need greater then ever heretofore.

Of stupide, forlorn, and extaticall Fools: the seventh discourse.
IN the rank and number offooles are they also worthy to be placed, who in
their actions, words, deliberations, and resolutions, seem like immovable
and insensiblestones: whereupon, men assignethem the name of stupide, forlorn,
and extaticall fools, they being in a manner half dead in all the operations
that proceed from them: Of this race were the people Gousofanti, inhabiters of
one part of Libya, who were of so dead and fearful a disposition, that they
shunned the meeting with any one, neither could they be brought to converse
with any men living, they thinking themselves half kilde in other men's
company. The ancient Rhegians are likewise described to be of this nature, who
by their slothfulnes and wonderful timidity, raised a proverb, that when men
spake of an abject or cowardly man, they would say Rheginis timidior; more
fearful then the Rhegians: Who will deny that Artemon the Grecian to have
been a stupide fool, and stripped of all wit, that enclosed himself in a house
so long time between two walls, and to no purpose, causing two of his servants
to hold an iron target continually over his head, to the end nothing might fall
upon him from above, to his hurt or danger; and when sometimes he went abroad
out of the house, he was borne in a litter with a cover over it, bravely
accommodated for the same fear. What report Aristophanes and Lucianus of one
Aristophanes. Lucianus.
Pluto, but that he was so silly in mind, that every little puff of wind
made him tremble from head to foot? In our times we have a memorable example
of Monferrino, who being to make an Oration before certain persons, when he
was mounted into the pulpit shut his eyes, and with his eye lids closed, and
tongue trembling like a bubbling spring water, he could scarcely finish his
exordium before he was in a sort distracted. This likewise once fell out to
one Colombino Bergamasco (although he was thought to have had an excellent wit)
that in praying he made very many and often gestures; but his words were
choked in the half utterance, for while he was fervent in gesture, his words
as frozen, durst not discover themselves, there being so little correspondency
betwixt the one and the other. Among these examples, I judge that of the
Salonesian to be thanks worthy, who when he was come to the bar to plead
in favour of a client of his, was suddenly surprised with a cold sweat, which
put him into a tertian fever, that as it were in post, sent him headlong to
hell, or the region of Rhadamanthus. Now these Fools are properly recommended
to Sentinus, protector of them insensate, and before their Cell in the
Hospital they have erected his ensign, because they expect from him that
aide, which we in this petition following, earnestly seek for at his hands.

A petition to God Sentinus, for stupide, forlorn, and extaticall Fools.
FRom the patron of humane senses, life and vigour of these members, and the
virtue and power of our spirits, which grant convenient courage to persons
timorous and benumbed, do these poor stupide, forlorn Fools expect
opportune help and succour, to the end the valour thou gave to Theseus and
Pirithous to enter the irreturnable shadows of god Ditis his house; as also
that thou gave to Iason, and Typhis to furrow the raging waives of the
Colchian sea, he to ravish fair Proserpina, and the other to steal away the
golden-fleece, so much esteemed, that this virtue (I say) by thy grace being
found in them, they may appear to be miraculously delivered, to thy great
honour and glory, from the fear and amazement of death. The which if they
obtain (as they hope to do) they will offer to thy glorious deity, a fair
bunch of nettles, as acknowledging their recovered sense, from the sting of thy
divinity, and their wit lost happily restored: yield therefore to their
prayers, if this glory touch thee so near the hart, as rightly it ought.

Of notted, gross, and Fools of light carriage: the eight discourse.
THis gross sort of ignorants commoly called Oxe-heads, who natu rally
apprehend nothing, when they are in the market are so incircumspect, that a man
may make them believe that an ass is a parrate, are they whom we term by the
name of gross, notted, fools of light carriage. Egnatius to this purpose
makes mention of one Britannio, who naturally was so gross and blockish, as
his Battista Egnatio.
master could never make impression in him, of the least part of the Alphabet.
And Philonides the Miletane, large of body, but of as gross conceit as a
sheep, was of so dull an apprehension, that men minding to speak of a foolish
calfe, they prouerbially used to say Indoctior Philonide, more unlearned then
Philonides. In our days Modern examples.
we have Checco of Minerbio to observe for notable stupidity, who was of
opinion one day, that Bologna gellie, or Marmalate was made with butter, and
therefore on a fasting day at night he would eat none, while the rest of his
companions fell harde to the box, saying, they had long before been dispensed
withal for this injunction. Much more gross then this man did Santuccio of
Fermo show himself, who at a repast of certain good fellows at port Fermo,
eat a perri-winkle in stead of an oyster, affirming to all of them, that it
was the goodliest oyster that ever was seen in that port. That likewise of
Castruccio of Rouigo is no less sottish, who was verily made believe, that
Prester Iohn was no other but the vicar of Bebbe, or Saint Asses: And that
other reported of Scarlino of Viadana is as palpable, who was once of
irremooueable opinion, that the great church steeple of Pisa, sailed as far
as Legorne, and afterwards returned again to his proper place. But the truth
is, that this last makes up the whole matter which is recited of one
Andruccio of Scarparia, who one day made a friend of his believe, that in the
forest of Baccano were seen five hundredth Turkish galleies, which went to
take the city of Rome, that the Popes soldiers had with forty thousand
Ballown squirts performed such a piece of service, that they were all in a
manner broken, and overthrown in that wood, the ribs of them being
dispersed all over as they went. Of these ninnies, a number are borne in
Valtolina, and specially in Valcamonica, and they are so sottishly credulous,
that they believe whatsoever is spoken; as he which thought the Arsenal of
Venice was a shop of drinking glasses; and an other who believed that the
steeple of Saint Marks in Venice, for suspicion of treason A village five or
six miles from Venice.
was banished for ten years to Lizzafucina: another also being more blockish
then a dromedarie, who believed that the Buccentor or Venetian barge, booted it
self, and rid in a night from Venice to Tripolie in Soria; and another huge
Ox or Oarke, that the river of Poe had the water of Brenta to wife, and that
therefore Adige as a corival in this love, was angry with Poe, neither would
have any further coiunction with it: and last of all, that member of an ass,
or Cammel, who believed that Montebaldo of Verona, going one day a hunting,
light upon the Banditi, and being by them bid Or banished men.
stand, he took a crossebow in his hand, and with one shoot, killed twelve of
them. Wherefore these men have a Cell in the Hospital, which hath hanging out
for a sign, the Egyptians Ox, because to him, as to their protector and
advocate, they are recommended. Therefore I call upon him in this petition
following, for their assistance and aid.

A petition to the Egyptians Ox, for notted, gross, and Fools of light
carriage.
THese dull-pated-Calfes have recourse unto thee, thou most solemn Ox of the
Egyptians, by all men called, Apis, and Serapis, to obtain at thy hands this
favour, that seeing they be Oxen (as thou art) thou wilt be unto them so
gracious, that they become not one day more gross then Camels. For that
honour therefore which is done unto thee in Egypt, which far exceeds the
golden Tortoyse of the Troglodytes; the gilded Aspes of the Phenicians; the
Assyrians golden Dove; the Thessalians golden Stork; the gilded Lioness of
Ambracia; or those of the Albanes golden Dragon; the Thebans gilded Weazell; or
the golden Cow of the Tenedians, I pray and rebeseech thee to grant unto them
this demanded grace and favour. The which if thou shalt do (as we hope no
less) in the Temple consecrated to thee, and before thy image thou shalt see
placed a bottle of hay, with an hay-stacke hard by, to show that these men
continue by thy favour in their oxen estate, not growing to grosser stupidity.

Of dottrels and shallow-pated Fools: the ninth discourse.
THese Unfortunate, and Lourdish sort, that so often have their wits a
wooll-gathering, their heads being as empty of wit, as an egshel, and that
through the absurdity of their gestures, words and cogitations move every
one to laughter that hears them, in this Catologue of Fools are termed,
dottrels, and men shallow-pated. And such did the Bithinians discover
themselves to be, who (as Caelius writes) climbed Caelius.
up to the tops of mountains, and there saluted and talked with the moon,
although from her they received no answer at all. The Boetians, as Authors
testify, retained also this kind of Folly: whereupon the Poet Horace saith:
Boetians borne in gross and foggy air. Horace.

Amongst those of late days, the example of Francino of Matelica may suffice,
who not forbearing to play the fool kindly, took his Mothers rock every
morning, she being 70. years of age, sitting in the sun, he would needs be
spinning of varne, but he so besnared the thread tow together, as the old woman
being stark mad, was fain to break the rock continually upon his head,
and thus rating and chiding, she half despaired of her son whom she saw to
have so little wit and understanding. Mattuccio of Valuasson poor silly
soul, was also such an one, for when his father sent him into the country, to
see what the harvest folks did, although he was four and thirty years old,
he fell a playing with the children at Musse and Scailepin, occupying himself
the whole day in such fopperies: afterwards returning home, without relating
any thing to that purpose for which he was sent. There was an other also of
Castle Bubano in Romagna, in wit sympathizing much with the name of his
country, who barren of all conceit, one day when he should have carried
victuals to certain workmen, by his masters commandment, he went into a
corne-field to make of these droanes and oaten pipes that children use to play
upon, and consumed the whole day in these ninneries, the workmen expecting in
vain that this hammar-headed dolt should bring them their dinner, being
half dead with hunger. But this example of Tonino Buffalora, gives life to
themall, who in his return from Rome, passing through the forest of Rauenna,
he filled a wallet full of flies and gnats, being such great ones as that wood
affords, and a good large pillowbeere with horse-flies, carrying them into
his country, where being arrived, he presently sent to his friends and
kinsfolks, that they would come and see him, for he would present them with
certain strange conceits which he had brought with him from Rome; who though
they knew him to be but a fool, yet took they him not for so very a sotte as
at last they found him; for taking them all a tone side into a secret chamber,
he powered out before them that huge number of flies, gnats, and hornets, which
flew in the eyes and faces of every one, with some small disturbance, yet
giving them so great occasion to laugh, as surely for the novelty of this jest
they were ready to burst therewith. Fools therefore of this brood be all
termed dizzards and shallow-pated, who within this Hospital have hanging out
for a sign, the Samian sheep, as their great favourer: and therefore in this
supplication we will request his aide and succour.

A supplication to the Samian sheep, for shallow-pated, and dottrell Fools.
IF the honour which the ancient Samians did unto thee (O reverend Sheep) be
such, as it far exceeds that which the Delphians did to the wolf thy
enemy, and greatly surmounts that which was performed to the Romaines
goose, and the Egyptians goat, and if thy glorious worship be one of the
greatest solemnities that ever any people hath religiously celebrated; by this
honour, and by such worship, I now entreat thee, that of these thy sheep thou
wilt have that care, which unto thy self being one, seems convenient, and so
much the rather, because if thou be not propitius unto them now at their
need, thou wilt loose their devotion, who readily rebelling from sheep will
give themselves in pray to god Castron: If therefore Calfe.
thou vouchsafe them help, we will offer a cheese of sheep milk, like to
those of Gualdo or Rimini, to thy sacred image; which shall give all the world
occasion to speak of thee, and all men shall cry out: Live sheep and
sheepes-heads for ever.

Of senseless and giddie-headed Fools: the tenth discourse.
THere is a nest of certain Fools, who vulgarly are called, Fools
Senseless, and giddie-headed: and by these circumstances they may be
discerned: for they never speak to the purpose, do according to the time,
perform any thing worthily, nor produce any thing seriously, or with gravity,
but in every speech, gesture, word, sign, action they are so simple, that they
may deservedly be called of every one by the name, of Silly, and Senseless
creatures. Hereupon Marcus Tullius in the second of his Orator, declaring
Cicero.
the nature property of one these, saith thus: Qui tempus quid postulet, non
videt, aut plura loquitur, aut se ostentat, aut eorum, cum quibus est, vel
dignitatis, vel commodi rationem non habet, aut denique in aliquo genere
inconcinnus, aut multus est, is ineptus la. He that obserueth not what the
time requires, babbling out many things, vaunting himself, having no respect
to the dignity, or commodity of those in whose company he is, or that, (to
conclude) in any kind whatsoever, is inseasonable, or superfluous, may be said
to be foolish. In my opinion that ancient Amphistides, named by Caelius, may
well Caelius.
be placed in the number of these men; who was of so flat and rebated a brain,
as he knew not thus much, whether he came of a father and mother, as commonly
we do, or no. Acesias the Physician may likewise be numbered among these
senseless; for this was his property, that when he had any cure in hand, he
administered to him, in a quite contrary course, to that he should have done:
whereupon Paulus Manutius uses this proverb. Paulus Manutius.
Acesias Medicatus est: Acesias did such a cure. Among those of our time,
Franceschino of Montecuculo, Modern examples.
was held for a great Dizzard, who conforming himself in actions with the name
of his country, entering into the court to defend a client of his, alleged
such testimony and proof, as was quite contrary to the poor man. A certain
fellow called Hortensio of Sarni, was by a judge in some particular cause,
reproved for a Fool of this kind, for having framed a process, for the
Latinitie thereof altogether excellent and Ciceronian yet in the rest of the
clauses, so impertinent and out of order, as the Judge was urged to tell him,
that another time he might do well, and bring before him some country or
Scottish Jigs, for such bables would better content him in the reading, then
such a bald process of Piouan Arlotto. That Castelline grosser showed himself
to be anotable Fool and buzzard, who when he should have served a maid with
starche, sold her in steed thereof, powdered Arsenicke Christalline, who through
his folly caused the mistres of the house well near to die with the fume of
the same. No less a wise-aker did one Lirone, some applesquier, manifest
himself, who when he was willed to scum the pipkin that ran over, not knowing
what to do, put out all the broth, leaving the meat dry in the pipkins
bottom, while the Cooke was ready to serve in dinner. No less sottish was
Bastiano of Monselice, who serving a certain Neapolitane Signior, that
commanded him to set upon the table some citrons and oranges, went into the
orchard, and plucked up by the roots the best plants of the same that were in
the whole orchard, bringing them all in a bundell to his master, with great
damage, and no small reproach to himself. A like example to this, is that of
another Bergamascan blockhead, who being commaded by his master, that he should
go up into the Lobby, and fetch some billets to burn, he went with an hatchet
in his hand and began to hew hard at certain beams that sustained the house;
when his master observing his delay, fetch him down with sound bastinadoes on
his shoulders. But this other example of Lucchino of Fusolara is not altogether
thread-bare, for he serving one of these that sell Malmsie, whiles his master
willed him to entertain a certain honest man his friend, and that he should
taste of every hogshead, meaning that he should broach them, took one of
those great beetles that wood-cleauers use, with which he staued more then
four, before his master was ware of his own error, or the others
simplicity. Marie this last example, is that which carries it, for Bartolo of
Calepio in Bergamasco, being servitor in Venice with a very rich chandler, who
one day being to make Tapers, the vessel boiling hot, and the wax being
melted, demanded what it was that so boiled in the vessel; to whom his master
smoothly answered without laughing, that it was sugar, and honey mixed together
to make marchpanes of: whereupon this liquorish cockscomb tarrying while his
master would be out of the way, he took one of the shop ladles, and before
the wax was cold, while it was good and hot, he suppes me up a ladell
full of the same, so melting his teeth, tongue, and bowels, that he was
ready in a manner to burst, and recounting this accident to his master, he
likewise with laughing almost split himself, perceiving this nyddicocke to
be thus beguiled. These therefore be senseless or giddie-headded Fools, who
in the Hospital enjoy a Cell; which hath hanging out the goddess Bubona for a
sign, as one truly favourable to such like men: wherefore in this invocation
following they be recommended to her.

An Invocation upon the goddess Bubona, for senseless and giddie-headed
Fools.
THese Geese of Romagna, Puglian sheep, and Asses of Marcanconitan, infinitely
recommend themselves to the most happy goddess Bubona, friend to Pan, Lady
of the Flocks, keeper of the Herds, and most faithful guardian of the
sheepfolds: and they conjure thee by the love of Pasiphaes Bull, Aristo
Ephesian his Ass, Cratides the shepherd his goat, and by the mare so dearly
beloved of Fuluius, that thou wilt also protect this flock of the foresaid
creatures, little differing from them: and if it fall out that thou shalt
undertake their tuition, as they desire, they will consecrate unto thee a wild
whole roasted Buffle, and therewith sing an excellent hymn, which in every
verse shall make mention of Bubona, and the Buffle together: Reach therefore thy
helping hand to these Buffles, if thou mindest that this invocation shall be
consecrated with all honour, and glory.

Of plain lourdish, and natural Fools: the eleventh discourse.
THere be certain silly wretches in the world, so blockish in reasoning, harsh
in proceeding, in their operatios, proceedings, negotiations so foolish, that
in al right they obtain the title of lourdish natural fools in the world,
being distinct from al those we have before made mention of. And if we be
content to refer our selves to the examples of ancient writers, we must
necessarily affirm, that Miltiades so celebrated by Homere, was one of these
archdolts: for he then came to succour Troy, when the city was already
ruinated, and destroyed, and therefore it grew into a proverb with Lucian.
Mitiadis auxilium, Lucian.
the succour of Miltiades: when men would speak of slow aide, or succours, or
of a gross and witless man. One Mammachutus also is made famous by
Aristophanes for this one point; for in his proceedings of the world, he was so
stupide and insensate, as from him it comes that all naturals and
cockscombes, are as it were prouerbially called Mammachutes. This dizzardly
crew is made renowned by Gratianus of Bologna in his Comedies; for when you
hear such a like man discourse, you would not wish to give ear to a more
babbling matter: and so great is the gullerie thereof as you must needs laugh
extremely: for besides that his speech his foolish; his discourse from all
purpose; the end evil sorting with the beginning; his gesture unapt; voice
harsh, and actions unseemly: he further makes such childish conclusions, as
the same will make any one that hears them, to cough with laughing. Giacomo
of Pozzuola, is likewise one that illustrateth our modern age with his
fopperies; for when he goes, he seems another lame Aristogiton, when he
speaks a man would think he had a ball in his mouth; when he gestureth, one
would imagine that he deluded Nature, and Art; when he recites any thing,
one would judge by his laughing that he were playing with a feather; and when
he discourses upon any matter, you cannot discern him from the most notable
noddy, and ioult-head in the world. What shall we say of Andreuccio of Marano,
that famous lob-lolly, who reciting a lease wherein ^s comprehended, that
certain fields were let for two hundred Venetian Liraes, said thus in
Latin. Moneta autem Venetiana valebat ducentis libribus pro affitandis illis
campibus? As also that other foppish Pedant of Saint Arch-angelo, what shall
we say to him, who giving vulgar construction to that Latin beginning of
Cato: Cum ego Cato animaduerterem quam plurimos homines errarein via morum, he
said in the mother tongue to this effect: Althoug I Cato knew very well, that
many men ran roving over the land of the Moors? Conformable to that other
pedagogicall ass, who expounding that verse of Virgill, Ille ego qui quondam
gracili modulat us auena,
Said, I Iohn Nicolo, who was condemned for the stinking creuices that were
carried to Rauenna. And what say you to that goodly Logician scarce worth three
farthings, who expounding those verses of Peter Hispanus, Barbara, celarent,
Dary, Ferro, Baralipton.
Said, that the barbarous soldiers of king Darius had put on their head pieces,
murmuring exceedingly: and then declaring the meaning of the other; Celantes,
Dabitis, Fapesmo, Frisesomorum,
Expounded, that those murrions or headpeeces, made the Phrigians and Moors
together astonished: then coming to the other, Cesare, Camestres, Festino,
Baroco, Darapti,
He interpreted, that Caesars men were arrived at Mestra, and that they made
haste to be upon their bones: and last of all lighting upon this verse,
Felapton, Disamis, Datisi, Brocardo, Ferison,
He expounded, that Caesar said to Philip Anthonie and the rest of his friends;
stab, and thrust me these men through with your swords. Was not this of
Martinello of Villafranca, an apparent cockscombrie, who making the
superscription of a letter that went to his son in the University at Bologna,
writ thus: To the divine spirit of my son Andrew Scarpaccia, who frequents
the lectures of the greatest Physician in all Bologna, who in three years will
become an other Falopia, if God of his grace preserve him living: with this
direction underneath: In Bologna near to asses tower in a woman's house that
lets chambers by the month. These therefore be doltes and naturals, and
for the same cause are recommended to god Fatuello, partaker and defender with
drawn sword of such like people; wherefore having the image of such a like
God upon the door of their cell, it is requisite that with this invocation
following, we reverence and call upon his name.

An invocation to God Fatuello, for lourdish and natural Fools.
MAy it please thee great monarch of naturalles, the true ghost and spirit of
all fantasticks, by the resonance of thy name, conformable to these fools,
with thy genius in like manner to favour this blockish band of naturals, in
all humility having recourse to thee, and by that Temple which thou hast in
Valcamonica, where so many lobbes merely depend on thy dominion and empire;
these men beseech thee that though in name thou be but a fool, yet in their
actions do not so show thy self and power: and thus doing before thy image,
they will immolate some famous niddicocke which shall be a true sign, that by
thy grace and favour they are now no longer fools. Now this is the reward
thou shalt have if thou be ready and athand with thy succour.

Of vicicious Fools: the twelfth discourse.
THere be in the world certain fools, who together with the deminution of
brain, and loss of wit, retain in them certain vices, which seem
sometimes to proceed from a kind of dexterity in them; but in truth they are
rather derived from the defect of a wit corrupt, and depraved, then any thing
else; in this manner, like mules kicking at every one that comes near them,
through the malignant nature and condition they have: And these kind of men we
thought good to term by the name of vicious fools, for that a fitter or more
conformable word cannot be found out, to impose upon them. Some man peradventure
may think that one Cippius, named by Lucilius, may well be placed amongst
vicious Lucilius.
fools: who indeed in this respect was a fool, for that he suffered others to
use his wife dishonestly: and in this other consideration he was vicious, who
because he would not appear to be a withal, fained himself then to sleep,
when an other watching in Cupids palestra, wrestled hard with her. He in the
Hospital of Milan seemed no less a vicious fool, who called strangers
Modern examples.
to him saying; that he would show them the valley of Iehosaphat, and by
little and little discovering to them his bare buttocks, he made every one
blush for shame that came near him. Another there was, who requested every one
that he might kiss him, and the man drawing near, either he would break an
urinal upon his head, bite him with his teeth, or do him some other kind of
mischief. It is recounted of a certain vicious fool, that standing one day
at a window, and seeing a fair young maid in an other right over against him,
as if in an instant he had been inflamed with her love, he said to her,
Signor a lei volete been adio? Lady will itplease you my heate to cool?
Signor no, perch sete un Sier Matthio: No sir, said she, because you seem but
a fool: then he replied; Lasciatemi adungue fare il fatto mio: Let me yet
furbish you with my tool. Of an other vicious fool this prank is reported;
that one day in the market place he got up upon a butchers stall, and gathering
about him a goodly audience, he began to cry out, that al men might come and
hear him: wherefore the people being assembled together he said; Imagine that
I am the great beast which calls a counsel of the other lesser; for my part
I will go break my fast, go you and hang your selves if you will: and thus
he deluded the people, departing with laughter and scorn to every one. This
man was much like to an other, who at a time of solemn council, about a
treaty of certain public affairs, entered into the counsel chamber, and
cried out aloud: I give my verdict that every one of you be dawcockes. And one
Norandino of Sauignano was not much unlike these, being a most vicious fool,
who at a time, when a great disputation was held in the city of Cesena, near
to that town, and passing by chance through the place where all the disputats
were gathered together, making room amongst them all with a good quarter
staff, he spake with a loud voice: I hold this conclusion, that Sauignano is
not distant from Cesena above ten miles; and next I maintain this other, that
Sauignano is male, and Cesena is female; as also i'll stand to this, that more
people will give ear to me, which am but a Fool, then to you, who would
appear to be wise: And last of all, I will affirm, and prove this other,
that if ever a wiseman went thorough Cesena, I should not be a fool my self.
These of this kind therefore are called vicious fools, and within the
Hospital they enjoy a cell which hath hanging without, the image of the
goddess Themis, upon whom, as their protectrix in this under supplication we
will call for help.

A supplication to goddess Themis for vicious Fools.
O Great daughter of heaven and earth, so wonderfully beloved of Iupiter, as
thou art desirous of his love, be not niggardly of thy help to those, who being
fools and vicious, seek at the hands of Themis, the goddess of reasonable
demands, that which is requisite for them to request and sue for: They
demand therefore this just and lawful suit; that of Heaven thy father thou
would obtain wit for their understanding and virtue for their minds, for
if by thy grace and favour they shall be delivered from such a defect; in thy
temple so much honoured by the Boetians near the river Celisus, thoushalt see
offred unto thee a Spanish mule, which will be an evident sign of the great
victory and triumph thou shalt obtain by such a delivery.

Of malicious and despiteful fools: the thirteenth discourse.
SOme men there be, that inwardly have inserted in the such a spirit, as if
they hap at any time to be offended or injuried by any one, with a foolish
wilfulnes at one instant, they begin to contend with him; and as of the
offenders side, injuries and offences multiply, so likewise together with
hatred, do continual rancors and despightes increase on their part: so as the
matter comes to this pass, that brutishly thus hammering and boiling in
their minds, they obtain the name of malicious and despiteful fools.
Amongst ancient examples, that peradventure of Cleomedes Astipalensis a man of
mighty strength, named by Plutarke, may well be placed; who being defrauded of
a certain reward Plutarch.
due unto his virtue, entered for this cause into such malice and despite, as
one day he laid his shoulders to a pillar which sustained the common school,
wherein were all the children of the chiefest men of the place, and bearing it
furiously to the ground, he killed the master and all those young youths
together. In the number of these also may that Merganore in the Poet Ariosto be
reckoned, who for the death of his two sons, conceived such mortal hatred
against womankind, as look howe many women soever came within his circuit,
they were al for this cause rudely scoffed, and hardly entreated by him. For a
malicious and peevish Fool Modern examples.
of late days, a certain literate quoy quanquam, is of all men crowned, or
such a kind of peevish Poul-iobham, that for the biting of a flea, could find
in his hart to kill the whole world, when he is in his spleen sir Iohn
Chimneis humour, he fears not all the great ordinance of the Tower; for envy
and despite take away from him all foresight, of the danger and blow that
hangs over the head of his fury. Wherefore, to this our purpose, it is
reported of him, that on a time another calling him, head of a base viol, he
was through this word moved to such choler, that he reached him such a blow,
which missing him, lighting upon a pillar by, broke all this Fools own hand
arm; and when he clearly saw the damage which redounded to himself, entering
into greater fury then before, he threw a flinte-stone to have hit him on the
head, which lighting against the wall, and recoiling back, took himself on
the breast, so that raging presently with double fury and madness, he went to
run his head against the other mans belly, who drawing back, he ran his own
head against the wall, broke it all over: and last of all, having no otherthing
wherewith to show his spleen, he indiscreetly out of his stomach powers a
belch in his face, saying: Go to, take this, seeing I can in no other sort
revenge my self. Christoforo of Crispino was a notable wayward, and despiteful
Fool, who because on a time another said unto him (he being of rude and homely
aspect) you are a welfauoured young man; abhorring this mans ironical speech,
he threw a cheese at his breast, and because he took up the cheese carried it
away to eat, he sent after him a knife which he had; but he taking up the knife
also to serve his turn to cut the cheese withal, being near to a bakers shop,
the other took up as much bread as he could in his hand and threw it at him;
the which in like manner he taking up to serve him to eat his cheese withal,
the other would last of all have thrown an empty cup without wine at him,
which was ready at hand: but he saying unto him: nay gentle brother, but fill
it with wine, and then send it after me in gods name. With these words he grew
into such a fury, as running to a fountain near hand, he would needs have
cast it full of water at him: but this man smiling, and flying away like a
treacherous Parthian, or sneering companion, said: I will have the knife, the
bread and the cheese, and let the cup and the water remain with thee, for we
are now share and share like: and thus did he delude the last blow of this
despiteful Fool, who in the end perceived that he was exceedingly derided for
his foolish enterpise. A more famous example of malicious Folly cannot be
produced, then that which divine Ariosto sets down in perverse and wicked
Gabrina, especially in that Stanza, which begins thus: Hark thou (said
she) that art so stout, and fell,
As thou contem'st, and make a scorn of me,
For if thou knew what news I could thee tell
Of her, whom dead, thou dost bemoan I see:
Then would thou me behold with merry glee,
But rather then I will the same declare,
Thou shalt me into mammocks pull and tare.
For the cursed old wretch, with all furious despite, sought to wreak her
self, on miserable Zerbino, not imparting to his lamentable Fortune one only
spark of pity or commiseration, like a devilish and impious witch, as no
question she was. These kind of men are therefore deservedly called,
despiteful, or malicious Fools; and in the Hospital they have a Cell, which
hath the goddess Nemesis hanging out for a sign, to whom in this their so
great need, let us have recourse, it being that goddess, who commonly hath
care of this kind of Fools.

A petition to goddess Nemesis, for despiteful and malicious Fools.
WIth all zeal possible, and as great vehemence as may be granted unto us,
we implore thy greatest favour and help, O thou sacred goddess, by the
ancients termed Rhamnusia, because in Rhamnunte a city of Asia thy image is
seen, made by the hand of Phidias, having recourse unto thee, because we know
there is no better remedy for these despiteful Fools, then the assistance
and aid of that goddess, who punishing and chastising the wicked and
offenders, is worthily held for the curer of these Fools wounds: wherefore if
we obtain that succour, which from so just a goddess we may well hope for, be
assured that thankful for thy favours, we will offer in the Temple of Adrastus
consecrated to thee, an hand-flasket of skalions and garlic, and all of us
will salute the name of Adrastia, belching forth all despiteful savours,
evident arguments of the recovery procured to these men, in whose behalf, we
direct unto thee this present invocation; heal them therefore, and peace
remain with thee.

Of ridiculous Fools: the fourteenth discourse.
THere be some fools, who day by day perform things so strange, fantastical,
unusual, that partly for the rarity of them, and partly for their excess
therein, make any one laugh that sees or gives any ear unto them: and
hereupon it is, that all men call them ridiculous fools, having a name
conformable to the actions and deeds they every day perform. Iustine the
Historiographer, among the ridiculous follies of Sardanapalus, sets down
this for one, that he being above measure delighted in womanlike effeminacies,
apparelled himself sometimes in feminine habit, and so intruding amongst the
girls and young wenches, he used the rock and spindell as they did,
performing all those things which women are accustomed to practise. Homers
folly also is recounted among parts ridiculous; for it is reported of him, that
he would miserably have strangled himself for this occasion only, because he
could not dissolve an enigma or doubtful question, the which by channce was
propounded unto him by certain sailers or mariners. This other of the Poet
Philemon is very excellent, who (as Valerius Maximus declares) seeing an ass
Valerus Maximus.
that eat certain figs, which were set upon the table, laughed so extremely
thereat, as he burst at the mirth he made to himself with this matter. A like
example to this, is that of Margutte in Luigi Pulci, who laughed while he gaped
again, seeing a monkeie to put on his Luigi Pulci.
boots. Lampridius amongst the ridiculous fopperies Lampridius
of Heliogabalus, mentions also this, that sometimes he would be drawn in
a chariot by four naked harlots, other whiles he would visit all the public
stews in Rome, giving rewards to all bad and common women, whom he termed
his fellow soldiers; and an other time apparelling himself like a strumpet, he
discovered himself not to be a Romaine Emperor, but some trencher buffon or
parasite, to al the world. But yet that folly of Nero surpasses them all, for
he had a desire to bring forth like women; he made a stallion and bardasso
boy of himself at one instant; and touching Sporus his Ganimed, he entered
into this notable folly, that he would needs see him of a male as he was,
turned into a woman by the Physicians. Iohn Rauisius Textor puts Textor.
one Zenophantus in the number of fools ridiculous, who was of this quality,
that the more he contended to refrain laughing, the more vehemently he burst
out a giggling. Atheneus in the fifth of his Gymnosophistes, while he recites
the follies of mad Antiochus king of Atheneus.
Syria, rehearses likewise these other very ridiculous: that he practised and
conversed as well with the basest vulgar sort, as with gentlemen and great
lords; and he carrowsed more willingly with the vilder sort, then with his
barons or knights; wheresoever he knew any assembly of dissolute or vain
young men to be gathered together, thither would he goevnlooked for, carrying
with him his cittern or lute; and thus thrust himself into their company:
Oftentimes also laying aside his Princelike habit, he went with a lantern in
his hand into the market place, taking this and that man by the hand, desiring
them all that they would give him their voices consents; for sometimes after
the Romaine manner, he would be made Edile, and otherwhiles tribune of the
people; often in the presence of noble personages, tumbling and dancing like
some stage fool, to the great abashment of those that were present at such
indignities. Among the ridiculous fools of our time, we may well count a
cockscombe called Pedruccio of Modern examples.
Biagrasso, to be one, who went up and down the streets gathering together all
the horse and cowes dung he could meet withal, and carried it home for
provision saying, that in time of dearth that grut or riffe-raffe would be
good to make an Italian Torto withal, wherewith A meat made of dow and scrapped
cheese, which baked upon a pan looks like marchpane.
to preserve his life, in despite of all usurers. Michelino of Papozza is also
an other ninnie, that makes all the world to laugh at his folly: for in summer
he will put a corselet on his back with some good furred gaberdine over it, and
above all this, a large target after the ancient Romaine fashion, affirming,
that he would by no means that the sun piercing him with his beams,
should make him to sweat. But Santiccio of Ritonda, is a ridiculous and
fower-eared fool, for all the summer he doth nothing else but take frogs and
flea them, carrying all the skins of them together to a furrier, to whom he
counts them saying; the Romaine Emperors never wore so rare and fine skins
as might be made of these his excellent and dainty ones. All such like men as
these therefore are called ridiculous fools, because they execute follies for
the most part, foppish and ridiculous, and their Cell in the Hospital hath
hanging out for a sign, the image of god Risus, adored of the ancients, they
being recommended unto him, as their peculiar godhead and patron: wherefore
with this ridiculous petition following, let us solemnlie for their help and
aide call upon him.

A petition to god Risus for ridiculous Fools.
I Can not but with great giggling and laughter turn my self unto thee, O thou
son of Iupiter, or Bacchus, friend to all Sycophants, constant affectionate
to drunkards, enemy to all molestation, more then to contagion or sickness,
nourished by Venus, brought up by Cupid, maintained at the charges of goddess
Flora, a brave fellow for thy life, a good companion for thy wit, a mercenary
advocate for the time, and with old Democritus in behalf of these men, make
unto thy self a loud squeaking laughter, like them, the tinkling of frying
pannes make in Saint Marks place: for if it were not thou that gave help
and nourishment to these ridiculous fools, all the whole Hospital would be
but in a miserable plight; neither would any thing but sadness and melancholy
be discerned over all: but these men by thy favour doing their endeavour, do
yet make their followers merry, and remove from their minds that
discontetment, which they receive from humours phreneticall, delirant,
melancholic, and savage, and other such like unto these: wherefore many men
are not a little bound unto thee, in perceiving by thy means, their harts
exhilarated, and minds replenished with exceeding alacrity, the which favour
and grace if thou continue, as in these particular sort of fools, we desire
thou shouldest, be sure that in thy temple thou shalt hear more prodigious
laughters, then ever were heard at any of Heliogabalus, or Commodus their
banquets: And all this shall be done to please thee, who art the occasion of
all laughter.

Of ostenting and vain glorious Fools: the fifteenth discourse.
THe greatest number of fools that we find, may peradventure be these
whereof at this present we discoursing, make clear and glorious mention of
the same to the world, and by this glorious title or imposition, we term them
vainglorious or osteting fools: for they love nothing more, contend earnestly
after no other matter, nor with greater care and anxiety covet or desire any
thing more then the glory of the world, whereof they are so greedy and
desirous, as covetous men of gold, Bears of honey, bees of flowers; it being
the breakfast, dinner, and dissert of all their operations: and by the reason
of this gross matter they have in their heads, their wits cannot enter into
the sayings of the wise, denounced against them: as that of Aristotle, who in
the books of his secrets to Alexander, saith, that Nulla tanta fortitudo est,
vt superbiae pondus Aristotle.
sustinere valeat: there is no fortitude so great which is able to sustain the
weight and burden of pride. This of Aristophanes who was wont to say; Non
oportere in Aristophanes.
ciuitate nutriri leones: Lions should not be nourished in acitie. And that
other of Demades to the Athenians, Demades.
who minding to ascribe to Alexander divine honours, said, Videte quaeso
ciues, no, dum ad coelum gloriosum istum tollitis, in terram deijciatis: beware
good citizens, least while you go about to extol this glorious man to heaven,
you throw him not down to the earth; but in such sort are they blinded with
this cursed ambition, that even pierces and sheatheth it self in their harts,
that they have lost all apprehension of understanding, and what light soever
was therein, running in post haste after the least spark of this glory,
voluble and inconstant as the wind: the words of these men are perfumed,
odoriferous like amber-greece, neither do they loose them fro their toongs, but
as a piece of fine sugar, they come sweet fro their mouths; all their gestures
are by symmetry compounded in the garden of the graces; their steps be measure
proportion it self, like Archimedes his geometrical instruments, that one may
not be longer then an other, nor this shorter fetched then that; and the
carriage of their bodies is like to a peacock turning round about and
beholding himself: or to a swollen Turkie cock, ruffling all spread through a
yard: the state they observe is like an other Iupiter upon his golden throne,
amidst all the other gods: their motion resembles a wagtailes going upon the
ground, the majesty of their gate, is like to that of a Romagna goose when she
goes through the barn yard; the glearing of their eyes is like to a cat, when
she glicketh her self: their standing still, is like to a swollen toad, when
she lies still breaking upon the earth: his speech makes more haste then an
Ante, when he is better laden then usually: and to conclude, all his actions
are so affected and full of ostentation, that a more strange or odious thing
then these glorious fools cannot be met withal: Among vain-glorious fools
the ancient Aruenians are by writers numbered, who as diverse report, vaunted
themselves to be borne of the Troiane race; and therefore they called
themselves brothers to the Romaines, Lucan speaking of them in his first book:
The Aruenians that themselves durst brothers fain
To Latians, that of Troiane race remain.
And like unto these was one Murrhanus, not he that makes oil jars, but an
other, of whom Virgill speaks in the twelfth of his Aeneides saying:
Murrhanus who with lofty words sets forth Virgill.

The titles of his ancestors great worth.
Among other examples of glorious fools, ancient writers place this of
Misenus Aeneas his trumpeter, who held himself so singular in that
profession, as that he durst challenge the maryne gods or Tritones, to sound
with him: as also those of Martia, who provoked Apollo to the self same
conflict: Thamir is a Thracian, who was so bold as to thrust herself in
amongst the Muses to sing; and together with these that of Araene, who would
needs contend with Minerua for weaving of wool: but last of all that of
Cassiope daughter to Cepheus, who would be preferred before the Nereides: as
likewise Niobe would have been before Latona, Antigona the daughter of
Laomedon, before Iuno; and Lychion Deucalions daughter before Diana: and in
truth the tribe of glorious, many-asses is greater then the rest, because in
all times we have seen trial, that the brain hath boiled more on this, then
any other side: what shall we say of that inhumaine Remulus, who attributing too
much unto himself, and over highly pleased in his own valour, condemned the
Troians besieged in Italy, of effeminacy and cowardice, Virgill relating these
proud words of him: Before them all, most sturdy he and proud
Went thundering out, unworthy words always
Vaunting himself, with clamours, shrill and loud: Cornelius Tacitus.

What may be thought of that Martus, one of the basest crewe of the Boetian
people, who was so bold as to make himself a god? What of Appion the
grammarian, who undoubtedly promised him immortality, to whom he did but
dedicate any of his works? Menecrates the physician also, was beyond all
measure glorious, who was never wont to take any reward for such patients as
he cured, but requested this only at their hands, that they would call
themselves his humble servants, and term him an other Iupiter: Nestorius the
heretcike was also one of this number, for in an oration that he made to the
people of Constantinople, he soothed himself so greatly, that the next day
following he promised heaven to every one of them: And Rhemnius Palemon the
grammarian or Pedant, is not far different from these, he being wont to
glory, that learning was borne and came into the world with him, as also with
him it was like to perish. But why do I pass over Paulus Samosatenus, who went
through the market places, streets, and highways, vaunting publicly of his
learning, and caused whatsoever came first into his mouth to be set down in
writing by certain registers? As also why do I conceal the Emperor Domitian,
who delighted in nothing more then this, to be called a great Lord, and God?
wherefore Eusebius saith, Domitian first commanded that himself should be
called a Lord and God; and a certain flattering Poet made of him these verses:
The Edict of our Lord and God,
Which doth alliudgements ratify.
And to what end omit I the Prince Caius Caesar, who made an Edict, that he
might be numbered among the gods, and that Statues should be erected unto him
in the name of the greatest Iupiter? Neither will I forget Themison Cyprian,
who would needs be called Hercules, have incense offered unto him, be
celebrated with divine praises like unto him. And what shall I further say of
Nero, who greedy of eternal fame, would in any wise have the month of April
called Neronea, and ordained (as Suetonius writes) that the city of Rome
should be called Nerapolis? Alexander Macedon in Suetonius.
this respect may also be recounted amongst glorious Fools for one, he taking
wonderful delight to be termed the son of Iupiter Hammon. Salomoneus made
many fictions of celestial thunder and lightning by mean of Mathematical
discipline, to no other end, but to obtain the title of a god. Varro Pergeus
corrupted by flatterers words was easily persuaded, that himself was the
goodliest man in the world, and that he sung more divinely and sweetly then
the Muses themselves. Hanno the Carthaginian was accustomed to take birds, whom
he taught to pronounce these words, Hanno is a god. Sellus was a certain poor
vain glorious Dolt, who concealed his own poverty, as much as was possible,
extremely desiring for a worldly glory, to be reputed rich. Herostratus a
vain glorious Fool in conceit (by report of Aulus Gellius) burnt all the
Temple of Aulus Gellius.
Diana Ephesian, only to obtain an immortal fame in the world for the same:
and to conclude, Empedocles Agrigentine being a Fool, one degree above all
others, threw himself headlong into the flames of mount Aetna, to the end that
men might undoubtedly think, how he was flown up into heaven. In our days
also this number of Fools is so augmented, as there is no place so little,
wherein a great company of them may not be seen. Out of all doubt the example
of that vain glorious Tuscane like another Thraso in these our days is
Modern examples.
very rare, who being demanded by certain pleasant companions, why, upon an
occasion he laid not about him, said, the reason was, because he knew himself
to have so heavy and weighty a hand, as wheresoever it lighted, presently it
killed. And that other of Valentino of Castle Saint Pietro is no less
pleasant, who having had a box on the ear given him in the public market
place, by a certain ost, wentbrauing and laughing away, using these words:
This man came upon me with a flat box on the ear, because he durst not strike
me with his fist, for I tell you if he had struck me close fisted, woe had
been to him, for I would have come upon his nose with such another, as should
have sent him to God or the Devil. Now Fools of this order, have their Cell
in the Hospital, which before the gate thereof hath set forth the image of
Iuno, to whom originally they are recommended, and upon whom in favour of them,
with this subscribed supplication, I do humbly call.

A supplication to goddess Iuno, for vaine-glorious Fools.
O Thou greatest of the Goddesses, Queen of heaven, sister and playfellow to
high Iupiter, amongst all the godheads most glorious, even as the sun is of
greatest glory among the planets, have that care I beseech thee of these vain
glorious, as stands fittest with thy deity: And once again I entreat thee
by these glorious impositions and titles, first of Saturnia, because thou were
the daughter of Saturnus; of Aeria, in that thou rulest over the air; of
goddess Guretis, because thouridest in a chariot with a spear in thy hand; of
Lucina and Lucesia, in that thou gives light to him that is borne; of
Socigena, because thou ioinest in matrimony the female with the male; of Fuga,
Populonia, Domiduca, Iterduca, and Vnxia, for that men employed about all such
affairs, are to thee recommended, and under the shadow of thy wings preserved
and defended: Thou art yet further that Opigena, who assistest women great with
child: that Februale, or Februata, which by monthly issue purgest feminine
sex; that Fluonia, who hast power to restrain the menstruous blood of women,
while they conceive: wherefore among so many helps adioined to thy power,
assist also these vain fools: be unto them with thy name and power so
propitious; as besides the goodly church which thou hast in the Lacinian
promotorie, by mean whereof thou art called Lacinia; besides the chapel
which thou hast in a city of the Argiues called Prosymna, and whereupon they
term thee Prosymnia; and besides the alter which the Hetruscians made unto
thee in the Marquisate of Ancona, through which thou art called Cupra; thou
may also see in this Hospital a temple erected to thy name, by mean of
which thou may also be Hospitalaria, even as thy husband is called Iupiter
Hospitalis, and thus to the titles of Pelasga, goddess Moneta, Castrensis,
Caprotina, Sospita, and Calendaris, thou may add this other of Gloriosa, for
having succoured importantly so great a squadron of vain-glorious fools, who
vow, for this aid received at thy hands, to erect unto thee a tower higher then
that of Cremona, where tapers may continually be light and burn, to make
manifest to the whole world the glory of Iuno, in this one action made more
renowned then in any other precedent, or former operation.

Of parasiticall or scoffing Fools: the sixteenth discourse.
IT is not in a manner convenient, that these whom we call Parasiticall or
counterfeit Fools, should have place in the Hospital of our Incurables, in
that they not being really Foolish in mind, as the others are, have little to
do in this assembly, but it seems that they should rather be placed in the
number of the wise, sage Cato affirming that, Cato.
Stultitiam simulare loco, prudentia summa est.
To play the Fool in time and place is greatest wisdom sure.
And hereupon comes it that so much is attributed to the wisdom of Meson
the Astrologer, who foreseeing the future calamity which was like to light on
his countrymen the Athenians in an expedition they undertook against the
Sicilians, feigned himself to be a Fool, for that he would not be present with
them at so great an overthrow. As also in like manner we read of Vlysses, who
because he would not have gone to the Trojan war, he sowed salt like a
natutall Fool, and yoking together diverse and sundry beasts to the plow, he
made all men wonder at his sudden madness, but only Palamedes, who discovered
him by laying his young son amongst the furrows, whom the subtle Greek
prudently shunning, he by this act manifested that he was well in his wits, and
no Fool at all. But because there be some that otherwhiles play the Fools in
jest, with that little folly they have in their heads, it being a manifest
sign of folly, to play the Fool for no purpose at all, to give other men
contentment, by such men I say, we only mean it, when in this our Hospital we
place Parasiticall or counterfeit Fools. And there is no doubt but that
amongst these men, we may well reckon that Gallus Vibius named by Caelius, in
the sixth book of his ancient lectures the five and thirty chapter, who many
times feigning himself to be a Fool, and jesting in this manner, at last he
came to be so in good earnest, growing a starcke natural Fool, to the end
that whereas he scoffed and deluded others, for chastisement of his folly, he
might at last remain derided and flouted himself. In our days one Garbinello
hath a notable grace in playing of the fool, who as in representing a poor
Padoan country man, a Magnifico, or some doddipoule Doctor Gratian he hath no
fellow; so in this other kind of dissimulation, exceeds he all others, for
whosoever hears or sees him, by actions, gestures, and words, judges him to
be no other then a natural Fool. In this point Pedretto of Moiano one like
the other, showed himself a gallant fellow: for when the Venetian Signiors,
upon important occasions, pressing ordinary galleots or sailors in their
state, would also have commanded this man to go, although he shunned not to
be in the galleies with many others, yet to give some recreation to certain
gentlemen his friends, with whom he had compacted, he appeared one day
apparelled after the sailors fashion with a chain at his leg before the
Captain of these companies, and with an oar in his hand he began a little of
himself to row and sing at the oars as they do, and afterwards taking the
whistle in his hand which they use in galleies, he made an excellent call
therewith as could be devised: after this having a sack full of biscuit before
him, he began to distribute it amongst the company, and carried the Captain
a great piece of it, saying how that, and an head of Garlic, made a gossips
feast a ship-boord: and at last taking a Turkish cymitar, and drawing it
amongst the company, he began to cry out allai, allai maumeth russelai, which
imports as much, as God and great Mahumet, and began to flourish therewith
against the wind; sometimes striking here, sometimes there, while at the last
all sweaty, and weary, every one beholding him, he fell down as dead,
wrapping himself in a mariners rug, and calling a notary to set down his
last will and testament, wherein leaving some thing to every one, he said,
that he bequeathed to the Captain of the company a great lubber and knave to
be buried, and that being a mariner, he would be enterred in no other place,
then in the gallie-pumpe, because that was the most convenient grave for his
knaueship; and while (he dissembling himself to be dead) they would have
carried him away, he leaps me up of a sudden, and said to the Captain: Signior
Captain, I assure you, that among all the sailors you have pressed, there is
not a woorser then my self, wherefore dismiss me at this time (for Gods sake)
if you will not have your galleie to carry the worst name of any that
belongs to the Signioria; for which cause the Captain smiling, and taking
great pleasure in this conceit, he was for this time content to remit him,
seeing he had counterfeited the Fool so cunningly, and gave him moreover a
mocenigo, or piece of gold So called of ent Mocenigo their Duke, in whose
days they were coined.
about a ducat in value, saying, pray to God that though at this time you
escape the galleies, you light not hereafter upon the gallows. Now these be
Fools, that in the Hospital maintain for ensign before their Cell the image
of Mercurie, as the god of all knaves, and crafty jacks like to themselves,
to whom for this consideration, I direct the petition ensuing, instigating him
to the protection of such like people.

A supplication to god Mercurie, for parasiticall and counterfeit Fools.
Look what help is to be looked for, from the son of Iupiter and Cyllena,
is expected from thee concerning these Fools, O thou great interpreter of the
gods, because these be properly they that conforme themselves so jump with thy
genius and humour, as that they seem to all the world thy cousin germans.
These (as thou see) be dissemblers, and thy self the god of deceit, being he
who with such notable cosenage did steal away Apollo his kine, from Argos
their herdsman. But if this suffice not to move thee, why then by the famous
and honourable titles which thou obtainest of Poets, first of Hermetes, that is
expounder of words, of Camillus that is a servant or nuntio, thou being highest
Iupiter his messenger, of Alipedes, for the wings thou hast at thy legs as the
celestial Pursuivant of Manigena, for that thou were borne of Maia the daughter
of Athlantes, of Arcades, because thou were brought forth in Arcadia, of
Cyllenius, in that thou were borne on mount Cyllena, of Lygius, Agryphon, and
Nomius; all of them with vehement entreaties beseech thee, to have that care of
them, which to so great a God appertains, seems but correspodent to so
fervent effectual recomendations. And the more to provoke thee to this
charitable enterprise, they set before thy eyes so many of thy performed
honourable actions, as to have been the inuentor of the Harp, of wrestling, of
merchandise, and of Rhetoric; to have first instructed the Egyptians in good
letters; freed Mars out of prison, and bound Prometheus in mount Caucasus,
causing him to be torn into mammocks by vultures: and they beseech thee by
these famous former exploits, that it would please thee to add thereunto the
wise and valiant defence of this kind of fools: The which if thou shalt
execute, expect without any delay, before thy image in the Temple of the
Phenicians, the oblation of a Foxes skin, which will be an offering much
conformable both to them and thy self.

Of lunaticall and Fools by season: the seventeenth discourse.
THere are but few that know not these kind of fools by their name only,
whom at this present we term lunaticall or fools by season, who because they
are not continually vexed with this fury but only sometimes, and with
certain intermission, have obtained the imposition or name of lunatickes, they
appeering mutable in this infirmity of their folly like the moon: or rather
because this kind of madness is proper and peculiar to those, that are borne in
the eclipse; or else in that in the waining or increase of the moon, and
according to the diverse alterations of it, this infirmity sometimes greatly
abounds, and otherwhiles also hath his force exceedingly abated. Wherefore
Iulius Firmicus in the fourth book of his Mathematickes saith; Et siluna male
fuerit Iuilio Firmicus
collocata, aut spasticos, aut lunaticos, aut caducos facit: which is, If the
moon be evil placed, either it makes men extatical, lunatic, or subject to
the kings evil. For this kind of argument I may produce the examples of
Nicoletto of Francolino, and Lorenzino of Chioggia, of which the first, upon
the new moon, would enter sometimes into an humour that he was become a
lobster, hunting out all the nearest waters and brookes whereinto to leap: and
an otherwhile, that he was turned into a doade man, putting a couple of tether
horns upon his own head, the better to imitate his form and condition: then
that he was a leek, or a young garlic blade, and thus ran among the
Herbagers crying out; who will buy fine sallet or herbage: an other time that
he was grown a sausage, or dried flitch of bacon, shunning the larderers more
then the pestilence itself, for fear they should have offered him some
indignity. The other upon the waining of the moon, shed likewise a great
part of his wits or brain; for he would run naked through the market places,
discovering all his privy parts: and other whiles all hampered with a great
wicker basket, he went through the market place, jostling all those he met
withal; but many times altogether distracted, he would lay at men with staves
stones, and sometimes (being a matter exceedingly worth the laughing at) he
would disple himself upon the naked buttocks, with a neates garbage, running
after the boys, with the filthy and stinking bowels, and casting them at
those that came about him, like a company of birds about a madge-howlet.
Santino of Pietra-mala, was also lunatic, and being possessed with this
indisposition of the brain, one day upon the full of the moon he played many
fond parts worthy the laughing at, and among others, this one is reported
of; that lighting on a tavern or tippling house, which had a laurel garland
hanging out for a sign, he put the same garland on his own head, and began
to say that he was a Poet, singing whatsoever came first into his mind, where
a company of people being gathered about him, and perceiving by chance an
harlot whose name was Diana, in the Poetical fury which then took him in the
head, singing he uttered of her these verses: Look on that whipper Digennie I
say
That calls her self Diana,
Ugly, deformed foul, and filthy
Like a rammish goat, an ape or a monckey:
And beholding else where a certain appendant, he sung of him these verses
following: You sir, who teaches young men to be nought,
Shall be for a Corydon taken and thought.
Among these lunatickes we may also put Menegone of Olmo, who thus in the
moons waining, tottering in brain, went up and down the ditches to gather
roots, bringing many times bundels of nettles and wild thistles into the
market place, minding to fell this baggage in steed of wholesome roots;
sometimes he went a fishing for frogs, and filled a trey full of toads, which
he knew not: and otherwhiles also playing the Tinker, he went crying up down
the country all black as a cole, who hath any candle-stickes, dishes, kettels
or pans to mend; neither was he like a tinker in any thing, but only the
smear, and collow of his beard, with a greasy sack on his shoulder, which
for this purpose he carried about with him. These be therefore those kind of
lunatickes we have hitherto spoken of, who within the Hospital have hanging
out before the door of their Cell for a sign, the goddess Hecate, whom as
their favourite, according to our accustomed manner, we will with this petition
under written salute.

A petition to goddess Hecate, for Fools lunaticall or by season.
BE thou always blessed, and with infinite commendations set forth, O thou
gentle daughter of Latona, sister to god Apollo, deservedly termed Hecate,
because thou procurest that the ghosts and unburied walk abroad an hundredth
years without rest or quiet, through whose power in like sort these poor
fools err in their wits, whom we call lunatike, vouchsafe cheerfully to
power down thy benign influence upon this weak fraternity, which they daily
expect from thee with so great desire, O thou threeforme goddess. Succour I
beseech thee, this thy weak and wavering flock, for when thy help shall
appear so ready at hand, for such dear friends, there shall incontinently in
like manner in three solemn temples which thou hast, one in Perga a city of
Pamphilia, another in Ephesus, and the third in Persian Tauris, be erected to
thy honour, as most noble Trophes, three Turkish ancients, with the Ottomans
crest in the midst, which will evidently possess all men of the good thou
hast done them, and of the evil which by thy grace and favour, thou hast
removed and taken from these.

Of carpet and amorous Fools: the eighteen discourse.
NOw would it be requisite that we had the knowledge and practise together of
as many amorous accidents, as have fallen out both in the old, and this our
present age, that we might describe with convenient solemnity, all the
fopperies of lovers, they being manifest causes of a thousand other follies,
which from this stock as from their beginning, drawing their original and
essence, cause their life not only to appear, but really and in effect to be
the strangest and maddest race, that may be imagined. This folly seems
principally to be rooted, in thoughts, desires, conceits, resolutions, words,
gestures, signs, and actions, all of which linking themselves together, make a
man in cases of love so foolish, that the argument hereof exceeds any other
subject I have before spoken of: with fond thoughts the foolish lover goes
about to make castles in the air of himself, imagining daily, which is the
briefest and speediest mean to accomplish his incontinencies, which hourly
makes him unquiet, troubled, afflicted in mind, and passionate out of
measure. From hence comes it, that he ruminates on treasures, riches,
states, dominions, empires, and power, as the readiest ways whereby to
compass the thing beloved: and with these apprehensions he ioineth a desire
of Croesus wealth, the gold of Media, Caesars power, and the Emperor Commodus
his means: and hereupon he thinks on incantations, witcheries, drugs, and
all kind of Magic practise, desiring with the stone Gyges to become
invisible, or the herb Eliotropia, to obtain the secretes of Peter of Abano,
or those of Ciecco d'Ascoli, or the other of Antonio di Fantis to know how to
put in practise Salomons keie; and with conjuration to command spirits: of one
side he strives after Alchemy, which enriching him with gold and silver
enough, may by this means possess him likewise of his love; on the other side
he betakes himself to deceitful Cabalistrie, which by virtue of unknown
names, can dispose of his mistres, to his own mind: and thus expatiating
amidst a thousand imaginations, howe to find out bawds, panders, servants,
brokeresses, or some old nurse factoresse, to write letters, conceits,
sonnets, madrigals and songs; to send flowers, nosegays, newe-yeeres gifts,
presents, and bounties, and to set down by himself in effectual words his
endured amorous servitude, he goes by little and little in this manner,
extenuating his wit, and consuming his judgment and understanding in these
fantasies. Amidst these his foolish desires, he covets to be a flea, a fly,
or an ante, that by this means he might enter into the chamber of his beloved:
he contedeth to mine under the earth as conies do; for the self same effect he
hugreth after al kind of greatness, beauty, parts, favour, that above all the
world he may know how to be in her grace, and (which is worst) he would that
both life and death should serve his turn at an instant. In conceit he
frames amorous devises, witty and excellent embleames, sweet and smooth
falling rythmes, sententious censures, artificial sayings, ingenious
stratagemes: and thus hammereth he in his mind both night and day, about
whatsoever he thinks in the end may procure him any assistance; with
resolution he determines to attend the conclusion, and to be firm in his
intentions, resolving with himself no more to endure, nor any longer to suffer
torment and grief; but mark what he saith, determines and resolves; for by
and by he affronteth her with words, and courts her sometimes bitterly,
otherwhiles sweetly, and then in mediocrity: with his gestures he seeks
to move her to compassion, crossing his arms with an high-ho, and if he be
cunning in his motions, and actions, he will make her even ready to kill
herself with compassion: to conclude, his carriage is such, that beasts
themselves are sometimes wiser and more prudent then one of these amorous
fools: for an only example of these amorous Fools Romain Mark Antonie is
set down, who besotted with the love of Cleopatra Queen of Egypt, lost for
her only cause both his empire, life, and honour. That of Pyramid and Thisby
entangled one with an others love, can not be concealed, who one for the other
miserably died: whereupon Strozzapadre in these verses following celebrates
their Strozzapadre.
death: Of Pyramid and Thesbie, example we may make,
Whom cruel death unto himself, by equal means did take:
And Calentius in his Epigrammes writes of them: Calentius.
Pyramid and Thisbies love, was most unfeigned sure:
For both of them with proper hand, did meek their deaths endure.
The example also of Hercules is most famous, who Iuiled in the affection he
bore to Omphale Queen of the Lidians, he was brought for her love to apparel
himself like a girl, and spin amongst damsels and young maids as a woman:
wherefore in the Poet Propertius he thus debates with himself: Propertius.
In long side gown, I Lydian webs did spin:
This servile function following every day,
My breast was covered with a partlet thin:
And with these hands I could the girl well play.
And even so in like manner is that of Theban Hemon, a notable example, who for
love killed himself before the tomb of Antigona, the daughter of Oedipus and
Iocasta: as also that of Sappho, who threw herself headlong from the Leucadian
promontory for Phaoes sake: whereupon Angelus Politianus in his Elegies
writes of her: Angelus Politianus.
Sappho Virago, who in death did oft exclaim,
Of love: both honour, to Leucadian sea and blame:
That of Phedra who hanged her self for love of Hippolitus, Ausonius saying of
her, I have persuaded what I can, try now some other: tell me whom: marry
let Ausonius.
Phedra or Elisa give thee an halter, or a sword: That of Didoe, who cast
her-selfe into the burning flame for Aeneas his love, whereupon Silius Italicus
saith, Deep wounded Dido stands upon the burning pile, Silius.

Commanding future Tyrians war to make:
The treacher Trojan he, to mid-seas gets the while,
And spreading sail the shore doth now for sake:
And last of all, that of Phillides daughter to Licurgus, king of Thrace, who
hanged her self upon a beam for love of Demophoon son to Theseus, whose
death is by Pamphilus Sassus described in these verses following: Pamphilus
Sassus.
Phillis to me, of death, a noble pattern gives,
Hanged was her body, yet her living fame survives.
Was not that folly of Aristoteles very great, who offered incense to a
concubine he had, as to a goddess: as also that of Nero, who married himself
to Sporo a young boy, and Doriphoro his freeman? with that of Periander
Corinthian, who according to Herodotus, lay Herodotus.
with the harlot Melissa, when she was dead? Is not this of Semiramis a
wonderful example of Folly, who according to Caelius in his thirty seventh
book, and Iustine Caelius. Iustine.
in his first, grew foolishly enamoured with a Bull? Of the shepherd Crathis,
who as Volterran affirms, was Volterran.
taken with the love of a shee-goate? This of Aristophanes Ephesian, who
according to Plutarch in his Parallelles, Plutarch.
was besotted with a female ass? Of Fuluius Romanus, who by the same Authors
testimony, exceedingly affected a mare, by whom he had a daughter called
Hippona? Of Cyparisso that fell in love with a Do? Of Pigmalion and Alchiades
Rhodian, who were each of them affected with the love of a dumb Statue? And
last of all, of Serses, who sincerely loved one Platano? Of latter days
Galleazzo Mantuano (as Pontanus reports) being Pontanus.
nuzled in fancy with a Pauian girl, at her commandment, when in jest she
bad him go drown himself, cast himself foolishly into the river Tesinus.
And yet of fresher memory, Tiron Milanese, overgone with the love of a fish in
a Pond, which he termed il Gobbo, or the bunch-backed, it having been eaten
by certain good fellows, remained many days afflicted out of measure for
this loss; neither could he any ways be comforted, he always thinking that
the death of his fish Gobbo, would likewise draw speedily after it his own
life. These be therefore amorous Fools, recommended to God Cupid his
protection, whom to this end, in their behalf, we affectionately solicit
with this invocation following.

An invocation to god Cupid for amorous Fools.
GOD save thee fair winged child, al hail most gentle son of Venus, live for
ever thou most excellent quivered Archer, and yet once more Viue, thou
discreet warrior in the Marshall enterprises of Love: All these Fools taken
in thy net, catched with thy bait, and in thy prison captivated, as humble
subjects of thy dominion and Empire, they with all humble submission entreat
thee, that thou would be touched with their torments, and have that
commiseration of their tribulations and grief, which in so tender and
effeminate a god as thou art, is not only thought requisite, but even proper,
and every way pertinent to thy deity. Remove thy snares, take away thy
hooks, put up thy arrows, lay aside thy bow, show thy self unto them naked,
disarmed, to the end they may not be afraid of those weapons, wherewith
sometimes offended, they have sufficiently proved what hurt they carry with
them. The which thing if thou shalt vouchsafe to effect, in that notable Temple
thou enioyest in the island of Cyprus, they promise to offer a great piece of
flint-stone, without the steel to strike fire withal, to show that thy flames
be quenched, and that fire smoothered up, which when it bursts forth,
miserably consumes every ones hart.

Of desperate Fools: the nineteenth discourse.
THere be certain accidents which sometimes happen unto men, through which it
comes to pass, that one being moved by the bitterness of such effects, he
falls into so great desperation, as loosing all sense and understanding, he
gives himself wholly over, as a pray to grief, and so far yields to his
afflicted and tormented mind, as the heaviness of such a mischance foolishly and
fondly urges and inciteth him thereunto: and through this malignant effect, he
obtayneth amongst men the title of a desperate Fool. For this kind of passion
is questionless a plain madness in such like men, who not being able to endure
crosses, hasten after an end of the same, altogether unworthy of one wise,
or that knows how to govern himself. Of this kind of argument, the first
example which comes to my mind, is that of Luctus Sillanus, son in law to
Claudius the Emperor, who for that he was depriued of his wife Octauia she
being given to Nero, was suddenly oppressed with so great anguish of mind,
that the very day of her marriage, the more to make him be envied (as Cornelius
Tacitus affirms) with his own poynard he killed Cornelius Tacitus.
himself. The second example is of Silius Italicus, a famous Poet, of whom
Angelus Politianus recounts Angelus Politianus.
in his book Nutricia, that being surprised with an incurable disease, he grew
into such a loathing of himself, as that being desperate, he ended his own
days: and these be the verses of him: He died old, and did survive his son:
By his own hand, this cruel deed was done.
In the Romaine Chronicles we read of Marcus Portius Latro, who overcome with
the great molestation of a double quartaine, laid himself his own hands on
his back, and willingly gave up the ghost. We find written in Ouid of
Sardanapalus King of the Assyrians, that being vexed with a grievous war, when
he saw his affairs go quite backward, he threw himself desperately upon a
burning pile of wood, and in that fire most miserably died, and these be Ouid
verses: These bodies dear thou may commit unto the fire, Ouid.

A death which Sardanapalus did desperately desire.
Biondus and Corius make mention of Ezelino the tyrant of Padoa, that being
wounded in one of the battles he Biondus. Corius.
fought with Martine Turriano, prince of Mylane, like a mad beast he unbound
and tore open his wound, giving up his life as one desperate, and who as it
seemed was borne only to the damage and ruin of human kind. Caelius
recites this notable folly of one Timantes Cleoneus, by profession a
champion, who not being Caelius.
able through old age, and partly for want of use, to draw a bow, which a
certain young man easily welded, entered upon this into such choler, that being
desperate, with a knife he killed himself. Divine Ariosto in fair Ariosto.
Bradamante, describes an humour much of this kind, yet differing from another
spirit, instantly stripped of all reason and sense, in that Stanza which
begins thus: She saying thus, and eeke prepared to dye,
Leapt out of bed, with fury all inflamed,
Putting her sword, on left side by and by.
With that which follows: In these our days that desperate folly reported
by Cecco of Brisselli, is questionless very ridiculous, who having in the
heat of summer a mighty strong itch, he suffered likewise as great a
disturbance, by a swarm of flies, as in such cases it oftentimes happens, and
so great was the molestation which he received from them, as not being able to
shake them off, of his nose, forehead, or hands, nor from the nape of his neck,
which was all cadied, like a most desperate man, he one day threw himself into
a tubbe of honey, saying: I hope you will remain here catched and taken by
the heals, and afterwards leaving the tubbe, he might perceive those
shameless creatures, to be clotted all of a cluster within the barrel to his
singular contentment. But now on the other side list a while: for at the smell
of the honey, there came a most irksome swarm of bees and wasps, by whose
buzzing and stinging he being sore vexed, entered into such a rage by this
second assault, as apparelling himself from hand to foot, like to a man
copleate armed with his beaver down, he went and sate in the sun, saying: now
hum and bum, as long as you will, for in despite of flies, and all the bees
and wasps in the world, I will keep this my scald itch to my self: but an
infinite army of these creatures fluttering about him, at the only odour and
smell of his corruption, in the end, not being able to behold himself thus
besieged, he grew desperate, and cast himself into a cauldron of hot scalding
lee, saying; and you love honey so well, as it seems you do, come hither a
gods name and fasten upon me. This sort therefore before spoke of, be desperate
fools, who have within the Hospital for an ensign the picture of the
goddess Venilia, wherefore as their protectress let us with dew prayers and
entreaty, solicit her in their behalf.

A supplication to goddess Venilia for desperate Fools.
O Thou which replenishest men's minds with hope, comfortest with sage
meditation the disconsolate, restore wearied spirits to true unfeigned
alacrity, therefore by all the afflicted art sedulously called upon, while
others thus groan under their burden, and that thou see the terrible
extremities and hart burnings of these fools, procure that thy merciful hart
may be touched with such commiseration, as that thou causing thy self to be
known for goddess Venilia, mother and guardian of the desperate, these men
may thus by thy favour, be as it were raised from death to life; for when they
shall perceive their wandering and lost spirits recovered, together with their
dried up blood, and colour wan revived, they shall in a pleasant bond and
duty, be obliged to fasten up in thy temple a hangmans collar, with an old
rotten halter, as a true sign, that by thy favour they have escaped death, and
that from desperate estate, they are reduced to an assured hope of future life.

Of heteroclite, reverse, thwart, and headstrong Fools: the twentieth
discourse.
THere be certain fantastical men in the world, who by no means can be
persuaded, either to equity, honesty, or truth: observing in their
operations, neither rule, order, or mediocrity, but are of a spirit cross
reverse, not yielding to duty, consenting to right, nor coformable to so much
as very reason would require; but are altogether out of the way, beyond measure
far wide of the true path: which humours are continually termed by the name
of heteroclite, reverse, thwart, headstrog fools. Of this humour that Perseus
subdued by Paulus Aemilius showed himself: for two of his domestic and
familiar acquaintance, being desirous friendly to comfort him after his loss,
he entered upon this into such an ecstasy, that like a beast as he was, against
all the reason in the world, he commanded that in his presence they should
presently be slain. Atheneus reports of Atheneus.
Eurilochus the Philosopher, who was an auditour of Pirrhus Eliensis, that he
was a right headstrong fool indeed, for upon a small occasion he would
sometimes grow into such choler, as that he pursued once a cooke of his that
fled before him even into the market place, running after him with the brooch,
and roasted meat upon it all piping hot. Diverse setdowne this wonderful
matter of Commodus the Emperor, that finding once the bath luke warm wherein
he meant to wash himself, in a mighty rage, he caused the stoue master to be
cast into an hot burning furnace, to the end that while he was in this tepide,
or luke warm bath, the other might quite contrary feel that excessive heate,
which his despiteful fury imposed upon him. Sansouino writes of Mahumet
Sansouino.
Ottoman, that going through a garden, and by chance perceiving two fair
cucumbers that had been plucked up, laying this fault upon two goodly young
men of excellent presence and form (who notwithstanding he used as ganimedes)
although they denied the fact, yet did he cruelly at the same instant cause
them both to be slain. Philagrus the sophister, one of Lullianus his auditors,
was also of so heteroclite and perverse an enclination, that if his disciples
chanced but sometimes of mere necessity to fall a sleep in the school, he
no ways bearing with their imbecility, would lay his fistes upon their
faces, spurning harde against their bellies, without having any compassion in
the world, even to nature it self in this point. It is an evident matter
which Biondus writes of Vedius Pollio, who was an Biondus.
headstrong fool, in all he went about, for those servitors which at the table
had by chance but broken one of the least glasses there were, he would
suddenly as a man even mad with fury, command them to be slain, and given
to certain murenaes to feed upon, which he kept in a wonderful great
fishponde that he had. Cherophon Athenian, a philosopher little known, was so
notable a fool in this kind, that in talking of an exquisite fool, this
proverb is used by Paulus Manutius: Paulus Manutius.
In Palladis vestigijs nihil Cherefontis gubernabis: In Palace her footsteps
Cherefon can hardly tread. The only, example of this gog-furie is read in
Corius, of Corius.
Barnabo the Visconte, who caused a poor baker to be slain, only, for that
passing by a castle where he dwelt, he waked him sometimes in the night, in
calling in with his bread: As also that other is very well known to the world,
which he performed to two of the Popes legates, whom he commanded to eat the
letters they had about them, to bring unto him, only for a despite to that
highest prelate, with whom he was then in enmity, touching matter of state:
Neither can I omit the other which he performed to that parish priest (which
for his avarice deserved notwithstanding great chastisement) who unwilling to
bury a poor woman's husband for nothing, he made him together with the dead
carcass to enter into the grave, that he might pay by this means for the
public iniquity he had in thus doing committed. So that heteroclite,
reverse, thwart, and head strong fools be such as we have described them
unto you, and these have hanging before their Cell within the Hospital, the
image of halting Vulcane, limping with his legs, as they do in their
understanding, wherefore to a god correspondent to themselves, in this petition
following, we very commodiously recommend them.

A petition to god Vulcane for heteroclite, reverse, thwart, and headstrong
Fools.
WE beseech thee O thou great celestial blacksmith, minister of the great fire
in mount Aetna, called Mulciber, because thou make iron tractable malleable:
Vulcan for that thou make thy flames ascend speedily upward: Cyllopodius, in
that falling from heaven, by a disgrace thou became lame: Lemnius, because
being cast out of heaven by thy mother, thou did light in Lemnos, where by
Eurymenes and Thet is thou were nourished, or else peradventure by apes, as
thou thy self know well; by that pity therefore which then was taken of
thy disaster, charitablie also assist these thy cousin germans, not lame in
their legs, but in their understanding, as thou see, and as thou did temper
Ioues thunderbolts, and knit the net for the taking of Venus and Mars: as
thou made Hermions carcanet; Ariadnes crown; and the wagon of Sol; or as by
thy hands in the Cyclopians forge, the arms of Achilles and Aeneas were
tempered; even as likewise were Mambrinoes helmet, Orlandoes Durindana, Rinaldos
Fusberta, the enchanted arms of Mandricard and Argiliaes armour: even so
settle the brains of these men after such a sort, as that in triumph they may
have cause to hang up in thy shop a mighty huge dumpling of the Lumbard-size,
which may serve in stead of a sign, of these men's brains thus resetled, by
thy means reduced to their right use temper.

Of scoffing Fools: the one and twentieth discourse.
TAles, bables, fables, I will not say wittily, but scoffingly related together
with correspondent actions, gestures, and operations to the same, constitute
those kind of men, whom we here call scoffing or jesting Fools, whose intent
is no other, but to recreat and make merry the world, they retaining in their
heads a disposition more then Iouiale, from whence inventions flow abundantly,
and a thousand odd pranks they every day perform in presence of the
multitude: as that Clisophus parasite to Philip K. of Macedonia, of who Lynceus
Linceus Samius
Samius makes mention in his commentaries, who perceiving that his master by
chance had broken one of his legs, began likewise to go limping like him, and
scoffingly wreathed his eyes, mouth and teeth, in eating any sharpe sauces,
imitating diligently and like an Ape, his Lord and master in every thing. Of
Clarisophus also Dyonisius the Tyrant his jester, we find thus much written in
Hegesander, that whenever he saw his Hegesander.
master laugh a part with any nobleman or Baron, he would also giggle soundly
himself: so that one day Dyonisius observing this Sycophant, he asked him why
he so laughed, to who the Gnato answered, I laugh for this cause: In that I
imagine those matters which pass betwixt you deserve no less, considering you
your selves so laugh at them, as you do. But above al M. Varro, Galba make

mention of a certain base Tarentine scoffer, called Rhintone, who was another
Cesco of our days, for in all matters, how weighty or serious soever they
were, he had ever a scoff ready at the fingers end, which peradventure might
well be mother or sister unto him: as also in this point, Sosicrates in his
first book of the Cretane affairs, Sosicrates.
attributeth to the Phestians as a peculiar property, that they were scoffers,
for from their childhood, they studied quick and stinging sayings, for the
sharpening of their wits, which by such applications are greatly whetned. In
ancient times, Mandiogenies and Strato Athenian, were famour Buffons, as
Hippolochus Macedon in an epistle which he writ to Linceus testifies, and
Hippolochus.
so was Callimidon, Locusta, Dinia, and Menedemus, to whom Telefanes in his
book of Cities saith, that Telefanes.

are magnified. These be they that sweep the courts of Princes and great men,
who for the most part are greatly delighted with these kind of Fools, as
sometimes Philip of Macedonia, who took in them such contentment, that as
Atheneus writes in the fourteenth of his Atheneus.
Gymnosophistes he sent a talent of gold to certain parasites, which before we
named, for their jests and sayings: Demetrius Poliorceta, as Philarcus writes
in the sixth Philarcus.
book of his Histories, was also so great a friend to scoffers, as that he
could never have them an hour from his heals. The like Herodotus writes of
Amasina king Herodotus.
of Egypt, who desired more the company of jesters and Buffons, then of those
prudent and wise. But yet it is much, that Nicostratus ascribeth this very
genius or Nicostratus.
humour to Romaine Scilla, who otherwise was so grave and strict in all his
proceedings. Of late days, one Gonella was a notable Buffon, as likewise
Carafalla; and yet of later memory Boccofresca the Padoan, who I am persuaded
had never his equal for Buffonerie, much less any superior: and he was so
much the more an ingenious scoffer, by how much he would never once smile
himself, though he made all the rest of the company almost burst with
laughing: for he was not like the Tirinthians, so celebrated by Theophrastus,
who being natural Buffons borne, had on a time general recourse to the Oracle
of Delphos, to know whether there were any means, for the recovery of this
kind of Folly; to whom the Oracle made answer, that I, there was: so they
could sacrifice a Bull to Neptune god of the sea without laughing, the which
thing not being able to execute, they remained in the same state of Buffonerie,
as at the first. Yet scoffers and jesters are good in this one point, for they
make men merry, and expel melancholy from the heart, neither do they eat
their bread in treachery, as flatterers do, from whom proceeds nothing but
shame, and detriment together. Now these Fools have before their cell in the
Hospital, an image of god Fabulanus erected as their friend and favourer:
wherefore let it seem no marvel, though to him, who is protector of these
frivolous chatterers, in this invocation following, we duly fitly recomend
them.

A prayer to god Fabulanus, for scoffing Fools.
THese men O God Fabulanus be true gnathoes, friends and affecters by life of
thy name: for they neither think nor speak of any thing but fables and tales,
which spring from thee, and inserted in them, take so deep root as that they
show themselves to be the children and true offspring of God Fabulanus: and for
this cause thy glorious godhead must needs have a care of thy dear friends,
that are conversant with the kings and princes of the world, holding them in
so tender esteem, as that it may be known, how without thy assistance, they
could utter nothing savoury or gracious in any sort: Vouchsafe them therefore
requisite protection, and so effect, that they may be stirred up to offer at
thy alter, which thou hast amongst the Tirinthians, the tales of Piouan
Arlotto, printed in parchment with text letters, to the end the gift and
present which they offer, may aptly correspond with thee their courteous and
bountiful benefactour.

Of Jovial, recreatiue, facet, and friendly Fools: the two and twentieth
discourse.
THese sorts may be discerned from mere parasites or buffones in this point:
for buffones at all times without rule, mediocrity, or discretion, are ready
to utter and perform all kind of licentious scurrilitie, but these facet
companions, are not so extreme in their speech nor performance, observing
further a decorum and decency in all their proceedings, their mirth also being
far more moderate then that of buffones, which surely is altogether scurrile
and dissolute: These sort of men are for the most part stored with excellent
pleasant quips, notable tales, recreatiue speeches, merry proverbs, and
conceited inventions, manifesting even in their very exterior countenances
towards all men, a certain domestic, friendly, sweet, affable, and
tractable disposition. Marcus Tullius in an Epistle to his brother Quintus,
declares Sextus Nemus to be such an one; and in his second de Legibus, he
sets down the old Poet Aristophanes for one of facet dexterity. So
Horatius in the first of his sermons, attributeth to Lucilius this jocund
alacrity of spirit saying, Lucilius was both wise and civil sure,
And excellent, the grief of mind to cure:
In these our modern times, Piouan Arlotto was reputed for a wonderful
facet companion, whose sentences and sayings put in print, show the value of
his wit in this kind of folly. There want not at this day in Rome, and the
courts of great princes, diverse fools of this sort: for more courtiers are
conversant in this study, then in any other; it being a very convenient
means, whereby to obtain the favour of princes, great ladies, and
gentlewomen, who are sooner many times won with some cheerful and pleasant
report, then with the long service those poor souls employ about them, for
after due examination of their own errors, they oftentimes sing: O passions
lost with thoughts both light frail. And an example of this may be observed in
one master Bernardine of Beneuento, who serving in the court of a great
Italian prince, obtained one day the favour of a most beautiful lady, only
for this gentle and witty retortion: for she saying that it was very hot about
his lodging; he wittily answered by way of admiration: How can that be fair
lady, when from Beneuento (which signifies in Italian good wind) there can
not come but fresh and fine cools! An other courtier called master Andrew of
Pomerano, while he served in the court of Frauncis the first king of France,
with an excellent sudden invention, got himself the favour of his lord in an
instant, for they being doubtful in the court, on what side Charles the fifth
would assail the kingdom of France, and some saying about Marcelles, others
in Nauarra, and a third sort in Prouence, one saying in one place, an other
in an other; this man in presence of many, the king himself hearing it, said,
how above all other places it was requisite to fortify Lingua d'occa, for
Languedocke as the French term it, signifying in the Italian a goose tongue,
because it was likely the ravenous eagle (for the eagle is the crest of the
Empire) would sooner light there then any where else. And of master Nicholo
d'Oruietto this other is mentioned, that serving in the court of Pope Leo, a
most courteous prince, on a day, in four words only, he got his holiness
favour for ever; for while on a time they were talking of a benefice vacant
(this word sounding near Vacca in the Latin for a cow) it being sued for by
one of the house of Vitelli (this coming near Vitulus in the same tongue for a
he-calf, on who it might have been bestowed) he wittily said: Holy father,
all reason would that it should in any sort be given to Vitello, because
she hath no nearer kindred then himself, playing upon the word Vacant, which
comes near Vacca, signifying a cow, which is mother to the calfe. Now jocund
fools of this sort, have a cell within the Hospital, which hath hanging out
the picture of god Bacchus, particular patron of such like fools: wherefore
as one to them most friendly, let us cheerfully with this under written
petition salute him.

A petition to god Bacchus for Jovial, recreatiue, facet, and pleasant
Fools.
GOod day, and good year God send thee O father Liber, all the mirth of the
world be with thee my dear and honey god; if thou wilt be carroused unto in
Muscadell orbastard, O sweet Lyaeus, then preserve maintain this pleasant
fraternity or college consecrated to thee: Behold how they expect from thee
that iocunditie wherewith the Bachides were surprised, being enamoured with
thee, when so willingly they followed thee to the fortunate enterprises of the
Indies; from which victory returning, thou were the first that in naval
triumph (by thee invented) did wear a kingly diadem, sitting upon the back
of an Indian elephant; if therefore thou hold thy self their friend, as
hitherto ever thou hast done, according to the natural inclination which
bends thee towards them, they will be content not only to call thee
Bimatris, for having had miraculouslie two mothers in the world, Semele, and
Jove, Saturmiter, having been first in her belly, and then in this gods
groine: to name thee Nyseus of Nisa Grotta, Anio of Aonia, Thiontis of Thione,
Nictalius because thou art worshipped honoured in the night, Mitrophorus, for
wearing a myter on thy head; Orcus, so called of an hill whereon thou art
sacrificed unto, Bassareus of the long robe thou wear down to the heel,
Dithirambus, Leneus, Briseus, Osyris, and Bromius: But they will further
attribute unto thee the Greek name of Eutropelus, because thou art a favourite
to pleasant, facet, and recreatiue fools: and besides the Thirsus or writhed
javelin with ivy, which thou bear in thy hand, they will join unto it a
carousing glass of Romagnia, with which thou may pledge, and do reason
unto men, when by so good fellows as they are, thou art sought unto.

Of testy and fustian Fools: the three and twentieth discourse.
TEstines and fury, be fond effects that proceed from certain fantastical
humours in their heads, whom we commonly call testy fustian fools: because
this whole matter is nourished by choler, and human inconstancy, it
consists in nothing else but in sundry cogitations and actions, resolving it
self in the end into a toy and humour, according as with such a passion it
seems well befitting: and of such like disposition be all those that are
prompt to anger, and then as easy to be pacified, wherefore the Poet Horace
manifests himself a testy fool, when he saith; Irasci facilem, tantum vt
placabilis essem; ready to be angry, only that I might as soon be pleased:
And Ausonius the Poet, was also a froward fool, by his own Ausonius.
witness, he uttering these verses following of himself: I sought my sudden
anger for to hide,
And for my fury pain I did abide:
For this purpose Corthidis king of Thrace (if Caelius do not fable) knowing
his own testy and froward nature, Caelius.
and how violent and headstrong himself was, one day when certain excellent
well wrought cups or glasses were given him, he therefore esteeming greatly of
them, yet considering they were but brittle, though precious, in deep
judgment he broke them all: for if by chance they should have been broken
by any of his followers or servants, it could not have been otherwise
possible, but that in his great rage and fury, he would bitterly have
revenged himself on them for the same. Of such a nature Rhodomont in divine
Ariosto is set out to be, for as one furious and fell, he spoke evil in
general of all women kind, when fair Doralice gave sentence against him; and
yet afterwards at the sight only of Isabella, it seemed that he recanted,
acknowledging no higher bliss, then her grace and favour. In these our days
one Claudius of Salo, discovered himself to be very humorous and testy, who
having an house in the country, which came to him by inheritance from his
father, he determined on a time to reduce it all into form of a douehouse; not
many days after being of another humour, that he would have it a castle,
building it in such like form, with ditches and rampires round about in manner
of a fortress; and presently it being finished, he changed humour again, and
caused it to be plucked down even to the very foundations, planting in the
very same place, a pretty young set of Orange-trees; which being come to a
reasonable growth, in a caprichious toy, he also procured them all on a day to
be rooted up, saying, it were much better to have it a field of Coleworts; and
thus in the end his house came to be a garden of Cabages. The fantastical
humour of one Zanfardino in our time is also most notable, who being called to
a dignity, at such time when Cuckoos were esteemed for Parrots (although at
this present also, we may observe some master like discipline to proceed from
his successors) being in his kingdoe installed, he began to sell herds of
cattle buy geese, supplanting his gardens, making them greenes for these
creatures to grase upon; alleging for a reason of this his wayward
fantasticality, that fro geese came feathers, wherewith to make boulsters and
beds, whereof he then had greater need then of flesh, fruits or cheese. There
is another by the common multitude called Scarinzo, who of no less a peevish
inconstancy then the rest, cut up a goodly and commodious set of vines, only
to make a vain perspective, for his own foolish contentment; and when he had
nothing to do, he would pluck down an Aiaxe, and make a fishpond in the
place; supplant an orchard to make a fair walking green, or else deface some
goodly cloister or gallery to make room for tame conies. But above al perverse
humours, that of Piacentino is most famous, who cast good pistolets or ducats
into the water, to make ducks and drakes with them, as children use to do: and
so great was the foppery which transported him, as he perceived not the damage
he received by the eluish arrogance of his own brain. And niddicocke upon
cockscombe was that other Cremonese, who putting on the Toga Pratexta, or long
robe of a doctor, hearing one day a drum that played but badly upon this
instrument, he steps me down from his chair of dignity, and taking the drum
in his hand, brased it hard, and in succinct and grave habit, went sounding of
it into the market place, drawing after him all the whole Fry of boys, every
one gazing at him with so great laughter at his folly, that all men were ready
therewith to burst. And yet this other performed by one surnamed Moscouita, was
far more solemn and famous, who being to make a funeral Oration to the
communaltie of Bracciano, upon the death of a certain Doctor, skipping up in
all haste into the pulpit, and being complete armed, putting his spear in his
rest, with a thundering voice he uttered these words: Whosoever dare be so
bold, to affirm that this Doctor died well, or that the destinies with any
reason cut off the thread of his life, I challenge him to fight with me, and
with my lance in my hand, in this pulpit I will die upon him. For
entertainment of the vulgar sort, I will only declare unto you this other;
that there was one Nicolo of Mount Frustone, who was with so great and perverse
peeuishnes replenished, as that being one day upon the bank side of Poe, he
loosed one of those water mils that stand fast chained together upon the river
while the miller was out of the way, and the mill making fair good way, he
followed it in aboate of Stellata, as far as Francolino, where he did drive it
a shore all broken and defaced: and here he took order, that there should be
a great ditch made to bury it in, waging twelve old beadswomen that should
morn for it, as they do for the dead, and utter these words: O poor mill
mine, buried here at Francoline, what did thou to good Nicolo, that he thus
loosd, and let thee go? We will ever lament, and whale, for of our meal we
shall now fail; out alas and well away, more bread then wit is at this day.
All these therefore betestie and fustian Fools, and have within the Hospital
for a sign before their Cell a Tesiphon, because she is the goddess of their
humours, wherefore with this subscribed petition, we will bow our selves to
call upon her for their aid.

A petition to Tesiphon, for testy and fustian Fools.
THou direful in heaven, furious upon earth, Eumenides in hell, great daughter
of night, and Acheron, remove a little thy fustian fumes from these men,
because many times they are ouer-peeuish and head-strong: even as thou wilt,
that at thy Temple thou hast in Athens, there may by them be offered unto thee
a couple of Westminster pigeons, mild and pleasant, which have a thousand
times heretofore been vowed to thy service, to manifest unto the world that
glorious and peevish humorists allured by thy favour, as with a bait, from
evil, may sometimes become as gentle as lambs.

Of outrageous, fell, and Bedlam Fools: the four and twentieth discourse.
AMongst the whole race of Fools, there are not any more insupportable, then
those whom we call Fell, and outrageous Fools, for the quality of their
humour is so wild and untamed, as it is requisite to avoid them, no otherwise
then we would shun the fury of cruel and ravenous beasts. Neither are they
mad and furious only towards others, endammaging them with the fury they are
possessed withal, but this rage turns also upon themselves, transporting
away their minds to all kind of evil, that may be imagined. Ancient Hercules
is painted with this kind of fury set forth, who after he had put on Nessus
the Centaurs coat, through impatience of grief, threw himself into the
flames of Mount Oeta: whereupon Claudian says: Claudianus.
Thou fliest the top of Oetes, flaming all on fire:
And Ouid in the thirteenth of his Metamorphosis brings Ouid.
in Aiax the son of Telamon, ravished with this fury, for the sentence the
Graecians gave, that the arms of Achilles should rather be given to Vlysses
then him. Even so doth Ariosto describe very rarely the foolish Ariosto.
fury of Orlando, in two particular stanzas, in the first of which he saith:
Writings I cut, and stone making to fly
There shivers: up unto the azurd sky:
And in the other he saith: I cast into the water, shrubs, bows, stones,
clods, trees:
Making it (clear before) as foul as any lees:
And this is the cause why in an other place he describes, that when
Astolphus would have healed him: he bound him with many ropes, like a Bedlam
Fool, as now he was become. Athamas the son of Aeolus is described for so
bestial and furious by the Poet Ouid, as in his outrageous humour he killed
his own son named Learcus, and these be Ouids verses in the sixth de fastis:
From hence it grew that Athamas, so cruel did remain:
And that by fathers hand, Learcus was so slain.
Herodotus reports this of Cambyses, that having violated Herodotus.
the god of the Egyptians called Apis, he was after this fact couerted into so
great fury madness, that thorough the very hellish furies stirred up, he first
slew al his whole family, converting afterwards foolishly his fury, and
killing himself. Propertius also in his third book places Alcmeon the son
of Amphiareus Euriphile, Propertius.
amongst mad and outrageous fools, who for killing of his mother, was by a
strong imagination led and induced into this kind of folly, wherefore he
saith of him, Alcmeons fury or the fastes of Phineus:
Lucanus in his first book, mentions one Pentheus among the Fools of this
kind, who for having contemned Lucanus.
Bacchus his divinity, was by that god chastised, in making him become
foolishly furious like a beast, whereupon he saith: In mind no greater rage,
or fury ever had,
Agave or Pentheus, when they were wood and mad.
Of Orestes the son of Agamemnon, and Clytemnestra, Caelius
Caelius writes, that after he grew mad for the killing of his mother, he
rent all the garments off his own back, and bit off one of his fingers; so
that in Paulus Manutius a proverb did arise, Oresti pallium Paulus Manutius.
texere: to weave Orestes his cloak, speaking of one who makes present use of
a thing, that in the end is by him spoiled and abused. A certain soldier of
Brisighella, was in these our days a notable outrageous fool, who growing into
fury for love of a Fauentine curtezane, devoured a whole gauntlet and
brest-plate at a time, so mightily did this caprichious humour fume up into his
brain, as that he could not discern his own defensive arms from bread to
eat. And like to him was Camble king of Lydians, who (if Caelius say truth)
provoked by a ravenous fury, eat up his wife one night as she lay by him, and
finding in the morning one of her hands in his mouth, he became foolishly
mad, even as a beast that must be fast tied and bound. I think not the
example of Santin of Villa Franca to be the coldest, and most threadbare one
of all the rest, who falling into fury, about a cow and an ox he had which
died, went to a stable of one of his neighbours, where there was an ass, and a
sow with many pigs, where, by this madness provoked, he killed them all, and
eat half the ass, before he so much as once drunk. An other called
Marchion, of Buffaloura in the territory of Millaine, being sacristan to a
certain vicar about Varese, he also through misfortune entered into these
brutish humours, by reason of a few fetches that were stolen from him by a
coosening knave, wherefore growing by and by cock a whoop in his brain, he
ran presently into the steeple, and eat an whole clapper of a bell, to the
great solace, though loss of that communaltie, when they knew of it. But yet
Peter Antonio of the valley of Taro, a gardner by profession, performed
somewhat a more solemn beastialitie; for having had certain fruit of his
spoiled in the night (as so it chanced) he fell herewith into so wonderful
an amazement and furious ecstasy with all, that with his teeth he tore and
devoured aspade, shovel, and dung-cart, not being able to mitigate this
violent humour, which besides all reason did drive him to madness. Like unto
this man was Dominicon of Guastalla, who by a mischance in a morning had a
bed of young beans killed and spoiled, and for so small a matter he grew
into that fury and spleen, as disposed upon this no more to plough, he eat
up his fodder stack, plough, and oxen, in less then five days. Let it
therefore suffice, that such like men be called outrageous, brutish, and
Bedlam fools, and within the Hospital they have god Mars hanging out for a
sign, because by him they are upheld in those fantastical humours that
possess their heads: Therefore let us have recourse unto him, as to that god
which kindles the fire of theirfurie, to the end that blowing it as little as
may be, they may of such folly be healed, and recover their former estate.

A supplication to god Mars for outrageous, brutish, and bedlam Fools.
TO thee eldest son of Iupiter and Iuno, called sometimes Mars, sometimes
Mamers, and otherwhiles Mauors, because thou reuoluest and turn topsy
turuey great matters, now Mars the revenger, Grandeuan god, dear brother in
law to Bellona, I now come to offer unto thee the recommendation of these
outrageous and brutish fools, who daily grow in foolish humours, to the end
that withdrawing from them thy terrible influence, they may gently like lambs
suffer themselves to be tied, even as thou thy self were sweetly bound fast
with Venus in Vulcanes net. If therefore beside the songs and hymns of the
priests Salij, thou desire to hear a still pipe sounding in thy Temple: and
over and above the carpe and pike fishes, that were anciently consecrated to
thee, thou be willing farther to see offred the paw of a great beast, yield
some hope of recovery to these poor miserable wretches, who will not fail to
offer unto thee fully as much, as hath hitherto been vowed and promised.

Of gross and three elbowed Fools: the five and twentieth discourse.
IT is an use and custom, to name certain men in the world, by the title of
gross and three elbowed fools, when such an extreme iocunditie takes place
in them, or rather a kind of levity unusual boldness, which inciteth them to
speak and perform some follies, not altogether unlike the disposition they
are of: and these are for the most part a vain kind of people, which draw
very near to buffones, or scoffers, they uttering jests that procure
laughter, and playing their pranks out of all season, as those who
notwithstanding it be lent, yet make it still Shrouetide; and as well in bad
as good times, retain still their humours of follies, not respecting (as
before I said) neither time, place, persons, nor a thousand other necessary
circumstances. The ancient example of Damasippus Athenian, celebrated by
Caelius, Caelius.
gives evident knowledge and testimony of a gross and three elbowed fool:
for of so pleasant a mould he was, that being ever in his merry pranks, he had
always a route about him, like a Christmas fool, and partly with his apish
gestures, and monkeie girnes, and partly with his scoffs, jests, and other
fopperies, he entertained the multitude many hours, playing the knave
sometimes out of all cry with those that crossed and plucked him by the beard,
with answerable crackroperie. It may be said, that Antonella of Rubia was also
in the number of these three elbowed fools, for he was continually set upon so
merry a pin, as it seemed he had some fly, or familiar that stirred up in
him these comical and trivial merriments: And amongst others, as he was in
presence of a lord of great quality, falling into his wonted rye, he
performed so many merry tricks, counterfeited so well some fools of his
country, and struck so notably into all kind of rogerie, as it wanted
little, that this great lord had not been overcome with laughing at them. He
which was called the Emperor of Bologna, (although he be not so well known to
every one) yet was he also well stuffed with such like matter; and amongst many
others, there is one most wonderful, reported by those that knew him, which
is this; that being Vicar one day to a certain President, who had left him
charge, to publish in his own absence certain proclamations, which were
flatly against public liberty and his own, and for this cause were odious to
every one, like a gross headed fool as he was, he yet played the crier
himself, and after the publication of them, he said, that the President had
good days himself, and he had thus far obeyed his command in publishing
them, and they that would might likewise observe them; as for himself he meant
to keep no circumstance thereof, and thus with exceeding laughter he left them
all, perceiving the good affection that he himself bore to those
proclamations: The other called by the vulgar Mascella d'Asino, was also one of
this tribe, for being servitor to a very rich Spanish knight, who one day
threatened that he would take off his head (using badly the Italian word
capezza, which signifies an halter or head-straine) and he faining not to
understand it (though he had it presently at his fingers ends) went into the
stable where there were ten or twelve horse head-straines, and bringing them
all to his master, he said, that his noble Signory might take which of them
he would, so it would please him to forbear that with which his truss was
tied up; so that the Spaniard was fain to laugh at this fellows mad coceit,
and thus passing over his choler, he received him to former grace. They
therefore like unto these above mentioned, are called gross and three elbowed
fools, and within the Hospital they have hanging out for a sign, the
goddess Volupta or Voluptina, sometimes so devoutly reverenced amongst the
Romaines, on whom according to our usually manner, we will in this under
written supplication, for their help and succour, invoke.

A supplication to goddess Voluptina, for gross and threeelbowed Fools.
BY the great alacrities and contentments, which in thy dear bosom are laid
up, O goddess Voluptina; by Democritus his laughter; by that of Philisto
Nicean, who therewith burst again; by the joy of Phillipides Comedian, that
died with the same; by the exhilaration of Chilo Lacedemonian, that gave up his
ghost in his sons arms, after he had seen him crowned in the game of
Olympus; by as many tigh-hees as ever came out of god Liber or Bacchus his
mouth; and lastly by all that iocunditie which is resident in the whole Chore
or Quire of the graces: I pray, rebeseech, and once again entreat thee, that
thou wilt but so much bridle the disposition of these three-elbowed fools to
mirth and iolitie, that if not wholly recovered, yet at least that they be
somewhat bettered by thy means, and favour; which doing, be sure they will
hang up in honour of thee in thy temple, a Cimball or droane pipe, much like
that of Morris dancers in a merry May day morning, in token that with so
ready succour thou hast ioifully relieved these poor miserable men.

Of Fools obstinate, like to an horse or mule: the six and twentieth
discourse.
THatrace of stiffenecked fools, replenished with such obstinacy, as they
seem harder then the diamond, and must be entreated four whole hours
together to yield unto the least jot of that becomes them, standing naturally
upon wilfulnes, and being as stiff as a stake, within this foolish Hospital,
are properly called fools obstinate like a mule. In holy Scriptures, obdurate
Pharao was for a most notable example one of these; whose marble hart hath left
unto posterity a lamentable memorial of an obstinate fool, of whom it may be
doubted whether he were son to Obduracie it self, or that he were progenitor
or father of the same. Iultan the Apostata, is also by writers set down for a
fool of this kind, who in his life being ever an enemy, and contrary to
Christ, in his last gasp also most felonious accursed he never repented
himself of his former contempts, for mad with anger and fury against him,
(although he confessed that he was plainly subdued) he contended with words
to despise the victor; saying, O thou Galilean thou hast vanquished: All the
ancient cruel tyrants as Dionysius, Busiris, Phalaris, one Hieronymus,
Policrates, Creon, and they of late days, as one Romaine Ecceline and
Valentine, with others, are placed in this infamous and reproachful squadron;
besides the base fry of those, of whose folly there remains no other mention
in writers, but that they put them into this Hospital of force, in that it was
built at their suit, and instance. Amongst whom I will mention one, that would
make one run his head against a wall to hear the irksome, mulish, and
Asinaicall obstinacy (as we may well term it) which was found in a fellow
worthy well to be beaten with staves, as they beat down walnuts with long
poles, called Bronte of Saint Alberto, who being borne as it should seem for
a spectacle of unusual wilfulnes, and obstinacy of mind, stood stiffly one
day to it, that whereas Donatus in a place saith, Ianua sumrudibus, I am a
gate, entrance, or instruction to the rude and ignorant; this word Ianua in
that place was meant by the city of Genoa, and for confirmation of this his
opinion, he cited the authority of a certain Physical vocabulare, which one
master Simon a Genowese, hath made upon all Galens works, where he said, that
he had seen it thus expressed: and notwithstanding there wanted not many
learned men in every corner, who perceiving this his simplicity, openly
condemned him of his obstinate position, yet would not this Puglian beetle head
ever yield, or be persuaded, that it signified a gate: there was arguing and
debating to and fro, sometimes with this reason, and otherwhiles with that; and
at last, resolute in no sort to acknowledge his error, he said, that if it
were not meant by Genoa, it was not in like manner understood by a gate, or
port, but rather by a porter, or gate-keeper so as perceiving the sophistry
and deep distinction of this buffone, that argued logically, every one blessed
himself for wonder, that he had but yet yielded so much to the honourable
assembly that was about him. An other archpedant, and most pedantic
pedagoge, (for that is the head strongst ging of all others, in that it is the
blindest most ignorant) surnamed Blesus; entering one day into disputation with
a master of a school, being a learned man, of great understanding, and
excellently well accustomed, concerning those words of Cato: Trocho lude, aleas
fuge: Whip the top, let dice go hop; he so obstinaely maintained, that Cato
in these words gave leave to young men to play at snaphaunch, and that in their
diet, they in any wise should take heed of garlic, as this discreet and wise
teacher was fain to leave him to his ignorance, saying, he had reason to do
as he did. This peevish obstinate Pedant after the masters confirmation,
further adding these words: See whether I knew as much as I affirmed or no;
for I have read Diomedes, Scopa, and Priscian, more then four times over, and
I have a Dictionary called Tortello Nouarese, or Dunses dry fat of words and
phrases, that cleereth all them of doubt, which stand out in contention, and
disputation with me about these points. Suffice it that such be obstinate
Fools like the mule, who within the Hospital have for their devotion the
image of Minos, a godhead peculiarly appropriated to them, and therefore with
solemn invocations, let us have recourse unto his help and favour, as being
most requisite and beneficial for them.

An invocation to god Minos, for Fools obstinate like a mule.
OThouseuere, inexorable, not to be entreated, immovable, inflexible, god of
the Stigian lake, son of Iupiter and Europa, most mighty King of Creta,
husband to that Pasiphae, who through lust inflamed with the love of a Bull,
foolishly prostrated her self unto him, a bitter persecutor of Dedalus, for
making that Cow of wood, wherein his luxurious concubine lying hid, he had
opportunity of dishonest commerce with her: by that hard and strict severity
which thou did not only use in this, but in all our filthy enormities, I
entreat, beseech, and conjure thee, that with these manner of obstinate, who
have taken to themselves thy image for devotion, thou wilt proceed in such a
sort, that they now blind, may perceive how this their obstinacy is far
unlike thine: for thou in circumstances honest, and just were always exorable,
but they in things inconvenient and unbeseeming, do so peruersly persevere, as
there is no proportion in the world between them, and thy disposition. Procure
therefore thou sacred deity of god Ditis his kingdom, that the difference of
you both may be known, reach unto them that perceiuerance which reigns in
thee, considering that for the favour thou herein show to this obstinate
crew, thou shalt see offred unto thee a good clout of leather, such as the
Rustics of Romagnia set upon their shoes, the which shall be fastened before
thy image as an ensign, to manifest that the obstinacy they have obtained from
thee, is far more beneficial then that other they were possessed withal
before.

Of pildpated and odious Fools: the seven and twentieth discourse.
THey are commonly called pildpated or odious Fools, who taking delight to
offend sometimes one, and then another, not being able to contain, their
humour applies it self one while against this man, and then against that; so
as in the end it comes to this pass, that either the most part, all, or
those of the better sort join together, and seeking revenge, they cause them
to remain pildpated fools; for they be those that bear away sometimes the
good bastenadoes, and carry home the blows upon their heads, which oftentimes
for their blockish importunities they have deserved. And though sometimes it
may be thought otherwise, because they are stout and peremptory out of measure
in their own conceits, hoping in this sort to bear down their companion or
any man they deal withal, whom they esteem but as a withered Tavern Ivy
bush, yet do they so much the rather remain taken of a sudden: For it seldom
times happens, but that he who presumes so much of himself, is at last taken
up for halting, by another as stout as he, that will stand hard to his tackle,
and return buff for baffe. Cateline thought to have taken Marcus Tullius
napping, with a notable plot he devised against him; but this wise and
politic man returned all the mischief upon his own head, and by means of
the same woman discovering all his practises, he hampered him in such a sort,
that in the end (as Salust writes) he together with all his companions
remained as Salust.
a pildpated and odious Fool. Lodouicus called Morus (as Guicciardine writes)
thought wonderfully to despite Guicciardine.
Ferdinand K. of Naples, by calling in the Frenchmen into Italy against him;
but in the end that fell out, which it should seem a Florentine ambassador
foresaw very well, who observing on a time in Milane his devise, which was a
Moore that voided and swept away all immundicities from before a Lady, gave
his censure thereof, which was, that he should take good heed, this Moore might
cleanse away all impurities from him, for in the end himself rested one of
these pildpated fools, loosing together, both his state, life, and honour. In
like manner Laurence de Medices, near kinsman to Duke Alexander, thought he
had performed a great exploit (as Iouius recounts, Ruscellus more copiously
then he) in killing this Duke within one of the chabers of his Iouius,
Ruscellus.
palace, although no other effect ensued of this fact, but that for this
flagition he was esteemed as an infamous treacher of all the world, and he
exchanged an happy contentment for a daily disturbance, and molestation both
of body and mind, while according to his deserts he was at last, by certain
of the others guard, slain in Venice. And I pray you tel me one thing? Did not
that Bourbone so much renowned for the sack of Rome, think peradventure to
have given some sound blow, in suddenly revolting against his king, who for
courtesy, magnanimity, and all kind of virtue had never his peer? Whereas in
the end every one held him but for an odious traitor, and he gave occasion to
that Spanish gentleman (as Bugato reports) being of a generous Bugatus.
and noble spirit, to show the greatness of his mind, and Castilian haughtines
to Charles the fifth, for the Emperor demanding of him in courtesy, that he
would lend him his palace or house to lodge Bourbone in, he made answer: that
for himself he would deny nothing to his sacred majesty, but so he might be
sure of one thing, that he should no sooner be departed out of it, but that he
would pluck down this house even to the very foundations, to the end no man
might point at it, or say: This is the house of such a gentleman, where that
traitor Bourbone was sometimes lodged. Did not George Sanese also think to
have effected a notable piece of service, in minding to deliver into the French
men's hands the Castle of Milane? And yet this treason being discovered, the
Traitor lost both the friendship of the one, with his life and good name at an
instant. All these kind of men therefore are called worthily pildpated
Fools, because they are discovered, and it comes home to them at length, even
as they thought to have taken others tripping. And these men have for their
sign within the Hospital a Rhadamantus, to whom I now turn my self, to
demand succour (as usually I am wont) for these miserable, ignorant, and
treacherous sort, with sword ready drawn.

A supplication to Rhadamantus for pildpated Fools.
AMong all the infernal judges, there is not any more upright or severe then
thou and Minos, together with Eacus the son of Egina, and Iupiter: And
therefore for this cause thou art deservedly called upon, to salve and cure
this kind of unjust fools, that in the kingdom of Ditis sit in the
chiefest chair: perform therefore that which is expected from thy office
place, (as reason requires) we will offer unto thee a piled threadbare gown,
that hath been in the hands of a Iewe for the space of ten years, which
shall not have upon it so much as one nap or hair, for a testimonial, to
the end this may manifest unto the world, that there is not any who better
lays open and discovers these pildpated fools then thy self, they being
subject to that whip and scourge, which wonderfully chasteneth men of their
quality and condition.

Of irregular and unbridled Fools: the eight and twentieth discourse.
THose insolent sort, who rashly and licentiously proceeding, usurp a
liberty to offend others, either in words or deeds, they thinking the whole
world to be their own, and that with this abused liberty, they may at their
pleasure, bandy against every one, are in few words termed, unbridled
fools, like an horse, having naturally inserted in them indomptable minds,
and insolent shameless dispositions; neither can you with fitter epithets
more aptly describe the quality of this foolish crewe, who kick and wince
with their heals, forward, behind, and on all sides, at every one they meet
withal. It seems that Seneca in his Epistles reckoneth one Oscus to be in
the Seneca.
number of these, of whom it is said, that he was borne into the world to be
unquiet, and a disturber, he with his actions and speeches annoying sometimes
one: and sometimes an other, and in few words, that Momus is by the Poets
numbered amongst these men, for of him it is thus written, that, Nullum opus tam
absolutum esse poterat, quod non calumniaretur Momus: no work could be so
absolute and perfect, but that Momus would carpe at it: And in token of this,
there is produced a very ridiculous action of his, being this; that seeing on a
day that excellent picture of Venus engraven by divine Phidias, because he
could find no sufficient fault with the singular workmanship, yet would he
needs caffle and carpe, that the latchets of her shoes were not very well
represented. And these be the men that in their evil nature and condition go
seeking out hairs on egg shells, of a malicious and viperous inclination.
Marinello of Gambacorta, was in these our days one of the number of these
licentious fools; for when as on a time he had leave by chance to see a
comedy which was played in Vincenza, beginning at the prologue, and running
over all the rest of the parts, he spake evil, and discommended sometimes
this, and then that plaier, so that one near him, through impatience was
forced to say unto him, gentle brother, I pray you give over this scoffing,
for we would willingly hear the Clown to play his part. And an other of
one Portia, surnamed Cauezza, or Horse-collar, is not much unlike this, who by
a certain friend of his being brought to see the hall or chamber where the
great Venetian Council sits, when it was replenished with so many gentlemen
and Signiors, adorned out of question, with comely bodily presence, a grave
majesty, correspondent to so great Senators as they are, like an huge ox or
elephant as he was, without all sense he began to observe this mans hat,
and that mans nose, the standing still of one, and the moving of an other;
neither did he leave this sight or spectacle before he had made a catalogue of
all that honourable assembly or council, the true honour and ornament, not
only of Italy, but even of all Christendom: when a circumspect Senator that
was near, making a sign with one of his gloves, that he should come to him,
he wentimmediately at this beck, and being by the Senator demanded, of
whence he was, being given to understand that he was of Portia, as also
knowing that his surname was Cauezza (or Horse-collar) taking him quickly by
the collar, he used these words: Master Grunt of Hoggenorton, although an
halter would well become you, yet I pray you return again to yourtowne of
Porkington, except you mean to become a collop of bacon: through which words,
bedawed and gulled as he was, he returned to his companion, and said, come for
gods sake let us be gone, for the gentleman you saw told me in my ear, that
there is a penalty set down, of three twitches with a cord, for any that
shall stand gaping at this gate. Of these kind of fools more lately, were
Aretine, Franco, Burchiello, Bernia, and other such like friends of Pasquine,
Marforius; wherefore no marvel though at length they came to be sifted out,
and by those soundly bitten, An image with in the court of the Capital in
kome.
against whom they had showed themselves, out of all measure insolent and
impudent. Neither belongs there any thing more to these fools, but that a
good hempen halter so gag their throats, as that they may no more be able
to vomit forth such acerbitie and bitterness, which so hard against their wills
they keep enclosed in their breasts. These unbridled fools therefore, have the
image of Hippona in the Hospital, as the peculiar goddess of their
necessities and wants: wherefore with this supplication following, we will labour
to pacify her in such sorre, as that she may not suffer these savage and
accursed beasts, thus to strike and fling at every one.

A supplication to goddess Hippona, for unbridled fools.
WHen the ancients (O dunghill goddess) placed thy acceptable image in sties
and stables, it was not in contempt of thee, being thus amongst beasts as one
scorned or neglected, but because they knew that all creatures have some god or
goddess their favourite, as Syluanus is god of sheep; Miagro the god of flies;
Bubona goddess of oxen; and for this cause also were thou adored as the
goddess, overseer of horses, and their stables, and if Nicholas Cuchiero of
Saint Quaranta knew but thus much, be thou assured, though he be but a poor
man, yet would he spend three-halfepence in buying of thy image, to fasten on
the top of his cart, that at all times thou may be a favourite to his
horses: And therefore for this cause, have those poor tankerdbearing jade in
recommendation, who though they were never good for any thing else, yet may
they serve to fill three or four cesternes with water: But if propitius,
according to thy accustomed manner, thou shalt behold with a pitiful eye other
mensnecessities, thou shalt perceive that with as much speed as is possible,
no trifles shall be offered unto thee, for when thou think least upon it, a
couple of huge malt sacks like those of Gonella will come, by which it shall be
known, that these me now bear right down weight, who before were unbridled,
and without any toleration or retention that was good.

Of extravagant, extreme, and right Fools indeed: the nine and twentieth
discourse.
ALl those by this common term are called extravagant, extreme, and right
fools indeed, who perform certain extraordinary, unusual, and strange
follies, which exceed ordinary bounds, and are not heard or seen to be
performed by few others besides themselves; as that was which Elian reports
by one Trasillus Esonensis, who fell Aelianus.
into this extreme folly, that he believed all the ships that entered into the
port to be his own, and therefore before they arrived near the harbour, he
would go meet them with a joyful hart and countenance, being full of
contentment; and so in like manner when they departed to make any voyage,
either eastward or westward, he would accompany them a good piece of the way,
wishing unto them with a good hart, a prosperous wind happy voyage. Aristotle
also declares, that there was one in Abydo, who beginning to enter Aristotle.
into folly, and so continuing long time, he would go into the Theatre,
reciting to himself some Comedy, he would perform all those actions and
gestures which Comedians use upon the stage. And Plutarch rehearses Plutarch.
one most solemn and admirable of certain Mylesian virgins, who were assailed
with so great madness, that without any consideration they all hanged
themselves, neither could any admonitions of their elders or parents tears
withdraw them from it: In the end, the Milesians being in Senate or
Council, and debating of this action, a notable man amongst them rose up and
said; that if such like as these persevered in their foolish determination, it
would be requisite to enacte a law, that they should be all disrobed left
hanging naked, and offered to public view, the which decree being of all
approved, and consequently put in execution, the rest received such terror by
the same, as they refrained from their former humours, honest modesty
prevailing more with them, like women verecundious as they were, then folly.
Like unto the death of these women, was likewise the ends of Laurentiano
Fiorentino, a man learned, and of Leonius an excellent philosopher of his time:
For (as Peter Crinitus writes) without any occasion, or misfortune whatsoever,
they threw Peter Crinitus.
themselves into a well, where no less foolishly then miserably, they ended
their days. That folly of Theobaldo of Cantiana was in good' earnest most
extreme, who verily believing that he was Soldane of Egypt, he went oftentimes
vnhosed and unshod (as they do) and with a Turban on his head, into a
certain vault near the place where he dwelt, the which he said was his
great Moschyte, or Temple: and he carried with him to the mouth or entrance of
this cave or vault, a company of young swine, who, said he, were the
Ambassadors of sundry princes, which for honour accompanied him; and thus
entering in, he made all the vault thunder again with these verses, which he
chanted: You Mahumetans, now give ear and muse
On that which Sultan Theobald doth say:
If you the Alchor an, do not peruse,
You can not saved be an other day.
An other called Scarpaccia of Gradisca, had an extravagant humour in his head,
(as it may be termed) for entering into conceit that he was king of Cuckoos,
to every one that spoke to him, whether it were good or evil, he would
always answer three times, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo: and being demanded why he
answered not to the purpose, he replied again, I am the king, cuckoo, cuckoo,
cuckoo. I remember I have heard say, that one Alberto of Pietra mala, which is
the confines of Bologna, was in deed one of these extrauagants; for entering
into conceit that he was become Lord of Mirandula, he writ a letter to
those of the town, that they should render into his hands the fortress, and
receiving no answer of his folly, in great fury he leaps me a cockhorse,
and took a drum upon his shoulders, going from Pietra mala, even to the
confines of Mirandula, to wage war with them on his own part; in which thing
like a fool as he was, being also flouted, he went under the walls of that
town, and laying an hot tourd near to the gate, said, that if the
Myrandulanes would not receive him for their Lord, yet they should accept of
the other whom he left as his substitute. These be those fools, who within
the Hospital have the image of God Hercules for a sign, who is very doubtful,
whether he should be protector and defender for term of life of these kind
of fools or no, and therefore in this solicitation ensuing, we will tickle
him with an Encomion, according to our accustomed manner.

A petition to god Hercules for extravagant, extreme, and right Fools indeed.
THou art that strong and valiant son of Iupiter, and Alcmena, called
Thirintius, because thou werte nourished in Therintus near to Greece; called
the Theban god, because thou were worshipped in Thebes; termed the extravagant
god, because as a vagaband, thou went demanding seeking out of monsters;
named the great Alcides, because thou were nephew to famous Alceus. Thou art
further he, who by thy own fortitude, and through thy mother who produced
thee, so much by Iuno envied, and exposed to insupportable labours, did
first weary her in obeying, before she was out of breath with commanding: Thou
art also he, who yet lying in the cradle did kill two serpents, which were
put in there to poison thee: Thou art moreover he, who being but a child in
years, and yet of wonderful force, that in one night did raise the bellies
of Thespius fifty daughters, by whom thou had fifty sons, named
Thespiades: Thou art he likewise, who in adolescency of years, did oppress
with fire and sword, the great Hydra with seven heads, which continually
sprouted forth one after the loss of an other, near the marish which was
called Lerna: which did kill and pluck down the stag Eripides, which
ran as if he had flied, with gilded horns on his head, near to the
mountain called Menalus: which in the wood Nemea, did flea that
extraordinary huge lion, and from that time forward did always wear his
skin about thee as a trophy: who gave Diomedes king of Thrace to his own
horses to be eaten, who fed them before with the blood and flesh of his
guests and friends: which took alive, and did carry to Aristeus, that
terrible Bore in Erymanthus, a mountain of Arcadia, that wasted all the
country round about. Further, thou art he, who did chase even to the land
of Aretiades, the birds Stymphalides, which were so great, that they obscured
the light of the sun: who in like manner did tame that wild bull, which
with his fury ruinated the whole island of Candia: which did take from king
Achelous of Etolia, his horns: did kill Busyris king of Egypt, who eat
devoured all the strangers which came to him: who in Lybia did choke and
suffocate the giant Anteus, wrestling with him: which did separate and divide
the mountains, Calpes, and Abila, which were at the first all one: which did
sustain Olympus, being before wearied with the heavy burden of mount Atlas:
who subduedst in war Geryon King of Spain, carrying away his arms, being a
worthy reward for the victor. Above all this, thou art he, that did overcome
the thief Cacus, which spit fire out of his mouth: that did kill another
called Lacinus, who molested the confines of Italy, erecting up in that place a
Temple to Iuno, which hereupon was called Lacinia: that did overcome Albion
and Bergion, not far from the mouth of the river of Rhodanus, who disturbed
every mans quiet travel: that did subdue in war Pirrhecmus king of
Etolia, who made war upon the Boetians, and did pluck him asunder at horses
tails. Again, thou that did tame the Centaurs, and carry away the two
pillars to the Ilandes Gades in Spain; that did make clean the stables of
Aurgia, and deliver Hesion the son of Laomedon exposed to a marine Orcke, or
monster, by first killing of the Orcke: who being angry when ungrateful
Laomedon, denied thee the reward of certain excellent coursers he promised,
did for this destroy the city of Troy: who did sack the Land of Con,
kill king Eurypalus together with his sons, despoil the Amazons, and took
prisoner Hippolyta the Queen of them: who descending into hell, did bind
with three chains three headed Cerberus; and thus bound, did bring him out.
Thou art also he, which did assist Theseus (according to many writers) to
ravish Proserpina, the wife of Pluto: did lead living out of hell Alcestes,
companion to king Admetus, to her husband; and being returned from hell did
kill Lycus king of Thebes, for that he would have offered violence to thy wife
Megra: who with thy arrows did pearce through the Egle, that devoured the
renewing hart of Prometheus, confined by Mercurie in Mount Caucasus: who
fighting on horseback, did overcome Cygnus the son of Mars thy competitor;
which subduedst the Cyclopes, whilst as a maid thou did attend on Omphale
Queen of the Lydians: that did destroy Hebeus with all his family; wounding
also Iuno, who would have succoured him: and did kill Eurytus King of
Ochalia, ruinating the city called by his name: And yet once more thou art
he, which did by force take unto thy self, and conduct with thee into
Euboea Iole, the daughter of the foresaid Eurytus, who was denied thee to wife:
that near the river Sagari did kill a serpent of immeasurable greatness;
did slay the Dragon that kept the garden of Hesperides, freeing the Oteans
from gnats and hornets; and this only for generation sake, that of two nights
there might be made but one: and with so many of these thy great woonders, and
miracles shall it not be true, that thou can likewise perform somewhat, in
the behalf of these vain and weak sort of extreme Fools, of thee true man,
but in all thy attempts a god, exceedingly favoured, that they may remove the
matter out of their heads, which thou in an instant did purge from the heads
of the serpent Hydra. Well go to, if thou shalt do them this favour, I will
promise thee, that besides the Temple thou hast amongst the Egyptians, and
Tirians, there shall a great chapel in this Hospital be consecrated to thy
name, and an Oak apple offred at thy aultar, in sign, that it is as easy for
thee to deliver them, as to promote up so high such a like fruit, amongst all
others observed to be of no worth.

Of mischievous or diabolical Fools: the thirtith discourse.
THE most brutish, strange, and accursed kind of Fools that be, are out of al
question some, whom we usually call by this name of mischievous, or diabolical
fools, the title or imposition, fitting very well with the infernal and
diabolical inclination they are of; for they are so viperous, and inwardly so
swollen with rancour, despite, and all kind of pride, that any one would
swear, they were the true cousin germans of another Farfarello, and
Calubrino. Neither are the examples of these very few, for the devil goes
all over sowing of them, like the herb Dogs-foote, and of themselves they bud
forth like to Hydras heads, and with their flames they set (if it were
possible) all heaven on fire, much more the earth. No man can deny but that
those giants were of this race, who by Iupiter for their pride were slain with
lightning from heaven, for the writer or Author of Etra makes this matter
very evident in those verses: The ancient Giants did sometimes contend,
To pluck the stars out of the lofty sky,
And to pervert, Ioues kingdom without end
Imposing laws on all the world boldly.
In like manner it cannot be denied, but that Mazentius a contemner of the
gods, was of the self same race: Virgill setting him down for such an one in
these verses: Virgill.
The first from Terrhene soil, that went to war,
Was proud Mazentius, who with gods did jar.
And this was he of whom Macrobius uses these words: Macrobius.
Fuit impius in homines, sine Deorum respectu: He was wicked towards men, not
respecting God at all. I hold it for a thing very manifest, that Lycaon king
of Arcadia was also a notable devilish Fool, if that be true which Ouid
reports in the first of his Metamorphosis, that Ouid.
he complotted against Iupiter, reputed amongst the ancients as head of all
other gods. Xerxes king of Persia noted by writers of singular impiety, is not
exempted out of this number, he being so bold, nay rather so rash and
headstrong, as that he durst threaten to deprive the sun of his light, and
put Neptune the god of the sea into prison, with fetters on his heels: And
therefore Strozzapadre makes of him these verses: Nor as King Xerxes, who did
threaten bonds Strozzapadre.

To Neptune, when with ships he shot the strondes.
Amongst whom in like manner I give to a thousand devils, that Plegia king of
Lapithes, and father to Ixion; who for rashly setting fire on the Temple of
Apollo in Delphos, is declared by Virgill, that for punishment of his offence,
he was enclosed in an infernal cave, in these verses: All Plegian malefactors,
with loud voice he doth advise
From hell, Justice to use, and not the gods despise.
Valerius Maximus, and Lactantius Firmianus, assigns Valerius Maximus.
Lactantius.
one of the principalest places amongst these men, to Dionysius Tyrant of
Siracusa: for he was so great a contemner of the gods, as he himself amongst
his friends was wont to say, that he greatly wondered, how the gods were so
patient, as to suffer him so long upon the earth. Biondus in his History
makes mention of Euerick Biondus.
King of Gothes, that he rammed up the gates of Christian churches, with heaps
of thorne bushes, wickedly intending to make them appear like hedges and
thickets, because he would be a Fool in this kind. Corius writes of
Gensericus king of Vandales, that with greater sacrilege, of the same
Christian churches he made stables for his horses, being likewise an infernal
Fool of the same nature. What shall we say of Attila, termed the scourge of
God, but even the self same? What of Tottila, and Athanaricus? What shall we
think of that Duke of the Hauuians, who threatened to cut off the privy
members of all the Deacons that came into his hands? What of those first
innouators, who of the great church in Basil, made a butchers shambles? And
last of all, what of our modern Mahumetists, who desperately make the worst of
every thing that they can, committing all kind of rapine, violence,
sacrilege, manslaughter, and rebellion that may be imagined. Now these be
truly Fools, who are mischievous, and therefore deserve a thousand gallows,
termed properly by the title of diabolical Fools, because in every respect
they are conformable unto him: Wherefore in recommending them unto some god,
that may cure them, I can think on no better physician then Pluto, who is in
hell a perfect Anatomy of their like: And for this cause, I direct unto him
this invocation following.

An invocation to Pluto for mischievous and diabolical Fools.
WHatgod may I more conveniently call upon, to remove the folly of this
devilish crew, then thee high Pluto, Prince of Herebus, admiral of the Stigian
waters, president of the flames which exceed a thousand times those of Aetna,
or Mount gybello? what God if not he, who is the son of Saturne and Opis,
brother to highest Iupiter, Lord of the infernal kingdom, being mighty in
riches, and therefore called Ditis, principal amongst the Manian gods,
therefore called Sumanus, and of power to inflict upon them their due
punishments, called therefore Orcus, by every one? what god if not thou, who
rentest Titius hart from out his body, punishest Tantalus with thirst, make
Ixion to be turned upon a wheel, cause Sysiphus to roll the stone, and
chastisest Salmoneus with so sundry torments. Thou I say, the scourge of all
extreme cruelties, the revenger of flagition, the ouerthrower of the wicked,
and flail of all bad men, ought to have a care of healing these men's
folly, in the same manner as thou hast before cured so many other by giving
them into the hands of the furies, who incensed against them, may inflict upon
them those torments, which the greeuousnes of their offence demeriteth. The
which if thou shalt perform, undoubtedly with all speed an hornelesse
doad-man shall be offred unto thee, for demonstration of the punishment thou
hast laid upon these men, according to their deserts, and the insolences
which so diuelishly they have committed.

A discourse of the Author, to the beholders concerning that part of the
Hospital which appertains to Women, wherein he wittily sets down all the
former kinds of folly to be likewise resident in them.
COnsidering (noble beholders) that you have commodiously perused all their
Cells one by one, who diversely besotted and depriued of their wit, are become
not so much a ridiculous, as a miserable spectacle to other men; and that you
have taken such delight in the subjects of them, as you could any ways look
for, from so strange and uncouth humours, administering at an instant by diverse
means, both contentment and wonder to your minds, by the specialties of
folly which you have observed: I think it not much amiss to point out unto
you likewise this other part of the Hospital, allotted to women, causing you
to behold with your eyes, the most ridiculous emploiments of foolish women,
that ever peradventure you have seen in the world. Because with the greater
solace you may leave this harbour, and replenished with greater wonder and
admiration, go all over the world, declaring and setting forth the monstrous
follies, which shall by me be revealed unto you, the which you receiving from
me, will in your relating them to others, administer special contentment:
Fix therefore your looks I beseech you, on that part, which I will point out
unto you, and cast an eye here on the left hand, where you see a long row of
lodgings and chambers, which have so many superscriptions, titles, and devises
set upon their doors; for all those be Cells appropriated to foolish women, to
be hold which leisurely, is accounted no small favour, it being the custom to
show them seldom, and to few, in respect of the modesty observed towards
that sex, naked for the most part as you now see. The first chamber which you
see there with that devise hanging over the door, which is a tuft of wild
nettles, with an inscription, which imports, in puncto vulnus; is the lodging
of a Romaine matron called Claudia Marcella, which in her youth was the most
sweet, affable, Jovial, and pleasant mad wench, that from the one to the
other pole could be met withal; a rare pattern of comeliness, the only
portraiture of courtesy, the image of divine splendour and beauty, and the very
express Idea of courtly grace and carriage: and now (behold howe lamentable
her chance was) slipping one day in her pantofles, as she went to the
solemnisation of goddess Bona her feast, she fell upon a great stone with her
forehead and chin, and thus loosing both her wit and memory at an instant,
she began to be lunatic and doting, after such a sort, as she became every
day worse and worse, sitting upon the bed as you see, al mournfu and
heavy, with an urinal at hand; and as often as you demand an answer of her,
touching this or that matter, so often doth she take the vrinal out of an Hutch
harde by, and beholding herself therein, she saith, this is the wise
prophetess Sybilla; and thus peers sometimes on the urinal glass, and
otherwhiles on the water within it. Whereupon the master of the Hospital, who
is a man of greatknowledge and understanding, about the causes and reasons of
the infirmities there reigning, hath framed that devise, or imprese with the
title, minding ingeniously herein to give gentlemen strangers to understand,
that come to behold this part of the Hospital, by the tuft of pricking
nettles, and that motto; In puncto vulnus: that as the nettle no sooner
touches, but it pricks and stings, so that matron no sooner slipped and
fell upon the stone, but that by the cruel fall she was so affrighted in her
brain, as now she labours and turmoils her-selfe there within as you see.
That other chamber near unto it, where you see one standing in the door, who
all silent and sad, with her eyes looking downward, and all disheaueled, to
fix her countenance upon the earth, never so much as looking upward; but on
the contrary, with her eyes drooping, she so bends her looks to the
ground, as it might seem that her eyes were concentrated and fast linked to the
earth, is one Martia Cornelia, of the country of the Insubrians, who from her
infancy hath been possessed with melancholic humours, and therefore you may
observe her so savage in aspect, and in countenance ghastly. And amongst other
humours which oftentimes disturb her imagination, this one in good earnest is
very terrible, that many times she takes herself to be a silk worm:
whereupon she never doth any thing else but nibble upon mulberry leaves,
affirming that by this means she preserves her-selfe in life: and therefore
you may perceive that the devise and motto, set upon her gate by the master of
the Hospital, be correspondent to her infirmity: the devise being a cod or
web, with a silk worm within, and on the one side a little branch of a
mulberry tree, with a motto framed in these words, Et mihi vitam, alijs decus.
But I pray you look a little foreward, and regard that Cell which hath the
gate open, where she whom you see with a cushinet by her, and a fine wicker
basket with cruel and silk, to work withal, giving over her best
employment, with that needle in her hand, she goes stabbing of flies, and
pismires, in steed of working upon her cushion: she is called Marina de
Volsci, so lither and idle, that the whole day in steed of some serious
labour, she gives her-selfe to bucksomnes, gig-loitry: wherefore the master of
the place hath assigned her for a devise, a gray bearded old man, pursuing of
butterflies, with a motto appertinent to the purpose, Quo grauior, eo segnior.
The fourth Cell which next succeeds, if you mark well (for it hath the gate
gaping and wide open) is made after the fashion of a tavern, wherein a woman
lies prostrate, with her hair loose about her ears, a Thirsus in her hand,
and withal a little bell, serving to ring therewith to god Bacchus his feasts,
who Or javelin wreathed about with Ivy.
is one of those ancient Menades, by some called Bacchides, and by others
Stimeles, in that by Lycus his fury they were stimulated, where this woman
called Teronia Heluetia, with her head full of good Greek and Trebian wines,
doth nothing else but whirl about, shaking that Thirsus or wreathed javelin,
and ringing the bell with all mirth and iolitie. To conclude, growing drunk,
she spreads herself upon the floor of the earth, even as now you find her;
and for this cause she hath a devise made, with a motto answerable to her
ebriety, which is a Magge pie with a sop in her mouth, and these words
vnder-written: Hinc silens, hinc loquax. The other whom you see in the Cell
underneath, who with her rock and spindell, takes a lantern in her hand to
see to work by at high noone day, and when the sun with his beams shines
over the whole Hemisphere, is a mad forgetful fool, which can carry nothing
in mind that she hath to do, who is called Orbilia Beneuentana: wherefore
the devise and motto fitteth exceeding well with her folly, the denise being a
mole, which naturally is blind, with this motto: Haec oculis, haec mente. But
that other miserable and unfortunate poor soul, who as soon as she saw you
look towards her Cell, hid herself behind that close stool, covering her
body with the bolster, and rug of her bed, is a certain pretty tiptoe,
called by all men Lucietta of Sutri, who in al her actions is so fantastical
and skittish, that when she goes sometimes to blow the fire, but feeling the
wind of the bellows, she starts back three fadome, for fear of that blast;
and this tremulent humour can no ways be removed out of her head, though
diverse sundry physicians have tried a thousand experiments for her cure:
wherefore with good consideration that devise is set upon her door, which is; a
cony scraping up the earth, with a motto that saith; Huic fuga salus: because
like a cony she thinks not her self secure, except she hide her-selfe in the
same manner as you see. Oh but for gods sake vouch safe to talk with her,
apparelled all in gray, that hath so great goll or thropple hanging down, as
she may cast it back upon her shoulders, if you will hear a right puppy in
deed: for this is that Menega of Voltolina, daughter to Roganzzo Panada, and
Mathia his wife, who on a time was made believe, that a cow making love to a
frog, and he moved with compassion towards her, not knowing any other course
he could take to content her, he was willing one day while the cow was
drinking at a river, to be swallowed down by her, thus swimming within her
belly, he entered into that concauitie where the cow conceives, and pissing
there within it, he made her after three years space to bring forth a
creature, which had legs like to a frog, and all the rest was like to a pied
or spotted cow, such as those of Hungarie be: wherefore the master of the
Hospital seeing her so round and plump in substance, hath placed upon her
Cell that devise which you see, it being a Buffle, with a ring at his nose,
and this motto Quocunquerapior; because no devise can be more conformable and
correspondent to her humour then this. In that other Cell which you see, there
is a certain silly soul, of an addle and weak brain, as any creature you
ever saw in the world, and she is called Orsolina Capoana, who is of this
quality, that if you bid her sweep the house, she will fall a paring of her
nailes, and yet it will be evening before she have made an end of this work;
and sometimes when she hath been enioined to heate the lie for the buck, she
put her mouth to the spigot of the tubbe, blowing there for the space of three
hours like a very dottrell, and by such like fopperies poor wretch she is so
transported away in her senses, that if you should but bid her void an
urinal, be sure that like a little child, blowing of feathers up into the
air, with a thousand other toys, she will tarry two hours at the least,
and at the last, either bring you the empty case, or the vrinal al battered
and broken, being so simple a drizzell as she is. Therefore marvel not if the
keeper of the Hospital have set that devise upon her door; which is a fly
hovering about a light, and a motto, which in Spanish signifies, No mas, no
menos: for as there is not a more silly creature then this kind of fly,
which houereth so long about the candle, that at last she burns her own
wings; so is there not any so sottish a roile, which may be compared to her. It
seems this other foul flappe-mouth is very like unto her, who hath
forgotten her spindle, while her rock is between her legs, and now much
amazed therefore, and staring with her eyes, she looks upon you, as if she had
never seen man in her life before: this woman is called Thadia di pozzuolo.
And amongst many other of her sotteries this one is very notorious; that when
the Guardian of the Hospital one day commanded her to take a little water out
of the cistern, and set it upon the table, in steed of using the bucket, she
took a porridge pipkin wherein there were colewoorts a seething, set the broth
upon the table, so qualified with cold water, as all men that were present
conceived of her minnerie, together with no indifferent wonder, delight, and
pastime thereat: and for this cause she is set forth with that imprese you
there see, which is a goose climbing on the top of an hedge, with her motto,
Frustranitor; this imprese with the motto thereof signifiyng, that as the goose
is a grosser creature then any other, neither can she so much as fly over an
hedge; so she performs foolishlie all actions whatsoever she goes about,
because she doth not any one thing as she should do. That foul beetle-headed
Margherita Bolognese, remaining there in that Cell below, seems to be a
bird of the same nest, of whose stupidity though there were no other sign or
manifestation in the would; yet would this one trick of hers be more then
sufficient, to prove her so: who being sent by a certain dame to the shops of
the Iewes, about an embassage of hers, to hier braselets and earerings, as they
use to do for setting themselves forth in Carneual time, she going to a
casket of her mistresses, took there out a pair of braselets which she had in
a box, with certain fair earerings, carried them to a Iewe saying; that such
a gentlewoman her mistress sent thither that ware, to be let out for use, and
thus she returned of that message to her mistress, bravely gulled by that
wiseaker, as could be possible; and for a good while there was speech of
nothing else in that house but of this: wherefore you see that proportionablie
the keeper hath placed for an imprese over her door, abroad faced owl, with a
motto which saith; Ipse ego ego ipse. But be hold next unto her within her
Cell, comes that wicked Lucilla da Camerino, who is as vicious us a fool as
possibly can be, and for confirmation hereof, behold the vessel she hath in
her hand: this vessel is full of walnut water, which makes the skin as
black as a cole. Now this woman about noone time besmeareth all her body over,
and being naked draws here to the maids of the keepers house, when it is
about dinner time, so that all of them aghast at so foul a sight, run away,
and leave the table and meat as a pray to that ravenous she wolf, who
without any discretion at all, doth in a manner ordinarily play those
pranks, to the children, servants, and all the rest of the house. Hereupon
she hath over her Cell a devise altogether conformable to her self, which is a
foxes tail that sweepeth a chamber, with this French motto: Parmafoy que liet
tanbien. I say nothing to you of that other despiteful cockscombe called
Flauia Drusilla, whom you see there busied about that little foisting cur,
rubbing and combing him so carefully, as appears, who a little while after,
calling him to her by the name of Fiorino, and he not coming, she grows
into such a fury, as that in choler she would hang, or presently make him
into iellie; and this is her quality, that for every little matter she is so
moved, as cursed Gabrina, or the wife of Pinabell, would have but an harde
match with her. And if there were nothing else, yet is this one part of hers
most notable, which happened the other day: for while she was washing out her
buck, a little lie by misfortune that fell out, sprinkled into one of her eyes;
whereupon this despiteful fool took the bucking tubbe, and threw it against
the wall, breaking it all in pieces, carrying away the clothes she had washed,
and rensing them in a river that ran hard by, where she let all go down the
stream merrily, neither had she recovered any of them again, if a discreet
wench had not run in and told them of the house of it, sending down to the
waters side men with long poles to take them up as well as they could: and
therefore since that time, the master of the Hospital caused a painter a
friend of his, to place over her Cell that devise, which is; a Beaver biting
off his own stones, with this motto; Vlcisci haudmelius: which clearly
manifests the outrageous folly of this beast. Behold that other swine
snowted sowestanding in her door, which doth nothing but gyrne and laugh, and
at the least matter she either hears or sees, sets her mouth wide open like an
ove: She is called Domicilla Feronia, who hath an husband that blockishlie
reciprocateth with her in the same folly, now because her humour consists in
nothing else but immeasurable laughter, the keeper hath caused to be placed
over her door, that owl sitting upon a whip, a creature that would make the
very stones to smile at the sight of her, with this motto; Haec alijs, mihi
alij: for thus her vanity is exceeding well notified, she being a coffin
replenished with carrionlike matter, but void of any wit, or understanding
at all: I cannot tell whether you perceive her that sits at her door upon a
seat, with a gown trailing after her like a peacocks tail, she is called
Tarquinia Venerea, then whom there can be nothing more proud and glorious: and
this I shall tell you manifests as much; for declaring her progeny one day
to certain gentlemen, although it exceeded not two hundred years in
antiquity, yet proved she her-selfe to be of the Queen of Saba her race,
showed therewith a pearl diamond of extraordinary value and estimation, which
she said great king Salomon gave her, when she departed from his court;
forcing every one to believe, that successively by inheritance, these jewels
came in the end to her. And yet one day she uttered a more notable one then
this, declaring to certain ladies and gentlewomen who were come to see her,
that she had yet in her house a pair of hose of taffeta, that belonged to the
Signior and consort of that Queen her kineswoman: wherefore the keeper of
this place observing the simple folly of this woman, and accomodating a devise
to her genius or inclination, he placed over the door of her Cell for an
imprese, the image of Time, after the same sort as it is by Poets described,
which is, by a Dragon eating up his own tail, with a proportionable motto to
the same, that saith: Sola aeternitate victa. But I pray you, do me this one
favour, observe her well which comes after, being called Andronica Rhodiana;
think of her as of a crafty and subtle Fool in deed; for questionless she
fayneth her-selfe to be distracted for no other end, but to enjoy easy and
good days, who in this point discovers her self; for sometimes she will
go into the hen-loft, and get her into the corner where the hen sits,
crying, co co co, to show like an hen that she hath laid an egg; but if any
go to take it up, she cries no more after that manner, brusling her feathers,
or cackling like an hen; but with a good staff in her hand she will make him
stand further from the hen-roost: wherefore the keeper perceiving these her
knavish proceedings, hath set her forth for a dissembling Fool, and placed
over her cell the picture of Fraud, with her balance in her hand wanting of
weight, with a motto adjoining which expresses, Ars fortunae salus, because by
these tricks, she obtayneth pleasant and good days. The other whom you see
beholding the moon at a window, is called Liuia Veletri, because sometimes she
is in perfect sense, as if she never had been possessed with this foolish
influence; and otherwhiles on the contrary, she is so stimulated by this
passion, as that by long experience they gather that she is lunatic:
wherefore the other day she seemed in her speech, and discourse another Palace.
Now if any man speaks to her, he shall find her altogether out of her wits,
tossing and turning like a beggar in fresh straw; for as the moon waynes, so
doth her wit decrease: therefore you see a devise with a motto proportionable
to this humour; the one being a crab which beholds the moone-shining, the
motto being framed in these words: Nunc in pleno, nunc in vacuo. She enclosed
by her parents within the next cell, is the fair Martia Sempronia, where over
the door is painted winged Cupid with a light in his hand, and this motto
subscribed: Desperatasalus. For she inflamed with love, grew foolish not many
years sithence, for the love of one Quintus Rutilius, and not knowing with
what to present this ingratfull young man, for the mitigation of his cruelty
and hard hart, with a needle she let her self blood in a vain, venting a
pound of her blood into a golden cup with a little inscription, that imported;
Si feris humana prosint: the which present being by chance found by her
brothers, was occasion of a great tribulation which she suffered: wherefore
amidst these vexations and injuries, she grew to a desperate degree of loving
folly, whereinto being fallen, by the small love of her parents, she was
confined in the place you see. As a companion to this woman, in another kind
of folly she there shows her self, who hath an haulter prepared fastened to
that iron hooke: for though her name may presage happily, she being called
Mansueta Britannia, yet are her actions quite contrary to the same: for like a
desperate Fool she hath three times fastened the halter about her neck, to
hang her-selfe, and always some one or other hath been ready at hand to
help her: neither can she by the help of physicians any ways be cured of
this desperate disposition, because she hath suffered this passion to have too
great predomination, the which is so much the less excusable, by how much
sometimes upon a trifling occasion, she will needs hang her-selfe; even as the
other day, she prepared that rope in the same manner as you see, only because
a needle was taken out of her pinpillow, and so she could not work on her
cushion as she would have done: wherefore the devise and motto show her
extreme despair; the devise being the body or trunk of a Cypress tree,
which being once cut, never grows again, and the motto: Semel mortua
quiescam. Who would not say that Hortensia Quintilia, she whose residence is
there a little below, were sister to Hortensia of Bergamo, or Sarnie, she being
a starcke noddy as also he was: for if his humour be not included in her, both
one and other may go hang themselves. This woman to show the verity of that I
have said, void of understanding, and of so weak a brain, as she one day
sat idle by the fires side, striking with the tongs upon a burning log, she
took woonderful delight to see so many sparkles come from it, as children do
when playing with their fathers, they ask counters and crowns; when the maid
of the house scumming the possenet, let fall some of the broth upon the block,
and so depriued this fool of her contentment, and brought her self to great
trouble: for she in all fury, took up the billet by one end, and with it went
after the maid all the street over, crying out, lay upon her, lay upon her,
like a queen as she is. Let it suffice, that the matter being afterwards
known, by the maids own report, and those of the house; she growing every
day worse and worse, as it happened, was by her friends constrained to enter in
here, where the Guardian of the Hospital fully informed of her humours,
composed that devise for her which you see, and placed it over her Cell, which
is no other but a choke pear, stricken down with a great haylestone, and this
motto subscribed: Actum est: which concurreth excellently well with her folly,
which surely is headstrong and stirred up by and by. Be merry a little, and
pluck up your spirits in beholding that notable Cogster Terentia Samntte, who
in her gestures, words, inventions, and carriage is the very sister of
Boccafresca, or Gonello: and for proof of this, the other day she sate her
down, and called into the chamber before her all the whole household of the
master of the Hospital, they all running up in hast to hear some goodly matter
come from her (according to her wont) where many being assembled together,
while they expected some discourse, or speech, as otherwhiles she was wont to
make: at this time (not without laughter) she used a thousand gestures, with
her hands, and eyes, sometimes this way, then that way, seeming always, as if
she would even then have begun; at last fetching a deep sigh with a grunt like
an hog, she told them, that the occasion of her calling them together, was to
no other end, but that so noble a grunting belch, might be honoured with so
goodly an assembly as there then was: so that very fitly that devise is set
over her Cell, a great iobbernoll, with a large slop after the Dutch manner
hanging upon the nose, and this motto in Dutch Italian gibberedge: Chesta,
stare bone compagne. But a most Jovial and pleasant humour is that, of Quintia
Emilia, borne to the relaxation and contentment of every one, whose residence
is in a Cell somewhat beneath, having three gentlemen standing by her, to whom
with her speech she gives wonderful pleasure and delight. And not long
sithence one of them demanding of her, at what time women are most foolish:
she wittily answered; when you men will but give them so much time, as to
become so: And to an other, who asked her wherefore nature had bestowed so
little wit on women, she presently answered, that resolving his question
truly, the answer was in readiness, because nature wrought like a woman as she
was. It may suffice that there is a convenient devise deputed for her, which
is, a Iupiter in the midst of heaven sitting upon a throne of gold, with this
motto of the poet; Iouis omniaplena: But mark that same fantastical and
capricchious Herminia Bohema, that for a roasted chestnut the other day, set all
the house in an uproar, and other sometimes she gives to them that would, and
would not; and the other day for a dried Seruise, she cried for the space of
an hour, with her neighbour Marietta, being afterward pacified in a monent:
she hath worthily upon her door for a devise, a great Turkicocke that girds
forward on a sudden, and presently stays, with a motto; Tanto lenis, quanto
propera. And she who is chained to a bed harde by, is a certain beastly
fool called Giacoma da Pianzipane, who the other day plaide this fine prank,
for a boy coming near to her to have emptied her close stool, she took the
pot and laid it on his head, so despitefully, that the poor lad was three
days after, ere he came to himself. And yet not two days since, she
performed an other far beyond this, for finding an ass that was brought
into the house, with two baskets full of eggs upon his shoulders, she took a
kneading tubbe, and so persecuted the poor ass, as she made him fall into an
hole, which served as a sink, to receive all the immundicities of that place,
where the poor beast slumped into the dirt with his pannell, and broke all his
eggs and baskets: And besides in the market she set upon the asses master,
that came behind him, and if he had not suddenly retired himself back, out
of doubt, she had made a mighty carbonado of his head incontinently: wherefore
the keeper considering the brutish humour of this fool, over her Cell hath
caused to be painted fit to the purpose, that Megera disheaueled, and with
hair about her ears, with her motto, which saith; Accensanil dirius. A little
underneath mark her, who is so pensive in view, and looks on the wall with
her mind fixed thereon; she is called Lauinia Etolia, who is an extravagant
and notable fool indeed, and I know thus much by this: for not long since
she writ a conceit to a princess of high place, like to the title of that
which those of Saint Marino in Romagna, writ to the Venetian Signory, saying:
To our dear and well-beloved sister, the Venetian Common-wealth, for those of
Saint Marino, though they be all in a manner rustickes, and country men, yet
live they in a common-wealth like Venetian Signiors; and in that invention she
requested of her a special favour which was; that withal her Damsels, and
weighting maids, she would come and visit her, and stay with her eight days;
for she would for her entertainment furnish a Palace beseeming another
Cleopatra, and among other dainties, she would give her one of a Beuers
stones, not such an one as a friend of mine of Piacenza bought, of a roaguish
coosening mate in the city of Teruigi, but somewhat less, which would perfume
even the very porredge-pot or coleworts within, so precious it was, and
peerless; and to each of her damsels, she meant to present an Indian
cricket, who wakens men without a clock, at what hour soever they please:
wherefore upon this worthy fantasy, that devise you see was copounded, which
is the image of a monstrous Medusa, with a motto, Extrema peto; because
doubtless her follies be monstrous and extreme. After her follows such
another drivel, that of all the pains she takes, she gains nothing but
nichilles, and her name is Calidonia da Heppi, who never stands still, or is
at quiet, and sometimes she ticketh with one, and then tacketh with another; and
after the sport is ended, she returns home, either with her face all to be
scratch, her hair shagged abroad, or her mouth all to be grumbled, for these
be the recreations which she ordinarily uses after meals: therefore by her
devise which is a Pluckt-hen with this motto, Quid nostra prosunt? a man may
straight conceive, wherein her error consists. And that other somewhat
beneath her, called Cecilia Venusia, is a notable buxom, and well pampered
Fool, who is continually conversant in her riggery, neither can a man behold
afiner madge-howlet then her self, so that she is never without a company of
women about her, who without her comfort, would certainly be even dead, and
half lost. This woman by her monckeries, singing of riffe raffe rimes and
country gigs, recounting a thousand merry tales, far more pleasant, then
those of Strapanarola, and by prating more incessantly then a Parrot, she hath
brought in amongst them an other Lubberlande, to pass over all melancholic
and displeasing humours: wherefore you see, that her imprese is a tavern bush
on the top of a spear, with this motto; Vndiquerisus; because it seems
that this devise and motto cannot fitlier concur with any then her self.
There follows after her Armodia Falisca, being an unbridled fool like a
horse, licentious and dissolute in all her actions, in her words impudent and
lavish, and with insolent liberty she rails on every body, as she did the
other day; for seeing a great troupe of gentelwomen return from the feast of
some saint, she found fault even with this, that one of them had a needle
sticking on her head cawle, in nothing so comely a sort as was requisite: And
therefore her advise is an horsestraine, with a motto expressing thus much; Nil
satiu^; she being very well known for so viperous a fool, as in truth she is.
That last Cell saving one, belongs to Laurentia Giglia, in all her affairs
being an obstinate fool like a mule; and from this, her obstinacy comes
evidently to be discerned; for not long sithence being rebuked by some of her
friends for talking at a window with I know notwho, departing presently, she as
suddenly returned, and once again put in mind of it by them, she withdrew
herself a little, and afterwards showed herself there a fresh; neither could
the wind which came with a great hail of stones as as big as an egg, so
much as make her bouge from that place, she being disposed to win the field,
and have the conquest of heaven and earth. And therefore in all reason, she
hath an anvil with an hammer striking upon it, set up for her imprese, with
this motto, Nec ictibus: which clearly manifests the extreme wilfulnes she
is possessed withal. But she who strikes it up, carries the game away, and
makes up the feast as it should be, is Hostilia Mutinense, either the sister
of Merline, or daughter of Calcabrine, a woman inspiritate, diabolical, and
stuffed up even to the very gorge with all kind of flagition and villainy.
This devilish Fool is so monstrous and malignant, as there is no devise in the
world that can sufficiently express her perverse, wicked, and abominable
nature. Therefore amongst all the rest, she only is left without imprese or
devise; for neither Gabrina for despite, Circes for diabolical malice, nor any
other prodigious monster so much by the ancients celebrated, can worthily
enough represent her strange and enormious properties. So that honourable
beholders I conclude thus much, that it were much better for you never to come
near her Cell: for if she do but perceive your being here about, make account
that like another Alcina, she will turn you all into beasts, trees, or stones;
and instead of entering into an Hospiof Fools, you shall find your selves in
that palace, where cursed destiny transforms men into Asses, and this is all
you might gain by the sight of her. Let us therefore now put to the gates of
this Hospital, and roaue abroad at large, for that which already you have
seen, is more then enough.

FINIS.
