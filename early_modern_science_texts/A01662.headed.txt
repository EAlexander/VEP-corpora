Iohn Day to the Christian Reader.
Considering with myself (loving Reader) many and sundry times, how yt
nothing is so desired, so acceptable, or so necessary in the time of
dangerous infirmities, and pearel of bodily health, as to preserve those yt are
free of sickness fro the violence of the same, and to restore the sick, weak,
and languishing patient unto his former estate and pristinate health, which
thing is performed by the noble and excellent knowledge of Physic: and
again, howe that this Art is exercised, yea of famous and learned men, which
with out any great profit to the patient, or worship to ye minister, because
their medicines are negligently prepared: I thought it my part, by this my
travail and expenses, somewhat to serve herein thy necessity. Wherefore, I have
caused this precious treasure to be translated into our usual, and native
language, that like as all men are subject to sickness: so in likewise all men
may by this occasion learn the way unto health. And because thauthor (whose
name I spare to manifest, for fear of inuious detracters) do in many places of
this his work, send the Reader unto Philippe Vlstadius Brunsvvick: therefore I
will with expedition (if this my labours shall be thankfullye accepted,) also
publish them, sparing neither labour, diligence, or charges for to bring
them both to their perfection, and also thy necessary use. As touching the
excellency of the preparing medicines, the utility springing thereof, and
the argument of the work, because it is exactlye set out by the author in
the preface following, I will leave to trouble the further herein. Fare most
heartily well in Christ. At London the.ii. of May. 1559.

The preface of the author to the Reader.
i Of the invention of liquors and oils destilled. ii Of the scope and end of
this book. Whereof more also shall be spoken about the end of the Preface. iii
The praise of them that can be content to make common the best and most
effectuous medicines they have. iiii How much the dressing and manner of
preparans avails in every thing.
THe Art of destillatio (which they call Chymia, Alchimia, Alkimia, Chemia
Suidas calls it, and Alchemia) hath invented many profitable things for mas
life, and in Physic also certain marvelous things, and praise worthy, if a
man prepare them right and diligently. For the lack of knowledge,
Covetousness or negligence of Physicians and commun Apothecaries is the cause
why many such preparations are set little by: and worthily, if you respect that
which they prepare: unworthily, if ye mark the Art it self, which certes is
most excellent and most profitable: which seems to be the cause why it lay hid
so long, and began to come in ur very late. Some ascribe unto Hierom of
Brunsvvick, which about.lxx. years past practised Physic at Argentyn, the
original of getting out waters, as they cal them, and liquors and oils out of
simple medicines by the strength of fire: but they are much deceived, for this
Art was not invented by him, but written in our Dutch tongue and first set out by
him. In mine opinion this invention is so aucient as the invention of the very
Chymia, which I suppose was celebrated first and put in writing by men that
used the Punicall or else the Arabic tongue, a little after the age of the
Grecian Phisicions, Of those I speak that writ almooste the latest, as Aetius,
Oribasius, Actuarius, Psellus. In certain libraries in Italy even at this day,
are there extant certain wrytinges of Chymia by certain late Grecians, namely a
certain Philosopher called Stephan: al so a book entitled of the changing of
metals, which comunlye are called Chymia, or Arcymia. There is also a book to
be had of Alchymia made by Auicenna unto Assis a Philosopher. Geber (the Nepheu
of I canne not tell what great Mahomet) who is celebrated as a captain and
prince of this science, what age he lived in I can not easily say. Although I
judge him not to have been the first in uentor of this Art, but one that
brought it to light and renowned it. This man in his work entitled Summae
perfectionis, discoursing excellently and disputing many things of
destillacion generally, writes that diverse manners of destilling are known
almost of all men, even as an ancient inuencio, yea in his time also, no new
thing. Certain late wryters declare the wrytinges of Alchymia not only of
Albertus Magnus, S. Thomas, Rhaza, and Auicenna, Arabic Physicians, but also of
Aristotle, Plato and Salomon, at the least wise mention to be made by the of
it: to whom I give small credence, not that I think this study to be the
newer, but certes that it was ether unknown to these philosophers or mentioned
in no place. Some there be that expound feetly and wittily al the feinings of
the Poets, and chieflye that of the golden fleece, sought by the Argonautae,
unto the multiplying of Gold or Art of enterchaunging of metalles. Some also
ascend higher, and make the first men by and by after the beginnidg of the
world, authors thereof. Some simplely make it most ancient, and affirm that no
certainty is to be had of the first inueters. At Padvvay in Italy in our time
was found a most ancient monument, namely an erthen pot, having written upon
it this Hexasticon.

Plutoni sacrum munus no attingite fures,
Ignotum est vobis hoc quod in vrna latet.
Nanque elementa graui clausit digesta labore,
Vase sub hoc modico, Maximus Olibius:
Adsit foecundo custos sibi copia cornu,
No praetium tanti depereat laticis.
This sacred to God Pluto (thieves) ware that ye touch not,
Unknown is it to you all, this that is hid in a pot.
For the elements hath ishut up digested with much pain,
In this small vessel the great Olibius certain.
Plenty with thy fruteful horn as a guard be thou present,
Least the price pearish of this liquor most excellent.
Within this pot was an other little pot with the inscription of these verses.

Abite hinc pessimi fures
Vos quid voltis cum vostris oculis emissitiis?
Abite hic vostro cu Mercurio petasato caduceato{que}
Maximus maximo donum Plotoni hoc sacru facit
Away fro hence ye mighty thieves, trudge else where go by,
What seek ye with your spying eyes, why do ye por pry
Hens with your hatted Mercury, and with his rod also.
This gift is sacred by the greatst unto the greatest Ploto.
Again, within this little pot was found a light yet burning between two
Phials, the one of Gould, the other of Silver, full of a certain most pure
liquor, by the virtue whereof they believe that this light had burnt many a
year, as did noote in their collections and gatherings of old ancient
inscriptios or Poesies Petrus Appianus and Bartholom eus Amantius Hermolaus
Barbarus also in his Corollarium or addition upon Dioscorides made mention of
this same thing, whereas he entreats of waters in comun. There is also (saith
he) a heavenly water, or rather divine of the Chymistes, which boothe
Democritus and Mercury Trimegistus knew: calling it sometimes a divine water,
sometimes a Seythicall liquor, sometimes pneuma, that is, spirit of the nature of
the firmament, and of y^ fifth essens or substance of things: whereof potable
gold, and that philosophers stone much spoken of, but not yet fond, consists.
Hereupon also is the name given unto the art calling it Psammurgicall, and
mystical, and Annophysiall and holy, and greatest: as though it had certain
secret letters, and such as it should be convenient to keep and restrein the
profane commun people from. This kind of liquor, as I suppose, doth the
Epigram signify of late found within the field of Padua nie unto the village
called Atesta, made upon earthen or brick mettle, and therefore frail, and
broken unawares by the hands of a man of the country digging the ground in the
same place. The remembrance whereof least it should pearish we have added
hereunto the very words. This holy gift to the God, c. as before. Therefore it
appears that the study of this Art was of most antiquity amongst the
Barbarus nations, but derived unto the Romains and Greeks somewhat late, nether
before perauenture that the Romains obtained the dominion of a great part of
the world: or if sooner yet covertly retained amongst a very few. Cicendulae
y^ shine in the night (saith Cardane) teach us that a liquor may be made that
may shine in the dark. It is made certes by the putrefying of those things that
have most erceding brightness, light perspicuity. I dout not but it is possible
to be made, whereof and how, I am uncertain. But these things are almost besides
our matter, saving that it might seem utterly that the way to sublimate
destil, as they term it, hath had his original of the Chimists, continued also
always with their art: was opened unto the me of our part of the world the
first, when as ye world being made known bithimpery of the Romains, sundry kinds
of spices also diners medicines unknown before to the men of Europe, to the
Greeks Latins also, began to be brought in: and afterward also more, what time
as the Mauritans me learned in the Arabic tongue doctrine, possessed a great part
of Spain, whereby certain books of learned me cam unto us: amongst the latter
sort, as I think, the works of one Bulcasis Benaberazeris who in the place where
he intreteth of the preparation of medicines, teaches also of many things to be
sublimated destilled. About the age of the same ma almost, I think Iohannes
Mesue was famous, who we read to have lived about ye year of our Lord. 1158.
But be mecioneth none other destild waters the of Roses Wormwod. Me say
Auicenna flourished the year of our Lord. 1149* who also speaks of Rose water
destild. The vsa of metalli things sublimated is far more ancient, at the
least wise touching the tradition or tretises of authors, like wise is the use
of oils that are made by descension or downward as in Rasis Aetius. A certain
ma (whose name I spare to rehers,) writ of late that these manner of destilled
liquors were not unknown to the latter Greek writers, using this argument, that
destilled liquors are sometimes named in the writings works of Actuarius, And
in dede he names in so places Rhodostagma, as in his Iulep against ye cogh: a
little following in an other Iulep intybostagma. But with these words is signified
nothing else the a simple syrup of Roses or Endiue. Rhodostactum doth Agenita
describe in his. 7. book, yt. 15. cha. with these words. Sis.ii. sextars of
the juice of Roses yt nails whereof are take away, one sertar of honey skimming
it till the.iiii. part be consumed. Ye a little before also he describes
Hydrorosatu rosed water, that also far differing fro a destiled liquor, or
water destild for it consists of.iiii. pounds of Roses the nailes take
away.v. sextaries of water: ii. sextaries of honey. The Arabians also or their
expositors, when they speak of the water of any plant, they understand the
decoctio of it in water: and likewise Nicolas Myrepsus that writ in Greek of
the compositions of medicines, whom it appears to be a very late writer, by
the barbarous words that he uses very oft: wherein I marvel this, that no
metion is made by him of waters or oils prepared in Chymistical instruments.
Only the oil Capnistum or smoked, that is destilled by descention, doth he
describe, as Aetius also. Moreover, the things that the Chimistes make may I
comprehend in.ii. kinds for the most part, that they be ether liquors or
Massy things, the liquors again are ether watery or oily: and these ether
aerie or fiery. The Massy things, are ether such as rest in the bottom: or such
as are carried upward: and that.ii. ways, ether as pure bodies and substauces,
as they which they cal sublimated, quick silver. c. or Sout for the remedies of
the eyes with Phisicions. There be also other artificial manner of preparings,
wherewith the purest and most effectual part in medicines is drawn out, and as
it were the form is separated from the matter.

And although I am not greatly travailed nether in the Chymistical nor in the
other manner of preparings, but by the way have got the kuowledge of certain
things, partly by mine own experience in some things, partly of myfrends: yet
what so ever and how much so ever this is, I will communicate it with the
studions of Physic: not as though I entend to teach perfectly and absolutely
the very Art of destilling and preparing of other things, but as it were
writing unto such as now already are not all void and without knowledge of
these things, having ether experimented them selves or red other men's wrytings.
For I have nothing so exrellet or secrete, but I covet it might ge abroad to
the publik and common profit, and although in small wealth, yet have I ben ever
of nature ready to communicate and make any man privy of any cunning I had,
which some refer unto simplicity or childishnes, other some better to the
liberality of my disposition. There be some that do utterly cloak and keep
secrete their things, and that diverse kind of men: some for Ambition, that
they may have wherewith to excel and pas other men: some also for
covetousness, to get gain thereby: other thorough the ignorance of the
ancient wryters, as though there were not put in wrytinge ether the same or
far better by men of antiquity, which now are despised of many, and a foolish
and vnsaciable lust is there always to find out new things. There wants not such
as think, great and effectual medicines should be kept secrete for this cause,
least vncunning men, as many practicioners be, without al reason almost, and al
learning, might abuse them, and convert those things which are invented for
the health of me, to their destruction. To such wold I answer, As no kind of
evil ought to be committed for this intent that any good thing might follow
thereof: so that which is good ought not to be left undone, least some evil
might ensue, for the world shall never be without them that will abuse good
things and profitable inuencions. But good men, simplely such good things as
they have, they make them common, and will not stick nor cese to do so because
they fear, that certain lewd persons may do hurt thereby. But I will leave of
this disputation, thy do I protest sincerely as I think withal my hart, that
I covet by my example to stur up learned and good Physions, that laying apart
al Ambition, Covetousness, Ignorance, Envy, if they can bring any excellent
thing unto our profession, that they wold do it gently and publicly. As for
the unlearned certes, they in ministering not only these great and effectual
medicines, of which sort we shall put diverse in wrytinge hear, but meates
also and most common drinks, out of time, do hasard and bring men's lives
many times to diseases and death: and it is well known that Hippocrates writ
how our Ptisan ministered not in due time, was the cause of death to a certain
man sick of the Pleurisy. These therefore ought to be left partly to their
ignorance, partly to their lewd malapartnes. But they that have need of the
Physician are to be admonished to do that in Physic, that all men are wont to
do in al other Arts: that is, to choose good Physicians, and learned, and such
as exercise and practise this Art by their profession, both with reasos, as a
part of Philosophy and also in the very actions and doings of cures. But I
return to the purpose. The preparing therefore (as I say) is of the greatest
moment and weight in every matter. In Rhetorik vtterans, gesture, and
pronunciation more almost move the minds of the hearers, then the very
argument that is handled. Hereupo it comes that things put in meter and in
numbers, do delight so greatly: which if a man utter in proofs, they shall be taken
for cold, dnl and solishe. Hereof comes it that one being asked the question
what was the chiefest thing in an orator, answered pronunciation: what was the
next and the third: the same. Shows and plays, that they delight the hearers
and beholders so greatly, it is much more long of the form and manner of their
forniture and preparance then of the matter played or showed. In like manner in
the very things and works, the form, the fashion, figure, manner, as well of
nature as of Art, finally a certain preparation is more marked and commended
then the matter. Likewise in physsk, the conninge to prepare things aright,
and the descression to minister them aptly, have the greatest moment and skill
most. Nether is it of greater force what thou ministrest, then in what manner.
And although there be many circircumstances to be considered, that thou may
exhibit the medicin aright, yet the manner, and the preparing is with in the
medicine, and is at it were the form thereof and part the other circumstances
are without it, as time, place, and such things as are to be considred about
the sickman. But letting pas other ways of dressing and preparing at this
preset, we will onli touch those, bi the which al the virtue and faculti or
operation is separated from the substance of the medicines, so that ye more
liquid and moist, the more pure and subtle part of every remedy or medicin,
may be bad severed and drawn out from the gross and erthy part: whether it be
gathered into a liquor drawn out of the sam remedy or medicin or into an other
certain ertarnall. c. which the barbarous writer Arnold calls Eruirtuare to
outuerteuat, or Excorporare, to outcorporate. Furthermore, if sumthings shall
seem to be written somewhat curiously or double diligently, ye must consider
that suthe pertain not to the Physicians of the common people and pore fooke,
but to such as abound more with riches and ease, have plenty of servants, or
such as remain in Princes or Kings courts: or also to Philosophers, that
busilye search out the marvelous mutation and virtues of natural things, and
in them delight them selves. To conclude, let no man marvel that so great and
lunge commendacions and praises are added to certain medicines, as unto the
Quintessences as they call them, to Aqua vities, made ba^mes, and that unto
some marvelous virtues are attributed, as to sharpen the wit and memory, to
coserue the senses and youth. c. When as even by the ancient Greeks Latins
also we read such effects and operacions to be ascribed to Triacle and other
preseruatiues and compositions, specially by the Arabians unto diverse things,
yea even of Galen also unto Triacle. There be some that I will not avow, and whose
credit I leave to the authors, whose names I write every where. But it is said
before already, that we wryt all these things for the learned and discreate
men, which for the most part shall judge more easily how much credit is to be
given to every thing. Although in very many it is not sufficient to be
furnished with learning and judgment, except experience and practise be
joined also therewith. But I make an end hear of my Preface.

What Destillation is, and of diverse forms and kinds.
DESTILLATION not distillatio (as learned Siluius. Destillation by ascentio or
going upward, is when the vapours or fume is carried up and be there gathered
together into water so drop down: The same author. Moist things put into a
body (for so do they cal the bigger Siluius. Certain like things natur hath
wrought, both in exhalatios above in the air, specially the the lower parts.
Therefore of a plant or any other substance ordained to be destilled: what part
of it is most meet to be extenuated and fynet (that is the purest part, the
lightest, the thinnest, the moistest, and the most superficial part next unto
the uttermost parts of the body) being first of all fined by the force of
heet, is lifted up: next such other parts as in puernes cum nie to the first
and last such a moisture of the things as is more gross that held together
the earthly parts, a certain (Plinie, I think, writes of the wode that is
called Smilax, how it willet sype through water mixed with wine, and it true)
but this is no destillation in deed, except unto such as speak improprely.
For that which is proprely called destilation is done by heet: and that from
the son, or of fire, corruption and rot tennes: By the son, as certain men
have inueted, to draw of flowers a kind of water, very ne'er to them selves in
smell and other pleasant qualities. By fire, that is, by flame that come of
aere and of aereall bodies: or else by burning cools, that are made of earth or
earthly bodies kindled,

Morouer the flame it self, as well as the cool, is diverse, not only in
respect of that it is great and little, but also of the wood whether it be
rotten and doted, or sound, stinking, or well smelling: grene or dry. Besides
this it is a great matter what bigness the furnace be of, what fashion, Syluius.
ascend up in their order: the lightest, subtilst, and hoatest first, that is,
the fire: secondarily the air: thirdly water: the earth remains in y^
bottom: and likewise I judge in the destillation of vinegar.

The nature of fire is to deminishe (as Cardane Balneum Mariae. The best kind
of destillation next unto this, is in horse dong. Then by ashes: the best in
this kind, is by the superfluous refuse of olives, after the oil is pressed
forth, for it being a hot moist matter, will reteyne his heat very long, yea a
great meany of months: and so much the lodger then the kurnels of grapes,
because the substance of the olives is thicker fatter. But none

The heat of the first degree, which is moderate, as of horse dong, and Balneum
Mariae, is called the heat of digestion, resolution, putrefaction, maceration,
and of circulation, whereof we shall

within in Rose water, out of Bulcasis.

Of destillation generally G^ber an Arabian, writ certain things in. 1. 4. 50.
chapter of his book callid Summa perfectionis. Where he reasons excellently
of many things chiefly of the difference and diverse affects of destillation
by water and by ashes. In the same book. 39. chap. he teaches of sublimatio,

Such herbs flowers and other plants and growing things, as are to be
destilled, ought to be gathered when they are perfectly ripe, chiefly while the
moan encreasith: when the whether is fair, and in the day time to be laid in

Of the virtues of licores destilled generally.
MAnarde in his Epistles. 15. book 15. chapter, saith thus: when I perceived
in the commun waters that are destilled out of plants by fire, nether the smell
nor the taste remain, but many times the contrary (for the water of wormwode I
perceived to be chymici, by what devise both the smell and the taste might be
preserved in this waters, that is found in the whole herb. It were lunge to
write all the ways, which I proved to find out this things: yet

Syluius. Waters destilled, reteyne and kiepe still the virtues of the simples
wheroute they be drawn: saving that they are more pure strong, the oftener
they be destilled, which we prove in the water of wine, for the most part,
very seldom in other things.

The virtues of licore destilled, some do alter with some matter, as honey,
Ladanum and such like, or else by putting it in ye nose of the still, which
serves for the most part, to the grace of the smell: for they bind musk,
cloves, Caphura and such like

A doubt. If so be it yt fire makes al things hot and dry: all waters
gotten by destillation, ought to be hot and dry. Nether doth the watery
substance disprove this, for when as brenning water is such, it doth both bren
and mightily make hot and dry men's bodies. Again, al waters be cold and
moyste, as long as the substance hath the upper hand. But nether of this is
always true: yea, some of this are more like unto

Therefore men be wont to axe whether these waters reteyne and kiep their own
propre virtues and strength. We once said, while we entreated of the evil
manner of curing, that they are no strengthes nor virtues, because they are
destitute of savour and taste. For water of wormwode, nether smells like
wormwode, nor is bitter yea that is more wonder, it is somewhat swiete. Yet
burning water (to speak nothing of Rose water) well declares that there is a
certain virtue and efficacy in waters. For if you will say it is such
because of fire: how comes it to pas that none Cardan.

But me thinks this things would be more diligently considered and weighed.
First, where he true, if a man destill it negligently as the comun apothecaries
are wont, in leaden limbeckes. but destill it in Balneo Mariae, and see whether
it shall lack his smell and taste, or no. Yea, it shall retain boeth, and that
effectuously, not only this herb, but also any other plant whatsoever it be,
having any savour or taste: if it be dried and weikte or stiept in wine a few
days, then destilled in Balneo Mariae or by ashes gentely, as I shall show
further within. Now when certain things have Theophrastus writes, do retain
their savour very long: other sum be unlike to their plants. for such waters
as have their virtue and force in the uttermost and superficial parts, they
fume or else more nie to the midest or utter part of the same. I am surely of
that mind with Raimunde Lullus, that water of the same quality may be gotten
out of any plant whatsoever it be, of cold plants, cold water: of hot,
hot: of dry, dry: of moist, moyste. But I will not grant that the same
virtue remains, except like savour, or like taste or both, (as in smelling
things (be left.

The cause why the smell of certain flowers as of Iasmin, of the flowers of
cloves, remains not Cardane, where as we entreat of Balneu Mariae generally.

It were good if every water once destilled, were powered again, yea or the
third time upon his own dreggees beaten, and to be suffered to putrify two or
three dais, and so to be destilled again: or rather, not upon his own dregs
that remain, but upon other like herbs of the same kind, and to putrefy in a
circulatory or a blind limbeck, and to be destilled: Brunsvvick

I saw once an alchemist, that destilled not the very herbs renewing certain
times the destillatio, and powering again ye water upon ye dregs groude upon
a marble moler: Gnaynerius.

Oats (whereof drink may be made as Ale or Bear of barley) do warm make drunk
no less then wine. Men say that in Tartaria, water of milk destilled makes
men drunk. But every water, not an element (that is alone without any mixture)
but liquor or juice mixed and compounded, being oft destilled may do the same:
for it Cardane.

Also a liquor or other thing be destilled, the thicker it is, the more it
seems to conceive heate and fire, if it be oft destilled.

It is manifest (saith Cardane) that a water may be made which shall
incotenent break the stone in the bladdar, if it be put in by a squirt or
syring. Tecolittius, or of the stones of crabes. for so may a water be made, to
break also the red marble. Moreover, that it shall not hurt the bladder, is
brought thus to pas, if the mattier out of which the water is taken be void of
any salt kind of thing, or alum, or coperoos, or of wine lies, but some of them
that we mecioned erewhyle. But there is nied of diligent trial, in cofirming a
subtle means, that such things which we have searched out so subtly, being
surely confirmed first by experience and proof, we may then deduce and bring
them to the commodity of man.

In dede I know that pigeos donge and paritary ether the one or tother,
destilled by this means, is able too break the hardest stoone that ever
Cardane. Perauenture also Chrysocolla would help unto this art, being
artificiusly made, and without sharpnes, such as is also praised of the
goldsmiths: wherefore to make Borace sum use rain water destilled, and milk
destilled, sum also honey marow: c. I hard of late, a certain practicer cured
the stone Borace mixed with burning water, to the thickness almost of honey,
mingling also Tartar, punned, or a stone cut out of a man or the grounds of
peace out of a pispot. He commanded that a man shall use this medicine by the
space of fourtene days, so that he should always mixed some with his wine when
he drunk, yea both at diner and supper. I remember I have red of certain
liquores, in which if a man put a stone or flint, it should be resolved. The
Chymistes and destillers use destilled vinegar, and

They dissolve with strong vinegar, chiefly destilled, or with the juice of
limons, perles, egg shells, stones of the reins, of the bladder, both the
corals, and they afterward dried, are quickly readily cromed betwixt ones
fingers. Siluius.

I can not let pas here to speak of the water of Epiphanius the practicionar,
which is such. Re. Antalis et dentalis, boracis, sarcocollae whyt coral, white
crystal, clay, anessede, rys, meel of orob{us} trochiscos (little roules or
balls) with water of beans made with musk. The use of it is for women to
make their faces whyt and fair, but the face must be perfumed before with
water of a decoction of barley oats: then let one baul be steeped and consumed in
bean water, and anoint the face before you goo to bed, but in the morning wash
it away with water of a decoctio of beans and bran: and again with coold
water. If the more beautify the face: for limones roasted and anointed upon the
face, they alone do beautify y^ face. If a man drink this water fasting and
anoint the place of his privities where hear grows therewith, it breketh the
stone: which is prouid by this, that if a man lay Porcellanas in it the space
of a night, the next day he shall order them with his fingers like warmed wax
(Porcellanas men call certain shells, and also precious earthen vessels.) I
have used the mo words in this, to give

Of the manifold use of lyquors destilled, both in physic, otherwise.
I Do perciue a manifold use of destilled waters, but chiefly and most of all
for physicians, which use such stilled chymistically dressed and prepared, with
oyntmentes, ether that they may have the better savour, or else to make them
hoater, and that they may pierce the sooner, they put moist linen clothes in
this voaters to cool and refresh the parts of the body, parts about the
arms, hot fury swellinges. Surgeons use such waters as dry mightily, to
wash wounds withal. But the most common use, of lunge time hath been in
mixture of syrups to be drunk, and to zulapia or iulebs, chiefly of roses
violets. There be that make diverse kinds of liquors and oils alonly for the
good savour. Glasiars also that paint glass in baking in their colours, they
do use burning waters. Goldsmiths use aqua fortis (as they call it) which
signifies a Raymund Lullus writes of y^ marvelous use and commodity of
burning water even in wars, a little before the joining of battle, to styre
and encourage destillation is necessary. Sweet water may be separated from the
salt, in a great caudron with a great and hie keuer having a beacke or nose.

A way to purge and make clean troubled waters, out of Bulcasis.

of hot
Hot water or else ye vapour of the same, send les strength into the thing that
is to be destilled, then other fire alone or else such other dry means as are
mecioned before. for yt cause as Galen saith Diploma, that is, a double vessel
(the Apothecaries as the men that still lyquors also, cal it Balneum Mariae)
melts, heats, seatheth those things whose strengthes the violence of fire
will not disperse nor separate: so, such things as be tender and gentle,



You must have a fornace A of this sor, upon the which you shall set a great
brazen vessel B full of water, C in a circle as many as it will receive, in the
botome, of the which vessels the things that you will destill, must be put.
Other build ye fornace A otherwise as though it were a vessels: B in their
broad bottoms stading inward, they contain the things that they will destill
the mouth without as though it were a bottle being covered, C in the which ye
vapour carried up by his open belly gathered together, and by the long mouth of
the same drops down. Syluius.



But why remains not the smell of certain flowers in the waters but in
Iasmin, Cariophillum, and le^is, the water comes forth wtoute savour? the
reason is declared otherwher: because yt unto so sclender and thin
substance, no substancial and thick part is joined. There Cardan. It appears
without doubt that those flowers should be destilled in Balneo Mariae, or in
vessels of glass

Balneum Mariae may be handsomely made hoate with a great pipe of copper A set in
the midst, in the bottom whereof is a grate for ye B ashes to avoid at: men
call it communly a stowe harry. Vlstadius names it a furnace of sloth. Upon
that pipe, do they make a cover of copper G with a small pipe coming out a
shore, to cary and convey the smoke out at a window or some hoale. (So do they
also make warm house flors now a days to bathe in.) The commodity of this
pipe D is then E, a ten or twelve at once, to spare time, labour and cost.



Some use brazen cupping boxes to still withal in the Balneo Mariae, glassen
limbeckes, whose noses if they be to short or broken, they join other

The herbs yt be to be destilled in a bathe or otherwise, some do pun them,
and let the remain so a while, (perauenture for certain days) before they
still them, thinking to have more plenty of water in a hot place, it were well:
but the most apothecaries and other, that sieke most for lucre gain thereby,
leave it in cold places in open confers, till the herbs lose their smell, and
be corrupted with a moist and gros air.

Some there be that put some sand also in the water of Balneum Mariae, to
the intent the heat my be the greater and more vehement: as Mathaeol{us} of Sena
in ye water that is called aqua philosophica against the frensh pocks. And he
affirms that

The water of Balneum Mariae ought to be no hoater, then that a man may suffer
his finger in it: Brunsuicensis.

Vlstadius prescribes the destillation of a certain kind of aqua vitae in
Balneo Mariae, to be done with so slow a fire, that a man may tell one, two,
three, until seven, before a drop fall.

Of such things as pertain to the commun wai of Balneum Mariae, you shall read
more with in where we make mention of aqua Camphorae out of Bulcasis, and of
Rose water out of the same.

This way of destillation in Balneo Mariae, is used also to the rectifying (as
they term it) of oils, to draw and purge the fleam from them, for only the
waters and nothing else may be lifted up and drawn out by the heat of the bath,
the oil remaining still in the bottom.

When as I perceived that waters, as they are accustomed commonly to be
destilled out of plats, they kiep nether their taste nor the same smell: I
began carefully to think upon the matter and to try many ways, yt I might
find a means how to preserve and kiep in the waters the same qualities. It
should be log to rehearse al the ways yt I proved. Onli one will I touch, which
seemed to me to be the best and ye easyest. That is this, to work on this wise
in a double vessel, after the manner that Galen would all oyntmentes to he
made, of that vessel A wherein the herb is contained B, do not touch the water
C that boils in the bigger D, but that it wax hot with nothing else then the
fuming moisture lifted up from the same. Manardus. Albeit things destilled in
this wise, although they of the plants (as the former smell, yet for as much as
they be corruptuous, they can not be long kept: Syluius.

The chief use of dong, or as some term it, a horse belly, is such: that the
matter which is to be destilled in a glasen vessel set in the dong may be
prepared by the heat thereof, as we shall declare more at large in his place,
where we shall make mentio of putrifactio and rotting. It is possible
notwithstanding for destillation to be brought to pas in y^ Brunsvvick
supposes to exceed in the middle degree, the heat of Balneum Mariae.

If you desire to have a water destilled of the flesh of any beast, you shall
strangle the beast, yt it bleed not in any wise, then take away al the fat
Brunsvvick.

The parts of beast or excrements, as blud, the liver, the lights, eggs, gall,
and ox dong, ought to be destilled in horse dong, with vessels not very close
stopped (but honey and milk a man may stop the close) least the water stink. But
if it chance to in Balneo Mariae, specially the water of excre mets of oxen
whose first destillatio is scarce found without stench: Brunsvvick. It wold
frame better if a man put to a little curtsy of salt in the putrefying or
destilling of dong, that they may corrupt the less.

Cheri water of what kind soever they be, is drunk against to much heate, is
ministered with out ye body: but particularly of sweet black cherries, which
also is commended of many against the palsy, if it be poured into the mouth:
and the mouth be well washed therewith, that it restores the use of the tongue
lost. They destill the flesh of it alone, or the kernels also beaten together,
that ye liquor destilled thereof may entye out the stony matter of the reins
and bladdar. The black and sower are called Visula, they yield agues which
couleth and confirms the strengthes: it is profitable also against thirst and
bluddye flixe: Ryffius. The water destilled of the swiete black and fresh
Cherries, is marvelously commended of Remaclus F. of Lymburg: As soon (saith he)
as it shall be powered into the mouth of one sick of the falling evil already
taken with ye fit (the potion of it is.iiii. drammes or moor) by by he revives
refreshed, neither is he any moor drawn together with any cramp, till in the

Camphora: water thereof or oyll is thus made. Take one of the vessels for Rose
water, that is called baten (that is a belly) fill it with the sticks or cips of
pynappull tree which hath great and brood leaves, and let it be filled.
Siluius takes it so as though the roose water should be poured to the chips of
the pynappull tree, but me thinks yt cucurbita or belly, that it may be a
certain repetition of the same which he had spoken before, and let it be
covered with a vessel having a nose: then put the belly into a brazen vessel
full of water over the fire, till it begin to boil: for an oyll shall destill
(and yet they deny that oyll may be lifted up by the heat of water) subtle of
a good odour, which is called water of Camphora. Or if ye list destill it
destilled. Bulcasis. But Belluensis saith that water of Camphora according to
the Arabians (saith he) is a water that runs out of the tree that brings
the Camphora: which as his tree also is of a hoot nature in third degree: so
Camphora it self is cold: Monachi in Mesuae. Put three little bies in the vessel
of glass where the Camphora is, which shall so be turned into water.

Fragaria.


SStraweberies shalt y^ putrify in a Vessel of bras (peraueture salt may be

or wheals by the struck of a ston with heet, which the only washing of this

nether skills it if they be black, so yt they be not rotten: yet the black
are counted the best. A moderate potion if it invade a man with heet) letting

experiment. It is praised also for ye noise in the ears and the difficulty of
heering, for the diseases in the throat called angine being gargild. A water

Rosa,


ROos water seems to be first invented: for I find mention of it in Auicen
the.ii. book, in the chapter of rooses: Roosewater drounke (saith he) is good
in a Geleniabin, and helps to digest. And the roos and his juice are good
for a stomach to mich hoot. And although the Arabias for the most part are wont
to say water for juice or Mesue in the chapter of Rooses. And again, The Roos
and his oil and water sublimated comfort the hart. c. The same speeketh of
rooswater destilled, in the.vi. destinction, whereas he describes the iuleb of
roses, as the Munkes his interpreters do prove: of whom also this was and nomo
mentioned in Mesue, that is of rooses and wormwod. They make no epithe or
outward medicine at this day, but they put roosewater in it. In sharp vehement
and greet inflammations, to strengthen the principal members, it may be
commodiously used. It is good for the flixe of the bowels and vomiting. It
helps the inflammation of the eyes very much in the beginning. Sum are wot to
mixed with it a little thucia and sugercady. It strengthens the eyes and
sharpens the Remaclus F. Of wine mixed with roswater in time of meet, see in
Arnold in his book of wine.

Rooswater although it be made diverse ways yet the best is made by Balneum
Mariae: Matthaeolus. If thoos rooses which we call commonly carnacion, dried
and moystened with the vapoure Syluius. They may be holden in a linen cloth
over hot water, till they have drunk enough of the vapoure.

Of Roose water out of Bulcasis.


THe making of Roosewater is known in most coutires. It is better made with
water then without: better also by fire of cools then of Aharach. A. Thou
shalt make therefore in a large house by a wall a little berchile B so doth he
cal the vessel that is filled with water the bottom and sides shall be of leede,
so well closed, that it leek not in any place. Then make meet a and make two
or three round hooles in it C C C moore or les, according to the largnesse of
the vessels, and as you desire to ether much or little water D, then make a
pot of bras like to the pot made in Balneo Mariae, which thou shalt set upon the
fornaice, so that the Berchile above the furnaice be lower in situation then
the pot, (so that it may conduit the heate of the fire of the Berchyle, to
the pot: but me thinks this words do ether redound or be depraved.)
Thou shalt also is finished, put away the first rooses, put in fresh: thus
saith Bulcasis. Some man would marvel, that in such a making of the fornace,
where the fire is not put under the duble vessel or berchile (as I conjecture,
seeing he makes the bottom and sides of lead) but at the side of the fornace,
wherefore he should think it to skill any thing, whether the fire put under
the pot be made of wood or cools. Moorouer it is known (saith Bulcasis in the
same place) that rosewater of wyld

There is a destilled water made of this with us a shorter way then that
before, is this wise.



A A brazen pot such as diers use, is set to a wall whereunto a cover B made
meet with hooles, wherein the be D it of the croppinges of vynes or such like.
But in process of the destillation thou shalt close the mouth of the furnace till
the hot destillation be finished. if thou burn cools, the water shall be the
swieter. (Here is more reason then in the former, because the fire here is made
immediately under the stillatory vessels.) The second way of destillacion with
out water with fire of coals is such.





MAke a square or round fornace A with a cover C made of glased earth, so that
they may abide the fire: And when the cools are kindled, the water begins
to destill shut the mouth of the fornace* and leave holes open for the smoke to
go out at. There is an other bridgemente of the third and fourth way.



A Brazen pot A full of water is set over a fornace, with a cover bored B through
C more or les. Put under fyr of the cropping of vines or cools till the water

THe water of Solanum or Morrella is good against all agewes if the sick the
day of his fit abstain from all meat and drink: and a cloth dipped in it

dried and grieved with an Hecticke fever. Against all these diseases it ought
to be drunk with the third part of wine. Lullus in his book of waters.

plants whereof there is any use in physic. But to reckon up also the virtues

Of vessels and diverse instruments belonging to destellation.
WHen men name a stillatory vessel, they understand the body of the still or
the Cucurbita, which the dutch men in their language, because of the fashion of
it, do cal clauam (ein kolben.) The body or gross vessel some cal the greater
vessel or Cucurbita wherein they put that which is to be destilled. Syluius for
this vessel compared to the limbeck or head, is Arabians name it, as Bulcasis
wytnesseth, Beten Batan, that is a belly. It appears also that Atanor in ye
same Bulcasis, where he prescribes the destillation of vinegar, signifies a
Cucurbita. (A furnaice, Athanor or a fixed instrument Geber describes in his
book of fornaces. The Cucurbita some barbarously do call bocciam a box. Of
the same ^igure and fashion the greater vessels are meet to digest and
putrify: thereupon when they must be destilled, the matter digested is
distributed into some les Cucurbit or boxes. The limbecke is taken, as I
suppose, both for the body and for the head, but moore properlye for the
head, as I said, is the upper vessel, that has a certain similitude of
the head, in respect of the nether, that is bigger and longar. The same vessel
(late authors call a bell and (ein helm) a salet or helmet. Tubus which comes
forth of the limbeck a length turning downward, is called a nose, a beak,
simple as it is a pipe: because the thorough the holownes thereof, the drops
gathered together in the limbeck, which all come together fold about the
lowest part of the limbecke, running forth do drop down into a vessel set
underneath, which commonly is called a receiver and a urinal. The nose and
beak are termed of y^ like figure, because this part stands out, after the
same manner that beaks do out of the noses of fouls, noses of.iiii. foted
beasts. The receiving vessel when as oils are destilled out of metals, as of
Vitriol or Corporoos, whereas there is need of a great fire, and continual,
must be very large: for

A blind limbek is that which hath no nose nor beak, nor limb or hembe which
serves for preparation and rectification or circulation, that is, perfection.
vitrial.

Such heads as be put upon bodies not standing upright, but as though they
were lying, they lack the limb folded skirt, and be like to commune earthen
Syluius.

I have sign also two heads one upon the other, that by the nether which was
bored through, part of the matter might be carried into the upper, which was
joined to the nether with nails, least y^ nether that is stopped with clay should

Some times the fashio of the head is like to a spyre ascending upward aloft,
sometime edged: sometime it waxes brood in the highest part of the head, that
it may receive the more of the vapours, Syluius.

Sublimation is taken of many simpely for destillation: other take it
particularly to lift up or cause to ascend up into the limbeck by the force of
fire, the matter that is to befixed in it: as many metally things are
sublimated.

Some join glass or earthen bottels together, which they call horned pypes,
the one whereof is set and cemented or clayed in the fire containing y^ things
to be destilled: the the other is a pretty way distant from Syluius. This
instruments are called commonly crooked: the frenchemen call them also horned.

This horned pipe is a musical instrument, which the Germans commonly call

The receiving vessel for the most part is a phiall of glass with is put, and
some times the belly thereof is set in a pot or some other holowe vessel that it
may stand the stedfaster in his place, or else for the commodity of the thing,
is set one way or other.

Vessels for circulation as they wherein the vapours ascend by course, and
again turned into liquor, desced go dounward as we shall declare within where we
shall make mentio of putrificatio Of al this the most excellent vessel is that
which is named Hermes vessel, because he was the inue bill: eve so this vessel
as though it were eared on both sides, hath pypes that beginning at ye head,
that is the upper part, descend in manner of a half a circle and are bowed
again and fastened as it were into the beginning of the Cucurbita with a blind
limbeck without a folded skirt or else a vessel of a hooll glass, that is
somewhat straiter in the midst, and out of the beginning of the belly it hath
looking out a short pipe, by the which liquor may be powered in and out. We
shall put the figures of both this within in the chapter of quintessence:
fornaces every where in this work.

The forms and fashions of vessels are diverse, and almost without number
commonly used with the chymistes and destillers, Syluius. Who so desires the
figures and names of diverse vessels, let him look in Brunsvvick. Ryffius

far from Basil and Solodourn. But the best

Of the vessel called aludel^s, look in Geber in his book of chief
perfection. 1. 4. 44. chapter, and again in his book of fornaces. Albertus
writes it a luttell, and expounds it a vessel appointed for sublimation:
likewise Bulcasis. The same wills arsnick to be sublimated in an earthen
dyshe glased, the fashion whereof he describes in Belluencis.

Of the matter for vessels of destillacion: and first against leaden and brazen
vessels.
WAters destilled in Balneo Mariae, do so far pas those that are made simply
by the tire in leaden limbeckes, as gold Balneo Mariae, with large chaplets,
limbeckes or heads, and somewhat great and of glass, do give the natural savour
and taste of the herbs flowers, wherout they be taken, without any noisome
smell of smoke or burning, which chances not al in the common leaden stills.
For the waters that are made in them, very few and seldom, specially whiles
they be new, are without notable lothsomnes of smoke and burntnes, which unto
sickmen that drink, it is not only grievous, but also hurtful: Balncum
Mariae, and although it shall be a little more chargeable unto them and
painful, yet so shall they satisfy and please both God and man. Matheolus.

Such things as are destilled in lead, I judge them altogether to be
disalowed, because of ye Cerusse and other malicious qualities of the lead,
lead, Galen condemns, because it bredeth diseases in the entrails. Syluius.

Moreover the vessel alters much, as well in destillacions as in things
sodden. Wherefore a man must take great hied in these things, that the vessels
be rather earthen or glass then of metal, and those that be of earth, yt they
be of a very pure earth, and well baked, such as be the earthen vessels of
Paris, Bellonaca, England and Spain. But glasen vessels are the best because
they be more Galens reason in every one almost of these kinds of metals. For
if he affirm that water only conveyed in leaden pipes doth breed diseases of
the bowels, howe much more ought we to fear waters destilled in a leaden
limbecke or still. Besides that no small cerusse remains cleauynge to the
inner side of a leaden head, as in destillinge of Vinegar is gathered, so by
the force of the vehement heate or brentnesse also tart, that is of sharpe
and tart plants, which infects the very wa^ers, and for the most part
makes them white like milcke, till that it be settled and sunk to the
bottom. Vessels of other metalles that bried other roust or canker, are so
much the more pearilous, as rouste or canker is more hurtful the^cerusse.
Vessels made of pure silver or gold, as they be least hurtful, so are they
more harde to be gotten because of the cost. Syluius.

The best vessels be of glass: the next, earthen that be glased both within
and without: then limbeckes of tin, the bodies (in destillinge of Roses) of
lead. Thirdly, the limbeckes and the bodies also of lead. For the strength
of the fire if it be moderate, it hurts not the lead, but these bodies of
lead must be set in syfted ashes, a handful thick, not in sand.
Fourthlye limbeckes of copper tinned within. Fifthlye brazen. But copper and
brass have two discommodities, Christophorus de Honestis, admonishes to take
heed and avoid them: Brunsvvick. Therefore saying all the most learned
Phisicions, and experience it self, do utterly disalowe waters destylled in
vessels of lead, Brass and other unclean metals, matter to the Magistrates,
that it might not be lawful for Apothecaries other to prepare any more or
sell such waters partly hurtful, partly unprofitable. Bulcasis in dede,
uses leaden bodies in destillinge of dry Roses, which perauenture may be
granted for such waters as ought to be used only without the body. Some find
no fault with vessels made of pure and best iron, because no evil quality
(as they say) can issue thereoute into the matter or liquor: and troth it is,
that certain Berchile. Bulcasis doth call a vessel in a furnace for Rose
water, which receives the boiling water derived out of an other standing
by it, in the which vessel, the body of the still containing the Roses, is set.

Of Fornaces, c.
I Declared before and described two manner of fornaces meet for destillation
by ashes, and Balneum Mariae also out of Bulcasis.

Hear will I trace out and descrybe another manner of fournayce, the use
chiefly when as any thing is to be destiled by a great fire, so that no mean
be betwixt the fire the cucurbite or pan wherein is contained the matter that
is to be destilled: after which manner oils or certain liquors that burn the
skyn and flesh are gotten out of metals, as aqua fortis. c. The use thereof
shall be also to sublimation: and if a man will set a kettle in at the top upon
theyron cross, then fill it with ashes or water and put clay about it, he shall
be gin what destillation he will. aqua fortis or such like, he shall set a
cucurbite or pan daubed with clay by by, right upon the cross. Yea this fornace
may be made also upon a strong board of wode, as I have made my self, that you
may remove it from one place to an other at your pleasure. Therefore upon a
woden table you shall buyl a four square fornace, of such bigness, that it may
be sufficient to set in a mean circubite. The walls you shall make of brick,
joined with mortar very well made, the hight shall O. where as the ashes may be
taken out, which fall from the coals from the grate builded upon it. If so
be it that an other grate were made also for the ashes to fall thorough (and
that lowest space to be somewhat dieper) a man should not niede to take out the
ashes so oft, and the fire should be the more vehement.

The letter. I. shows an other door, straight way above the grate, which I
have markte with certain pricks set overthwart in order. That door as the
nether also, it is sufficient if it be only so big as a man may easily put in
his hand at it. V. shows the iron cross, that is.ii. bars of iron, ye nether

in the figure here present. An other kind of fornace, for oil of vitriol or
corporoos, Balneum Mariae, y^ hast already described before, whereas we entreat
of Balneum Mariae generally out of Syluius. Also in yt making of Rose water,
out of Bulcasis. Of divers and destillacions, there is a book of one called
Geber. Concerning the making of a fornace, loke in his book entitled Summae
perfectionis. that is, of chief perfection. 1. 4. 43. Of commune Rose stills
in earth pottars fornaces, although some make them also of bras, we shall
speak with in, by and by after the destillation by ashes.

Of slow Harry, or the fornace of sloth, that is, a pipe wherewith the Balneo
Mariae is made hot, we have written above where as we have entreated Balneo
Mariae.

The differences of coals shall we know in Theophrastus, but better of our
own smiths, specially goldsmiths, and of the very experience it self. Such
coals as are dug out of the ground are condemned forbidden because of their
foul smell. They are counted the best that are made of bieche or fir tree.

Dioptra or a little skrien I call an instrument, which some men hold before

Lyquors destilled should be kept in glasen phialles with narow mouths. Let
the mouth be shit with a stopple of wod, or rather of cork, and besides that,
a man must cover it with wax and bind a parchement about it also.

Howe to close vessels and to defend them, both with clay and otherwise.
CLaying of a thing, men do commonly say for yt which is to daub with clai, to
plaster, to pariet. Tothintet we may the better keep the smell and qualities
of such things as are destilled, we must close diligently and join together
with Vlstadius chap. x If the head be not miet enough for the body but somewhat
to big, you shall put paper round about between it and the clay. Without also
whereas about moist paper about it, or else a linen cloth, and after clay it.

The mortar to join the cucurbita with the limbecke withal. c. ought to be
made with clay and hear, and to be dry before fire be put under, Bulcasis
entreating of oil of tilestones. The mortar shall be the stronger if it be
tempered not only with hear or woll, but also with gotes blood, and the more
also to be made with that is dros of iron, beaten as is found about smiths in
fields.

Of Hermes seal, that is, of joining together the mouths of glasen vessels
with a pair of hot burning tongues softly thrusting them together, and how
after they ought to be opened again, read Vlstadius. cap. 20.

Let the cucurbita also be fensed round about with clay, specially those that
must abide the fire directly put under them and nothing betwixt, and that aqua
fortis and oil of Vitrial are destilled. For the destillation in ashes, there
needs no such mortering nor claying: albeit if a man will provide for the worst
considering the frailnes of the vessels, specially where many vessels are
set together in one fornace, it shall be sufficient once or twice to pariet
the. Those cucurbitas which they use in Balneo Mariae, specially when many are
set together, some men use to like as it were house or cases.

They say glasen vessels will abide the fire better and longer, if they be
wared, that is, if they be warmed don over twice or thrice with molten wax.

Of the preparation for destillation.
FOr as much as in destillacio we seek ye separation of the elemets either for
one or mo of them, or else to thintet that they quintessens: separation truly
can not be don without heate. For heat unites and gathers together such
things as be of one kind and nature, and they that do differ and disagree it
separateth to the intent this might duly be brought to pass, both the Chemists
and Phisicions have invented diverse means and ways. They term this
preparation diversely and give it sundry names, digestion, leauening,
putrefaction or rotening. Digestion they call it respectinge, the concoction
that a certain inward virtue, but increased or styred up by an outward heat,
comes unto an humour or moisture, so that a certain comune and general
quality be mixed and spread throughout the h^ole body, with a hot spirit, one
that moves and breads bubles, as it is in ye mixture of true leaven in dede
knode with meal: also in vinegar powered upon the earth. And this affect is the
beginning of rotennes in such things as have superfluous humour. That which is
called putrifactio

The savour or other quality of ye putrefying matter, in my mind, it is not
possible it should infect the mixture that is put in a glasen cucurbita with
glass is: for the common grene glass will gather a certain duskishnes and as
it were a skin.

Destillation that is done by rottennes, or with horse dong both alone and with
lime be sprinkled and oft changed, or with barks watered, or other rottening
things, how so ever it is profitable to the Chymistes and destillers many
ways, a physician not withstanding ought not to receive it, for a cause in
rotten wod and evil smelling, thorough the rottennes or some other cause:
specially if the Syluius.

Of this kind of destillation in horse dong read before in the latter end of
those things which we writ of Balneum Mariae generally. At this present we
should entreat rather of rotening then of destillatio. But because of rotening
also in horse donge seems to be disalowed, if destillacion in it be reproved,
it is not altogether from our purpose

Putrification or rotening in horse dong with lime is otherwise done on this wise,
that the dong every day or every other day or by longar distance, be
sprinkled with warm water: otherwise, without sprinkling, when as the dung of
it self serves to be hot enough. A pit or hole being digd in some corner of
the house, they lai one course of horse dog about a foot thick, that is three
handbread: then an for the by course. There is need of three burden for the most
part of dong, as much as a porter is hable to cary.

Some put the things that are to be destylled (specially such as be
stiepte in wine) into a tin botel, and that they do set in vnslaki lime closed,
which they quench at certain times now a little and then a little, with
rain water. Some mixte Oaten straw with the horse donge, and sprinkling it with
hot water, set in their vessel, Cardanus teaches. If a manne covet but a
light heate, it shall be sufficient to put it simply in chopte straw.
Certain of the Germans that live in stouffes that is hot houses, the winter
time, make A. and in the vpperparte they set two or three glasen pots. C.
upon little iron bars and pariet and rub them over diligently with clay.
In this filled full of fine sand or ashes, both things may be destilled
which I would should be tried, and also certain lyquors may be rectified or
prepared. c, and by this means a man shall save both labour and cost.

Some to digest the matter which they will destill in the son, provide a
holowe lokinge glass. D. beams. B. which they received: and direct them into
the vessel C. wherein the matter is contained: for this purpose (as I am
informed) the figure of a holowe parabolae should be more apt and meet: a
parabolae conus. Read Archimedes in his Book of burnnynge glasses.

The same also may be done very well with balls of Crystal. A* hanged between
y^ vessel B. so yt the beams of the sun may com unto the vessel. C by the
balls. The only end of all these preparations is, that the liquor may be
drawn out more easily, more aboundatly, and more

The time of this digestio doth vary according to the matter, which the more
massy it is, the longar time doth it require: new herbs need the less time,
when they are stiept or weekt in wine or other liquor: for they be the
tenderer, and if they should be let stand long, they would have a certain
hoarinesse: the same dried must stand a little longar: then the seeds: last
of all the rotes: so that almost double time is necessary for them that follow
to yt which goes before them: as to new

The putrification of herbs to be destilled in horse donge, is wont to be
done almost by the space of.xiiii. days, but in Balneo Mariae. ii. or.iii.
natural days. Brunsvvick.

Such things require chiefly putrification, whose substance is somewhat dry,
gros, thick: raw have les nied which are contrary wise, and are digested

Putrification is sooner done in cloudy wheather then in fair. Vlstadius.

To the most part of things that are prepared in horse dong, some salt is
cast, as unto beasts blood, to flesh, to fyshe: Guainerius.

To digest, take a blind lymbeck: if the matter be pure, as pure liquor, then
take a vessel for circulation, of which sort the pelecan is the best:
although it can skarsly be made, and not without great cost. c.

But in digestion or putrification, the hoal vessel would be hid with horse
dong or with the refuse of grapes. c. To circulation the half of the vessel,
or at the least the third part, must loke out into the free and cold air (as
also to destillation.) Vlstadius chap.viii. where as he teaches at large of
putrification in horse dong.

Of the rectification of liquors destilled.
WAters destilled in Balneo Mariae, ought to be set in the sun and to be
rectified, namely in a glasen vessel, (the mouth whereof let it be bound
about and stopped with leather) full of the destilled water, so that the third
part must be left empty. then set it in hot sand by the space of forty
days, that all the fleme may be consumed, the third part of the vessel must
poured first into wine or burning water, least they should hurt a man by the
means of their over much heat, let them stand for the space of a month or
more if the water be hotter, in moyste sand, in a cold place. Likewise the
third part of the vessel hid in the sand: or two parts of the vessel (two
third parts) let them be digd in the earth in some wine cellar. Brunsvvick.
Every water if it be destilled again, specially upon the dregs and grounds
well pund and broken, it may so be rectified: quintessens must be added.

But ye the brentnes yt is in these, may brethe out it shall be best to keep open
a while the phials wherein the liquors stand: not withstanding you must take
heed that the grace of the smell in the mean season with it much of the
strength and virtue thereof, do fume out. Syluius. Destilled liquors of diverse
sorts if a man mixte them together sometimes they become troubled and pudled
like thin milk or why, and for the most part an old liquor make them clear
and pure again, if into three pounds, you cast six or eight drops of white
vinegar very sharp: for they will drive down the pudly matter to the bottom:
Brunsvvick.

Destillacion by a Filter or a list of Woollen cloth.
DEstillation by a filter is more in ur with the last vessel only and lowest
shall have no lists, which must only receive, not yield forth. The
destillation by a filter is done also in two crooked vessels of glass well
clayed, the one where of must stand higher then the other, when you will draw
precious and swiet smelling liquors from the matter (digested first in Balneo
Mariae,) as Vlstadius makes mention. Chap. 56.

To the sirrup which is made of the sower juice of the citron, that juice must
a man destill by a filter, or elsse it will gather into a courd when it waxes
cold, and likewise ye juice of Lemons and Orenges.

By a list some destill also the decoctions of herbs sod with a soft fire,
which afterward by little and little they sis till it be as thick as honey,
as of the rotes of black Elleborus or bears foot. Other think it sufficient
only to sethe it or strain it.

Of burning water or single Aqua vitae, and of the strength thereof, and
manifold use.
BVrnynge water or Aqua vitae is drawn out of wine, but with us out of the
wine lies only, specially of them that sell it, and by this onli almost get
their living. And parauenture it is never a whit ye worse that it is drawn
out of lies: for Lullus teaches it be destilled often, it shall be made the
more effectual, that is to say, hotter and drier: for dregs also or lies
brent, are very hot, and give the hottest oil, which they call oil de
Tartaro, but that burning water that is destilled out of wine, me thinks it
shall be the swieter, and more pleasant both in smell and taste, and without all
brent taste: besides that more apt also for quintessens. Burning water is
called also water of sapa, of which oil, mingled together soope is made, for
it brenneth ye Monachus in Mesuaem.

Burning water oft destilled, is brought into such sharpnes yt it can not be
drunk. Cardan. But this is commonly known: they that sell it commoly serpentins
or writhen or crouked vessels or in other accustomed vessels (with pipes of
brass as big as a mans arm) may afterward be perfected in ashes, until all
the steam be put away: by the which means it is made not only hoter and more
subtle and finned, but also more pleasant both form or fashion of the
bodies and heads which they call limbeckse, to destill all ^uyces: for some
draw the water out of wine put in a great brazen vessel, standing upon the
fire, the neck or mouth whereof is great and broad, upon a three foot, and
upon this neck stands the head of brass also with a top like a spire
steple, a thing like a pail or bucket. D. compassing it, full of cold water,
that the large vapoure may be thickened the sooner by the head made cold, and
least the water of ye wine Syluius. We did see diverse fashyons of vessels set
out in figures to destill burning water or aqua vitae, in Gualter Ryffius Andro
Lo nicerus. Bulcasis saith wine may be destilled after the same manner, as
vinegar, the destillacion where of he described. Read within, straight after the
title of destillacion in ashes.

Some make a lunge round pipe. A. going upright from the cover of the
Caudron containing the wines or lies, which pipe is larger beneathe after the
fashion of a figure in Geometrye called conus which they bow at the top
almost with a straight corner, and by a bucket full of water not a crouked nor
wri then course: and so they say, shall a man have more plenty of water. Such
like little instruments certain apothecaries do make, and call them bladdars,
for this purpose, that if they need

Aqua vitae is thought then to be stilled enough, that is, after it be stilled
four times at the least, and pourged from all his fleam, when as if a Aqua
vitae so oft destylled should attain, ought too be lighter it should also
become thin and pure, more more, and when every fire, the thicker and grosser
it is, the more it burns: contrariwise, the thinner, the less: that which is
most thin should burn least of all. By the same cause it comes to pass,
that a drop of Aqua vitae poured in the palm of a mans hand, the better it is,
the sooner it vanishes away and is consumed. I hear that this is a laudable
note of this water, if succinum amber being set on fire and put to it into a
spoon do burn. When wine Vlstadius. 10* chapter.) is destilled twyse or thrice,
you shall cut a fine sponge into pieces, so great, that on every side they may
touch the cucur bita or body within the upper part (that is in the inner
circuit) the spog must be tied in three or four strings hanging without, when
you shall set on the limbeck, so that the sponge can not fall into the bottom
of the still: let the sponge be dipped in oil olive, and crushed out a little
again, least pexauenture the oil should fall into the pot or body of the y^ me
of our time call it dead water: for it is unsavoury and stinking. Such, that is
the stinking water, whether it be yeilden of lies only, or also of wine, I
have not tried.

For the destillation of aqua vitae or burning water, a man must choose the
best wine, black, red, or white. Black and old, yields more plenty and also
better water, then any other. The fire at y^ first must be light and soft,
after more vehement: but you must take heed in any wise yt the wine sethe
Albertus as some allege.

Of five parts of lies, when it is twice destilled I hear, one remains or
somewhat les. When y^ fleam is one clean consumed, nothing is lost after in
the destilling, but the hole is yielded again. Of.iiii. measures of wine, for
the most part one measure of burning water is gathered in the first
destillacion or there about according to the goodness for the most part we are
content with the third or the fourth destillacion, and call it perfect. And
surely it rests much in the instrument, that the water should be perfected
sooner or slower. For the vapour is more destilled and perfected in the first
destillacion in a serpentin (that is in a crooked and bowed pipe) the thrice
destilled by a straight pipe. Note further that there diverse waters may be
gathered in the first destillacion, whereof the first is perfect, that is, that
which burns and is consumed Lullus.

Of the strengthes and virtues of Aqua vitae, in the book of Arnold, De Villa
nova, which is written
ARnold in his book of Aqua vitae describes many qualities thereof both of it
alone, and also mixed with other medicines after the destillacion, observing the
order of the.xii. signs, from the head to the fete, for as he saith, a man
must minister much more effectual remedies to the head, if a man have need, at
such time as the moan is in the ram: and likewise in the other, which thing
how true I judge it, I will not say at this time: notwithstanding this will
Arabians have brought into physic. Aqua vitae simple and alone (saith
Arnold out of one Theoricus I can not tel whom) breaks an impostume or
recourse of matter both within the body, if it be drunk, and without, as
botch, if it be anointed therewith. It helps read and duskish eyes. It
stauncheth the running and watering of the eyes. It is good for them that have
the falling sickns if they drink it. It cures the palsy iuila fallen down with
humours, also the salt fleme, the rose drop the touth ache. It is marvelous
profitable for fretik me such as be melacholy. It erpelleth poyso, The smell
thereof burnt, kills flies fishes from roating. It restores wine that is
turned or putrified. It draws forth the virtues of herbs and rotes, if they
be laid in it.iiii. days (otherwise.iiii. hours) except only the Violet. It
ought to be set up in a glasen or silver vessel and to be well stopped. There is
more of it better made of old wine pure and read. This he. He that desires
more concerning the virtues of Aqua vitae, let him read that which we write
above of ye virtues of certain liquors, which our men call gold, Aqua vitae,
as to the other, specially to simple Aqua vitae, much more to compound or Aqua
composita, but chieflye to the quintessens thereof. Read more over Lullus in
the book of waters. I have scene also a certain broken work ascrtbed to
Albertus, of the virtues of Aqua vitae. But practicioners, ignorant of things
and times, or else of a purpose to deceive me, as many as they could, have most
impudently fathered Galen, Hippocrates and Aristotle of the virtues of Aqua
vitae, or burning water, as written by them. All kind of cold passions or
greues, that be curable, it helps in short space, specially diseases of the
brain, sinews and joints. Also worms in the belly, biles and all scabbines,
if it be washed oft therewith, it heals it. It helps ye spleen, it kills
all worms. It medeth a stinking breath. It takes away the disease of the
loins. The hurt members if they be anointed health. It preserves fish and
flesh from corrupting, but before they be eaten, they must be washte with
common water. Camphora put into it, will dissolve. If common water be poured
into it, it goes to the bottom: and likewise oil. This writes Albertus as
some allege.

The taste of it excedeth all other tastes, and the smell all other smells.
Lullus, It comfort the natural heat more then any other remeadye: it is most
holsom for the stomach, the heart and the liver: Lullus. Anoynte the head
therewith and it helps it of the head ache: it kills the worms drunken
fasting: it puts away away diverse kind of touth ache. It puts away the
blemishes and whit spots in the eyes, if it be poured into them: and avoids
the running and watering of the same, if a man do but hold it in his mouth. It
lets the leprosy a space and hides it It helps rotten and materinge
biles, if linen clouts be dipped therein and laid upon them. With a little
decoction of parcely, it drives away the stones in the bladder. It makes women
apt to conceive, but annoys them that be great with Lullus.

I knew an old woman, that was cold and Cathectica, to be restored by a
handkerchief made warm with Aqua vitae set a fire within it.

Some allege the testimony of Constantine, of

Aqua vitae besides other things is commodious and profitable for the strangury
and other diseases of the bladder, for the tertian ague and quartain also which
are joined with cold humours: against the disease called the Wulfe: against
worms: against the sens or painful fealinge of a man body like unto
biles. It furthers and provokes women's flowers. It breaks and puts
away the stone in the reins, and expels a of the belly and fluxes, it
helps, what so ever they be. They say, that Aqua vitae is perfect when often
measures is made one, (which I suppose will come to pass in the third or
fourth destillacion). Annoynt the head therewith, and it heals worms, the
scuruinesse and scabs, pusculs and skailes. It puts away the spots in
the face and other where. Broken eggs or eggs that that lack a shell, put
them in Aqua vitae and it will sis them. It healpeth the numnesse of a
Apoplexia, swellings, steames, tenesmum or desire to the stool and weariness.
It amends the morphew being drunken or anointed theruppon. It makes the
skin soft and pure. To conclude, it is good against the biting of a mad
dog. It will heal any would excellently, if it be washte therewith, and so
that no evil effect shall come thereafter by the means of the same wound.

I perceiving Aqua vitae to be hot and to dry, apomel^, which with us
commonly they make of honey cobs. c. Some wet figs there in set them on fire, then
eat them hot. A ma may also mixed any sirup therewith, one or other, according as
ye disease shall require. To preserve wine y^ it be not troubled nor putrified,
put to it the teeth Aqua vitae. in dede sulphur is far better for the same
purpose, but it bewrays the craft and the smell there of. The same will alum
do, but being both hurtful, they are very noisome to the health. Cardane.

If wine by the means of the savour of the vessels or taste of the grapes be
corrupt and soured, pour Aqua vitae into it and it will restore it. The same
purges haging wine that is new: also wine that is putrified and soured also:
for it conuertes vinegar. To conclude it brings a good smell and Albertus as
some allege. When the wine is to be drawn into an empty vessel, most use to
put in a ball of brimston set a fire: other use Aqua vitae, dipping tow
therein.

Wine that is made to have any taste or smell, out of hand in a moment, is
both a curious thing for rich men cheiffy, which will aduaunt them of ye sorts
of wine: and also profitable. For the qualities Aqua vitae for the space
of.xxiiii. hours for so the strength of them shall be drawn out. Then ye waters
so affected and died, shall be mixed with a little wine when ye will drink.
Arnoldus de v^lla nova.

How that wine is made which they calcommoly Hippocras, with Aqua vitae and
certain spices stiept therein, I will declare when I shall speak

Of the quintessens of wine I shall speak within, in the title of quintessens.

Of such things as be destilled dry, put into any liquor.
THe things that be dry can not be destilled, except they be stiept in some
liquor. Of their will I write in this place. Of those that whiles they be new,
be stiept and wet in some liquor before they be destilled, I will speak
hereafter amongst waters Aqua vitae rectified seems to agree best to the
stieping of spices, except we will avoid to much heat, wherewith the things
destilled in them might be infected withal, when the liquor is drawn away.

Some still Cinnamon beaten with spring water poured to it, as we shall show
amongst Oils. Sedes also and other spices, wheroute oil is taken, are stiept
in some of the forsaid liquors. It is best according to my judgment to destill
all these into anything in ashes with a soft fire. Of waters of virtues or
golden waters, that are wont to be made with saudge other smelling herbs
spices, set in wine, I will speak within amongst the copounded waters: of them
that are put in burning water, amongst the composed waters of life. It is to be
considered also how long they stad to soak in wine: for new things, they yt be
thin or open not massy, need les time the dry, gross and thick, beaten things,
the hole: the rotes then the gentian, astrantia, ye flour deluce, y^ beries of
juniper other: I wold more allow ye liquors of drithinges set in wine or other
where: but if ye things be thin or slendar, or of no savor, or ought to could
moist they should be destilled rather new. Sometimes the time of the year
causes a man to take dryethinges because of the lack or scarsity of fresh.

Gentian water. Take.iiii. pounds of the fresh and new rotes or rather dry cut
in small pieces, of great Gentian or white Gentian, (whose rotes are most fat,
and being set in wine, they nether corrupt them selves nor suffer the wine to
corrupt, as I have tried my self by the space of these ii* years) set in a
couple of great glasses in a stoufnie the fornace, or hang them if you will, the
glasses diligently stopped, and put into them pure good wine, so much that the
wine be.ii. fingers above the: you shall ever put new wine unto them still,
cucurbitas, ye wine and the rotes destributed together, destil them in Balneo
Mariae, or else in ashes with a soft fire. Of the water of Centory y^ les and
gentian together destilled in wine, read within amongst composed waters.

Juniper beries also dry set in wine, give a very good liquor swiet smelling:
but wormwode

Pelitory other fresh or dry is set in wine or vinegar destilled or
vndesti^led*

These things also sookte in burning water (as I said) do communicate their
strength with it: but I hear it is done much moore effectually, if the
things be beaten at the beginnynge and myxte with the lies of wine ready of
wine, the men of our country draw Aqua vitae.) So also did one teach me in
counsel as a great secret, that Wormwode water and other may be best made.
I have not tried it yet.

Water of Roses with dry Roses is so made. Pour water to dry Roses, not more
the is sufficient to stiep them in: then put them from thence into glasen
cucurbitas or leaden, and destill them by little and little. This water shall
be profitable in medicines, and also to garnishing and trimming, Bulcasis. If
the Roses which we call commonly incarnation Roses, dried moystned with the
vapor of hot water be destilled, they will give good Rose water. Syluius.

The water of the nux vomica or spueinge nut, or the juice gotten out with
fire, is like the water Cardanus in his second buke de subtilitate. And a
little after. If the poison newly taken remain yet in the stomach, the best
kind of remedies be they that provoke much to vomit strogly, milk, lie, oil,
the water of the spewing nut, I suppose he means by the juice gotten out by
the fire, nothing else but the water destilled thereof. For he names water
that is like it in colour, not in smell nor taste, which agrees with destilled
waters. most hard and dry, it appears that his shell must be sookt in some
liquor as water, wine, vinegar, Aqua vitae. I wold soak it rather in vinegar,
which by it self resists poison, and is good to provoke vomitting.

Waters destilled of new and fresh plats (saith Brunsvvick) ought to be
preferred, which if they can not be had, ether for some other cause or because
they be brought out of strange countries only dry, as spicknarde, lavender,
stichae, scoenantum, Balneum Mariae, and rectifye it also in the sun, (that
is in hot sand, for the space of: xl. days) and keep it a year. The what time
of the year so ever thou lakst liquor of dry herbs, do thus. Take as many
herbs as thou list dried in the shadow (the leaves being taken away and kept
apart by the selves) put them in a glass, and pour upon them that first thou
power on so much, that the herbs be sufficiently overcovered with water: and
again twis so much. Then set it in horse dung two or three days, still it,
and putrefy it again, so that it be thrys putrified and destilled by course
in order. This water surely shall be much better, then if a man, as Bulcasis
writes, to one pound of dry roses (or other herbs or flowers) shall put ten
poud of common water and destill it by and by. A certain cunning phisicion
writes that if water be aqua vitae. Hitherto Brunsvvick.

And in the dew it self also there is a certain medicinal virtue as
Brunsvvick teaches in an other Alexader Benedict{us}.

Of quint essence of remedies.
QVint essence they name to be, the chief and the heauenliest power or virtue
in any plant, me and purity of the hoale substance, not by any elimentall or
sensible quality (although it be not without qualities) conserveth the good
health of mans body, prolongs a mans youth, differs age, and puts away
all manner of diseases. Of this first of al me writ Raimudus Lull{us}, although
it were unknown to al the physicians of his time, nether written of in any
book, nor tried or gone about in any use. After him follows besides other
Iohannes de Rupe scissa, (whom one certain Lullus, as I writ before, I judge
they were both in one time) Hieronimus Brunsvvick, Philippus Vlstadius, and
perauenture a few other which writ somewhat of the same. Sum kind thereof is
simple, as yt most famous quint essence of wine or Aqua vitae, of chelidony or
selandyn, of mans blood, of strawberys, of Antimonii. c. Other are copounde that
is when certain remedies are put to sum quint essence now perfited, yt it may
draw out yt virtues of the, whereunto

But here springs a dout, saith Cardane, whether a man may make ye water
teperat, which they cal quint essence: It will be, as I shall prove, of the nature
of the firmamet, that is a most pure thin substance moveable, which by the
moving retains a temperate heat, very much thereof. This thefor is of power to
coserue al strengths, topro long life. For being most subtle, it mixith it self
with the first moistur, piercing the massy things, separateth And because it
hath much heat, it expels what soever is unclean, and therefore restores
the natural heat. For age is nothing else then a lessening and diminishing of
natural heat, which is therefore diminished, because the mouinge is hindered: as
I said of fire: for there is like reason of this unto that. Moving is hindered,
because of ye abundance of earthy matter, because the earth only hath very
much matter, and is destitute of all moving. Therefore that water being of so
teperate Aqua vitae reteininge his purity and subtle matter: by the lunge
mocyon of circulacio, hath put of and rid away his heat and sharpnes of taste
and smell, it is becomed of the nature of the firmament: and then first of all
it smells swiet and fragantly. For a fragrat smell is nothing else then a sharp
smell when it is moderate. Aqua vitae, if it come once to a temperatnes, the
thinnes and purity remaining still, it must needs be made fragrat and swiet
smelling: and if it be once fragrant, it must necessarilye be turned into the
nature of the firmament. There is also a water made of the flesh tyr{us} or an
adder, that restores youth: there is made olso of Elleborus, which I saw at
my fathers. But these vex and unquiet the body, and firmamentall water doth
it in dede, which retains long that which a man has and adourneth the
same. But is the firmament more pure then the fire which is most hot* It is
surely so: for it is next unto the heaven, and therefore most light. For by
his circulacion it moderateth the heat caused in it by the stars: and after
ye same manner this water, brought to the most puritye by the heat of the
fire, by motion it self is coled again and obteineth a temper. Wherefore both
Stoikes believe mans soul to be.) Al this write Cardane.

The virtue of every thing rests in the quintessens quintessens. Somthings it
is sufficient to destil the few days, if any part of the earth or lies remain
in the boto of the circulating vessel, to put it awai pouring it forth. The
quintessens of wine will no more burn the mouth, nether is it burning wine any
more, but more subtle, and is called heaven: whereunto we say his stars is
added, when as herbs of diverse qualities, and such as be excellent against
diverse sicknesses, are sokte stiept therein, as we shall show hereafter in Aqua
vitae compounded. To be solificate or made gold, is Lullus book of
quintessens.

The quintessens of any medicine has a thousand times the greater virtue,
then it had before, whiles the thing had yet the element in it. Vlsta.

How the quintessens of all things Lullus, intreatinge of quintessene.
THe quintessence of any thing may be drawn out from it, as of wode, fruit,
flowers, rotes, leaves, sedes, stones, metals, flesh, and of what spices a man
will, in this sort.

Any thing that you will separate the quintessence from, you shall put it into
the quintessence of shall set it forth to be solified sonned in ye spring, or
else in a vessel to a light fire, and within three hours you shall have the
quintessence of ye thing mixed with the quintessence of the wine, which shall be
converted into such a nature as is of ye thing that is put in, whether it be
hot or cold, moist or dry, purge or what other condition or smell so ever it be
of: and it shall not only have the same operation, but also in the same degre,
yt is nether more nor les. c. After this he rehearses remedies one quintessens.
Rogerius Bacho also writ a little book of the qualities strengthes of Aqua
vitae, throughout the.xii. signs according to the diseases from the head to
the fete, adding waters and medicines according to the nature of every part and
disease, for one, one, for an other, an other. This book some ascribe to
Arnold de villa nova.

Ihon Brasescus a man of our age most exercysed in the mysteries of the Art
of liquors, as his writings do testify, in a certain dialoge, the spekers
whereof be Raymund Lullus and Demogorgon, (which ye author set forth in
Italian, with an other also upon the exposicion of the books of Geber. Ihon
Petreius at Norinberg Prynted them both in Latin without the authors name)
affirming that quintessens which serves for the conserving and lengthening
of man life, is not to be lokt for out of plants, beasts or precious
Raymund. Seeing it is necessary that this medicine should be utterly
vncorruptible, and in this thing it ought to pass and exceed al things that
have any part of the elements in them: it must needs be drawn out of such a
matter as is most far from all corrupcion, and least subject to the same.
Demogorgo. Yet thou said in ye book which thou writst of the secrets of
nature, yt it should be drawn out of red wine, ye same cofirmeth Iohn de rupa
scissa, other suppose it should be made of Celedonie, other wold take mans blud.
Ray. Thou art not a little deceived, if thou think ye writings of philosophers
ought to be taken vnderstaded according to ye bare letter, chiefly in this
science, ye more clearly plainly they speak, so much ye more darkness have their
writings, for they have spoke by similitudes ridles in ye darkest form of
speech. Demo. In this thing what similitude have they used? Ray. Senior the
philosopher saith this medicine and from taste to taste, and from nature to
nature: and therefore the names thereof are multiplied. Also Minois a
philosopher, if a man ask (says he) why is it made rede before it received
whyt: Answer, that it was twys made black, twys turnid into orrenge colour,
and received twys red colour. Seeing now that it receives twys red colour,
as red wine and mans blood, that is to say, after the putrefaction and in the
destillation: therefore the old men speaking by quintessence now perfect,
which Io. de Rupescissa doth: that is, that al men entering into the house may
be marnei lously allured unto it set in a corner of the house: an other. that
all birds that perceine that swietnes of savour, may flock together unto it
set in the top of a tour: this is expounded allegorically, that by the tour,
the fornace set in a corner of the Rasis also was. Thus saith he.

Of the dravvyng out of the quint essence from wine, out of Vlstadius and
Raymund Lullus.
THou shalt take the best wine thou can get, what colour soever it be, let it
be wyny rather then swiet, destill it.iiii. times in a lembeck, so as commonly
burning water is made. If so be it, it be ofter destilled, it shall be the
better. To know when it is sufficiently destilled, you shall consider, side
one, which also some call the vessel of Mercurius, by the hoal whereof in the
top, the matter that is to be circulated, may be put in and out. And when the
quint essence. Then the wine so destilled as we have said, when as it hath all
the four elemets, yet by the oft moving agitacton and going up and down, it
passes and is turned from corruptible into almost vncorruptible. If so be it
that by the often ascention and descention of destillation, the is separated,
how much more doth it come to pas in a still where it is tossed up down a
thousand thousand times. By this moving therefore, it is to be supposed, that an
elemental matier is turned in to a substance void of all elements and a body
incorruptible, so that this quint assence is of so much the further from the
corruption of a body that hath part of the elements in it, as the heaven it
self is more vncorruptible the the four elemets. But when this circulation is
many times done, quint essence. For if it be perfectly done, there will issue
forth a most fragrant and pleasant smell, so excellent that they that feel it,
shall think them selue to be rapt from the earth into heaven, and to have the
fruicion of a certain heavenly savour. This vapour if it chance to insinuate
it self into some close place

If it be set in the top of a tour, it will allure all kind of birds unto
it, that be there about. But if that excellent grace of savour appear not
yet, then thou shalt shit it close again in to the Pelecane, when it is
diligently clayed, fet it in again to the circulating destillation, until the
perfect quint essence it self appear, or else as Raymundus in his first book
the second chapter, calls it quick Mercury. And it hath not only that most
excellent savour and taste, but also a certain vncorruptible nature to be
occupied about other medicines.

And surely it hath no brentnes in the mouth as aqua vitae, nether any moisture
or fleam, because all the earthy elemental matter is settled down to the
bottom.

How qvint essence may be dravven


PVtt Horse dung A in great deep vessel B or in a pit made for this
purpose: and in midst of the dung set C full until two third parts of the
matter to be destilled, so that the third part remain without the dung
empty, that the matter may ascend descend, and so to be turned into clear
water. But the dung must be renewed once at the least every wieke. The same
after they be pressed in the wine harvest: or else in the dog days with the
sun. It is possible also to draw quintessens out of troubled, unclean and
corrupt wine, if it be not sower or like Vinegar: For we see even of corrupt
wine, if it grew in a good place, although it be troubled and of an ill
taste, yet very good Aqua vitae may be destylled therout.

There is also an other way to draw it out without fire and labour. Take Aqua
vitae the best with a lunge neck, in the top whereof must be a hole, why the
ought to be closed and stopped with wax prepared accordingly (as Vlstadius
teaches after in the teeth chapter.) Then let it be turned upside down, and
with the neck let it be put into the dung, so the grosser matter shall settle
and lie in the bottom of the that is, the very quintessente, stop the whole
with thy finger turn the glass upright. So hast thou quintessence, but les
precious then tother before. In like manner may burning water be put in a
glasen vessel, not turned, but buried upright in dung for a certain space.
After by streinynge may you separate the groser matter which is settled to the
bottom, from the pure that is above: but this is yet les precyus.
Notwithstanding it draws out all the virtues of the herbs, and other
Vlstadius the.viii. chap.

After this he adds the way howe to draw out quintessence out of new
wine, yet hot in the Lullus) I will let it pass.

In what places Vlstadius in his heaven, teaches to draw out diverse quint
essences.

philosophers, this (as men say) doth extract and draw out within the space
of.iiii. hours, the virtue and strength of every thing that is stiept therein.

Ihon Brasescus, by red wine, wherout quintessence quintessence.

A marvelous water that has a contrary operation to Aqua vitae which may be
called cold quint essence.
THe flours of samoncus elder, y^ flours of horse houf, which grows upon
waters having giluu (otherwise y^ flour of nenuphar, which I think to be true,
and so doth Rogeri{us} interpretate it) of ether of them a pound. Purslan sede,

on fire with a candle: it will burn but not consume nor waste, nether leave any
sign of burntnes in ye cloth. If so be it part of this water, when Aqua vitae

agues: in all hot diseases, and grieves of the even and head, that comes of
heat: also against the irkesumnes and lothsumnes of the stomach: for the
diseases called Lupus, and the fistula, and the pain of the side, the heat of
the privy members through the act of generation, and all diseases about this
privy parts, what hot causes so ever they cum of. And after the deliverance
of women, it is very proffitable if a

A certain water in Raymund Lullus book of waters, seems to be of the like
operation, which he describes in this wise. A water compounded according to
the contrary of Aqua vitae: Take white Camphora, roses, whyt pople and black,
cichory, porsulane, violets, Solanu or night shade, maidenhear, cymbalaris,
singrene, vermicularis, rostrum porcinum, cardicellum. The leaves that be to be
punned, let them be punned and destilled.

Of the extracting and dravvyng forth of all the virtues of Chelidonia or
selandine: by the which example, every man of any understanding, may use to
draw out the virtues
BY the quint essence of selandin, Ioan. Brasescus thinks somewhat else to be
allegorically vnderstaded, as I declared before where we entreated of quint
essence generally.

Chelidonia, Seladin (saith Vlst.) hath innumerable virtues: and the quint
essence thereof, which we will teach here to get out, goes cucurbitam or body
of a still of earth glased: when the body is full shit it close, and clay it
round about, then set it in now horse dung, for the space of iii. weeks. After
put it in a limbeck and destill it in Balneo Mariae, with a slow fire, and the
fleam shall avoid out of it. Then shall you draw out the dregs, and stone,
put the again in a cucurbita with a blind lymbeck, and let them stand in
Balneo Mariae a seuennight, or in horse dung mo days. Afterward the matter by
little and little being couled put on a nosed limbeck, and destill it in ashes,
according as in the.x. chap. of the separation of oil from the earth, we have
spoken: and there shall issue out a clear water containing in it self air
and water. Thou shalt separate the water from the air in a new cucurbita by
Balneo Mariae, with an easy fire: Balneo Mariae seven days at the last thou
halt destill the in sand with a great fire, and the fleam shall issue out
first, then a radish water, or rather an oil, which is the element of fire,
from the which thou shalt separate the Balneo Mariae, as is before said. But
the dregs that left, which conteyne nothing else but earth, must be urged
with a strong fire and brought unto lyme, by the space of ten days. (that is
in a fornace of calcination or reverberation, or a very lyme kiln, as I have
taught in the tenth chap.) Then grind them again upon a marble stoone and sooke
them in the fleam, and let them be destilled in a limbeck, until you see in
the matter little white stones like salt. And out of which you have destilled
it, and after, you shall destill it again, and again so oft, until the earth
chance and put away from it all unclean and earthy colour, be brought to a
very white (to the whytnes of wax) and so it shall be rectified earth. The other
elements also ought to be rectified, so that every one be destilled seven
times, pouring every time the fleam to the air and fire, and after separating
them as is before said. When as thou wilt do this an easier way, dissolve every
quintessence, but it must be presupposed that every element be first justified.
Then let it be put in a vessel of circulation in horse dung or in Balneo Mariae.
xxx. days, and then destill it again. So shall the very body as a gros matter
be changed into spirit or most subtle and pure substance. quintessence. The
matter is judged to be sufficiently circulated, when the quintessence swims
above the other matter.

Of the virtues of every one of the liquors of Selandine. The element of the
water is good for al the diseases of the body, both hot cold. It tempers all
ve nom from the hart: it cures al the diseases that chance unto the lunges.
It purges the blood, and preserves a man from all corruption of the natural
strength and power. At once, it is good for all sick men in what disease so
ever they be.

The element of air, like unto oil, confirms and increases the strength and
beauty of young persons, if they use it sometimes with meat, for it lets the
blood fro corrupting by any means.

The elemet of fire, if so much as a wheat corn in quantity be mixed with the
best wine ye can get and poured into a sick mans mouth, yea if he be half
dead, it restores and refreshes al the stregthes of the body: for it pierces
unto the hart, and makes it warm: and expels all poisons and moist
superfluities from the hart. Lullus with the quint essence of wine mixes a
little drop of this oil, to restore the that are about to die, and past al
hope, in that within the.xx. part of an hour.

Some draw out the quint essence fro Selandine an other way and shorter. They
cut Selandine together with the rote and flour in small pieces they wey it,
pouring well water upon it, they sethe it till it be brought to the same weighte.
Then they pun it in a stone mortar, and when the juice is streined out through
a linen clothe and purged it be ad consistenciam mell is as thick as honey.
After, they put it in a cucurbita so that it be half full, by destillacion in
Balneo Mariae, they gather ye water or fieme. Then translating the vessel into
ashes, they receive the aerie oil, whereupon when they se an other kind of oil
swim above (the fire being encresed) they set under an other receiving vessel,
wherein the element of fire is gathered. Every one of these liquors must be
rectified, that it may be mete for the medicines of mans body, that Balneo
Mariae, so yt at every time the cucurbita be diligently washed, (made clean)
from the dregs which remain, which ought to be mixed with the element of
thearth, which remains in the bottom of the cucurbita after ye destillation
of ye fiery liquor. Likewise thou shalt rectify thair, destilling it in
ashes.vii. times, mixting the dregs with thearth. Afterward ye liquor of fire
likewise. The earthy matter, in such manner Selandine puts away al heats
poisons out of y^ breast. It is good for the stoppinges of the liver and lunges:
for it consumes ye superfiuous humours fleme: Tie conclude, it delivers a ma
within the space of.ix. days, free fro all infirmities. choler, no bitter, nor
fleme in ye body to get ye moisture. It encreseth blud, destributeth it into
all the parts of the body by his piercing. Wherefore they that use this oil,
do let blud the ofter. If a ma be in ieoperdy ^f losing of an eye, let him drop
in a drop or.ii. thereof every day by the space of xxx. dais, it shall do him
merueilus much good. The firye liquor is much more effectuous then the watery
or aerie, helps where they fail. It conserveth the youth, it makes age
lively and elipir of life. Moreover ye earthy matter rectified by dissolucios,
coagulations ielyings: calinatios sub till salt of ye earth, wherewith al metals
may be turned into stone, al spirits may be fixed: having radicable natural
moisture. It nourishes lepre me. Of this ye aunciet philosophers made a stone
which they called ye philosophers stone. The manner to receive y^ for said
liquors within the body is Seladine, iii. sponeful of rosewater, put to it a
little sponeful of y^ sanguine air (y^ is the liquor of the air) give it to be
drunken fasting, if the disease be hot, with wine: and if the man be
past.xxiiii. years of age give it him with Aqua vite. In hot agues it ought not
to be taken in no wise. Al this writes Vlstadius.

Of drawing out the four elements from Selaudine and bay leaves, read also
Io. Ganiuetus book, which is entitled Amicus medicorum, a

How quint essence is dravvn out of fruit, as Appels, Peers, plummes,
Cherries, Chestnuts. c. out of Vlstadi{us}.
WHen the fri^te is small cut and stampte in a stone mortar, mixte it with
the.x. part of common salt. Then put it in a cucurbita with a blind limbeck,
and set it in horse dung, as is said before of mans blud. c

Out of Flowers, herbs, and roots.
GAther the Plants, when they be well ripened, in fair weather, in the spring
of the moan: and when it is almost at ye full, wash them and cut the very lmall:
beat them in a mortar of marble with the tenth part of salt, and thou shalt
sower them in a circulating vessel or blind limbek, in horse dung for ye space
of a month. Then shalt thou destill them in Balneo Mariae, encreasyng the first
fire to the third degre. The take the dregs out of the cucurbita, and
grineding the very small pour the destilled water upon them again, and when
they are putrified in dung again as before at the length thou shalt destil
them, deminishing the fire by the half degre. Then grind the dregs again. c. as
before, and when thou destillest the again, deminishe and lesson the fire, yet
also by ye half degre. The putrefaction also must always the second

done, put it in a circulating vessel (close above and beneth and large, narowe
in the midst, with a short byl hollow coming out of the upper part of the nether
belly, looking upward) and let it be digested in dung or a bath with a fire
quint essence: which not withstanding shall be the more effectual if thou shalt
destil the water of the herbs, seeds, or routes: and pour it again upon his
own dreges, then digest it by the space of seven days, and afterward destill
it by ashes, the very same way as it is said before of selandin that every
element

Of quint essence of mans blood, eggs, flesh, and honey.
HOwe quint essence is gotten out of mas blood, eggs, and flesh, read
Vlstadi' the xiiii. chap. They put unto them the tenth part of salt, wherewith
they are well mingled, putrified and destilled and that four times, length they
are perfited by long circulation, until they come to the most swietnes of
savour, and pure fynnes of substance: Lullus also in his first book the.iiii.
chap. mencioneth of quint essence, but the printed books left out that, that
salt must be added unto it. It seems that salt may ryghtly be added to the
destilling of moyste things, specially those that would easily corrupt,
such as chiefly the parts of beasts are.

A most precious water of Albertus magnus, as Albertus water, if it be his,
when as he wills it to be destylled only once and simpely. The composition
that follows hath more reason with it, which I found also in the same
written book.

Holy oil or life oil (because it preserves Hevve Gordones, wherewith he
cured many most grievous diseases: Three pound of read blood of a helthfull

the fourth read, and somewhat thycke. An oil so destylled, when the moon
increases and decreases, therefore they name it holy. If so be it then give a

call it) is wonderful proffitable Gnaynerius.

To draw out the four elements from mans blood, read the book of Ioh.
Geniuetus called the friend of physicians. 4. 7.

Of mans blood destilled simpely, read Brunsvvick, in the duche book of
destillacios. He writes

Io. Bracescus, is of this opinion that the old wryters would signify
allegorically some other thing, that of metal, when they speak of mans blood:
as I recited before, where I write of quint essence generally. Vlstadius in
the.x. chap. of his teaches how quint essence of wine is made, every element
drawn out apart by him self: And this (saith he) which is destilled in the
seventh time, is called man blood, which the destillers, chieflye search,
and it is very air. This saith he. In deed the liquor of the air, which
in the most part of destilled things is oylye, seems to be called by the
name of mans blood, for as much as our body consists of four humours as
elements, whereof the blud is compared Ihon Brasescus, mans blud is a certain
metally thing, so called of the color.

For the extracting and drawing out of quint essence from honi, which goes to
y^ making of potable gold, read Vlstadius the.xii. chap. and.xxii. whereas he
prescribes also diverse ways to gather three manner of waters, and rehearses the
virtues, whereof he spake nothing in the.xii. chap. declared to get out only
two diverse waters.

Of quint essence of metals.
IHon Brasesc{us} in the dialog of Raimund and Demogorgon, when he had affyrmed
that quint essence which is profitable to the preservation and lengethening of
man life, can not be had of any other thing the of metals only, he adds
at length. When as according to the opinion of the ancient philosophers, every
metal after their simi^itude, in every metal, as it is plainly declared, in
the book of the expositio of Gebrus books: therefore this our medicin also
although it be extracted and drawn out of some one metal only, yet nevertheless
it shall have the virtue of al metals and plants, and the virtue over the hole
body of man to heal many infirmities that be curable. Ioan de Rupescissa
speaking of our radical and natural moisture, and of quint essence under the
name of Aqua vitae, would signify the same, for he Brasescus, wherein he
expounds Gebrus.

Of the drawing out of quint essence from Antimonia, lead, white lead out of
Vlstadius.
QVint essence of antimonio is thus made. Incorporate and mingle the powder of
antimonii most finely beaten, with most sharpe vinegar destilled, and let it
stand till the vinegar be turned into a very red colour. Then drive the
vinegar out, and in a clean vessel put other destilled vinegar upon the
antimonium, and set over a little fire till the vinegar be coloured* This shall
you repeat so oft, till the vinegar will be coloured thou shalt destill it in a
limbecke in ashes. First the vinegar it self will run out, after this thou
shalt see a matter issue forth of a thousand couloures, and this is that
quint essence which is called of the Philosophers. Philosophers lead, and of
some virgins milk (it differs notwithstanding from it, whereof shall be
spoken here after, saith Vlstadius) it is almost like blessed oil in
colour. Put this in a Pelican to be circulated for the space of forty days.
It dries

Yea also quint essence is extracted and drawn out of lead or white lead
after the same manner as out of antimonio, pouringe destilled vinegar upon it,
that the vinegar be over it four fyngers deep: after let it be digested in
dung, as it is said of quint essence of herbs and flowers. quint essence of
lead: and it has in it a certain swietnesse like* as the oil of antimonii.
It is good against all burnynges with fire and hot water, as also against
itches, as ringewormes and choleric bladders.

But a manne must noote, that the white lead ought first to be washed often
with water until none of the powder of the white lead remain in it. Then when it
is dried, reserve it to your use. So doth Bulcasis Ioan of Sanct Amandus upon
the Andidotarie of Io. Mesuae, will to be done.

Of the drawing forth of quint essence out of diverse metals, as gold, silver,
lead tin, vitriol, or coproos, iron, coper, brimston, read orpment, yalow
ocker, antimonio and marcha^ta leaden, who so lists, let him read in Lullius
in his book of quint essence.

The spirit or quint essence of vitriol is commended of certain men against the
falling sickness, and Apoplexia or the benumninge of the senses. The spirit of
gold against the diseases of the liver. The spirit of ^irall against the stone
of the rains and bledder. But of these and certain other we shall speak
hereafter amongst oils of metals and otherwhere.

Of diverse kinds of Aqua composed.
VVAters of life composed are proprelye called, when as certain medicines are
stieped in the very Aqua vitae and destilled together, improperly when as they
are put to after not destilled together. There be also waters of virtue or
golden (as they cal the) when as the medicines stieptfirst not in Aqua vitae but
in wine, but of which we will write hereafter: those that we describe here:
saving that they are les vehement and les hot and dry.

Sum sorts of aqua vitae are commanded to be made simpely, putting the
medicines into y^ aqua vitae: other into aqua vitae thrys or four times
destilled. Sum there be also to whom a certain time of infusion or digestio
is prescribed, as. xiiii days. c. Sum are put in punned in the beginning*
other hoal, and broken after a certain days fermentacion and stieping. Sum are
destilled on Balneo Mariae: other in Balneo Mariae once ortwys thirdly in
ashes, as that which Vlsta. describes xlvi. chap. although there is nothing
else done but infusio in wine. In the same author.xliiii. chap. Aqua vitae is
described to be destilled thrys, the first water whereof is called Blessed, the
second Aqua vitae, the third, the mother of balm. Again the destillatio of
certain is repeated twys or thrys, that the water first destilled, be always
powered Vlstad. teaches in the.xlix. and.lvi. chap. Also sum are commanded to
be drawn out with a slow fire in Balneo Mariae. Other in the same with a
strong fire, as the the water described in Vlstadius. xlvi. chap. Many times in
the first destillacion, only fresh herbs, and fresh seeds are put with the
aqua vitae: and dry swiet smelling things, spices and other, also honey is
added after to the water drawn out of the herbs or seeds, and then are
camphora put unto it, thirdly, folding the limbeck every foot with moist
clothes with the whytes of eggs and bran together. Read Vlstad. li. chap.
and.lvi. Concerning the matter, none almost is composed without spices: unto
diverse also swiet smelling herbs are added: unto some, both the flowers and
the siedes, sumtymes also other destilled waters: Also malmsey, honey, sugar,
figes. To conclude, unto some hoale pieces of gold: I suppose it to be added in
vain except it be queshed Vlstadius described.xiiii. kinds of aqua vitae
composed, which we let pas because of brevity shortness. We read in Vlsta.
the.liii. chap. of aqua vitae, with spices and honey, c to be destilled in
Balneo Mariae, and an other likewise, but without honey, the.liiii. chap.

Vlstadius describes a certain marvelous aqua vitae in the.lvi. chap. First
he bids to digest diverse fresh and new medicines, in Balneo Mariae. xiii. aqua
vitae powered unto them: then to be destilled in ashes with a slow fire. After
he adds spices and other dry things: and bids digest the xiiii. days: and
destill them again in Balneo Mariae. Afterward he added camphoram, rhabarb,
safron, amber and mosch. If so be it (saith he) thou wilt have the water yet
better, put unto it certain precious and costly powders or spices of
confections made of amber, made of mosen, made of precious stones. c. and a
few ducats of the finest digest it three days in warm water of Balneo
Mariae, afterward destill it by a filtrum or list of woollen cloth in crooked
glases well clayed, so that the one glass stand higher then the other. And this
(saith he) is the most excellent Aqua vitae amongst all other.

An aqua vitae, which may be a remedy against the most part of diseases, put
rosemary, cinamo, geloflowers, ginger, and maces, and two or three pieces of
gold, (which will be never a whit the aqua vitae, four times destilled. Use
this water.iiii. times destilled, morning and evening before slepee. It drives
away divers kinds of diseases, and restores youth.

What aqua vitae can do, wherein rosemary is stieped, see hereafter where we
make mention of oil of rosemary.

Take three vnces of Dianthos made with sugar, put it in three pounds of wine,
three days, Filtrum. Sum destil it in a lymbeck, and keep it unto their use.
Sum mixed the third part of Rosatae nouellae, that they may assuage the heat
and dryth of the Dianthos.

Gentian, Melissa or balm, Betain wild Roses, sonchos or cicerbita, called
sowthistle, or gose thistle of the Dutch men, or blessed Balneo Mariae
accordingly, and mingle them with the best old Elseter wine, or rather
with.iiii. pounds of Aqua vitae. vi. times destilled, put them in a strong
cucurbita of glass, that will hold.iiii. good ale quarts, which thou shalt
clay well and let it stand in Balneo Mariae. iiii. days. Afterward, then
thou shalt of perles into powder, as men do limb, grind them upon marble
diligently, till thou can feel no roughnes in the powder. Put this powder into
some vessel, and make it with Rose water into a liquor, what so ever remains
sharp or rough, which is not mixed with the water, grind it again, and wash it
the second time. A man may resolve the corals into water when they are once
pund or ground, setting them in the juice of Berberies, which way is better the
the other. After this beat paeony the herbs thou shalt cut. Afterward put the
herbs, rotes, and precious stones moystened and made liquid with the Rose
water, into a strong glasen cucurbita, that will hold six great ale quarts,
there about I ges.vi. Dutche mooses to be, which I think he means by
Mesuras,) and pour upon them the Aqua vitae which is dygested with the
destylled liquors in Balneo Mariae, and when the cucurbita is defended closed
cucurbita stand for a month, then take the dung away by little and litile: and
the matter which it contains to be destilled, thou shalt destribute
cucurbitas, and destil them, in Balneo Mariae, with so slow a fire, that from
the falling of one drop, till the falling of an other, thou maiste tell one.ii.
iii.iiii. till thou come at ten. For thou must in any wise, take heed that the
bath be not to hot, when the destillacion is once ended, stur the dregs that be
left in every one of the cucurbitas with a stick moderatlye, and pour the
water that is drawn out of them in again, and destill them again with a slow
fire as before. When this destillacion is once ended, pour out all the dregs,
cucurbits, into.ii. cucurbits, of.iii. great ale quarts a piece, and destill
them in Balneo Marie gentlelye. So hast thou a treasure and an incomparable
remedy against the pestilence. The use thereof is both to preserve, and also
to cure provoking a sweet after the drinking thereof. So soon as any manne
perceives him self enfected with the pestilence (so that it be within
xxiiii. hours that it enfecteth him, for after that time there is no

After removing the clothes by little and little, and wiping the body, when the
sick is risen, let him eat sodden Barlye, or a little meal of Oats broiled,
mixte with Vinegar and Rose water or Vinegar only, which shall be mixed always
with his meat also for the space of a sennyghte. For his drink he shall take
a decoction of Barlye with raisons and Licoris, when it is well couled, let him
dryncke as much thereof as he list. Let him abstein from wine.iii. or.iiii.
days: after let sambucus, Eldar, or Acetosa. And if so authrax or bubo do rise
as it chances often times, then thou shalt use these medicines. Cut an Onion
on the one side, make it hollow and put triacle into it, tormentil, Dictamni
diligently broken and punde, in equal parts, and put the cap that you cut
of the Onion on again, fold it in moist tow, then roast it under the ashes
by the space of.vi. hours, then punne it in a mortar, and wrynge it through a
lynnen clothe, putting

then lay the moist cloth to the place, and as oft as it dries, moysten it
again. If a man drink, once a month, half an uncle of this liquor and sweat
upon it, he shall be preserved. It is very good also, if a man hold a drop or
two thereof every day in his mouth in the morning.

Vlstadius in the.xlvi. chap. describes an other aqua vitae commended both for
the pestilence and for other diseases.

An aqua vitae or quint essence, whose effect is ready Matthaeolus Senensis, in
his sixth book of his commentaries upon Dioscorides. A pound of our antidotu
now described, (the description whereof we let pas for briefnes sake: a man may
use good triacle in the place of it, or Mithridatu, or an other effectual
antidotum) and a pound of syrup of the barks of citron, mixed them with five
pounds of aqua vitae so oft destilled, till it cum to quint essence, and put
cucurbita of glass as big again as the things do occupy, (that is of.xiiii.
pounds,) and when it is well clayed move it moderately softly so long till the
antidotus be holly resolved mixed with the liquor. So let it stand a month,
moving and chafing it in like manner twys a wieke. The month being ended power
out softly by little and little the clear water which is ascended above the
antidotus which is sattled in the bottom, into an other vessel of glass, and
reseruith very well closed. proved by innumerable tryales, that if half an
uncle thereof be drunken with wine, or with any convenient water destilled, or else
alone, it restores a man infected with the bytyng or stinging of any beast
althoug he have lost both his voice and his senses, and calls him again to
the great wondering of all mem. For the most part also the humours now
infected are avoided by vomit. The same virtue hath it against poisons which a
ma hath received in meats or drinks. For ye strength Mattheolus.

Aqua vitae for the diseases of the colike. Take a great ale quart of aqua
vitae rectified, put therein half an uncle of cinnamon.ii. or.iii. nutmegs,

Aqua vitae devised by George Alapide. Take cinnamon cubebarum, ginger,
nutmegs, cloves, galangal, of every one an ounce, fresh sage.iiii. vnces,
wyn that is sublimated six times, made of the best of the wine, not of the
lies, as much in weight as all the rest, that is.x. vnces. Take so as a
filberd nut will hold. They say that M. Gallus the physician of the Emperor
Charles used this, and lived. Cxxiiii. years.

A most noble water of virtues, worthy to be preferred before silver and
gold, out of a certain written book. Cloves, cinnamon, maces, galagal,

space of.xiiii. days, then dreyn the wyn out, and grynde the spices, then
mixed again with wine, and let them stand.viii. days: then destyll them, and
at length cast in a few sage leaves fresh.

They asscribe the same virtues every one unto it which we mentioned before in

A certain kind of aqua vitae is commended in a certain book written against
the leper and pestilence: in the composition whereof Fumetetrae, the les netle,
the leaves of bedegnar, let them be stieped in wine in Balneo Mariae, a
month: then let them be destilled, casting into them also a dram

Afterward put to destilled wyn decocted and sodden with pepper, that there may
be equal porcions of both liquors, which joined together, and stieped eight
days together in Balneo Mariae, must be destilled again. He wills a
sponefull of this water to be drunk every day for the space of a month, and
the leprous places to be anointed therewith. They say it purges blood
dissolveth the congeled blood, and changes the whole temperature of the body:
and if a ma may believe it, it cures

Two compositions of Aqua vite out of the book of Raimundus Lullus, of
waters.
IN the composed waters of life following, although Raymundus do not express
whether wine or burning water ought to be put to the medicines, that they my be
destilled together, yet we have thought good to rehers them in this place,
because Raimundus seems utterly to will these medicines to be destilled in
burning water, the in wine, as one that rusci, maidenheare, sperage, Rapes,
parsellye, eryngii, mill of the sun, scariolae, of every one like much mixed
them and destill them with a slow fire. (It appears that this liquor is good
to provoke urine, and against the stone.) An other.

Take cloves, Nutmegs, mastik, doronicum, zedoaria, galingal, long pepper, ye
bark of citron, sage sambucus that is elder (perauenture it should be
samsuchus, that is Maioram) dill, spiknard. Wood of Aloes, cubebe, cardamonuum,
Lauendula, Mint Peniroyal, organy, calamus aromaticus, both kinds of sticas,
germander, chamepytis, of every one like much, and a little musk. Pun them and
destil them. The virtues be all one with simple Aquavite, but far more
effectual. Or the same that are attributed before to other waters of life
composed of many medicines. Then follows a water composed of many cold
medicines, not in his place (as it seems) which I made mention of before quint
essence. Afterward is placed a most perfect Aqua vite (as he calls it, that
is, because it is composed of very many things, and that most hot.) Take
Euphorbium, Serapinu, opopanax, pyretrum, Capers, squinanthum, spodium,
bdellium, long pepper, and white or black, cubebe, castoreum, zedoaria, of
every one equal portions, to the which thou shalt put good Mastick, and a
little Amber, Saffron, and of the bone of a hearts hart. Also take all the
things aforsaide in Aqua vite, in so much that I suppose the book to be
corrupted by the fault of the Printer.

What medicines be mixed with Aqua vitae, without any destillation, first
within the body, then without.
MAny times instruments, time or cost fails a man, that those medicines,
whose strength he wold have in his aqua vitae (as though it were by a certain
metempsy chosin, y^ is a transposinge of the souls or principal virtues) he
can not mixed them with it by destilation, which only way is in those bodies
that are called met^ora, that is things bred on hy in the firmamet, moreover
in many other things mixed ether by nature or by art, is easy to be
understanded. But for so much as in so diverse states of men, sum for one
hindrance, sum for an other, they can not always follow that which is best,
if quint essence can not be made, at the least the second or the third, or as
many as may be: let the destillacions be repeated with a slow fire. for any
mixture is done better by little aqua vitae, the medicines whose strength he
desires to mixed with it: yet at the least wise let them be broken and stiept a
while in it: for it draws unto it the virtues of all things that are put in
it. There is a book of Arnoldes de villa nova, or rather of Rogerius, which I
have written, where in is declared particularly, to what diseases and
sicknesses, what medicines ought to be put to sooke aqua vitae, for every part
of the body, which he doth attribute to the twelve signs of ye zodiak.

It is well known in many ages hitherto, that gentian is the best preservative
against certain most grievous diseases and poisons: but sum use to power the
powder of the same with burning water, as much more effectual, into the
throotes of beasts, whom they know or think to be hurt with poison in
their meet or drink, or else by biting or stinging: and if gentian can not be
gotten, certain sicknesses of man, specially of the bulk or breast apomeli may
be put. for both certain men cout it otherwise for dainty, to have apomeli mixed
with burning water, also a toost of breed mixed therewith, many take for a
breekfast. A ma may also against diverse sicknessess, give men to drink the
water of gentia artificially destilled with wyn, mixed after with apomeli or
swiet hypocras.

Wormwood wyn most excellent, sum make on this wise, they power to the leaves

moor) assuaged.

Sum put into burning water, mint cut beaten, and set it in the sun four days
or five, then

Hereafter will I put the use of burning water, with other medicines without
the body.
Many mixed a little burning water with hoot oynmentes, as Martiatum, Arragon,
dialthaea, at such time as they should use them, and will them so to be
anointed upon the griefs.

A water that norysheth and restores the heat of the brayn, wherewith the head
is to be rubbed. Two vnces of aqua vite, Moschocarium, Cloves maioram, cubebe,
long pepper, of every one half a dram. When they are pound mixed them, and rub
them upon the head a certain space. Sum put to it a scruple of euphorbium,
Epiphanius a practicioner: other put to other smelling and hoot things, as
sage six vncees: few, ginger, grains of paradys, cinnamum, flowers ot
rosemary, the bark of de bay: a dram of spik: a dram and a half of castoreum.
And in a destilled liquor they hang mosch amber of ether of the a grain. This
they say is good to annoynt the head, and also with the smell it puts away
the palsy, and apoplexia.

A marvelous water of the same man, for the impostumes or botches of the
privy members. Three yolks of eggs hard roasted and cut small, pun them in a

In the disease called the French pockes, sometimes the jaws and throat are
eaten with evil destillacios, which onles a man find remeadye for,
oftentimes the gargil is wasted, oftentimes the corruption passes to the very
bones. Therefore a man must purge them, and turn them aside. c. There is a
marvelous water made for Aqua vitae and vinegar in a limbeck a most clear
water issues out of many virtues, but chiefly it helps where the strength of
the medicine ought to be conducted sowhat diep, if therefore thou dissolve in
it bole armoniak or sphragida, and touche the parts that be freten, thou shalt
both kill the cause of that contagion, heal al the freting, Fracastorius, in
his.iii. book of contagions.

Of destilled vvaters composed, but with other, then with Aqua vitae.
SVche waters as are destilled of two or mooe medicines mixte together, I call
them composed. Of this sort some are used for medicine, some for smelling,
some are invented for garnishinge, trymmynge and deckynge. There be some that
will do two of these or all. Notwithstanding we will refer every one to one
kind, that is, wherein it excells most. Again, of them that be used in
medicine, some are received into the body, other some are minystred only
without other some both ways. We will make only two Chapters, for all
though some be used both ways, yet they are moore used other within and
without. Again, of them that be received into the body, some are moore
simple, Aqua vitae composed, where the spices are sooked in pure and only Aqua
vitae, we have written severally by them selves. Hear will we put the other
(as I said,) and those which they call waters of caponum, and one with certain
medicines put into swines blood.

To be sooked in wine and after to be destylled, it seems to be ordained,
chieflye for those Melissa called Balm, Wormewode. c. which more over by that
means, do retain more firmly their own savour, the wine drawing it and
drinking it up, that it canne not dispersed for the thinness, we shall speak
hear of certain things to be stieped in wine, but while they be new, for
we have entreated of.iiii. dry things stieped in wine other liquor, and so
destylled.

Betany, commonly called betany, and in dutch eerenbrey, is stiept in wine a
few days, likewise melissa. They shall have the same virtues strengthes, but
more effectually and more subtle, then the herbs by them selves alone.

Melissa, that is citraria (saith Lullus) let it be put in wine to be
destilled. Let a man drink a sponefull of this wine fasting. It sharpneth the
understanding and the wit, increases the memory. To a man that stutteth* lay a
linen cloth wet in this wine upon his tongue and he shall speak right, It is
most profitable against scabbednes cumming of could. It sharpens ye sight of
him that drinks it. It takes away duskishnes, tears of and superfluous
humours of the eyes. It is wholesome for the breast, profitable for cocoction
against evil humours that lets it. Drunken with good wine, it stireth the
appetyt. It puts away spots and frakenes of the face that is washed therewith,
if so be it a little baulm be put to it then the face washed tnerwith, it makes
also good colour. It Lazarus from increasing. It is good also for them whose
brain is perished, and for the frantik. Lullus. Melissa beaten is stieptin wine
a night. Men say this water destilled and drunk every day and holden in the
mouth, it cures the benumbing of the senses: all so the falling sickness, the
dropsy, the quartain ague, and other diverse diseases of black choler or fleume.
It is ministered also to the strangleng of the womb, and toth ache, Remaclus.

A water of the les centory, worthy to be compa red unto gold.

Take one part of gentian, two parts of cetory: when they are pund and sookt
in wine five days destill them. This water drunk morning and evening
preserves the body from all kinds of diseases. It puts away all
impostumes: it makes good colour: It resists the pestilence, it heleth the
sick of the phthisik, it avoids the stuffed stomach: it breaks the stone in
the reins, it separateth and puts away the watery humours of Lulli{us} in
his book of waters. Certain at this day stiep dry routs of getian in wyn,
destil a most effecual water therout.

The sage and penroyall of ether like much, castorium, as oft as a ma drinks
it, so many days it prolongs his life until the time ordained of God.
Nether is it possible for any man to be so greatly couled, but if he drink it
with castoriu nyn days, he shall be perfectly made whole. Drunken fasting, it
removes the disease of the belly, all gutta, scabbidnes, it makes good blood
the best colour in the face: It is profitable Aegidius.

A water of juniper beries stiept in wyn while they be new, is destilled. I

But the routes of any herb a man will, which are used in physic or may be
used: if they be cut small and stiept a certain days in wine, they yield a
water of the same virtue force, but more pure

Gualterus Riffius rehearses the routes that be Angelica (which sum think to
be our Alexanders) that is sown, and the other that is called water angelica,
arum, hollow aristolochia, as they call it comunly in Germany, asaru or

Piony, Parsnippes, Petasita, Pencedanum, Pimpernel, or rater Saxifrage,
Polygonato, Pyretru, rubia or rubea, satyricu, Scrofularia the bigger,
Symphytum the bigger, Valerian. Here while he asscribeth to every one his
virtues, he makes a whole book. When as notwithstanding he brings none other
virtues then such as be attributed to the medicines them selves alone, and
that before destillacion, which if he had touched with one word at the
beginning, it had been sufficient. And truly I marvel, seeing he wryt forth his
books with such earnestness, and endeavoured by all means, to augment his

The wyld radyshe, which communly they call the byggar, cut small and stiept
in wine a certain days, I wold think it would give an effectual stilled

The rout of Pyretrum fresh (or also dry) beaten and stiept in wine is
destilled, or also for touthe ache and to cause one vomit up fleume, in vinegar
Riffius teaches.

A profitable water against rottennes of the teeth. Mixte the rotes of
Pyretrum beaten small, with the best wine ye may get, and make a mixture that
may be like to Aqua vitae composed. When ye will use it, taste a sponefull
(hold it in your mouth) in the morning or when ye will, for ye shall
perceive remeady shortly. It heals weke ties, corrupted, hollow: it pourgeth
also and clears them. It is good also for the putting away of all kind of
rottennes or vnclennes, to avoid

A water against the falling sickness, whereof ii. or.iii. sponefull ought to
be given in the very fit, communicated unto me very lately of a friend. The

Of vvaters of virtues or golden waters and certain other composed of many
medicines, destilled with wine.
WAters of virtues, which the Germans name golden, all are destilled with
spices and odoriferous herbs (specially sage, which seems to be a foundation
in these waters composed) put first a few days into wine: they are in more
use to be ministered Balneo Mariae, in the sun, in chaf or chopped straw in lime
whereunto rain water must be sprinkled in a bottle.

Waters of virtue. Guatlerius Ryffius in his book of destillacions, describes
very many

And a manne may in these also gather four kinds of waters differynge in
virtue, of the which I would most chiefly allow the middle. For this is truth,
Aqua vitae comes out out more pure at the beginning of the destillacio,
about the last end, it runs somewhat watery. Of spices and gummes, the parts
that are more moistened ascend first, the hotter and the drier follow, which eve
the colour coming nie more and more unto red declares. Moreover they smell of
brentnes, and in taste they are les swiet pleasant. But without the body they are
ministered effectually. c. But a.iii. kinds of water is gathered better of dry
spices and medicines only rectified, not

With waters of virtues, some also mixte well smelling sedes, provoking vrin,

let him drink this: if any lean man desire to be in better plyte, let him
drink it with sugar.

thou shalt kiep it in a glass diligently closed nyne days (otherwise.xl.)
Afterward let it be given in drink every day in the morning before day (other
wise, by the space of.x. days) to the sick fasting. It is proffitable against
the falling sickness if he that takes it continue fasting after it six hours.
And truly it is a most effectual remedy. It heeleth al resolution of the
sinews, and the members are Castorium, it is good against all goutes, which
hath not taken rout yet in the members. If it be drunk ix. days together
fasting, it puts away all manner of agues, what matter soever it cum of (if it
be drunk.ix. days every morning early. This water is also most profitable to
wash woudes in which the sinues are cut.)

conseruatiue water, (that is destilled of persely) and destill it. This is the
chiefest remedy for the cough and breast ill at eas. If a man drink it could
fasting, and in the evening as hoot as he can. If it be drunken hoot with
Castorio, it is good against the disease called Apoplexia, it heals also the
mebers sick of the Palsy, if so be the Palsy be not it chereth all the
members, it drives away il humours, and strengthens the heed and the brain.

An other, the six in number amongst Aegidius waters. Gladiolus Hyssop, Sauin,
Sothernwood, (otherwys the sied of Sothernwood, leaving out Sauin, I like it
not) of every one like much, beat them together, and let it stand a certain
days, the destill it. This water is of greet strength. It with stands all
agues both hoot and cold. It provokes women's flowers if it be drunk thrys, but
it is Castorio, it heeleth the palsy (if it be drunk daily very hoot)
within.iii. days. The same descriptio find I in the book of Lullus of waters.

THey also are to be called composed waters, that wine, burning water or other
liquor. Certain copositions of spices to restore the strengtes of the hart and
the spirits, are mixed with waters of capons, dressed by destillations as I said
before: also with burning waters, or rather Quint essence of wine, against the
pestilence and poisons, as we declared before. But also purging medicines,
Electuaria chiefly in the which Dacry dium and other vehement things hurtful
to the stomach are received, mixed with the liquors, specially with burning
Lullius also praises greetly, and certain practicioners of any acquaintance
have used it with praise. I know Hamech, that which is of ye juice of Roses,
and gave to drink unto the weeker sort the liquor that he received by it
self: to them that were stronger, he myxt sum of the elctuary with it: and so
he said he purged sick men without any grief.

With Helleborum is a water made, that restores youth: such one saw I my

Gold Potable or that may be droken.
OF potable gold, who so list he may read much in the book of Vlstadius which
he names the heaven of philosophers: in the book of Lullus of quint essence.
That there is virtue in gold, which comes of it made hot and quenched in
water, that may be an argument, that the water wherein a wedge of iron or
gold is slekt, is commended of Nicander Aconitum: for it seems to be
understanded of water, wherein these mettalles should be quenched, when as he
names none other liquor. Quench (saith he) red hat iron or the dros of iron,
or red hot gold or silver dip it in a troubled potion or drink. Where the
expositer saith: Quensh iron in water and drink it, and a little after: quench
the dros of iron in honey drink the intinction, so calling the liquor wherein
any any thing is quenched. Dioscorides bids to quech Auicenna also hath, and
Aegineta, and also Aetius, who saith that a miln stone so slekt is holsom, and
that the wine should be drunk hot) with these words: and the dros of iron,
or iron it self or gold, or silver red hot queched in wine, if yt liquor be
drunk. And trueli it seems that wine is more apt to receive ye virtue of gold,
then water. When as I on a time tasted water, wherein gold was often quenched,
I could perceive no quality of the savor or the taste to be altered in it.
Again, it brought unto quint essece doth draw more strength of the gold the
wine: the more if the gold be beaten into most thin plaits, most of all if it
be beat into powder. But the oil that coms of gold shall pas al these. As for
gold simplely sod, as in ye broth of capos, there is no strength in it all,
except a mas opinion cado any thing, as I believe withal learned men for the
most part. Of the virtues of gold, rede Auicenna in his second book. 78. cha.
But because ye purest is to be chose for medicines, I will Plinies words out of
his. 33. book a bout thend of the.iiii. chap. of ye purging of gould. Let gold
be roasted broiled with thrice as much in weight of the clots or lups of salt:
and again with.ii. procions of salt one of the stonecalled schiston: so it
yields his strength to the things burnt with it in an earthen vessel, it self
remaining pure uncorrupted. I conjecture yt Plini in this place did mistake
schistu the stone, for schistu an alu: for in an other place (the. 35. book.
15. cha.) he writes schistum, yea and the reason taken of the virtues, makes
more for Alum: for he saith gold is purged with salt only and schistu^ put unto
it: but Alum has more like effect unto salt then the stone Schistos,
whereunto the old writers ascribe none other virtue, but yt which it hath comun
with the Haematit (of which kind it is) that is to stop blood. But Alum is taken
and used in the purging of metals: also Aqua Forti (as they call it.)
Notwithstanding Plini may be excused, because the word stoone is more common
and of larger signification with him for he names both quick silver and many
other metally things, stones, wherefore he might call the Alum Schiston by the
name of Schiston. Albeit he should not have so done, for the difference of
that which is proprely called a stone Schistus. In the same place of Plini,
after the words now rehearsed is put: The rest of the ashes (that is to say, of
the salt, with the which being burnt together, ye gold Schistum) kept in an
earthen pot, and tempered with water, anointed upon the face, it heals the
disease beginning in the chin called Lichenes, or like foul breakings out:
which shall be conveniently washed away with Bean meal. It heals also
Fistulaes, and they that be called Hemorods. If so be it when it is beaten
Spuma be put to it, it amends corrupt and stinking biles and sores. Decocted
with honey and Melanthio, and anointed M. Varro saith it heals wartes. Here
in the first words, the ashes kept and anointed no man can dout, but he
speaks of ashes: but that which follows of decoction and anointing, seem to
be long to the gould it self. But in my indgemente, ought to be red so that
those words decocted and anointed be referred unto the ashes, as both the
consequency of the text, also the manner of the medicines do require. For salt is
used of phisicios (Diascordes other) against Lichenes, ringworms itches, against
al manner of vucums, red inflamacions, tetters: and broiled or parched with
honey, against running cankers. c. The men of our country rub children warts
with salt and soute. And alum, as Plini saith, asswageth rotten sores and
biles, with fat: the fretting cankers of biles with vinegar or burnt with as
much in weight of gals, with.ii. parts of salt (in which manner of proportion
also it is mixed for to purge gold) the diseases that sprede abroad. Moreover by
the name of Spuma which signifies some. Plini vnderstadeth Halosachne, as also
the. 31. of ye. 7. I find nothing noted by Hermolans or Gelenius upon this
place. But as gold is purged with alum, so is also Misy, as the same Plini
witnesses. 34. 12. bi an other means, with quick silver, rede Plini. 33. 6. That
it may be purged, it is sod with lead: the same. 33. 3. An other way to pourge
the same, Cardanus describes in his.vi. book of subtilty.

liquor represses the swelling of the eye lids of a cold cause: it dries up
the blearednes: it stops the flowing of tears: it clears the sight:
breaks bleamishes or spots (I suppose he means corns or Pearls.) If
thou wilt have it stronger to break spots or perls, ad unto it Gallitricum,

The Powder of the Flower Deluce, mixte with hot water, makes it to smell,
and is used of Barbers. The Flowers of Lauendula or Lavender, and much rather
of that which is communly called Spick, both grien and dry are put into
water, or wyn, or burning water in a vessel well stopped set in the sun, that they
may infect it with their smell. But if they be yet fresh moist, they turn the
wyn almost into vynegar, which if they be dry they do not so. The liquor
shall be made the more smelling if the flowers be dried in the sun in a glass
closed, and afterward whyt wine be put to it. If so be it a man desyer to have

Wash the face therewith twyse a day.

A very good water of the same mans for the same use. Take flowers of Beenes,
bitter Almodes, the leeues of Peeche trees, of every one.iii. vnces, Gootes

wherewith let the face be washed.

An other to make ye apple of the chieck ruddy (ye like also we described
before.) Take Alum Brasill, the grains wherewith the Peeche is made reed, let
them ve pund with the water of wine destilled. Therewith let the place be very
much anointed, which ye list to make reed. If so be it ye ad a little water
of salt Ammoniack destilled, the colour should be the faster and abide the

Howe waters of herbs, flowers, and rotes be destilled by descencion, that is
downward.

A vvaye to destill svviete vvaters, and effectual, out of Flowers and
Herbs by descencion or going downward.
TAke an earthen vessel, upon the which strain or spread a thin and fine
linen cloth and upon it sprynckle Rooses, (for so the Roosecake will prove
marvelous swiet) or coueslops, or other Flowers or Herbs. Then must ye have
Cardanus.

Fresh Rooses laid upon a linen cloth strained upon a Basin, if they take a
vessel full of hoate coals, they destyll much water and swiet Syluius. In my
mind this kind of destillacion is commodious for all such things as be
cold, or ought to coule, chieflye if they lack smell, as the most part of
binding things: more also, such as be cold moist to. Yea also we shall have
much water in shorter time, with les cost by this way, nether is there any
ieoperdy that they should fume out. But a man must give diligent heed least
the vessel laid upon be to little hot, least the water taste of burning.

If.ii. vrinals be set together, the upper full of Roses and set in the sun

the bottom, covered above well closed with clay. The bottom of this pot is put
into another, put under it in a pit of the earth, and the joining of the pots
is compassed with clay cloos. Then make they a fire about the upper part of the
pot by the space of one night (.x. hours or more. So the water runs in to
the nether pot, which mixed with meel or breed, it kills mys quickly that
taste of it: the sooner if thou mixed a little Litharge or whyt Lead. Bulcasis in
his Syluius out of him.

Sumtimes certain waters and oils are made by descencion, like as of Roseny
tries when they are burnt pitch. Syluius. But of Oils which are made by
descention we will speeke hereafter. Certain are made by a middle way between a
dissention and ascention, as Oyll of Coperos, by a Cucurbita laid along
overthwart upon the side.

Destillation in Ashes, or Sand
IN Ashes are both waters and oils destilled. Waters with a most gentle
soft heet, which thou shalt discern by touching with thy hand both the ashes
and also the vessels of destillacion. And perauenture there is no difference,
for the destillacion of any kind of waters, in Balneo Mariae or in Ashes, if
so be it thou observe the measure of ye fire. For Balneo Mariae, the water that
ye stillatory is put in, may be scalding hoot: the ashes may not be to hoot,
that is when herbs, roots, flowers or any liquors are destilled to derive a
water of the. Men think them to be made so much the swieter les smelling of
any fyrines and brenning, being destilled in such ashes because the thing is
done more softly and with more leysur, so that the heed or lid be not hoot,
and sumtymes between the falling of the drops, a ma may tel swiftly till he cum
at fifty. But the Oils have nied of a gretter fire Quintessence.

The destillacion by ashes is easy and ready, if an earthen or brazen vessel,
diep enough, and able to receive the Cucurbita or body of the still, be filled
with fine ashes and sifted or fined sand, so full of every side is sufficient
to be one foot long, the height six fingars or there about. All this shall
we strengthen every where with clay (and pieces of shells mixed together) that
the heet may the better be kept in.ii. breething hooles left in the corners.
But this manner is for upon a soden and only miet for one vessel. I bielded once
a more laborious fornace on this sort. In a corner of the house I raised a
foundation of brick and lyme, a foot and a halfhy. Upon the foundacio or
harth,

This round place above the plait was filled with ashes, in ye ashes round about
was there set about five stills of glass, that at one time and with one fire
many waters or Oils might be destilled together. Round about the fornace was
well fensed with wrought clay with very salt water, wherewith sum Horse
dounge was myxt.

This kind of fornace is surely very comodious, because it niedeth little fire,
which also it self in this form endures very long: that it is almost
enough to see to the fire morning and evening. But it must be made only of
cools, which are put in to the fornace with a little fire shovel, only that
they may be gotten in at the little door hansumly: the edges of this fire shouel
must be a little turned up, that it may hold the cools ye better. There is nied
also of long iron fyershouel (as the fornace shall require) turned in at the end
according to a streigth corner, and there in the end to be somewhat made brother,
wherewith the cools within may be Gentian, Juniper beries, and Aqua vitae is
sumtimes repeated, in which I have observed this, that the better part always
the purest issues out first, what so ever is flegmatyck (or deed water, as sum
cal it, which is vnproffitable, hurtful, and almost stinking) follows last:
which is well perceived and known in a glass heed for the still: For while the
purer matter, that is, the fyry and aerie substance issues, no fleume comes
once, and tokens of the water following by straikes appear manifestly, as ye
see them, remove the receiving vessel, and what so ever remains in the
Cucurbita or belly of the still, pour it out as good for nothing: and begin a
new destillation of fresh and that must be repeated, until no fleume appear any
more, which chaunseth lightly in the fourth or fifth destillation. Afterward
there needs no more destillation, but circulacion, that the liquor be
rectified, as they term quint essence.

Things destilled in the vapour of hot water, retain more perfectly the virtues
and qualities of of plants, but because they have some corruption in them, they
can not be kept long. Those things longar which by the heat of ashes or dros
of metal beaten to powder are destilled in vessels of stone or glass, how many
so ever they be, upon a long or round fornace covered with slates or tiles
which may hold the hie sands compassed with Syluius.

Vlstadius prescribes a certain destillation in ashes with so soft a fire,
that thou maiste number one.ii. iii. between one drop and an other.

Any kind of fruit thou wilt, when it is well ripe cut small and beaten,
thou shalt destill it in sand with a slow fire. Vlstadius.

A certain way to make water by and by.

WAter is made also vppn a sudden, whiles the juice is made hot or scalding, a
glasen cup is set upon it, in the which the fume passes into drops: and the
drops gathered thereupon are driven together into water. By this means
Vinegar is easily turned into water. This is wholesome for spots and
blemishes in the eyes, and for the web, to put them away: specially if Rue be
sod in white Vinegar. Cardanus.

Some are put resinam larigenam in a trene vessel, whose bottom must be made
by a tornar as thin as is possible, so that a man may see through it, so in a
hot place the purer part and the thinner destilleth.

Of rosaries, that is to say instruments wherewith a destilled liquor may be
gotten out of Roses and other medicines, fire being put under (for the most
part without any
FIre in destillacion doth more procure the savour of adustion and brentnesse
unto the water that is to be destilled, then do cools or water, which thing
to avoid put sand in the pan in commun Rosaries: or rather see that sand be
betwixt the fire and the pan, and also about the pan, and that pan: for
it is made also of brass. The joining together of the pan and the lembecke
thou shalt fense with clay, that is to say with a lynnen clout perieted or
closed with clay and hansumlye laid about it: and the receiving vessel with
the nose of the lembecke likewise. Brunsvvick. Some now a days make these
Rosarie pans of bras, and upon the sand they lay the herbs that be to be
destilled: and round about the pan (and within it also except I be deceived)
they fill a void space Balneo Mariae, or in ashes.

Vinegar is made white with destillation, as well for other uses of Chymistes
and Phisycions, as also to be mixte with Sirrupe of Vinnegar, Bulcasis words.
Build an Atanor like unto that wherein Roosewater is destylled, and ever take
a stillatorye vessel of glass or of earth glased: fill three parts of it
with good Vinegar, that the fourth part of the Vessel above may be empty,
least when it doothe seethe the Vinegar be spilt and run over. Then cover
the vessel with some Vessel upon it, as ye know, having a noose, as the
manner is in rosewater, and make a the Vinegar shall not become so white. The
vinegar that is destilled must be of white wine, and very sharpe. So shalt
thou gather a white and pure liquor, which thou shalt keep in store. After y^
same manner may wine be destilled. This writes Bulcasis. I destilled it once in
glasen vessels in ashes, which I keep yet hitherto certain years, like to
Vinegar not destilled both in savour and taste, differing only in the colour
and substance, where in it is like to pure water to see Bulcasis seems to be
of this opinion, that vinegar should be destilled with fire or water, not in a
Balneo Mariae, but in that manner that he makes the first and second in
destillinge of Rooses, that is, without water with fire of wood or rather of
cools. I have destilled very excellently in ashes. Pearls, eg shells, stone
of the rains and bladder are dissolved with strong vinegar, specially when it is
destilled or with the juice of limos: so is also both kind of corals, and they
afterward praecipitatum and sublimatum and cinabrium, and they return into
quick silver. Syluius. The Chymistes say metals are resolved with vinegar
destilled: also with mans urine destilled.

The leaves of hemp turned into meal, because they pearse the head, make
drink which will make a man pleasantly drounke. Cardan. It seems water
should be poured to it, and when they are made dow together, then to be
Rosestil, or like instrument where the fire is put under without any men, and
perauentur the destillacion should be twys or thrys repeated. I wold say the
same of Ootes water, whereof likewise Cardanus writes: The Moscouites (saith
he) because they lack wyn, use water destilled of Ootes which enflames and
makes a man drunken no les then wine. For Ootes being of a more gros substance,
it must niedes when it is destilled make hoot, becum more subtle and sharp,
and draweny

The like may be done of any drink that makes drunken, as Ale, Bier, Curmus
and Meed, specially when it is old, and that which is sod with Mill.

Honey while it is a destilling is wont to rise up and run over, when it is made
hoot. But this is avoided, when a man destilleth in a comun Rosestill, by
putting upon it within the pan a wooden sieve (made with horse hear) so that it
touch the honey. Cucurbita or body of glass, mixed with it pure and well washed
sand, make a slow fire. The first water is cast away, but the second is kept
which hath a golden colour, and a little before the end reed. The use of this
water is for women to their hear, that they may grow, be soft and yelow being
moystened therewith specially in the sun. It amends the shedding of the hear.
It heeleth swelled and blered eyes, and puts away their watery cootes and
their duskishnes: and full of wheales. It heeleth notably the places that be
burned, specially them that be soft and ten der, so that no skar or blemish
shall remain. The latter water that is redish, purges corrupt mattier in roten
boils, if they be washed therewith, and lynnen clothes moystened therein be
laid upon them, and when it hath purged them, it raises the flesh also.

Syluius.

An oily nature seems to be in al mixed things or copounded by nature
whatsoever they be, when as it is in salt also the most dry body that may be, as
Cardanus writes. (There is also in salt a fatness, which we may maruaill at,
Plin.) but in sum more, in sum les. For it is an oily and fat humour that is in
mixed things, not that watery and ea^y to be dried, but an aerie which also is
hoot. Boeth kind of elements have the moisture in the that belongs to their
kind. This liquor in certain Griekes call them opus: teeres, gumes, rosins,
Elaeomel: but also in deed bodies, as in fat metally things, brimston, quick
silver, also in diverse kinds of pitch, Naphtha, aumber, ambra, P^r^l^on,
which hath his name because it flows runnethout of stones. But most
manifestly in beests, both by other parts of the, also chiely ye fat marow,
blud in the yt have no blud, sum fat humour of ye natur of blud. in the massy
parts both of beestes and plants, in all such chiefly siemeth it to be
which have thriedes or veins manifestly, by the which they draw
nourishemet. For unto nourishment swiet things are most of all ordained,
which by a moderat heet are turned easily into a fatness, ye y^ very fat
things them self are somewhat swiet. And the abundance of fat juice is tried
found most in those things which are nourished with many swiet things.
Notwithstanding fat things Gnaiacum because it sinks in water, abounds
therewith. Thinner and lighter woods convert and turn the fat juice in to Gum
or Rosyn, wherefore they have les plenty thereof: such as be Gnaiacum, the
walnut try, the Ash.

Moreover the very ashes show that Oyll is in all woods: for the ashes of
every one have their fatness, which it leeueth in lie. So durable is the aerie
fatness and yet more the fyery, as when earth is burned, the water goes out in
vapours, the other remain, part in the ashes, part in the Sout: although in
both those also sum substance of earth remains. But this things perteine to
Philosophers.

How oil must be dravvn out of spices, as Cloves, Nutmegs, Saffron, Mace,
and other.
MOysting mesurably in Aqua vitae rectified circulated, any kind of spice what
ye will beaten and broken somewhat gross, and when they are stiept together, at
the last destil them with a very slow fire. And when as the Aqua vitae once
drawn out clean, the oil begins to still, the cucutbita and put it in a
little bag well knit and tied with a thread: in a pres for ye purpose pres it out,
both ye iron plates of the pres well made hot first. The oil pressed out so
must ye destil, rectify and circulate: that the pure oil may be separated
from the grosser matter. The dregs afterward may be digested or putrified again
with the Aqua vitae first separated from them (and be destilled again.) And
this waisemeth to be the most commodious and most Ryffius: but we have
traslated it as well as we might, somewhat darker then it should be.

Howe oil is drawn out of vvodes and other like, as Cloves by destillacion
out of Cardan.
THe things beaten are put in a vessel of glass A. are destilled with as easy
a fire as may water put round about the Vessel, it shall be much the
better. A head of glass. B, is set upon the top of the vessel, and is
cloosed with clay least it brethe out, whereunto a pipe. C. is adjoined as
the fashion is: to yt an other pipe of glass D. is joined, so compassed with
clay that nothing can breethe out. This pipe passes through a trene
Vessel. E. which ye must have always full of very cold water, drawing out by
the spigotte so much water as hath gotten any heat and putting in other water
again late and new drawn D. is made coule, and the fumes are not brent, but
pass into water or into oil, and being turned by that crooked part of the
pipe which stretches beyond the vessel with water, fall dropping into the
vessel.

Therefore as I did once see it, at the first a troubled matter runs out,
caryinge forth the more subtle substance of the thing: after that a more
clear water comes out, at the last oil, which declares the savour
rather of a thing burnt, then of that thing wheroute it ran. In this manner
the destillacion of waters also (of herbs and flowers) may be done: but that
way is far better which is by descencion downward c. Some put Musk about.
F. and other precious smelling things, and the water that rettineth the
smells not only of the own proper matter, but also of the Musk and of other
things that be put to it.

Of destillation by descencion or going downward. Vlstadius in his.xix.
Chapter teaches of this way of destillinge vniuersallye: and specially or
severally of oils of Juniper sticks, of the yelkes of Eggs, Nutmegs, and
Benedicto: where through I will go about to declare the matter moore
clearly and more shortly. He teaches to make a fornace meet for this
destillacion, like to such a Chunney as is used to be made amongst the
Germans, of brickes vnbrente of a Cubit and a halfhie, on every

This fornace shall be meet also for an other use, that is to seal with the
seal of Hermes, as they call it: when the mouth of a Glasen Cucurbita being
put into the whole of the fornace, the length a hand breadth, that is.iiii.
fingers, and if any more about it be open, that being stopped with clay, as soon
as it is red hot, it is nipte together with a pair of tongues likewise red
hot. When thou will destyll therefore in this fornace, take a Cucurbita of
the best earth: or if not, of Coper or Latin: syll it unto the third part
with the matter that is to be destilled, and shit it with a very thin iron
lid of iron plate full of little Cucurbita of glass (for the putting in and
taking out whereof, and that thou may see when the whole matter is
destilled, the foore part of the fornace must Cucurbita must be joined, (but
not with clay.) Then let a fire be made above about the vessel that coteineth
the matter on every side. But the fire at the first must be little, and as
far of from the vessel as is possible: afterward by little and little to
make it bigger and nearer the vessel.

Ye must understand that of every matter, at the first water destilleth,
moore or less according to the difference of the matter.

When it hath left running, and now the oyll hath begun to destill, thou shalt
empty the Cucurbita of glass that stands vnderneth, and set it under aagain:
and continue in encreesing the fire, and to make it ever nearer and nearer the
vessel, until no more oil destille. For then by and by the fire must be
removed far of that the upper Cucurbita may be couled. Then take away the
nether that is the receiver, and keep the oyll. But as I said, a little fire is
required at the first, and is to be encreesed Cucurbita, burn it, breeke it, or
infect the oyll with sum vnplesaunt Benedict, thou shalt increase the fire only
at the end of the destillacion: and thou may prepare such a place for the
destillacion: Dig a pit in the earth, long, brood and diep, accordining to the
measure of the pot that is to be put into it. Let the pot be glased, washed
with water, and upon the mouth of it let a thin iron plate be put, bored
through with many holes, so that the plate be a fingar thickness within the brim
of the pot: upon this set an other the mouths of them be joined together, and
all well clayed, then let a fire be made about the upper pot, which shall be
hool without the pit save ye mouth. But this second way is not so comodious as
the first: because the water can not be separated from the oil: nor easily
know when the hooll matter is destilled, except it be known by use and
custom. The fornace may also be made in a stiep hill: as the same Vlstadius
shows: I let that pas that I be not to long.

Oil of the leeues of Citrum, or Orange, Arantia, or Limons when it is
destilled, first the water is gotten out (then the oyll) and both ought to be
kept severally: the oyll is very swiet and good. It is made on this wise. Take
the leeues of any of the foresaid tries which so ever ye will, when they are cut
beet them in a mortar, and as ye destill them receive the water: and when ye
see any drop of diverse colour swym upon the water, the receiver being changed,
encrees the fire and gather Ambra, hoot Styrax, Ladanum, Cinnamon, Benzoum: not
the substance of them, but the fume or smoke only: for they put this into
Rose water upon the fire, and with the vapour of them they season the leues.
When this are so diligently certain spices are stiept, as Cloves, Galangal, Put
megges. c. for the space of one day, and the powder of the leues moistened
therewith, they destill it it ashes with a slow fire, till the watery liquor be
separated: then they encrees the fire and receive the oyll, which is of a
wonderful pleasant and swiet savour. Furner.

A certain practicioner showed me, that the oyll is separated comodiously from
herbs routes in this manner. Put the herbs or routes in Turpentyn Larigna,
rosin washed (eigth or nyne times) till it wax white, and let it stand in hoot
sand q. s. Then destill them with a slow fire, the Turpintyn shall run out
first* by and by at the beginning: or if it move but a little, being shaken
together it shall then run out hoolly, first in a colour white as milk,
afterward yelowe. Thou shalt perceive by the taste when the liquor that thou
desire begins to run out: when the colour is changed, thou shall change
also the receiver, that

Such destilled oils as be to be ministered with in the body, al must be mixed
with sum liquor, wyn Meed, or Syrup with sum destilled water, or other
medicine: As we shall declare also hereafter among the balsameles. And this is
it oils as unto spirits or souls, sum body ought to be added.

Of oils of flowers.
OYll of Saffron is prepared thus: Thy matter is digested by sprinckling Aqua
vitae upon it, and when the Aqua vitae is drawn out by destillacion, the other
liquor is wrong out with a pres, as it is written Ryffius.

Oil of Spick, out of the French book of Furnerius. Set the herb (the flowers
rather) of Spik or Lauendar a while in the sun, then draw out the water in a
lebeck. This set in the sun in summer in a very hoot place brings forth an
oil in the superficial or upper part of it, which being separated now and
then fro the water, thou shalt reserve. For it both smells most swietly, and
is

An other way of the same mans. Thou shalt stiep in a glass the flowers of Spick
well rypened in as much as thou think good of Oyll of swiet Almondes, in
horse dong.xl. days. Then destill them with a slow fire: at last rectify them
in the sun, the vessel diligently stopped. But if there be any smell of adustion
or brentnes, make.ii. or.iii. little hooles in the cover. So shall it remain
purged

The third way of the same man. Fill a glass with the flowers of Spike
well ripened, shit it, and every day put as much to it as ye can. Do this
continually for the space of.viii. days: then stop the vessel and putrifye it
in horse donge iii. months. At the length destill it a lembek with great
diligence, and when the oil is drawn out set it in the sun, so that thou
seperat always that is clearer and reserve it Some as soon as the matter is
drawn forth from the fire (so is it in Furnerius.

The same oil Ryffius saith is made, as oil of Roosemary, the flowers being
cut and stiept in old wine, then destilled, so that the spirits of the
lembecke be couled. c. Read before in the oil of Roosemary. Some sell this
oil of Spike commonly and name it Balm, with tables wherein the virtues of it
are described. It is very hot and dry. I knew a woman which received into her
jeopardy: but therewith she avoided many worms. It is mixte with many
things, chieflye for the smells sake. One drop of it chafed with a great
quantitye of water, makes it all swiete smelling. Physicians also mixte it
with Oils and hot oyntmentes, both because of the savour, that it may
increase the pleasantness of things that be somewhat swiet of them selves,
and to conserve them, or else to hide and cloak an evil smell: for it
ouercometh all smells, and perauenture

Oil of Roosemarye that is in stied of Balm. Take a Phiall full of the
flowers of Roosemary: bury it in sand (shit with a double cerecloth, or
with wax and a cover so that it may brethe, Atnold: with a double linen, and
then also with wax to be closed, Hollerius:) till the middle of the vessel:
and let it stand so a month or more, until it heats them for the most
part, and heals them sometimes. It resists salsfleem. Fistulaes and
Cancars that give not place to other medicines, it heals them thoroughly.
Aqua vitae destilled of wine, wherein Rosemary is decocted and sod, doth the
same things. Lullius. I would not sethe the Roosemary: for the strength of the
wine and quintessence doth fume out in vapours: but I would stepe them in a
vessel closed, or putrefy them: then first in Balneo Mariae, afterward in
Arnold de villa nova, which in his book of wine, (where he writes of the
oil also of Rosemarye the very same things, which we rehearsed now out of
Lullius, if so be they be Lullius words.) Of tentimes (saith he) have I tried
that Aqua vitae, made of wine wherein Rosmary hath been mollified, cures
salsfleum, scabs, cankar, and the fistula, which cannot be healed otherwise.
But this Verbascum not by destillatio.

Oil of Rosemarye should be made of flowers cropped of with the tops of the
tender buds or bows wherein they are sprung, pund and stiepte or putrified in
very good old wine. They ought to be destilled with a slow fire, so y^ the
spirits of the lembek be now and the couled, afterward to be circulated, till
yt all the gros matter be separated from the subtle as much as is possible:
Gualterus Ryffius. It may be destilled, as I conjecture, ether in a Cucurbita,
specially somewhat short, with a limbeck: or in a crooked still with a
receiver of a diverse figure and fashion, or rather in two crooked stils, whereof
the one may be the receiver, or else in brazen vessels which the Apothecaries
call bladdars as water of Cinnamon, or burning water.

In like manner be oils destilled, as the same man teaches of Vernix or Gum
of Juniper: of the flowers of Spike or Lavender, of Anes sedes and many other
sedes.

how it is prepared and to what use, read before, where we have entreated of

afyerye out of the most herbs and other medicines, after the same manner it
is prescribed there in Selandine.

Oil of Rue. Cardanus in his second book of subtlety, writes that there be
certain poysones which slay with the only touching. Against these Lullius:
but that whereof Cardanus makes Few it self, that is of the extreme tops of

Of oils of siedes and fruits,
OYll of Cloves did I taste once in Italy wonderful swiet and strong: howe it
should be drawn out, we declared before with Catdanus words, where we write
generally of drawing out of oils: also another Ryffius (that is) the same way
yt ye may out of what spyce a man will, which stiept in burning water, they
destill the till the burning water be separated, and as soon as the oil
begins to run, the matter taken out of the Cucurbita is pressed. c. as before
it is written out of Ryffius, who describes also particularly the virtues of
this Oyll.

Oil of Nutmegs how it may be gotten out, fee before where as we entreated
general of the Ryffius, who describes the virtues of ether of them severally.

Oyll of Anis sied is draw out (as out of other dry things which be in the
kind of plants) the siedes well beeten stieped in the best wine, then
destilled by little and little by ascencion, so that the spirits in the Lembeck
be continually refrigerated The virtues of it Ryffius rekoneth, we leave them
out as also of other for the most part, where no peculiar effect or working is
attributed to the waters and oils, yea the same are agreeable to this medicines
also wherout they be drawn, or ever they be destilled, saving that by
destilling they are made more subtle and more effectual or stronger
operation.

Oils of the beries of Juniper and of the beries of Baize, are made one way:
that is pund, Cardan, to be gotten out of woods and cloves: or else as out of
spices, by Ryffius description. I think it makes no great matter, so be that
the spirits which be carried about the lembeck, may be couled commodiously in
it and in the noos.

The virtues of this oils Ryffius rekoneth Agyrtae or iugleres also are wont
with us to sell oil of Iunipers, with tables imprinted coteining the rehearsal of
the virtues thereof. This amongst other heeleth them that be sick of a tercian
as I am informed.

Sum make oyll of wheet pressing it out between two iron plates reed hoot:
other think it to be nothing worth thatis made thus, and that it should be
made as oyll of Juniper, that is of the sticks of Juniper by descencion or
dounwarde. Mesue saith that wheet after it be husked is destilled in a vessel
of sublimacio, as the Philosophers oyll. It cures ring worms, and ruggednes
of the skin which springs of drynes, it mollifies and moysteneth, and other
infections, also of the skin it remedies them. It is described also by Rasus
in his Antidotarium. Loke within emogst the oils not destilled. There might be
made also of Barley and such both by sublimacion, and also by descencion.
Monachi upon Mesue.

Oils of Musk ben, (that is Balanus my repsica,) Fnrnerius calls Retraban
or retraha, of most precious smell. Like as of Almondes, so shalt thou press
out an oyll of the fruits of Ben (which are found about Genua pleteously
enough, of the same price almost that Almondes be) thou shalt let it stand, and
put a good quatitie of musk into it, and so in a glass well stopped, thou shalt
set it in a ketle that it may sees a while, then receive the oyll by
destillacion, which shall be most swiet and most odoriferous.

Certain oils of siedes which I found in a book of Waters of Raimund
Lullius.
THis oils I thought good to write severally, because I doubt whether the
author would have them made by destillacio or simpely by pressing out: in
every one he adds this words and let an oyll be drawn out after the manner
of the to signify, simpely by the pressing out of the siedes in a pres, as the
commun people is wont to do, so is oyll to be gathered, specially when as he
would have it drawn out of the same dried in the sun. Notwithstanding it is
out of all doubt, that the same things destilled accordingly, should be far
moore effectual: But for destilling, the liquor wherein the siedes pund or
stiept ougth to be left with them and putrification to go before. c.

Oyll of the siedes of Few. Mixed the siedes of Few pund with leued gould, and
put it in vynegar a day. Then dry it lightly by the sun draw out an oyll after
the manner of the lay men. It is precious and resists poisons, so that they
shall avoid by vomit, if so be it a man drink of it the second time, the
other humours also that be infected wound and cure be had accordingly. Also
being drunk fastinge and puts away the Gutta or drop and all scabbednes:
and the dropsy sprung of a cold cause, if it be taken but two days. To
conclude it stirs up and restores all sliepy and benumbed members, (taken
with the Palsy, being anointed upon.)

Ruberta (if it be right written, perauenture of the colour he so calls it:
I would rather read Sperma,) that is oil of Nasturtium (I would rather
Nasturtium, as in other in the same place, before and after the oil) moystened
in sharp vinegar, dry it in the sun, and draw out the oil after the manner
of the lay people.

This mixed with Aloes oil of baize, cures all scabbednes and the drop, the
places being anointed. Druncken with Aloes and cools of an elm, it heals
the Tercian and quartaine, and all breches in the body. Soden with a ptisan and
drunken, it stauncheth the bloudye flux and binds

Oil of the seeds of Pimpernell. Put seeds in read wine a few days, dry
them, punne them and make an Oil after the lay manner. This oil drunk
fastinge, dissolveth, breaks and expels the sand (and any stone of the
bladder, yea if it be finished (gathered to y^ form of a stone) what matter so
ever it be of. It lighteneth the wearied members of a man body. These

Of oil of the beries of Juniper, destilling first by ascencion, then by
descencion as I learned of my friends.
TAke a pint or a quart full of the Bearies of Juniper, when they are beaten
steep them two days in well spring water: then put those beries together
with the water wherein they were sooked into a Cucurbita or bladder, as they call
it, Alsatia, about iiii. ounces of oil. Other to separate the Oil from the
water, put it into a drincking glass that has the foot taken away ether by
coming with a wire of iron red hot, or else by chance so that a little
whole in the bottom be left for the oil the whole is stopte, and then the
oil may be poured out into ye vessel where it shall be kept. So destill it in
like manner, but they move the matter oftentimes in the still, least it be
burned. And they say spices beaten, as Cloves and cinnamon my be rightly
destilled likewise. Some, as I hear say, destill in a crooked vessel not of
glass, but of Copper, tinned in the inside: which is put into a long pipe of
coper, as they do for burning water.

An other way of preparing the same by descencion

Then being well beaten, thou shalt put them Aqua vitae,) specially the
arthritical parts and joints, this juice is easily conserved, neither is it
corrupted lightly, it is also swiete and effectual or strong. Some get out
the waterye humour not by a pres, but separate it in a commun fornace, (Balneo
Mariae.) The reast of the matter well dried and beaten, put it in a Cucurbita
that is hable to receive a galon, but thou shalt not fill it up. In it (shit
with the clay of wisdom least any thing brethe out) shalt thou putrify the
matter, about.xxviii. days in horse donge: or if it be winter (in Germany) ny
unto the fornace, for to putrifye it in horse donge a and make it sure with clay
(and the hooll also of the bottom shalt thou fill every where with clay) then
let down that part of the vessel by the hooll in the middle of the fornace so
far, that the nether vessel also (that is) the receiver may be put with in the
nether skirt of the plate, fensed with clay. The clay ought to be tempered with
salt water flox: this) sum cal clay of wisdom. The manner of the fornace is
this: In the midst must a floor or chamber be made with a hooll, as I said:
above Cucurbita is sand laid almost till the third part of the Cucurbita: above
the sand, cools burning, more then the third part of the Cucurbita, nether
needs it to put away the ashes: the rest of the Cucurbita, the fourth part
perauenture, or little les then the third part must be above empty and at
liberty. It so be thou feer that the upper Cucurbita perauenture shall not be
able to abide the force of the fire, thou shalt pariet it with clay, at the
least wife in that part that the cools oyll certainly drawn out by discretion
in a glass, siemeth to me to be les infected with ye faut of adustion or
brentnes. Hitherto although me thinks I have described the matter plain enough
as my friend rehearsed unto me, yet will I ad sum figure, that I may lay the
thing before the eyes most clearly: A. is the Cucurbita containing the
beries: B. the cools: C. the sand: D. ye plate E. the floor whereupon the sand
lies. F. the Cucurbita, that receives: G. the round wreeth of straw whereupon
ye receiver is set.

OYll of Mirh. Look before amongst the swiet waters of Furnerius, where we
have described one which is made with one part of Mirh, and the half part of ye
juice of Roses, most odoriferous.

Liquors thikned by nature, and gums as they call them, of a hoot and dry
temperatur, that they may be prepared unto destillacion, when they are pund,
put them in a vessel well stopped (wyn also, except I be deceived, may be a little
sprinkled upon it) and dig it in a could and moist place so diep as a man is
hy, without putting to it any hoot matter, and it must be left a good long
space: notwithstanding it should sooner be resolved if thou put to Caphura also,
seeing they contain a fat liquor and whyt, that which by destillacion is drawn
from them, do easily savour of the injury of the fire faut of brentnes, that
although they be destilled in vessels very men, yet issues forth a liquor
full of dregs, gros, brent, of an vnplesaunt as power forth any gums or
teeres.) This for the most part writes Ryffius in his first book of
destillacion.

The same Ryffius in the treatise of the same work of oils prescribes no
peculiar way to draw out oil of gums: but sends men unto his first koke. He
describes severally the virtues of oils of Ammoniacum, Belzoum, Camphora,
Cloves, Euphorbium, Galbanum, Ladanum, Myrh, Opopanax, Sarcocolla, Sagapenum,
Stirax liquid Calamita. In the only oyll of Mastick he wills the Mastick when
it is pund, to be resolved with old wine (and to be degested) then destilled.
And the gum of Juniper likewise to be resolved and stiept in wine, because of
the drynes of the substance thereof, and afterward to be destilled.

Oil of Belzoum. Thou shalt water a pound of Belzoum or more groos beeten, with
burning water: and in a crouked still with a receiver set under thou shalt
destill it in ashes, with a slow fire Furnerius.

Oyll of Styrax out of ye same. Thou shalt beete somewhat groos Styrax Calamita
that which is full of juice and fat, water it with the best Aqua vitae: then
destill it in a crouked still as the oyll before, and kiep the water by it
self. This oyll excells with a marvelous fragrat swiet savour

crooked still be put in sand, first of al with the water shall an oil issue
Valerius Cordus. More of oil of Turpentin, and of the preparing of it and of
the hertues thereof writes Ryffius, which I for shortness sake let pas. This is
chiefly tobe taken heed of, that in the destilling, it sis not, as in honey
also: for they rise and swell quickly these liquors when they are made hot:
wherefore at the first the fire must be made very light scleder Benedict yt by
the same means of the oil incresed. The descriptio following makes with me,
which I found in a certain written book. Take pure sand, or little white and
clear flintes and put them over the fire in a vessel till they wax red hot,
then quench them in turpentin, that they may drink well, and that sand quenched
destil it in a lembeck. Some commend oil of turpentin for the grief of the
stone. Also those, oil of Turpentyn, of a pound of Turpentyn, an ounce of old
tile slates, (or as Albucasis saith, new tile slates because they may drink
the more oil) and Mastik and Styrax, of ether an ounce. The tiles made red hot
are slekt in oil: when they are queched and pund they are mixte with the other
in a lembeck of glass. Three liquors run out, whereof y^ third is the best. Iac.

is finished, destill it again, renewing y^ glass, the cucurbita and the sponges.

Oils of barks.
Oil of Cinnamon is made, as we declared before out of Cardanus, how oils be
drawn out of woods and like things, as Cloves: where is also described the
instruments. Or else as we described out of Ryffius of the drawing out of oils
of all kinds of spices. Cinnamo may be stiept about viii. days in burning
water.vi. times destilled, and the be destilled, as I was informed of a fred.
Here will I rehearse also the way to make water (as they call it) of Cinnamon:
for in the destillation or rather longer, an other showed us he had seen in
the destillacion of this water: but peraueture it shall be les nied of such a
long one, when no great plenty of water is destilled.) It may also be destilled
in a Cucurbita of glass parieted with clay, after the manner of Aqua fortis, and
perauenture it wold be best that way. Put a pound of the best Cinnamon pund not
sifted, in the bottom of a still warily, least the powder s^ir abroad or cleue
to the sides, by and by pour to it a.iii. pintes of freash and put linne
clouthes dipped in could water about the pipe, and about the cover likewise if it
be too hoot. For it skills much that this parts be couled that both more
plenty of water and also better may run out. This water of Cinnamon I have scene
my self and tasted, very pleasant and swiet in savour and in taste. The liquor
which I saw was sharp, almost of the colour of milck and troubled: whereupon
certain somewhat red drops of oyll did swim, which were les swiet then the
water, Cardanus writes generally, of liquors of swiet wood things as Cloves.
c. This liquor restores the strength excellently: the other virtues thereof
Ryffius describes: but every man may know the manifestly by the nature of
cinnamon it self.

In like manner is the oyll of the husk of Nutmegs which they call Mace,
prepared, which also is described by Ryffius.

An oyll marvelous swiet smelling, wherewith Furnerius. Thou shalt take in the
month of May the.iii. parts of the second barks of the tree of Almon (so is
it red says Furnerius in the book out of which he writ it, but doubted
whether it ought to be understanded an Elm or a Limon a kind of Orenges) and
the fatter parts of the flowers of the same tree (Les espis de la fleur qui
sont grasses,) in like weight, dry them in the sun. That kind of this tree is
thought best that the third part of the beries of Juniper new, and destill
them dounwarde, with a little fire at the first, then greater and greater
increasing it till al the Oyll be cumd down into the receiver, which should be
of glass and closed with clay. Afterward thou shalt set it in the Sun, with the
mouth of the vessel open a while, or shit with a parchement pricked through
with a few hooles, till the smell of adustion and brentnes brethe out. Sum to
encrees the smell, put to it Belzoum, Spick narde, Agallochum, the shauings of
Cypres, Styrax, Ambra,, Mosch and destill all together, repeting also the
destillacion the second time.

Of oils that are dravven out of Woods.
Oils of wood are all destilled by descencion (as they call it) dounward. Of
the preparing of oyll of the wood of Juniper, Vlstadius, where we entreted of
destillacion dounward generally. He that desires more, specially perteyning to
the virtues, let him search in the duche bouke of Ryffius, who writes that
oyll is gotten out of Guaiacum also after the same manner utterly: and also out
of the wood of Rosemary. I will ad heer that I found in a certain dutche book.

The wood of Juniper to make oyll thereof ought to be cut in ye beginning of
May, or harvest, which is grien or fresh, the barck being red. When y^ barck
is taken of, thou shalt dry it diligently in an oven straight after the bred is
taken out, then cut in pieces with an ax, put it in a pot that hath the botom
full of hooles, set hansumly in a pot vnneth it. The upper pot thou shalt fill
with ye chips of Juniper and also of that whyt Popler which they cal
trembling, with a part of the whyt stones whereof lyme is made: after when thou
hast fensed the cover well with clay, put it into the nether and Brasauolus
commends the same against the pestilence. It puts away cold causes, and
represeth the typum of the quartain. Being anointed from the navel of women to
privy Rogerius.

Oyll destilled of the sticks of Juniper most dry, in two earthen vessels
with the mouths joined together, or also in a lembeck of glass, if it be holden
in y^ mouth, it takes away marvelously the touth ach sprung of a could reum,
likewise it is good against all oher grieves coming of could humours, as the
griefs of the synewes, the conuulsion or cramp of the joints, the palsy, and
like, Matthaeolus. Oil of Juniper (saith Mesues) helps the infections of the
skyn, crieping diseases, the cancar, angry boils, such as in sommens legs the
late wryters call the deed evil. Fill a glased vessel with a narrow mouth,
with the small chippes of Juniper: join a thin plate of iro boored full of
hooles after the manner of a meell sieve, to the hooll mouth: daub the same with
the mouth both of the said vessel and of the lesser, Mesues as Siluius
interprets him. In the same place Siluius in the commentaries. By this art
(saith he) oil is made of the kurnelles of Pynaples to put away the wrinkles of
women's skins, of the wood Gnaiacum, and stronger of Lignum sanctum for the
grieves of the Spanish disease as boils (unto which oyll of Juniper also and
of Broum, and of ash and of like, is holsum) and of other woods, specially
that be fat and full of juice as fruits beries and seeds. The biggar vessel
also may be of metal, or if it be of glass or ston, let it be well fensed all
over with clay of wisdom, an erthen vessel because it is spongi not so cloos,
when the oyll seeks to breeth out it would give it way: therefore let it be
glased within, the nether only in the circuit but somewhat more thik, it may be
also of metal: it may be at length of earth, so be that it be glased and oiled
as they call it: else that most thin oil wold run out here and there by the
pores of the vessel: much les may that oil be received safe in the pit within
the ground having the sides walled with potters earth, (which notwithstanding
Mesues commanded.) Take this withal, that it shall not be needful to dig the
lesser vessel within the ground, if thou can find a means Syluius.

Oil of ash tree helps them that be sick of the spleen, besides that it can
do all that oil of Juniper can, and is made after the same manner Mesues. Where
again Syluius saith. That oil anointed upon the left side under the short ribs,
and drunken, delivers mightily the obstructions stoppings of the spleen: it
mollifies also digests.

This oil (saith Rogerius) represses the cold greues of the joints: it
heals a wound brings skin where it lacks: it delivers from the white
morphew, and blackeneth it.

Io. Manardus in his epistles. 16. 4. giving counsel for ye health of the
cardinal Campegius sick of ye gout: I praise (saith he) both the manner the use
of the some of the decoction of lignum sanctum or of Iudicum to the place where
the grief is. But I think the oil of the same wod, destilled after y^ manner
more effectual, anointing the places therewith yt swell and where the grefe is.
They be wont also of the shauings of raw wode, sodden in some noble wine,
putting unto it old oil, to prepare an ointment which is very good to be
anointed upon the places where the grefe is.

Take ye wode cut like bordes, therwt fill a new earth vessel, with a cover of
the same matter board through with little holes: yt diligently claid let an other
empty earth pot digd in the earth up to the mouth, Andreas Mat in his book of
the frensh disease.

A ma may also, as I hard of a friend, destil guaiacu after the same way that
Aqua fortis is destilled, best in an erthen vessel glased yt will abide the
fire, such as they make at Haganoa. This oil is good for the fauts of ye
joints through the frensh pocks, if it be anointed upon the places with the best
burning water. Oil of the wode guaiacu, more mightilye of lygnum sanctum, is
wholesome for the spanish diseases biles. Sylu. A certain practicioner even so
also yet is the best oil destilled of.

Take the wod of ivy dried, the beries gum also if you may have it. When they
are cut in pieces let the be put in an erthen vessel bored through in the bottom
in.ii. or.iii. places: then let an other pot be set under it. Set the in the
earth, join the botto of the upper unto the mouth of the nether with clay or
paste: the upper pot must stand holly above the ground. At length make a fire
on every side, and the oil shall destill black into the nether Rogerius.

The preparing of oil of capuistu that is smoked because it is made by
descencion, like as the oil of woods, I have rehearsed it in this place out of
the first book of Aetius, where he entreats of oils: from whence Nicholas
Alexandrin{us} also borrowed it in his treatise of oils. Vngues aromatici that
be black (melancho, Fuchsius the expositor of Nicolas reads Megalco, that is
great) thus Masculu, styrax bdellium pure Costus, of every one. v dras (of
every one.ii. vnces a half, saith Nicolas which I like better).v. sextaris that
is about. iiii pints of the best swiet oil, (ii. a half saith Nich.) Hypni as
much as need requires. The cost{us} cut in pieces sowhat gros, likewise ye
styrax bdelliu mixed together, put the into an earth vessel (a new one:
Nycolas) without eres, ye mouth whereof you shalt stop with the hypne, without you
shalt defece it with the slips of aspalath{us} or some odoriferus thing hasomli of
the other vessel that contains the spices agreing aptly with the mouth, into
which thou shalt put.v. sextaries of sweet oil. Afterward dig the ground and
bury the earthen pot that holds the oil unto the neck, lest it wax red hot
after with the fire that shall be made about it: then turn ye other vessel with
spices the mouth downward upon ye head of it, soioyn y^ mouths of the both, yt
they my be closed together most exactly. Then close ye hole vessel roud about
with clay, on every side where the mouths are joined together, by by thou shalt
kindle a fire putting under coals about ye earthen vessel, blowing. When the
fire is kindled let the spices being consumed, yt being set on fire theimai sed
out their vapor by the mouth of ye earth vessel into ye oil set under: For ye
which cause it is called capnisto y^ is smoked. The second day after remove away
the oil, and put it in a glass to keep. Women use this whose flours are stopped,
anointing the nether part of their belly loins therewith. It is convenient
tenesimus, if it be received in wol (hot as Nicolas adds) folded together
and laid to the lower part of the belly loins. The same seems to be called
capnelaeu or smoked oil: but the author of Kiranidum expounds it naphtha, in
his.iiii. book where he makes mention of the fish Ecleneis or Remora.

I have scene also of paper rolled together in manner of a hod, set on fire over a
dish of tin, holden at the very extreme top with a pair of shears (or tongues)
certain drops of black oil run out, which are praised for the spots or
whytneses of ye eyes.

Of trevve Balm, and antibalm, that is Oils composed by art, which are used
in steed of the true Balm both within and without the body.
BAlsamum is a word used almost in Syrian word without dout: for in only Syria
in one only garden did it ones grow. Panag ye hebrew word in the.xxvii. of
Ezechiel, Dauid Kimhi after certain doth erpound it a proper place of Iudaea:
other Apharsamon, that is Balsamum. The later wryters of the Iewes wryt
Palsamon: Mycander Balsamo bycans of the verse. Opobalsamon is a liquor:
Carpobalsamon a sied, which sum call also Casamum: Xylobalsamum, bows or the
wood. I imagined once that it was called Balsamum of the excellency, because
it was most precious most noble of all spices: for Bowl signifyeth lord and
master with the Hebrewes and Sam spyce. Balsamon, is an aromaticall flower,
Varinus. And in died it is reason, that as the thing it self is proper to
Syria, so the etimology and interpretacio of the word should be taken of the
same tong. Peraueture Belsuin also (other writ it Beniuin, other Belzoum) a
liquor of most swiet savour hath the same Origin of his name. Not same only
with the Hebrewes but also Bosem signifies a swiet smell ling spyce, whereupon
the Germans may seem to have called Mosch Bisem.

Balsamum or Balm sum in our age think it is lost, the juice of it was of the
colour of gould, it he led wounds, and toke away wrinkles, and kept the faces
of deed men from corruption: it brake also the stone in the reins, it did put
away the spots Aconitum, Hemloke, and the shaking of very fevers, and in all
this things the virtues of Balm excelled. But now there is another kind of
Balm brought out of Spain, of a red colour teding toward blak, weighty,
sauouring somewhat of adustio or brentnes, and by and by it stryketh pierces the
heed, and the tongue also sharply, but somewhat lunge first as pepper. And it
also heeleth new wounds more quikly then any other thing: and takes away
Goacomax, of the form of a Pomgranat tree and in bigness almost like: but it
has a lief a little biggar and a thinner barck as though it were dry, the
wood of it burns like a torch, the fruit is as the clusters of grapes, but
the kurnelles are somewhat biggar, of a wyny colour, which together do yield
that kind of oyll, Cardanus.

Certain merchants affirm that the gardeines of Balm were destroyed, what
time as Zelimus the Turck, the predecessor of Solyman, wan Chayrum, when the
Turks killing the gardeners, did not forthwith put other in their places the
year of our Lord. 1516. Moreover they say there is a Balm tree of an
indifferent bigness laid to keep to be compared unto many thousands of Ducats,
with the most famous ma of our time, Lucullus, May. Antony Fuggerus: Ioan.
Agricola in his commentaries upon Galen, of the diseased places.iiii. ix.

Antibalsama. Dioscorides prescribes certain notes and tokens of the true
Balm. In the collection and table of those medicines that may be used one in
steed of another, which is joined with Galenus works, and in the end also of
Aeginetas books, we reed: In the steed of ye liquor of Balm, Mirh that
destilleth, that is liquid and running Stacte. In the same place is red also:
In the steed of Opobalsamu the liquor of Myrti: but it seems it should be more
rightly ye liquor of Mirh. Auicenna in his second book in the chapt. of oil:
In steed of Balm (saith he) is liquid Mirh used, or else like weight of the oil
Adhii, or Aldadi, or Dadi as Bellunensis traslated it. Rasis in the latter end
of his Antidotarie separated, in oil Benedict or of tylstons: It is of like
force (saith he) yt oil of Balm: but it is more subtle hoter more Monaci upon
Mesuen. And a little after, in the tretis quid pro quo, what for what, which is
imprinted with the books of the sun of Mesue, it is red. In the stead of Balm,
Turpintyn destilled, or oyll of Baize, or the gum of Ivy is put. But what Dadi
is, I can not easily say: it is described of Auicen the. 213. chapt.
Bellunensis nether there nor in the glosses expounds what it is. It is a grain
(saith Auicenna) like unto barley longar, more strait and cloos together, more
massy, bitter, could, declining to heet, dry CiTum or Ladanum, for it is could
also, so measurably yt it hath a warm heet, according to Galenus mind: it
binds, stops ye belly, and dries in the second degree: that is hooter that
grows in hooter places, the same mollifies meanly and dissolved, and
concokteth or digests. Furthermore in Antiballomenis Graecis, Propolis to be
used in the steed of Tragopogona, that is Ladanum: and Auicenna, in the
resolving (saith he) of hardnesses, ii. third parts in weight of kur, that is
Propolis, and the half of the weight of abhel. Dioscorides says that Ladanum
is mixed with medicines without smell: Auicenna, that it is good for the griefs
of the fundament hemrodes. Now that Auicenna hath, that Dadi is like unto
barley, but longar, straiter. c. I plainly suppose it to be corrupt out of
Dioscorides, who makes Ladon that is the bush of Ladanu, like unto Cisthum,
with longer leues only and more black. Last of all the names Ladon and Dadi do
not much disagree nor be far unlike.

Oil made of the flours of Rosemary (after the same manner as it is made of the
flours of Verbascus) may be used in stead of balm, and a drop of it put into
water, doth likewise go to the bottoe: Arnold de Villa nova. They put this also
amongst other to be a toke of true balm, y^ it will gather milk into courds: I
going about to try on a time, whether Ryffi{us} oil of cloves. In ye greek
Antiballominis it is red yt the rotes of white violets Xylobalsanu. The
Antiballomena or rehearsal of things y^ may be used one for another, which was
once imprinted with Mesues works declare in this wise. In sted of Xylobalsam, the
wod of ivy or Leucoradix. For carpobalsa, the fruit of ivy or Xylobalsamu in
like weight. The same: for balm it self, the gum of ivy. But peraueture in al
these ye expositer or traslater was deceived, when as no writer ever compared
ivy in any wise with balin: therefore I thought Arabic tong to have erred, or
rather the Arabians them selves, confounding Cisson, that is ivy and Cisthum
together: for Ladanum is the juice of Cisthum, which Auicenna did put in stead
of Balm.

In the Antiballomenis ascribed unto Galen I find these also: for the liquor
of balm, ye liquor of Carpasus: and for the liquor of Carpas{us}, the liquor
of Myrtus: and for the liquor of willow, the liquor of black iuye, which the
Arabians leaving certain things or changing them, translated them into Cassia
called Balsamodes because of the smell. Sisymbrium a kind of wild mint, growing
ni waters for the most part sowhat red, ye late writers many of the cal it
Balsamita. There is an other Balsamina as the Ligures about ye river of Poo cal
it: The Thuscans or Florentins cal it the apple of Ieru salem, with the leues
of the white vine, ye flower of the Cucumer, the fruit atboth ends round sharp
like to a little cucumer. c. the apple with ripens Lentil, most red, wheroute
oil is pressed chief for wounds. Some season the apple first in oil set it in
the sun a few days, then they bery it in horse dong or in the earth so long till
it be clean putrified: so they affirm it will get the virtue of balm in
closing of wounds, and thereupon hath it gotten the name of Balsamina: Ruellius
out of Her molaus. Brasauolus calls this oil of Cochirs: and and sharp husk,
Cochia or Momordica. The oil (saith he) is prepared diverse ways, both by
infusion and being digd under the earth many years, and by seathing: and it is
made of Echinus, of the leaves severally and of the sedes. That which is hid in
the earth, helps the greues of Hemrods. Generally, that oil asswageth all
greues, who so desires to know mo very marvelous effects of this oil and
herb, let him read Matthaeolus Senensis commentaries on Dioscorides the.iiii.
book

Balsamaeleon, that is the oil of balm, of a plant a cubit high or.ii. cubits,
like unto wild Rue, by the bark whereof toward the East, being scarified rased
and wounded fat tears destill, that is the fatness of the balm. Other do beat
in a mortar the slips of this plant in the beginning of Vere, sethe it in
water, press them in a press, and call it oil Mesues, Syluius translating
him. Where Syluius also in his scoles saith: let Xylobalsamum Carpobalsamum most
new be stiept one day in old oil: after let ye oil be drawn out by the art of
chemists, it shall be of no small estimation: or set Xylobalsamum new be putin old
oil and set The virtues of this oil so much praised of al me nothing spoke of
Mesue, it is marvel, for it heteth moysteneth, extenuateth and makes slender,
digests, scours, closes. This virtue of closinge she wed unto the old
writers, makes it at this day precious. Opobalsamum is most rare and gesen:
and therefore most precious. Wherefore Petrus of Abanus, Guilielmus Placectinus,
Bartolemaeus Montaguanus, composed an oil of balm, nothing inferior in virtues
to balm. Other put the leues and sede, and wode of this plant in oil and set
it Opobalsamum: This saith Syluius.

The Egiptians make a counter^aite kind of Opobalsamum, of ye bark new most
swiet smelling heating it in oil of Almondes, of a singular smell when it is
fresh mixed: Alexan. Benedictus.

The oil that they cal communlye Balsaminum raises up suddenly them that be
fall of the falling ficknesse, being heide to their nose that they may
Balsamum.

Of balms made by Art.
THe commun intentand purpose of all Balsams or balms, to speak of their
virtue, seems to be, to close and heal wounds biles, that in a short space,
to avoid and turn away the evil Symptomata or diseases which the sores wold
otherwise parts: hereupon it is that all of them have Turpintyn Rosin, sum
also other rosins, as the rosin of Pyn tree, Mastik: here upon also gums are
added Frankincense, Elemi, gum of Ivy, Bdellium, Sarcocolla, Mumy, c. Unto sum
diverse spices are put to smell the swieter: whereupon they are made apt for the
moo uses, and miet for diverse diseases even within the body also, as to those
also, unto which moreover diverse plants or their parts are added. They are
destilled the most part of the They do al season the vrin with their smell. They
must all be received within the body mixed with sum liquor, chiefly wine, so
that to a sponful of liquor, one drop of the oil or.ii. at the most be put.
The dregs remaining in the bottom are good for nothing, saving that they may
be used in steed of Colophonia or Scammonium. I same of late a practicioner
destilling I can not tel what kind of Balsam in a pan, with ashes laid upon
slates, as I described before in the mention of destillation Cucurbita of glass
so diep set in the ashes, that they were not above the matter contained in the
vessel. The vessel was full to the middle, able to receive, if it had been
filled up perauenture, iiii. pounds: he continued this labour.iiii. or.v. days
nights also, never abating the fire. He separated only.ii. liquors, ye first
whyt, which was more plentiful and in gretter abundance: then a redish,
which was yielded lesser by the.iii. part. The clay wherewith the Cucurbita,
the lembeck it was good to chronicall agues, for the most part he mixed with
it sum spices, as Ginger and Sugar with wine the drop of the oyll, that the
sick should les perceive that he drunk only a drop of the oyll: sumtymes he
would mixed nothing else with the wine but one drop of this oyll, specially to
amend the defaut of a stinking breeth. Sumtymes he gave it in water, other
times he dropped it into a shyue of breed: sumtymes to phlegmatic and gros men,
with a sauce made of musterd and

An oyll devised by VVilliam de Saliceto, a Placentin, which is in the fifth
book of his Practice, in the chapter of Oils, and supplyeth the place of balm
as he saith. Carpobalsamum, Mirh, the nut of Inde, of every one half an uncle,

Arabic, Tragacantha, of every one an uncle: broken till sherdes that never
touched water* red hoot and quenshed in three vnces of comune oyll, vii. vnces
of cleen and clear Turpintyn. All pund and knoden together in a mortar, destil
them like Rose water. This water is proffitable against ye stoon, being mixed
with medicines against ye same. Hardnesses a^d skares it makes them even and
is used in every thing in steed of Balm.

An other of the same mans more noble. Myrh Carpobalsamum, the nut of Inde, of
every one half an uncle. Hypericon or saint Iohns wurt a drame (otherwise two
drames.) When they are pund somewhat groos, let them be mixed with five vnces of
oyll, and an uncle and an half of Turpintyn. In the end put to five grains of
Musk, and. iii of Ambra, and an uncle of oyll of till stones, and let them be
destilled as before. It hath the same virtues that Balm hath may be used in all
things in steed of it. This Nic. Stokker also an excellent if mifrend sent me
the descriptio of it right when it was ready pressed, he adds at length the
Musk and Ambra, with oil of tile stones, and destilled them not as I think. He
has the former description in Luminari Maiore, as also the next following of
Montaguana.

A balm composed of Bartolomeus Montaguana out of his Antidotarie the first
chapter which is of oyntmentes. Turpentin a pound: white frankincense. iiii,
ounces: as much of bay beries: gum Elemi. vi. ounces: Mastik: Galangal, Cloves,
Cinnamon, Zedoaria, Nutmeg, Cubebae, Lignum Aloes well beaten, of every one an
ounce. Let all be destilled together, first with a slow fire: and first shall
run out a water called of Balm. Then when the fire is increased thou shalt
gather an other water by it self. And do so the third time. The shall destil
forth balm in all trials. It shall be the stronger the oftener it is destilled.

Balm of Peter Aponensis in his addition unto Mesues in the treatise of
oyntinges (for the diseases of the heart.) Mirrh elect, Aloes Hepaticae,
Spieaenardi, Sanguis Draconis, Frankensece, Mumiae, Opopanax, Serapinum,
Crocus, Mastik, Gum Arabic, liquid Styrax, of every one two ounces, two
ounces and a half of Ladanum elect, or Castoreum: half a dram of Muscke.
Turpentyn as much as the weighte of all the rest break them that be to be
broken and when they are all mixte with the Turpentyne, destyll water of
Rooses. These saith Peter, as the munkes that write upon Mesuen, said they
write it out of written books, far truer then in the Printed books, and it
is had in Luminare maiore. Aponensis saith, we find no mention made by the
old wryters of the annoyntinge of the back bone, perauenture not because they
were ignorant in so profitable and commendable a thing, but be cause they would
keep it secret. For this is an excellent help, preseruinge the subject of
life Nucha, it springs of the brain. c. Therefore things anointed with this

When thou wilt comfort bodies that be extenuated and brought lowe, thou
shalt mixte Roose water with it, and annoynte it upon the lower mansions, and

upon it the token of it with Pecia, thou shalt put away the shaking of
wandering Agues, and of any simple agues. But quartaines and wanderinge Agues

seem unto some to be corrupted in the printed books) in the swoundinge or
debility, annoyntinge the extreme parts of the back boon: that the
instrument for the purpoose may speak with voice, Aponensis.

The same manne wills to mixte this composition in the steed of true
Opobalsamum, with Triacle, Mithridatium, Diacurcuma, Aurea Alexandrina. This
Oil (saith he) Epiphanius Empiricus to all diseases of the sinews,
anointing twice a day therewith the Nucha, the back and inynts, for it is
plain by manifest proves, specially in a cold matter. The same man commands
to still this oil in Balneo Mariae, which I like not.

There is an other composition of VViliam Pla centinus, which I find in the
bigger Luminarie in Diacurcuma or Diacrocu, in this wise. Take Turpentin.ii.

These and certain other diverse balms doth Ryffius also in his book of
destillation describe.

A quickeninge water and one that procures youth unto an old man, out of the
book of Lullius of waters. Turpentyne a pound: honey half a pound: Aqua
vitae thryse or four times destilled Lignum Aloes welbeaten, Sadali
mustatelli, of ether.iii. drams, gum Arabeck (perauenture a dram): Nutmegs,
Ambra, ofether.ii. drams. When they are all pund destill them with a slow
fire, till ye have the first water clear. And when the second begins to
run out, whithe shall be like to a burning cole, increase the fire by and by and
keep that by it self. The encrese the fire again, gather the third, which
shall be black and thick like honey, till al the liquor be run out. Of The first is
called mother of Balm, the second oyll of Balm, the third Balm artificial. The
first is ministered in drink, with warm wine. The second a^d the third are good
to remove maladies which newly gnaw the flesh of mans body. The first drunk
with warm whyt wine, purges the stomach from al il humours: and withholds
the water that it cum not at the hart or principal parts, as it is plain by
often experiment. A fine lynnen clooth moystened in this water and thrust into
the Bombase, dipped lightly is this water, is very good to put in the ears
against any kind of deafnes. Being anointed it cures the rednes of the face:
the palsy of the tong, and all cold diseases. The second and third water Noli

throot. Also against the fistula and the ill disease called Malus morbus,
specially if it be yet but new: for by washing it and wetting and oft laing a
linne cloth moystened therein upon it, it is made hool. They help also if a mabe

glass, ye Aqua vitae shall be as much as thrys ye weight of all the speces
besides. After thou hast lest them stand.ii. days, thou shalt destill the with
a slow fire. The first water is most clear precious. The second differs in
colour, and must be received in an other vessel: it is whyt, good towhit Aqua
vitae of the same weight. And ye first water shall run furth odoriferous and
marvelous, which thou shalt receive by it self: then an other of the colour
of safron, the third at length like blood.

The virtues of the first and of the second water are this. If the one of the
be poured in to a would while it is new, there needs none other remedy: But
within a natural day and a half at the most it shall be made hool, so be that
it be no deed wound. All ill soores or boils, Old, roten Cankered, Fistula,
Lupus, Noli me tangere, and like to them, let them be washed with ether of this
waters, and they shall be heeled within a few days. One drop only dropped upon
a Carbuncle quensheth carnosity bred upon it, drop one drop of this waters
upon it every third day, and within nyne days it shall be hool, except it be
utterly destroyed. A drop of them drunk with a little good wine breketh the
stone in the reins or in the bladdar, or in the yard stopped and that within
two hours, delivers from the grief. If deed flesh be washed away therewith,
the place is shortly made hool. If a woman be sick of her womb or belly, let her
drink a little of them with sum juice. If a man have any

disease of short wind, the dropsy, palsy, Ischia or Sciatica, the swooning,
the falling sickness, the drop in the joints called the gout, ye consuming
fever, the strangury, and many other diseases, and that within two months. It
recovers youth unto old men: a man that lies a dying, out of all hope of the
physicians, it restores him, if one drop of it let fall into his mouth, be
swalowed, so that it may cum to the hart. If so be quantitye of a wheat corn
of this liquor with a sponefull of water of borage, destilled like Rosewater,
after the year is ended, he shall seem as though he were made new, in his
flesh, blud, and hole body, both in form and strength.

There third liquor will suffer no venom: is an utter ennemy and destruction to
spiders and Serpents. Two or.iii. drops let drop into any venomous biting,
do make it hole straight. If thou draw a circle with this liquor shit a
venomous beast therein, it shall dye there rather then go out of it. To he
short, it doth the same things all that Triacle doth, but more effectually
all things. Being poured or put upon any impostume, within.ix. days it
heals them, and likewise a Noli me tangere. All diseases bred of fleume and
cold humours, it heals them, if a linne cloth dipped in it be laid upon the
place where the grief is. It puts away utterly the Palsy, and all tremblinge
of mebers: it strengthens meruelouslye the sinews. It is hoter then the

without grefe. To conclude, it doth many other things and all diseases risen of
a cold cause, it heals

I understand that Vinegar is chieflye used to be destild, for the drawing out
of oils out of Metalies, as Antimoni, Lead, Cerussa. Other use other sharp
and most hot liquors for that purpose, as sharply, burning water, urine
destilled, Aqua Forti.

Lullius in the fifth Canon of his first book of quintessence, when he had
taught to draw out the.iiii. elements out of plants, he added. And make
them to resolve with our Menstrue (I suppose he means our Urine) under
dounge for the space of a weke: the Menstruum must be sharp with some Vegetable
and strong quickenynge things which we shall declare hereafter in the
Questionary. After the metalles shall be dissolved set them to be destilled in
a fire of the first degree, and the Menstruum shall issue forth, and the lime
or powder of ye metal shall remain in the bottom. After this reiterat repeat
it again upon the dregs Menstruum as much as the weight of the metal, and set
it to putrifyinge for the space of a month and a half: and after this destill
it as thou did of the Vegetable or quickening things, but every time put new
Menstruum upon the dregs. Other diverse opinions of Philosophers in the drawing
out of the elements out of mineral things, we shall declare in the third
book: This saith he.

I suppose it to be a commone thing unto all Cardanus signifieih and an other
certain author writes, that the drops oil of Vitriol or Coproos to be
ponderous and weighty.

Oil destilled of Orpment or Mysi (or Vitriol of Rom.) anointed upon ye
arteries region of the hart, I suppose is hable to save a ma infected with
poison, be it never so sharp and strong, do kill a manne only with touching:
Cardanus.

And a little after, but sense we are fallen into nor far fro the purpose to
inquere this how oil may be made which being anointed upon the Arteriis,
makes the venom to break out by vomit or purgation, or sweat, or urine, It
is sure, it must be of metal, which must be most strong. I saw such once
and by the waighte only I conjectured that it was without al dout of metal,
It must also be of the nature of Venom: for by the immoderate heate, as it
is said, it vanquishes first the evil infection conceived Laser or Assa
Foeetida. Therefore those things that must drive out the poysone, ought to be
metally poisons, but not most bitter: and most hot and discussing or expelling,
also in a manner contrary to the poisons. The matter therefore Mysi Orpment, and
the juice of Laser or Assa foetida, and Gentian, and of the fat of venomous
serpents, and Aconitum. If so be it that in any land moo of these (foresaid
virtues, as to discus, expel, and resist poysones. c. be to be gotten, the
oil extracted by the force of fire shall be best of all. And a little after.
But oil that only by anoyntinge of the Arteries doth thrust out the
poysone, I would not call it the best in this sense drink, Triacle or Milk
or sum other excellent medicin, ye also it should be the more auaylable. That
dare I be bold to say, that the anointing of the arteries, and the things
ministered outwardly, are better and of more strength then those things that are
drunk, save only for this that the poison remains yet in the stomach. For
unto such (poisons newly taken, that they be not yet gone out of the stomach)
they that provoke strong vomities are most excellent, as Milk, Lie, Oyll,
water of Nucis vomicae or spewing nut. Therefore in venomous bytinges, in
stingings in oyntmentes that be venomous, in the drinking of venom which is
now already pierced to the midriff or nether parts of the chest, the helps that
be ministered outwardly are more available and of greater strength. c. This out
of Cardane have I written the more at large, that thereby also ye reason migth
be the more evident of that marvelous oil of Scorpions. c. Which because it
is made without destillacion,

Oyll of Antimonium is most proffitable to all ill soores and boils, as I my
self dotry with good success. But the Antimonium is purged first, oftetimes
melted and made liquid with the fire. Far from this doth the oyll of Antimonium
which chymistes use, wherewithal they endeavour to set the colour of gould upon
silver: Matthaeolus upon Diosc.

Oyll of Antimonium howe it is made for soore boils and fistulas. I writ before
out of Vlstadius, Quintessence. But certain practicioners also make oyll of
Antimonium to diverse diseases within the body, which they extol with
marvelous and great praises. They make it after this sort, as I here. Antimonii
half a pound, whyt Tartari Calcionated as much: let the be beaten and melted
or dissolved in a gouldsmithes Tigillo (crucibulo) upon cools: when they are
melted let them be powered out into sum earthen pot, where they shall be stirred
and mixed together: and when they are becum into a hard lump, let them Hyppocras
as they call it) in a moist place (in a hoot and moist place) as in a wine
cellar, the colender hanging: for so shall the oyll destill out by little little
which of sum because of the bloody colour is called Rubedo Antimanii, and
likewise it is made of certain Gouldsmithes for a certain painting I can not
tell what. But for the remedies of mans body it ought to be prepared with
Quintessence of wyn Antimonium: and let them be sturde diligently in body, and
mixed, and then destilled in ashes three or iiii. times, till the breath lose al
the evil smell. The dregs must always be mixed stirred about when you powrest i^
again the destilled water upon the, or when thou powrest to them new
Quintessence, for I am not sure which way it ought to be done. Sum in the
beginning do stregthway mixed reed Antimoniu Tartaru calcionated to be melted
together. But I wryt althies not as certain: but as I noted the by the way as I
hard them recited certain years ago of a certain practicioner. I know that
certain chymistes goldsmiths search for ye oil or Quint essence of ye
Antimoniu as a most perfect treasur. This destil first sharp lye composed of
vnslect lyme and ashes Clauellatas by a Filtru: and is this lye they sis the
Antimoniu subtly and fynly beten, for the space of.v. hours, and again
destil this lye when it is cold, by a Filtru: that of ye Antimoniu Antimoniu
put in a Cucurbita or body, most sharpe red vinegar destilled, so that it be
above it iii. or.iiii. fingars thick: they set it in a hoot place a few days,
and every day they shake and* mixed it, x. or.xx. times: then they power ye
vinegar lightly into an other glass, so yt nothing be troubled. This do ^hey
repeat.v. or.vi. times (ever pouring new vinegar upon the Antimoniu remaining
in ye Cucurbita quintessence of Antimoniu, is of a colour of blud. With this
they die Mercurie, say it is an incomparable treasure, a chief mystery of ye
chymistical art: as we traslated out of a certain written doutch book. A reed
oyll is gotten out of Antimoniu, very sharp, smelling lyk brimston, it
retains ye virtue of y^ Antiminium, because of the grosnes of the substance
proffitable Cardanus.

Hooll Lyme vnbroken, let it be slekt in comun oyll, and destill it in a
lembeck of glass, there shall issue forth an oyll good for a boon that is
corrupt: Syluius. Put a hot piece of quick Lyme into commun oyll, till the Lyme
becum powder, then let it be destilled in a lembeck of glass, and oyll of Lyme
shall issue, which is the first that was described by Leonard of Praedapalea
Patauinus, Ion. Iacobus de Manliis.

Oyll of Cerussa: Look before where we intreted of Quintessence out of
Vlstadius.

Oyll of Gagates or ieet, called Sacratum or holy, most holsum for them that
be possessed of spirits, that have the falling sickness, the palsy, the cramp,
the stifnes of sinews, the gout, or be chooked in their womb, it helps also
coceiuing. It is made of Ieet stones after the manner of oyll of Juniper (by
descention) or else by sublimacion (as oyll of tyle stones) Mesues of Iac.
Syluius interpretation: out of whose notes we have subscribed this words:
Seeing Bitumen is far lighter cost then Ieet, Bitumen, forasmuch as it is as it
were the fat of the earth, and is burned in steed of oyll of them that dwell
about the place of Asphaltita or deed sea, or else in other places where Bitumen
is. Forthermore he doubts whether it can heel the falling sickness, seeing the
falling sickness doth the more appear with ye foul stinking, smell of the
Bitumen. But me thinks it with it by attenuating, digesting, drying, which
virtues boothe it has them befoore, and that not feablelye: and also much
moore the liquor destilled thereof performs these things.

Nether doth it not help this diese therefore, because it is likely that the same
should be uttered and appear with the perfume of that bituminous smell, as with
the perfume of Myrrh, Galbanum, and horns, houfs, and the skins of a she or he
got. For Phisicions use the horns houfes of diverse bestes Bitumen) specially
white, holden to the nostrils of one sick of the falling evil, with coals in a
spoon and the Amber upon them, and by by Mosch or Ambra will do also. But that
Mesuae writes of men possessed with devils (saith Syluius) is superstitious,
against the faith of a Christen man. Brimston and jet are molten at the fire as
al other liquors. The same.

Oil of philosophers (which some have named oil of wisdom, and of perfect
mastership, divine and holy) by al the old writers consent, is most effectuous
to secret diseases, and tha^ not to a few means of the subtelnes of the
substance, it digests and consumes al excremental and superfluous expelled
matter. Therefore it is very wholesome for the falling sickness, palsy, turning
sickness, for getfulnes, and for the cold diseases of the spleen, rains,
bladder, womb, sinews, al joints, other sinewy parts. But one sort is natural
or mineral and an other of the sea, that runs out of Isles rocks (called
Naphtha) of the which kind, that which is somewhat white is counted the best:
the (alchichil) or old claret, as much as is possible let them sok in the oil.
Dry them by the selves in cases (caczobis. The Munks upon Mesuen: where also is
red shortly after, Caczola for a Cucurbita or body of a Bulcasis) which stopped
very exactly, set it up keep it: for the elder it is the stronger: Mesue as
Syluius traslateth him, whose words also I have written here out of his
annotacios. Oil (saith he) of tiles is so subtle, that more subtle, more hot
and more effectuous in cold diseases, the is oil of balm. It provokes vrin, it
breaks the stone, kills worms: it is holsom for the singing of the ears
coming of a gros wind for the palsi, the crap (spasmo cynico) the sciatica or
ach in the hukle bones, the gout in the knees, fete the greues of the other
joints, being drunk or anointed upon ye place: but let it be drunk mixte with a
little portion of some water convenient for the disease. The making of this oil
is described also Rasis in his Antidotari or preservative and by Bulcasis in
his book entitled Servitor: whereas Bulcasis prefers new tiles, yt never yet
touched water, because they drink in ye oil better: he bids divide the into
pieces of an inch bigness, putreth the so in a vessel of glass, or glased, well
claied yt the third part thereof remain empty. The fire must be made soft at ye
first, but so yt it touch ye bottom, encresed by little little. First shall a
water issue forth afterward an oil (read Bulcasis) which must be gathered
guaiacu many other things. Oil also of Chamaemel, Nard also, which is called
Benet or blessed of Mesuae: but this (of tiles) is ye chief, of so is called
petroleu or oil of stones. These Sylu. This is a stinking oil, but it pierces
passingli. Io. Iac. de Maliis. Read certain things before, where we have entreted
generally of ye destillatio of oils by descecion, out of Vlst. Bull. bids to
dip in the pieces every one of an i^che bigness (a dram, Rasis) made red
hot, in most old oil, and when they are quenched to take them out of y^
oil and when they are al sowhat gross beaten, to put them into one or mo
stillatory vessels: which he calls belies, so that.ii. parts of ye vessel
or more be filled. He bids also to take heed that ye fire come not nie to
this oil (while it is destilled) because it will easily be set on fire, and
hardly be put out. Afterward again new pieces of tiles, dressed as before, to be
destilled, till oil enough be gathered: which he bids to be kept in a vessel
with a narow mouth: most diligently stopte with wax Rasis describe.

The oil that they cal commonly Balsamyn (of spik) raises up sodely them that
lie in the falling Alexander Benet.

This oil is made also with certain other things mixed with it, as I found in a
certain written book, the words whereof I will rehers here. Take break into little
pieces red tiles very old or new, but yt never touched water, they being made
red hot quech them in oil of olives, or else, y^ is better, in oil of bays, by
by make the red hot again, theiwer queshed, if any of it be left, if not, put
new unto it to the measur of a fingar. Afterward put to it Castorei, and
Spicknard, or in the steed of it few, of ether of them one part: Costi two
parts. When this are punned, mixed them with the tiles in a Cucurbita or belly,
which thou shalt dig in horse dong about. rx. days. At length thou shalt
destill it, increasing the fire by little and little. The first liquor is good,
the second better, but the third of a red colour is best. This oyll is good
against Cynical Cramp, being anointed thereupon or drunk, also the Sciatica,
the griefs Ammoniack, dissolveth in short space the impostumes and hardnesses
of the splien. It is of force against the falling sickness and the obstruction
or stopping of the nose, being put into ye noosthrilles. It heats the brain,
confirms the memory, asswageth touth ache. Being put into ye womb, it
provokes the flowers. It brings out the child newly conceived ether dead or
alive. It opens the mouth of the veins, dissolveth the lunges from gros
humours. A few drops of it drunken with syrop of Rooses, helps them that
draw their breeth peinfully. It consumes marvelously the water descending
down to the eyes, that is to say the disease called Suffusion. If fishers
anoint their nets therewith, they shall entyse innumerable fishes. Iron
moystened therein and put to the fire shall burn streigth way. It kills
wornes whersoeuer they be. Being made hoot in an egg shell or other vessel,
may be dropped Rasis in Antidotary attribute and Benet, that is, that which is
destilled of only tiles oil. That is couted the best (saith Rasis) that is very
red, of a strong smell, and of a subtle substance.

Oil of lead: Loke before, whereas we have reher sed Vlstadius words of
Quinessence.

Amber by an artificial means of siething is turned into an oil of his oun
colour. Ge. Agricola In died it is possible to make oil of Amber, after the
same manner as of Jet, whereof we have written The Germains call them by a comun
name Agstein, giving only the difference of black unto Jet. Cardan supposes
that Camphora also is of ye same kind, only because yt this, that the perfume
of Amber received in a moist cloth, gives afterward the smell of Camphora in
it: which notwithstanding did not appear so to me as I did prove it for a
trial.

Brimston anointed druck takes away scabbednes, leprosy and the french
pockes. But with Card. But his books of ye french disease, I suppose are not
yet cum forth in print. Salt coteineth an oyll in it if it be mixed with the lyme
or clay called Bitumen. Wherupo Arrianus declares, amongst the Ichthiophagi,
the men that live only by fyshe, in his history of Ind, howe they make an oyll
of salt. That may be an argument also that the Olive tries delyte in the Sea
Bitume mixed with it. Car.

For the making of oil of Brimston, a ma must chose out yt which is pure never
touched the fire, chiefly alive of an ashy colour.) This oil is made many ways
at Rome, by sublymacio descecion. c. It is good for many things, chiefly for
fistulas, for ye healing of ye wheels of ye moutes excells most of all. For
take and wet the end of a feather or other like thing, as some young and tender
spring of a try or herb, and touche the wheels once or twyse only therewith,
and by and by they shall be killed healed. The Munkes upon Mesue.

Take a vessel of glass (as Maithaeolus Senen. writes in his book of the
French evil) not much unlike to a little bell, daubed with potters clay, hang
it the space of a cubit from the ground, by a wire of bras or iron, under ye
which thou shalt set

Brimstone that never came ny the fire, or most yelowe, while it is brent,
gives a thick smoke to be received in a bell of glass or of stoone. Wherein
thorough the gros vapour an oyll gathered together destilleth into a large plain
vessel, in ye midst whereof the brimstone builded upon a little vessel is brent.
Other beating the brimstone consume the fyry substance of if, with Aqua vitae
set on fire, and after devil that which remains, like unto oyll of
Philosophers. Other sis yelowe Brimstone pound, with a slow fire, with.ii.
vnces of odoriferous wine, till the wine be consumed, (as it is red in Luminari
maiore.) Syluius.

Put one part of quick brimston into.ii. parts parts of oil of Lynsied, beat
them well and diligently together, and let them stand in horse dong ii. dais in
a vessel well shut, it shall be clear fair.

But all these oils seem to be prepared only for this purpose that they may be
ministered without the body: I here say that there be certain practicioners
Syluius makes mention, is first consumed by Aqua vitae set on fire, then
destild by sublimacion, it may be more safely ministered with in the body then
the other.

Oil of Vitriol or copros is desired of chemists and likewise of physicians,
and as a most secrete matter is hid. I will put here some descriptions

Make the Vitriol in to lime, as thou know, then pour burning water unto it,
so that it exceed the Vitriol a little: then seperate the burning water by
destillacion in a phiall or in a crooked still, or out, urge the spirits of the
Vitriol by little and little, increasing the fire more and more, till al ye
spirits be over passed. This liquor destilled put it again into some one of
the.iii. manner of vessels aforsaid, destil it in a kettle full of water, until
whatso ever watery thing is in it, be separated, which thou shalt endeavour to
bring to pas by al the wit thou hast, that the watrines be clean gotten out,
ether by a lebek, (with a nose) or a blind lembek, whose nether skirt have a
hollow gutter or circle ether by it self, or with waters convenient for every
disease. This oil I have tasted my self, it is swiet, pleasant, and strong, in
colour (if I remember well) somewhat white.

An other way. Take.iiii. pounds of Vitriol of Rome, dry it in an earthen
vessel till it wax red, after when it is beaten put it into a belly of glass
diligently defenced with clay (as the manner is for Aqua fortis) and first
destilit with a soft fire, encresing the degre of the fire by little and little,
until Acetosae, somewhat warm, putting unto it half a dram of spices
Diamargariton, which is cold if it may be gotten.

An other way to make oil of Vitriol against in rabble diseases. Put as much
Vitriol of Rome as ye will in a belly to wax red, with such a fire as is used to
Aqua fortis, for ye space of.xxiiii. hours, as loge as the water comes forth
without spirits, and more if it be not made red, ever kepinge the same fire.
When as it is now becomed red, take away ye head (lembek) and the receiver, and
keep the water for secret uses to be spoken of. After beat ye Vitriol and put
it in a belly with.v. parts of quintessece of wine, that the Vitriol may be
soked: The belly Aqua fortis is made. So shall run out first the Aqua vitae, and
at length the fire increased, oil of Vitriol shall follow. Then thou shalt
separate the Aqua vitae from the oil, putting a head to the belly wherein both are
contained, setting a receiver without, with a fire of Aqua fortis. morning, and
forbid them to receive any meet before.iiii. hours be past. Against a cotinual
ague give.viii. drops, with half an uncle of Rose water, in the morning as is
said and likewise also against other diseases, Dosin, that is the quantity of
the receipt, unto strong men thou may give.viii. drops, to men of men
strength five, to such as be weak iiii. c. In this oyll if thou dissolve
Marchasit, it shall change silver, and tinge it in all degries.

An other way for the same, that it may be the Crucibulorum glased within as
much Vitrioll of Rome as thou wilt: and destill it in a fornace, as is before
said, with a fire of Aqua fortis and there shall run out a white water of
Vitriol: After when it cease, thou shalt increase the fire, and a grien water
shall follow, which when it hath left thou shalt make a most strong and vehement
fire, both above and beneth, and a red oil shall issue out. Change ever the
receiver according to liquors in one vessel, seperate the waters afterward from
the oil by destilling them, and the oyll shall remain in the belly. This
separatio is made ye belly stading upright (with a head and a receiver) the
first destillacion of ye oil, the belly lying ouerth warth, as it is said. If
thou dip a little dry woul or bombase in water of Vitriol of Rome, and there with
thouch any kind of diseases of ye mouth, thou shalt easily heal them: Out of a
written book of a certain friend: he seems here to mean that water yt
Vitriol, which is more precious and pure, and is kept to be ministered given to
drink against inward diseases.

Of the virtues of oil of Vitriol, out of ye same written book. Drink Malmsy
with a little oyll of Vitriol, continually for the space of.v. or.viii. dais, it
riddeth a man from all obstructions, it purges the blood, and drives away the
stone. It heals the il scab, if it be drunk with water of fumitory,
Myrobalana condite. It renews a ma with water of endiue. It heals all manner
of griefs of the head, with water of Maioram, or Buglos, or Melissa: also the
turnsicknes, if it be contained any space. With water of Agresta it heals al
manner of diseases, the body being first purged. It restores the memory with
the water of Acorus or Fenell. It mouith a man to sleep, with the sied of Letis
or Popy. It is good for melancolyck persons with water of Bublos or Borage. It
cures with water of wyld few. It purges the body with Aqua vitae. It heals
ye palsy with water of wyld mint, or sage, Hyssop, the cramp with water of
Sage: the sickness of quaking with water of Basilicus, diverse inward diseases
with water of Trifolium, all feblenes of the eyes with water of Fenell: the
reum from the head with water of Lily, ye catar with water of Adiantu Hyssop, the
cough, also the disease of the side with water of Platain the Pleuresis with
water of maiden hear, the feblenes Diarhodon. It stints ye flux of the belly
with the water of Plantain: the co lyck with water of Few. With water of
wormwod it resistith venomous bytings. It heals al manner of impostumes and
dropsy, continuing it. It is good for the limes that be resolved, if it be
Tamarindis: with water of Radish and and sea bremble, it expels the stoone,
opens the stoppinges of theines. It heals all agues with water of Agresta,
certain kinds of leprosy, cotinuing the use of it. This is the true potable
gold, and the true Seladyn or Chelidonia, more also in weigth it gives not
place to gold, it hath the same as many virtues as potable gould. A little of it
with a little water of Roses drunk, restores ye

An other manner of oyll of Vitriol, which a certain old man a practicioner in
Heluetia used, mixting.ii. or.iii. drops with Triacle, and bidding the to sweet
after they had drunk it, in a bed.iiii. or. v hours, so that they put not out
so much as a fingar, by the which medicine I know many too be cured of him
from diseases hard to be cured. c. When he died I saw the oyll which me
thougth was of somewhat a white colour or duskish, perauenture because of the
little pieces of silver that Vitriol, or as much as ye list in a large earthen
vessel glased, and fenced without every where roud Vitriol many enough from
above in the very vessel, and leave it so till the Vitriol be clean brought to
lime, that no moisture or vapor at all remain in it, and that now it have
gotten a redish or yelowish colour, nor any vapour or spirits seem to ascend
from it any more. For except ye Vitriol be very dry, oil effectual strong
enough should not be drawn out of it, but mixed with a certain white fleum. When
as therefore it is sufficiently brought into lime, put away the fire, and
when the vessel is couled by little and little, take Vitriol as well as ye ca
with a knife or otherwise: although it is no harde matter to get it out of a
glased vessel. The Vitriol take out, break it small, put the pieces into an
erthen belly, which the potter, as be spoken, hath made of ye best earth, and
wonderfully well baked, so strong that it my be able to abide a vehement fire
in a with clay, and yt, ii. or.iii. fold, yt is, first dried parieted again,
again. The form of the fornace shall be in this sort. This fornace shall be
butlded. 4 square, in the top a little imbosed vaulted roud in the midst of ye
top of ye arch shall be made a hole or smoking vent, so large, y^ every hour or as
oft as nead shall require, coals may be put conveniently into ye fornace by it,
with a log iron fire shouel, to put in the coals getlely charily wtall yt they
may slide down about the belly in such wise yt it be not hurt. In the. 4.
corners also above must be left holes or spirits should brethe out. This clai
must be suffered to be dried, before ye begin the business. Moreover there must
yet.ii. holes be made in the ii. contrary sides of the fornace (not in yt side
yt the belly looks out at, nether in the contrary, but in the other two. These
also must have their stopples to shut the with al, yt the heat may be kept in.
The use of these holes, yt the coals which are put in at the top of ye valt may
be hadsoly disposed with some iron prog for the purpose put in at ye holes,
ordered in such wise yt his full strength, and this is a token of perfection.
Therefore thou shalt let the fire to go out and the fornace once couled, take
away the receiver, and turning it in thy hands, and inclining it now to one
side, now to an other, gather all the drops together that cleue unto the sides,
and the oil or liquor so gathered, pour it into a vessel of the best Venice
glass: for it is danger least the commun glass should be eaten through of it,
for it consumes and eteth like Aqua fortis, This liquor that practicioner

Of the burning or broylinge of Chalcanthum, that is Vitriol, and his kinds.
Bulcasis, writes in a manner the same things in his third book of the
preparation of medicines, which we have declared afoore in his preparation for
the making of Vitriol Zimor, also he teaches to prepare after the same manner.
But amongst diverse ways of this oil of Vitriol, I like that best which I
described last. For the liquor that is destilled that way is the sharpest of
all, and also the tartest, in so much that it may be called vinegar of metal,
as me thinks: Wherefore of certain it is highly commended for the quenshing of
thirst in somer time, one drop of it put into a draught of wine, like as I
found in a certain doutch writ book, where as this also is added: Vitriolum
is

An other way out of the same book. Stiep Vitriol in Aqua fortis, which may
draw out all the fatness thereof, from the which if thou separate the Aqua
fortis by destillacion, an oyll shall remain. But perauentur this way is to
dangerous that a liquor so destilled should be received within the body. But
without the body and to the wheels or

I remember I have red in sum place in Lulli{us} in his work of Quintessence,
where he makes mecion of oil or Quintessence of Vitriol. But in what sort it
should be made, I could never yet find in any book that went abroad: so
greatly have they all kept secret this thing as a marvelous mystery. For the
description which I will declare here after out of the book of Nicolas Massa
upon the disease of Naples, can not be received within ye body.

When the Chalcanthum, that is the Vitriol, or Mysis that is Vitriol of Rome is
brent an oyll most sharp hot is drawn out of it by the force of the fire, in
vessels of glass wherewith if a man touche wartes when they are cut or wounded,
they will go away. The same if a ma taste it, it strikes the tong like as it
were a hot iron. Yet the use of it is to dry boils within that be out of hoop
of recovery, where as they be not much filthy, as it chances in certain that be
diseased of Phthoe corrupcion matter without grief. It serves also to cut
Cardanus. The same coniectur we write before, that oil of Mysis or arsnick
anointed without may seem to deliver fro poyso. The spirit or Quintesseuce of
Vitriol is praised of certain practicioners against the falling sickness and
Apoplexia or benumbing of senses.

Shomakers inck lowseth the belly, both in honey and meed drunk to the weight of
a dram, also in wine, specially the oyll thereof. George Agricola, Vitriol doth
kill not only men but tries: wherefore it must be made in sum out syd or place
where no man dwells. Albucasis other show the way of making it, Brassauolus
(In mine opinion not the oil, but ye smoke of Vitriol while it is brent with
fire prepared unto destillacio is so hurtful.) And again, of Chalcanthu, yt is
vitriol oil is made so burning, that we use it for potetiall fire: for it is of
a caustical, you is a burning nature, with a knief anoited with Olives. While
ye oylis preparing, ye must take heed of the smoke: because it doth not only
kyl men but also the tries that be ny, it dries the up. The trial whereof
Fraciscus de Mote the notable bone setter whose tries of his archard every one
died with the smoke of Vitriol while he prepared the oyll thereof.

The oil of Vitriol is marvelous, burning like a hot iro without grief, is
made in this manner, xxx. vnces of Vitriol of Rome or of Cypres, Salnitrum,
Bocia clayed for the fire of an alchemists fornace, and by the fire thou shalt
have the oil incresed in the receiver: which is a marvelous Cauterium or
burning thing, and hath no pere in any operation, and chiefly in taking away of
wens great wartes. But the receiver must be great, if thou wilt make the
forsaid oil: Nicolas Massa in Naples, and Thomas Philologus, who takes.xx.
drames of Vitriol, but of Alum and salt of ether. xxiiii A water of diverse
metals (out of a certain dutch book) for the leprosi, spots dunnes of the eyes.
The filing of silver coper, stiele, gould, of every one as much as ye can
get: the first day put it in vryn while it is warm made by a boy or wench
that is a maid, the next day in the crumbs of hot bread: the third in a white
of an egg: the fourth in the milk of a Then put all this into a still
destill them with a little fire, and kip it. For the virtue of it is
incomparable. It is good against the leprosy, and al the spots in the face, and
it procures unto the face a youthful brightness, it makes also clearness of ye
sight this shalt thou reed otherwise in the Addicions upon the Breuiarium or
Bridgment of Arnold de Villa Nona. 1. 18.

Of Aqua fortis and such like.
E described a little before a certain water like Aqua fortis, destilled of
Vitriol, Sal Nitrum, and Alum against great wartes. c. But the commun Aqua
fortis also, and the simple oil of Vitriol, if a man put a drop of them in to a
wen or wart first cut, they take it away: of the which thing I made a trial
in my self upon a sied wart on my fyngars end, whereinto when I had first cut
it with a razer, I Aqua fortis, and although it wet not away by by, yet within
a few weeks is was gon Aqua fortis or to separate metalles is thus made. One
part of Sal nitrum, liquid or molten Alum (that they call roche.iii. parts:
sand half a part, when they are dried diligently and purged with the fire, let
them be destilled in a vessel of glass. It is gathered by it self, that which
issues out first, at length when the glass looks like a safro colour,
increase the fire and an other follows: and yet if thou take it in water of
the fountain or well, it is yet so sharpe that never the les it dissolveth
silver, and separateth it from Goulde. It is separated in this wise. Take a
little quantity of ye water drawn out, and put into it the weight of. xii grains
of very pure silver* and set it upon ashes till the silver be dissolved. This
shall send down into the bottom of the vessel, grounds like unto fine lime,
which taken away the pure water that remains, put it to the hole water from
the which Aqua fortis but of another manner of making.) But seeing it vanishes
away easili and consumes, it shall be kept in a glass diligently shut. To a man
that imagines how great strengthes it hath, which taking Ammoniak and Nitrum,
with Chalcanthum (yt is coproos) and Alum molten in equal porcions, putting
unto them at last one fourth part of roust: this made It yet a man ad and put
to a little of the obstracite stone, called Smiris wherewith they polish
precious stones, thou shalt have more plenty of water and better, because it
will not be burned. These things therefore received and found true by trials,
let us see what should be cause that this water becomes so strong: for
manifest experience teaches, that the drier part attenuated and fined by the
force of the fire, receives a firye and a fretting or gnawing strength. But
why burns not Chalcanthum by the force of the fire, for as much as it
turns the driest part into humour, it is most sharpe, and strikes the tongue
like fire. Cardan. Let no manne think that this liquor perteineth Chalcanthum
or Coproos an ounce of Aqua fortis: mixed it with an ounce and a half of
Roosewater, soores of the throat, palace, jaws and lips, let them be touched
twice a day with a little Cotton tide to the top of a stick and moistened in
this liquor: Thom. Philologus.

Certain diverse manners of Aqua fortis, maiste thou read after, where we shall
write of Mercury sublimated. Burning water, that a candle ma^ burn in the

uncle of Plantaine water, and with a little wode wouldipte therein rub the
teethe, and they shall become Furnerius.

An other like out of the same book. Sall Ammo niak, Sall Gemmae of ether. iii
ounces, Sugar Alum an ounce and a half, commone Salt, an ounce. When they are
beaten destil them in a lembecke of glass: and with the liquor drawn out
thereof rub the teeth with a stone, and after wash the mouth with a little white
wine. Read before in the end of the Cosmeticall waters, the same description,
but without common salt, the use whereof is declared without destillacion.

Aqua Angelica of a marvelous virtue against blearednesse, Cankar, and burning
with fire. Three ounces of vn^lekt lime and half a pound of rain water, let
them stand together in a vessel of glass or tin a.iii. days. Then

more in a vessel well covered. Afterward strain them tenderly through a
linen clothe till it be clear. Then put to it.x. drawmes of Sall Ammoniak
the whitest thou cast Filtrum. This water heals the clothe or spot (La Toil
in French, that is the web) of the eyes, three drops thrice a day dropped
into them, continuing till the eye be made whole. It takes away also the
tears of the eyes, the redness and blearednesse, also the Cankar and burning

it a little warmed. Furnerius.

Syringe or Spout might break the stones of the bladder, supposes such a
one might be received Tecolithos, or the stones of creuisses. c. as we have
rehearsed before, in the tretize of y^ virtues of destilled liquors generally. I
if I may ad coiectur to coniectur, I would destill ether this or other stones
or glass, with the juice of Parietary.

Certain chymistes, do praise highly the spirit or Quintessence of berill,

Of cirtain massy things, as quicksiluer precipitated or killed, and the same
and arsn^ck sublimated.
LEt us ad here certain massy and hooll medicines, which also be sublimated or
sod in glass vessels at the fire, although it be almost besides our matter,
when as we purposed to entreat only in this book, ofliquors separated from a
grosser substance. Yet because they be a few medicines and sublimated (that is
they are prepared and made with like in Car. writes in his fifth book of
Subtlety. Take Alum, Calcanthum (that is coproos) of ether like much: put
thereto salt as much as one of them half as much, destil this together in glass
vessels. Put a pound of this water (yt is of aqua for tis comunly called).iii.

they be well mixed. Then put the powder somewhat groos into a Praecipitatu an
uncle a half, rosed honey.ii. vnces, mixed them diligently. With this medicine
without doubt thou shalt dry clese a filthy sore and roten (wherupo the flesh
shall after begin to breed) where as other clensing things, as those made of ye
juice Apiu, or of ye juice of Cynoglos shall do no good.

Nicolas Massa in his book of the French disease, calls Mercurium
praecipitatum, Angelical powder, because of the marvelous as it were a divine
operation of it in the Frech pockes, which he his self hath not seldom tried.
This medicin (saith he) dries, with a certain gentle eating of the soft and
superfluous flesh, and that without grief, removing also the evil secret
quality of the soores, and chiefly of the disease of Naples. It digests any
matter, and purges it, lets the Corrosio of gnawyng the canker: it
dissolveth groos matter, hard and raw, after ye opening of gummes. And no
medicine is to be compared with this in this disease. For if thou continue in
the use of it, it leads unto the perfect breding of the skin, as I have
oftentimes tried: and it is excellent in the evil sores of the yard. It is
made in this wise. But a pound of quick silver in a little belly of glass, and
power as much Aqua fortis unto it. Then put the belly in a pot and ashes in
Mercurium calcionated red. Grynde this, if any part of the quick silver
remain with it, put the said powder in a cleen vessel of bras at the fire, be
consumed. This powder may thou use to all the forsaid diseases and specially
to the sores of the yard, of other places, where rottennes and much il matter
lets the knitting or heling up: and in fistulaes dissolve it with wine, and
cast it in by a brazen pipe, for it works marvelously.

Moreover water to separate gold from silver is thus made. Two pounds of
Vitriol of Rome Roche Alum.xvi. ounces: Sal Nitrum a pound: let them be put in
a crooked belly (writhe backward)

But this angelical powder had I of a certain old Alcumist, and I made it
before Iohannes de Vigo ever made any mention of it. Thus far Massa: and
part Thom. Philologus out of him.

Of the making and commodities of this red powder, read Iohannes de Vigo in
his fifte book of Additionum: where he bids that the vessels rereceiuer
shall be thrice as big as the bealye, the xxxviii. leaf. b. And that white
found with this powder, is silver sublimated from the red: like as is what so
ever is yelowe or of a Saffron colour. And also in his book entitled
Capiosa, the. Clxiii. lefe. a.

Powder of Mercury (saith Matthaeolus Senensis, in his book of the way to
heal the French disease) is made in this manner. Take.iiii. pouds of water,
wherewith gould is separated from silver: Acetosae, of ether ii. ounces, the
next morrow early take the waters from thence and put new unto it, and set it to
the fire in a vessel of bras or earth: when they are hot, cease not to stur them
about with an iron or woden spattle or s^is until al become powder and that
when thou list make such a recept against ye french disease as well that is
Flegmatike as Melancholy. Take electuarii Conciliatoris (this is made of diverse
cordial medicines, and spices, precious stones, pearls, gould, silver,
Camphora, Ambra, Mosch: is described of him, Differentia. 196) half a scruple,
perls, hyacincts, of ether.v. grains: the powder of Praecipitatum. v. grains:
powder of D^amuscum, Diamargariton, of ether half a scrupull: Make.v. pills
(let the be gilded, Thom, Philolog{us} Terrae Sigillatae and Boli Armeniae of
every.iii. grains,) let these be taken of the paciet an hour before day: let
him keep his bed.v. hours. Shortly, believe me, shall the french pocks be
avoided with this receipt. For the fleum and blak choler also shall vanish away
both by vomit and downwards. Besides this there are very many kinds of
diseases that we have cured with such a powder. For it puts not away only
matter and rotten flesh being strawed upon, but also without Tuneci, which
they call Carduum Benedictum, or with an electuarye of precious stones, if it be
not yet confirmed stablished in the body, it drives it away meruelouslye.
Many also that be Limphatici, that is, mad, or Melancolike, whom they
believed commonly to be resorted unto of Devils, we have cured them with ye
same. What make I mani words almost dead of the quartain, putting unto it
Saccharum Buglossatum or triacle, or Mithridatium, some digestion made, an hour
before the fit, in.v. or vii. grains weight, according to the age and streght
of the body of the diseased. Yea also it is holso to be ministered amongst the
griefs of the yard great guts: for we have cured some that avoided their dung
by their mouth: leaning to the moniments and sayings of Paulus Aegineta, that
saith, how certain phisitios have ministered in that disease Athesin, did
prepare Mercurium praecipitatum with gould, and sold it like gold, which had
such virtue, to eat out gnawinge or grief. Se those that we shall declare
about the end of those that follow next after.

How Praecipitatum is made, which is a remedy against all diseases growing of
the rottennes of humours, out of a certain write book. Make a water of equal
porcions of Vitriol of Rome and Sal Nitrum, with a head and receiver, in the
which thou shalt put the sixt-part of the weighte of raw Mercury, yt is to
say, if there be. 3. pouds of Vitriol and Sal nitrum, put.vi. vnces of Mercury.
Afterward suffer the water with his spirits to descend in to the receiver.
Then avoid all that is in the receiver into a clean belly and that is claied:
under the which put a head with a receiver, and destill it again: and when the
water is in the receiver, put it again in the belly in the which the Mercury
remained. Thou shalt repeat this till the Mercury wax red. Then when it is red
wash it with Cordial waters, as Borage Balm and such like. Mercury so
prepared shalt thou give to sick men within their bodies, in this manner. If the
body be very strong, give.x. grains if it be mean.viii. weakes, five: if it be
a child, consider diligently what is necessary to be done. But utterly mixed it
with triacle: so shalt thou give it to him that is infected with poison,
droysy, pestilece or taken with other infirmity. If a sound man once a year,
or every third year, as it shall seem Praecipitatum with a dew digestion of
the humours, that is with a preparation of purgation, he shall prevent many
diseases. Note that in the stead of Mercury thou may use Amal gama made of
six parts of quick silver and of one part of gold and so shalt thou work
greatter woders. (This Amalgam must be made red like as Mercury alone with
Aqua fortis: although Mattheolus Senensis, as we declared a little before, wry
teeth that the powder Mercurial may be made of Aqua fortis.) And mark that
thou may heal wounds with the first or second Praecipitatum, which thou
shalt use thus: Put of it about the wound and within. And this is a great
secret. And know that in.iiii. destillacions thou shalt bring this to pas:
which done, put it in a clean belly in the fire, that the spirits (that is
of the Hydrargyri that is the quick silver sublimated mixed with the
Praecipitatum) as much as is possible may depart, then make as is above
specified.

Of the sublimacion of quick silver, thou shalt read Bulcasis in his third
book of his work that he calls Servitor. But of the use of it in burninges
and seerynges, and for the French disease, read Nicolaus Massa the sixte book,

Quick silver (says Cardan) is sublimated in this manner. Put Quick silver and
Shomakers inck of ether like weight, and with most sharpe white vynegar mixed
it so long, till the quick silver be seen no more: then in a vessel of glass
parieted with clay sis it till it grow together. If any do run abroad cum
not together, break it again in a mortar with vinegar put to it, and sis it
yet again. They use quick silver so excoct for painting faces. But it makes
the ties fall out and briedeth a stinking breath. But for the use of silver and
for the art of Goldsmythes, it is proffitable not in few things. Of the
sublimation of Mercury, Marchasyt, Magnesiae, Tutiae, look in Geber Summae

Auicenna makes mention of Arsnick sublimated. Arsnick or Orpment (says
Albertns Magnus in his book of Metalles) is of the kind of Stones, of a
Citriny colour and reed, the which stone the chymici call one of the spirits.
It hath the nature of Brymstone in heating and drying. Being calcinated with
the fire it waxes black, and by and by with sublimation it becummeth most
white. If it be sublimated three or four times it purchases such strength,

Tartarum, that is the dried lies of wine, how it is sharpened, that it may
have marvelous virtues for certain medicines (by the destillacion of burning

A certain practicioner told me that he did dres and prepare the stoone called
Cyanence, that is, Lazulus in such wise, that it might bring up more strongly
and more safely black choler from melancholy men and those that were mad. And
first if I remember me well he said it must be calcionated, then sublimated:
or first that the best Aqua vitae should be destilled upon it, put in a
Cucurbita or belly, then sublimated, and be sprinkled or watered with Aqua
vitae. vi. times destilled,

Salt that it may be more pure to be put to medicines or meates, after it is
mixed with water let it be destilled by a Filtrum, and again let it be sod till
the water be consumed. The same purged in a gouldsmithes Crucibulo with a
great fire is molten and fused. When it is so molten, let it be mixed with
Salt Alcalis (or in stead of it with the white gall of glass (for there is
black also) which some call the norishmente of glass, other Zoza as Sal Gemmae.
When these are beaten they use them for Chrysocolla, or also they put a little
of Chrysocolla unto it. But this mixture hath to much sharpnes, and consumes
some of ye gold. Wherefore they use it only to courser works, but to finer they
use only Borax. There be so that mixed Borax, commun salt molten and salt
Alcalis together in equal porcions, and in secret matters count it for
Borax. But these are besides the matters perteining to physic.

Soot how it is gathered of pitch and butter, thou shalt read in Dioscorides

Of certain other not Alchymisticall or not destilled or sublimated medicines,
but cunningly and wittilye prepared by other and diverse ways.
THe medicines that we have hitherto described are all comprehended under the
name of lyquors Corollarium or addition which are not very common, nor to be
met with every where. But no man ought to look hear for a full or exact and
general way of composition at our hands: when as we shall teach only a few,
and such as shall come to mind by the way, and all these as it were by
matters besides our necessary purpose. diverse kinds and ways of making and
preparing of medicines, let him goo to the books of Iac. Siluius and other of
this matters.

Of diverse Oils.
I Se the most part of odoriferous and precious oils to be sod in a double
vessel It is an easy matter to pres out an oil that shall be like the plant in
savor Dioscorides the flours were poured into pure oil.iiii. dais, were set out
in the sun, then the oil being pressed out, most diligently, as much more of
the new flours was added, and again it was set out in the hot Sun,

The second way it stands in pressing out, in some things without any help
of Art, as Myrobalano, in other that be dry and odoriferous by their own
accord, as the Nutmeg, that is light stiept in wine and pres out with a pres.
So may a manne draw oil out of spices. But they that be odoriferous, and lack
the substance of oils, as flours, upon Almondes and under them, and lay in
order the leaves of Almondes and of the flours by course, and keep them so
lunge pressed together, till the smell of the flowers may be vanished away, then
put them away and in their steed lay other flours after the same sort, and
do this so oft (for there is not one way in all) till the Almonds have gotten
a very great smell, then have them to the pres. A man must first blanch them
and parch them a little at the fire. By this means the oil

The third way is by destillacion (whereof it is said before.) Cardan.

Unto the most part of oils that be to be sod and made by fire, they put some
wine, by the which means they smell les of adustion bretnes, they be sod till
the wine be consumed. But flowers and such as be of a sclender substance, it
is Hyperico or S. Ihons wurt.

Iasminum is made of.ii. ounces of flours of Iasmin oil, which afterward is
sod with a slow fire.

Oil of swiet Almondes, hooll Cloves being added thereunto, let it be set in
the sun.viii. days, it shall be marvelous swiet smelling. But thou shalt reed
diverse ways in Mesue, and in the annotacions of Syluius upon the same, of the
pressing out of oyll of Almondes, which also may be applied to diverse other
fruits and siedes from the which oyll is pressed out. We use the oyll of
Almondes am. (that is bitter) in stead of oyll of ye Brassauolus.

I am wont to make an oyll of siedes and the reed codes of Capsicum, or
Cardamomu Arabicu: other of the codes thereof alone, put in oyll, which is wont
to be used in place of oyll of Pepper, or also of Euphorbium, if it be put in in
more abundance, for it is far more vehement then Pepper. With us (they call it
reed Pepper, sum of the comun people call it Siliquastrum, but not ryghtly) but
few of Cardan: which I praise not. Nether was the^ ever any man said that
fire was venomous, burn it never so much: when it hath no venomous quality
besides. I have my self used both the siedes of this Capsicum and the codes,
without harm in potage but in a small quantity.

An oil of the kirnels of cherries cleanses ye face, takes away spots and
frakenes: it is good also for the gout, and the stone of the reins bladder. It
is made as oil of swiet Almondes. Furne.

Oyll of hay is thus made. Let the hay be set on Rogerius.

Oil of whet is made between two iron plates moderately made hot (or as Rasis
hath, between a marble and a thick plate of iron,) but much better as I hear,
by destillacion: it is commended Furnerius and other. Sum say also that it is
good for fistulas, the chames or chinks of the skin: Mat. Read before emogst ye
oils destilled.

Oyll of Ivy beries, drawn out like as out of Bay beries, is good against the
gout of a could cause, or of obstructio or stopping: and it restores the

A marvelous oil of Hypericon or saint Iohns wurt. Three vnces of the tops of
Hypericon are in sufficient, afterward sis it in a double vessel well stopped,
and pres it out strongly. Likewise stiep new Hypericon, sis it and press it,
put to it.iii. vnces of Turpintyn, six vnces of old oyll, a scrupull of
Saffron. Sis it till the wine be consumed. This oyll (saith Syluius) no man
knows who was the author of it: Yet Galen writes that Tart or harsch wine,
wherein the leeues of Androsaenni or Ascyri (which are kinds of Hypericon) are
sold, doth cloose great wounds: and as sum Hypericon hot, dry and of subtle
parts, is wholesome for them to drink that be diseased with ache in the hippes or
Sciatica. Of the which, the virtues of other mixed heer, thou may gather, y^
which oil strengthens, digests and sclendereth. For it is composed of
contrary substances. Sylui. upon Mesuen. Brassa. puts the same discriptio
in Examine simplice. 519. chap. Sum (saith he) put simpely the flowers into a
glased vessel, y^ the oil may be gotten out by it self with the strength Syl.
Thus prepared in a glased or glass vessel, they keep it. But this things are
clearly expounded of Mesue newer authors. This Brassauo. Sum put to it worms
or bowels of the earth, and let it stand a month or more in a wine cellar in
a pot stopped with clay or past, the they sis it by little little in y^ same

red, the taste is somewhat sour. The use of it is for wounds, prickinges and all
kinds of offensions and the swellinges that cum thereupon. Sum use them to the
grievous soores of the legs.

I hear say some do not stiep them in wine, but a finger may suffer, and so put
in a little bag must they be by by tied, and pressed in a little press of wod,

little bag put there in. c. They yeilde for the most part, the.viii. part of the
weight of the nuts, so that one ounce of the nuts give a dram of oil, if the
nuts be sufficiently moystie. A man may warm ye same matter again pres it as
before: but the second time yields very little oil and not so good. It is
better therefore to two extreme irons or ends whereof, consisted of. ii hollow
half spheres, so that when they were pressed together they might hold a Nutmegge,
or a little les, as occasion of the pressing served. The one of the half
spheres was bored through with.iiii. or v. little holes, that the oil might
run out, when the ends of the tongues moderately made hot were pressed together. I
found also this descripcion in a certain written book. Take.ii. pounds of
Nutmegs. Three ounces of Malmesy, wherewith the Nutmegs

There be many ways to make oil of Rooses. It is made ether with oil and ripe
Roses, or both of them unripe, or the one ripe, tother unripe and so there
is.iiii. diverse ways. Some in stead of Rasis in his Antidotario seperato
puts.iii. ways. First. Take a pound of comun oil washed, wherein thou shalt
put the fourth part of Grene Rooses in a glased vessel (of glass rather)
which thou shalt set in the sun for the space of.iii. days (ye.xl. as Aegi
neta hath). Then strain it and put it in a glass. This way is better then
the other. The second: Take oil and Roses as before, and hang the vessel in a
well so that it may be touched of the water: and keep it. The third: Oil and
Roses as before, put them in a glass anointed within with honey, which stopped
thou shalt let it diep in ye earth, where it shall not be touched nether with
water nor other moisture. ii, months. This oil will be better smelling then the
other: These writes Rasis out of Aegineta as it appears. Aegineta bids
in the xx. chap. of the seventh book, unto a Sextarium or wine pint of oil
Omphacinum (made of olives not fully ripe) to put.iii. ounces of red Roses the
nails Mesuae in the. 411. chapt. describes.iiii. ways. First that fresh and
new red roses be set in the sun.vii. days, then let them be sod in a double
vessel.iii. hours: then (the Rose leaves wrong out) let other be put in, and
let them be set in the sun and sod as before. Which when thou hast done thrice,
put to the oil water of infusion of Rooses, Syluius traslateth it, as much as
the oil is, which I like not so well.) So when it is set in the sun.xl.
days, strain it and set it lunge again in the Sun. The second, mixting
with the oil washed the juice of Roses, and the water of their infusion, and the
leaves beaten together: then setting it in the sun with swiet Almondes
blaunshed, exactly beaten in a mortar, leaves of Roses be beaten again, the
make them in little lumps or caakes, and keep them in a hot air.xxiiii.
hours. Then beat the again and kneed them in the mortar very exactly, pouring
unto it a little hot water of infusion of Roses. At length prees out the oyll
with a press, put in a glass covered set it to su. The fourth, y^ it be made
with Sesamum blaunshed after the same manner as with Almondes. But Almondes are
Sesama for ripe. This hath Mesue, where Syluius had it. The first composition
(saith he) of the.iiii. now rehearsed, is used of many: but of the Parisians,
the composition of Nicolas, which shall be declared in his Antidotary. And
again, I hear that oyll of Roses is is made most odoriferous, by putrefying
the roses one month in dung in a vessel well stopped. After the same manner of
commun Mastick, and Roses incarnate and Musk Roses and such like, Cardanus
out of Symeon. There be sum that when the Rooses are beeten, and sod in only
water, say there swims a certain fat foom, which may be streined or
gathered me, that the leaves of Roses new should be sod in water till they be
thick as honey almost, then crushed with a spoon, that the oyll or foom may enter
in to it: but sum water will be mixed also with it, wherefore when it is gathered
in a glass, it is set in the sun ye oil swimming above in ye top is separated.

Oyll of the flowers of Elder purges and makes smouth the skin, strengthens
the sinews, and helps the griefs of them. Furnerius.

Oil of Spick most wholesome for the that have Antidotary of Arnold de Villa
nova.

Oyll of the flowers of Verbascum is made, by settin them in the sun in a glass
(as also of the flowers of Rosemary) most commended praised for the gout of the
fiet of other griefs, specially hot.

Oil of violets is made as oyll of Roses, but of grien oy^l, or oyll of
Almondes or Sasamin: Mesue. Paulus Aegineta makes this oyll of purple Violeth
or Leucoio that is yelowe: or he sets them in the sun covering the vessel
exactly that it breath not through, only ten days, the Violettes in the mean
season thrys changed, and at length he adds dry Violettes.

Of oyll of Tartarum, that is the dry Lies of wine.
OYll of Tartarum devised by Peter Argil lata, serves to cleanse the face and
to smouth it. Tartarum cleaving to the sides of the vessel, white rather then
red made into powder, is stepped in vinegar, after it is folded in a linen
cloothe, then let it be put in Tow moystened with water under the ashes:
after that let it be laid in a dish hielding towad the one side.iii. days:
then shall a certain humour somewhat red destill.

Nicolas way to make oil of Tartarum cleaning Tartaru that is of good wine
beaten, folded in a linen cloth, moysten it well with strong white vynegar:
sis it under hot ashes (burn it) till it wax black, beet it again, keep it in
a vessel lying on the one side inclined eight days, in a cold place, till it
be resolueed into oil, which if it do not, pres it out and keep it. The same
ways doth Mesues make oils of eggs. It were better, when ye Tartaru is calcinated
and put it in a Hippocras bag, as they call it, into a vessel set under it.
Syluius. I find an other certain manner in Furnerius in a French book of
decking, where as he bids to take Tartaru burned and calcinated, as much as
can be taken at two handfuls and tied strait in a linen clout to be burnt
and calcinated in a furnace of Glass, Lyme or Brick: the to be powered into a
good quatitie of water with as much Alum as a nut and to be much stirred
about: then when thou hast let rest.xxiiii. hours, strain this water
(casting

Sum put Tartarum to be calcinated in a new pot in a potters oven, and when
the vessels are all baked then take it out. But I think it should

An other way. Take equal porcions of Tantarum Salnitrum pund, burn them in a
large pot: then grind or break them with a hot iron and put them in a little
bag in a wine celer, that they may destill.

An other. Beat Tartarum and Nitrum in equal parts, mixed them and burn them
that the Nitrum may be consumed. The Tartarum that remains: put in a bladder
(that is a glass like a bladder) hang it in hot water, and it shallbe straight
resolved into oil. An other. Tartarum well washte from the dregs and very well
dried shalt Filtrum: then let it gather into a Iellye: when it is so,
calcinat it again that it may wax more white. So at length shalt thou hang
it in a little bag, as an Hippocras bag in a moist place: lay on some
broad thing for a cover, that no unclean thing fall into it, and setting a
glased pot under it.

Some destill it in a lembeek of glass (that is to say in ashes) from whence a
water runs first, then the fire increased by little and little, the oil.

The use. It is good for all scabs and Ringwormes, it makes the skin white,
clear youthlike. I have scene it used to running soores of the head: to the
which I think that is better where with Nitrum is burned together. It makes
coper also silver white, and puts away spots steins in linne clothes. It is
put to colours to make the ink, of the colour of the bresill wode and other.
Rogerius also. 4. 9: teaches to make oil of Tartarum. This (saith he) cleanses
cloths and spots remaining after birth of a melancholy cause, purges the face.

Of oils of the yelkes of eggs, worms, and Scorpions.
Oil of eggs, out of Rasis. Put the yelks of eggs in an iron kettel upon the
coals till Mesues) is proved with much experience to purge the skin, to heal
thoroughly tetters, ringwormes and other faults of the skin, to breed hear, to
sores boils and fistulaes. Thirty eg yolks or there about hard roasted,
crummed with the hands, let them be parched in an earthen frying pan or
skellet leaden with Mesues. Whereas Syluius in his annotacions saith. It takes
away marvelously the foulness of the skin, and skars, specially that be left in
burnt places, for the most part it smells somewhat strong, yet at the last
destilled by sublimacion, les. It increases hear, as Serapion saith in his
Antidotarie.

Oil of eggs of Nicolas fashion. Fry sodden yolks of eggs with a slow fire
made of coals in an iron skellet, continually sturringe them with an iron
rod, till they be well roasted, press them Syluius) to fry the yelkes raw,
and move them continually with a spoon, till they being roasted, and pressed with a
spoon, give an oil in a vessel hielding, which put in a glass reserved good a
great while. Out of xx. yolks thou shalt draw out in.ii. hours.iiii.
ounces or there about.

oil fodenlye: which is separated with a spoon removing y^ frying pan from the
fire streightway, and pressing ye yolks with the spoon: this some men think to
be

This oil makes skars subtle, dissolveth Tetters and ringwormes: Rogerius. But
Brassauol{us} writes that the Apothecaries do falsely attribute unto this oil
the virtue to put away skars, to the intent they may get eggs from foolish

Arnold. Some tie the yolckes so fried in a linen cloth, and pres them in apres


Oyll of worms or bowels of the earth is commended for the assuaging of
griefs, specially of the sinews joints, also if they cum of the frech
diseases. It is made, the worms purged fro their earthy excrementes, ether by
styping these excrementes through the fingars, or rather by letting them stand
alive in sum vessel where hay is, to crepe: then sod with a little wine in oil
and strained: or set in the sun before they be sod. Sum sis them in water and

Oil of Scorpions (saith Mesues) breaks the stone of the reins and bladdar,
and expels it, being anointed upon the loins, the privy parts where heer

of the rotes of Capers, of every one an uncle, let them be set to sun in a
Sextar of oyll of bitter Almondes, xx. days in a glass stopped: then put in the
Scorpions from ten till.xv. in to the oyll: stop the glass and set them in the
sun again a month. He that as he cummeth out of the bathe, in the.iii.
forsaid parts, and let a little portion of it be put in at the yard every
hour. It is marvelous. Sum had rather used the first, sum ye latter as more
effectual and better wurking. This Mesues. But Siluius in his annotacions
saith, it is prepared also now with old oyll putting to simple medicines good
against poison: and it becummeth an oil of marvelous virtues against al poisons
and pestilece. I know a man with the help of this, that seteth Syluius.

In the secretes of Variguanus, we reed that certain have been presently and
out of hand delivered oyll of Scorpions.

Oyll of Scorpions whose operation is marvelous against poisons specially of
Serpents and other beats, and peculiarly against Napellum, is written by
Matthaeolus Senensis in his sixth book of his commetaries upon Dioscorides
imprinted in Italian, from whence we have translated it into Latin. This oyll
(saith he) anointed upon the pulsing veins, where they appear most, as of
the temples, hands and fiet, and in Hypericon or saint Iohns wurt fresh, (with
the herb and flowers.) Put the oyll into a belly of glay, twyse as big as for
the measur thereof, and when the Hypericon is a little beaten put it in upon it.
Then the vessel being stopped, set it in most fine sand up to the midst where
it may be made hot the hool day of the sun, for the space of ten or twelve
days. After thou shalt put it in Balneo Marie four and twenty hours. Then
pres out the oyll from the herb and put to Hyperici, Chamedryos, Calaminthae,
Cardui sancti, of every one a handful moderately beeten: and put them again
into the bath for.iii. days. Afterward thou shalt strain them and pres them:
and putting to them.iii. handfuls of flowers of Hypericon well picked from the
stalks, and well beeten, set it again.iii. days in Balneo Mariae, and pres it
out as before. This shalt thou repeat.iii. or.iiii. times, till the oyll have
gotten a colour as red as Hypericon, or the husks like to the corns of barley,
wherein the sedes lie hid, in such plenty that it may be equal with the three
handfuls: beat this sprinkling upon them a little white wine, power it into
the said oyll. then bery it in sand in the sun eight days, and straight after
in the bath for.iii. days. Strain and pres it as before. And do this three
or.iiii. times putting in new tenderlynges of Hypericon, till a very sad or
dark reed Scordium, Calamint,, the les Centaury, Carduum sanctum, Veruin,

them into oyll: and put them in a bath for two days. Strein them and pres
them as before. Then take Zedoariae, the root of white Dictamni, Gentian,
Tormentillae, Aristolochiae root, of every one three drams: of fresh Scordium a
handful. When they are beaten together, power them in and let them again, put
into the oil Styracis Calamitae, Belzoi or Laserpitii, of ether.vi. drammes:

Napellum, wherewith those.ii. thieves of Cor^ica were infected, whose history we
recited in ye fourth book, where we made metion of Aconitum, to which place I
send the reader. These writes Matt.

Cardanus thinks that the oil which should be anointed without the body

course, as in gouty greues ether in the feet or other joints, where as it is
jeopardy least the more subtle part of the matter drawn out, the groser be
left behind and made more hard. Moist fomentacions seem to prepare the matter
for the dry, to extenuate and make sclender, to mollefy, to digest, to make
them vapor out: some perauenture do none of these, according to the diversity
of the matter. But dry fomentacions do dry and Filtrum, that is a shred of
woollen cloth. Bladders or like things full of hot water or oil. Cataplasmata
also may be numbered amongst these, which are ministered hot, that is to say
herbs sod, and Milium, Salt, Sand, bran, Otes made hot in a kettle, and
stirred about, are put into a linen clothe or bag. Celsus in some places
commends the juice of hot Salt, and in an other place he saith it is most
wholesome to make fomentacions with moyste Salt. You shall, as he expounds
put a little bag into hot water, and lay it hot to the place diseased:
putting into the bag now and then an iron s^ise hot, sprinkling water
lightly upon it: therefore you shall have.ii. slices redi, that while the one
slis is put into the bag the other may be heated in the fire. In the disease of
the neck called Tetanus, which is the stifnes of the sinews (saith Celsus)
it is necessary to have a moyste and warm fomentacion. Therefore the most
part of men do pour often upon the necks much hot things. That procures
presently ease, but it makes the sinews more apt to receive cold: which ought
to Paronychia or whitflow, or ilgnawing sore upon her out, and many medicines
used in vain, she laid unto it a fomentacion of the mos of a walnut tree sod
in wine, so that she held the sore place a pretty while in that vapour: then
bound part of the mos hot thereupon, and was by and by made whole. A fire brand
also brent, folded in a moist cloth is in stead of a hot fomentacion in
Celsus. I have put Caret or Cumin sede beaten in a bag moystened with burning
water hot, unto the navel of them that were sick of the colic, and have had
oft a pipe. Hyppocrates describes a peculiar vessel for this purpose. Let
them put out their head the while, which are to weak for to abide it, or such
as it is to be feared lest they swooned or chance into over great thirst. c.
Sum in bathes power water or wine, simple or mixte with medicines upon reed
hot tyle stones or dros of iron, or stones. Sweet in bed is provoked with hot
tyle stones folded in moist linen clothes and put in to the bed, or with
tinnen bottles filled with Celsus. Sum put hot ashes, or burning cools
rather in a vessel Matricaria. be laid unto by course. Celsus wills men in
sum place to lay about the places diseased will perfumed with the smoock of
brymston. Hereunto may be referred all such things as Fuchsius other wryt of
fomentacions, apposicions, embroches, little bags and insessions. The greek word
aeonein signifies the water upon and power upon, whether it be done because of
fomentacion, that is with heat, or other cause. Galen doth praise ye perfume of
the fire stone or miln stone sprinkled with vine Cinabrio that is made of
quitksiluer, sum also with orpmet Marchasita. c shalt thou find in Nic. Mass.
certain other which have taught ye heeling of this disease. The leeues dry of
Tussilago made in perfumes so ye smok may be drawn in at the mouth upon, doth
help ye congh and Orthopnaeu, and breaks the impostumes in the breast. The
same operation also hath the rout Dioscorides.

Of certain iuices.
THe iuices of certain herbs wrong and pressed out, are sod at fire or dried in
the sun, as Bulcasis teaches severally of the juice of Hamsig, Plantain,
Lettis, Singrien, Purselan, Rostrum Purcinum, or hogs snout, Scariola, Fenel,
Smalage, Volubili, Sorrel, and other.

A marvelous way to draw out the juice out of black Elleborum, which sum use
as a secrete would not hyde, lest I should seem to be sorry that our posterity
should have any excellent knowledge. who found this way first I can not say I
learned it of certain my most secret friends I mean that black Elleborum
which communly all men in Germany name in like manner, like unto Consiligo,
very many keep it in their guards: but that which grows upon the moutaines,
to be found in our country Heluetia is best. A man may try the same way in
Colocynthida Esula, Laureola, c. Elleborum cleen and washed, set infused in the
same first a night or more, small cut. Thou shalt take heed both in this and in
the other decoctions that thou skim away diligently al the foom that swymmeth
above, as venomous. This water shalt thou keep and again power other unto it
warm, and heet it a while moderately, changing the water so oft till the routes
retain none or very little bitterness any more: which shall cum to pas when thou
hast Filtrum or through a brush: and at length sis all with a slow fire, or
with burnt cools rather, so that they boil not, yet let them be always at the
point of boiling, until they be as thick as honey in an earthen pot glased, or
of bras tinned, the pot covered or little open. When as now a little water
remains, about the end of the siething, stur it about gently now and then with
same time for a pound of rotes of Elleborum, thou shalt put.ii. drammes of
Mastik pund, and cease not to stir it, other continually, or by little
distaunces, till the juice seem out and out sufficiently thickened, which will
chance suddenly for the most part: and that the matter may be the les
burnt, the ne'er unto the end and to the thickening the juice is, so much urge
it with les fire: nor be not weary of the time: for thou shalt have a most
excellent and exquisite medicine against diverse Asarum or Asaraba^cha, and
Cloves, but stronger, ye burning as it seems to the taster: yet is not burning
in deed, that is because of the tenuitie and sclendernes of the parts, as I
wold have tried. It is ministered an hour after supper, in the moutenance of a
peas, in all diseases whereunto Elleborus is convenient, and where it is good
to lose Elleborum alone, but infused and decocted with other diverse medicines,
as I shall declare by and by. taken grene or dry. But a man must take a poud at
the least of the rotes. Lullius and other (Cardan) have made mention of the
quintessence of Elleborum, where unto I think this juice to be nothing
inferior. This truly is worthy to be wondered at, that the juice so lunge
decocted is not only nothing weaker but also much stronger: for it seems,
(that I may speak of conjecture) that one part of this juice to be ten
times and more stronger then Elleborus it self, and yet nothing Mastik is
added at the last, specially for more hard and grievous diseases, where
necessity requires extreme medicines: and for Frantic persons and
otherwise mad and doting, which when Acatia and of Berberies in Bulcasis.
For the straining of it only is decocted, not that which is depressed out:
also the juice of Galbanus and Licoris: but the water in them

Other iuices are made all by expression, and aresod till they gather into a
Ielly, as of S^landine, Poppy, Wormwod, nightshade, Vinae Acerbae, Memithae,
Agremony, Hypocisthidis, the barks of the rotes of Mandrag. The same Bulcasis
also, wills to put to a little gum to certain iuices that be pressed out which
are sod by them selves at the fire, that the parts of the may better cleue
together, as the juice of wormwod gasid, that is Eupatorium or nightshade: also
of Centaury, and Mastik is mixed with ye juice of Elleborus, not only for this
cause, but also to amend the venomous virtue thereof and contrary to the
stomach. Moreover in certain other medicines, where a ma list to increase the
strength and virtue of any medicin which is to be left and laid away in some
liquor, we change not the liquor, but the medicin: that is ever when the first
is strained, putting in new medicin into the same liquor, as in many decoctions
Elleborus we do contrary: For keeping the same rotes of the Elleborus, we
change oft the liquor. I may tel the cause, because ye rote of Elleborus
above all other things, hath most strong virtues, not in ye superficial other
parts only, but in ye hole substance imprinted vehemently fastly: wherefore it may
be also kept most long of al other. I my self used it, when it was.x. years
old, in his full strength. And certain common Practicioners bid men in a
part of it hath sooked a night and the next day is strained, and the rotes
to be dried again: for they are nothing or very little weaker therewith although
they be somewhat often repeated to the same use and dried again. But of
Elleborus it self and what we have tried and experimented thereof, perauenture
we shall once have an other place and occasion to write of.

Pills of blak Elleborus, or rather of his juice, is to be taken every seventh
day in the curing of the Matthaeolus couselith. Three drams of the roots of
black Veratrum or Elleborus fresh and new: Dauci or yelow-Caret, Anisi, Pepper,
of every one a dram.vi. grains of Mosth. ii scrupuls of Epithy mii or the
harder time: let all these be lightly beaten: then when they have stand to
soak a day and a night, v. pounds of Malmsye (hear seems to be some fault of
the printer, for it is to great a measure of wine) let them be mightilye pressed
out. Take.iii. Cochiarum, Aurearum, of every one. ii drams and a half, knede
them together, and then let them be dried. Moreover when they are dry made
again in powder, thou shalt steep them again in the same Malmsy, as
before.iiii. times. The pills thereof, must be taken at one time, to the
weight of one dram.

Our juice composed and made of Elleborus. Two pounds of Black Elleborus
new cut: stiep them a night in a good quantity of water. The next day after
sis them an hour a half with a slow fire, or.ii. hours, power it out
straining it, and put in to it other water warm (which shall be ready in a chafer
by the fyr for this purpose. Repeat this seven times or more. Then casting away
the routes, take the hooll water streined or destilled by a Filtrum, and sis
it by little and little and when as yet a little of it shall remain, power unto
it this decoctio: Seven handful of Betain, Anisi. iii. vnces, stiep the in
water and sis them till the consumpcion and wasting of the third part: pres
it out, strain it twys or thrys, at the length put to five vnces of Agaricum
elect cut small: flower deluce two vnces and a half: Cinnamon six drams, Ginger
half an uncle: sis them to the half, pres them out strain the water as before.
Then power this decoction to the decoction of the Elleborus boiling moderately:
and let them be ^od together to the thickness of honey. Scammonium: this
dissolved together in a little of the decoction of Elleborus, that it may be
like the substance of honey, not much before the end of the decotion power it
in, (when the juice shall be moderately thyck, or begins to be thick) and thou
shalt stur it about till the juice be consumed. Thou shalt try now and then a
drop of the juice, let it fall upon a tinnen ^rencher, and when it shall be so
thick that it the trencher on the one side or lifts it up, then is the juice
perfect. But by the space of an hour or more before the end thou shalt now
and then stur it about with a slow fire, lest it burn too. Of this decoctio I
had almost.xi. vnces of juice: I think I should have had skarsly ye fourth
part, if I had sod Elleborum alone. This juice have I used already sumtymes:
for I ministered it unto a yonge man sik of the falling evil, with good success,
who now of long time God be thanked, is well: but Ascarides or little round
worms breeding in the long gut, many medicines tried in vain, was restored
with this juice once received, and a few days after taking hearts horn burnt.
Pills of the bigness of a pees, from.ii. to five may be ministered after supper,
that is from half a scrupull or there about to a hool. But a man may try this
better in after sopper, ye next day I felt no small grief about my stomach, I
avoided sutymes downward, but I vomited not. A man may more safely give it to
the yt be sufficiently full of flesh or fat, of a moist stomach, and a stomach
of moo exquisite sense.

Again of the juice of black Elleborus: and of the drawing out of the virtues
out of purging medicines and certain other, as I learned of a certin friend.
THis drawing out was invented for delicate Ellebor{us}. iiii. poud of blak
true Ellebo. new fresh, let the be straight ways washed: the cut small power upon
the this manner of streining, ye juice of Buglos, Borrage, of ether.ii. pounds:
let the be purified strained most diligently, y^ they may be as pure as gold,
let the be laid or set up for a time. The take fenel roots Cichori, sperage,
persely, of every.iiii. vnc. Iuiuba ru, sebesten, of ether.ii. vnces. Melon
siedes, cucumer siedes, gourd siedes, citrul siedes, of every an uncle, sis
the accordig to art in. 16. pouds of rain water. Unto this straining power ye
forsaide.iiii. poudes of juice: let the boyll a little at y^ fire: afterward put
in y^ cut beat Ellebo. sis the lightly by little little till yt the roots
appear above, the pres the out again, strain the through a filtru, sis this
strainig to ye thiknes of honey with from half a scrupul to a hool or further. It
is ministered to louse ye belly, folded or moulded in a little moystned dow
unleavened, mixed with a drop or two of oyll of Anis.

The extraction of Rhabarbari. Cut a pound of the pieces of Rhabarbarum elect
small, and beat it somewhat gros, and power to it ye clarified iuices of Borage
and Buglos, of ether two pounds, let them stand.xxiiii. hours. Afterward
sis them at a slow fire, till the Rhabarbarum appear and Balneo Mariae till
it be thick lest it should put to which is better, as likewise in a double
vessel. In purging give it to be swalowed down mixed with a drop of oyll of
Cinnamon and Anis, folded in unleavened dow, making a trial Rhabarbarum by it
self doth not purge greatly, do sharpen the hooll extraction with a little of the
best Dacrydium, which hurts not.

An extractio of pills. Take any lump or mas that y^uo will of pills composed
most diligently, of the best medicines: when it is broken into little pieces,
stiep it eight days in rain water juice of Borage, juice of Fenell, in equal
porcions, as much as suffices. Then sis it in a glasen double most clean
wullen clothe, that will lose none of his hears, and sis it again in a bath
and double vessel diligently to a convenient thickness, and frame little pills
whereof thou shalt give.ii. scruples or there about. A matter drawn out in
this wise is most pure, very tender and melts easily in a mans hand. In like
manner may also the virtues of other purging medicines be drawn out. But heed
must be taken, that ever softening and slippery iuices be mixed therewith in the
decoction,

A description of a purging Electuari extracted, which a certain excellent
Physician at Norinberg did use.xiii. drammes of Colocynthidis, blak Elleborus,
senae Alexandrinae, of ether an ounce, of most white Agaricum an ounce:
Rhabarbarum Electum half an ounce, or if the Rhabarbarum be not very good, an
ounce: xiiii. drams of Dacrydium: Turbirh, (if I rede right) Stichas Ara. of
ether Lignum Aloes, Mastik, red Mirrh, Asarum, spiknard, Styrax liquid, of
every.v. scrupuls. Pour altogether and digest or putrify the, as they cal it.x.
days or.xiiii. in warm Aqua vitae thrice destilled. The juice pressed out thereof
shall be joined and mixed with.iii. vnces of prepared Aloes. But the Aloes did he
prepare in this wise. About apoud of Aloes is put into a basin, caudron or pot,
putting thereto vinegar made with Rosewater, and Roosewater of the vinegar of
Roses, then of the water of Roses. Let them boyle together with a slow
fire.ii. or.iii. boylinges: then strain them pressing them strongly. When it
is strained, let it boyle again with a slow fire to the thickness of Aloes
stirring it continually with a slise. When it is could, let it be kept for
use. The species or particulers rehearsed are first cut small, then beaten,
infused in Aqua vitae, as much as is sufficient, they are let stand in the
infusion warm in Balneo Mariae or sand.xiiii. days, stirring and chafing
them in Diacy donion of the said medicin. If there remain yet any moisture let
it be put upon burning coals in some vessel as much as is sufficient.

Of the juice of the Flour Deluce and Rape. c.
OVre Flower Deluce is more strong in operation in the dropsy, as seems me,
then the Florentines: of the which opinion a friend of mine also a very well
lear^ed Phisicion is, who of late sent me these his experiments and trials
of the juice of the root of Flower Deluce and Rape. Take a hens of the Flower
Deluce in place, and mixte it diligently with the yolke: and when thou hast a
little warmed it in the ashes, give it for a mornings draught, which shall
avoid downward above mesure the dropsy water.

This also (saith he) have I amongst my secretes for them that be sick of the
dropsy and can not sweet: take the juice of a round Rape beaten in a mortar and
pressed out, seasoned with Sugar or cinnamon, that it taste something else then the
Rape,

The juice of Purslan, Singreen or Houslike, Cotyledonis, and of other likewise
that be slimy and Clammy, because of the clammines can not be pressed out
alone: The herb well punde with Omphacium is pressed out. Other when they are
punde heat them at a flow fire. Other beat them and let them stand in a cold
place, as a wine cellar, put in a basket of wikars, to destill down into
Syluius, in whom thou shalt read moore of the preparing and preserving of
iuices, in his book of the preparacio of simples.

Of Lignum sanctum and any other, we draw out tears, which is moore
precious then the wood it self, in this wise. The Lignum is cut in pieces,
the thickness of a finger, which are put in the fire: thereby is gathered what
tere so ever is in the Ligno. Cardanus.

Milk is gathered of Esula Selandin, cuttinge the highest bows, and laid
hielding in a vessel, pressing (milking or slipping* the one by one. The liquor
so gathered shalt thou dry in the sun. But the juice is gathered when the
herbs are punde and pressed out: Bulcasis.

Gummes that be purging and other, (if any refuse to swalowe in the form of
pills) put them in boiling water, let them be dissolved, strain them: and
put in oil of swiet Almonds, and give it in drink with rob.

Put any strong purging medicine in water or wine: Then in the same liquor
steep dry prunes, or dry Figs, or Rasins till they swell, then wash them
in wine. These fruit received within the body do maruelouslye and without
grefe loose the bealye: Arnold in his book of wine. Sis.iiii. ounces of
Passularium with water of Violets half an hour, lift them through a sieve: the
sprinkle in.ii. drams of Scammonium, let them be dried. Then when thou wilt

harde say howe a certain practicioner roosted a gose stufte with Mise, chopte
small, and ministered the liquor gathered there of to the anointing of the
crooked vunche upon the back.

Of decocted things.
WE cal decoctions liquors, water, wine, or vinegar: in the which any medicines
be sod at the fire, and then streined. c. of the which for shortness sake at
this present we will speak nothing, saving that we will admonish, that when
they are beaten or chopped they ought to be first stiept which should be sod and
decocted in a vessel diligently stopped and cloosed.

A decoction in vinegar against the pestilence. Sis two handful of the
biggar Salandin, the herb and root together, in.iiii. pound and a half of the
best vinegar, upon cools in a glased pot with a cover the mouth whereof shall be
fensed with clay of other. And of late I red almost ye very same medicine in a
certain book of a certain practicioner, written in french, and a few years
past when the pestilence was here, a certain friend of mine sent unto me a like
description. Many would have the Selandine sod in the vinegar, but other put
other things to: sum, as I said, Few only: other also Sage noble, Rosemary,
the leeues of flower deluce, not the root, Zedoaria and sis it in a pot well
covered: thereof they give a few drops

Otherwise.. Wormwood, Few, the younglings Selandin. iii. parts. Sis the in
white vinegar q. s. that is as much as is sufficient in a pot clayed, till the
third part be consumed, let it be given as soon as ama is infected, after let
him sweet.

Otherwise.. A pound of the roots of Seladine, Brimstone, Saffron, Turmentill,
an uncle, Triacle.ii. vnces: pimpernel, Gentian, of every an uncle and a half:
Pilosella or mous ear, with the root and all. Few, of ether an handful, Sage
with.ii. quarts of whyt vinegar till the third part be consumed. In this
decoction dissolve electuary of an eg (or triacle) to the quantity of a been
let it be given to the patient as thou know.

Of made vvyne, and mixed with medicines.
LAst of all we will teach and declare here certain things of made and
counterfeit wynes, yet not of all of purpose, Dioscorides, Aetius in his last
book, and to the book of Arnold Villa nouani of wynes. Wynes mixed with
medicines are made diverse ways: first siething the medicines with the wine
while it is must and new, for the most part to the consumpcion of the third
part, skumming in the mean season straining afterward. Sum sis the wine
alone: other till ye Zedoaria, with Inula, also with Borrage and Melissa, in
Arnold. Sum sis a little new must and when it is couled, they power it upon
the herbs in the vessel. Secondly putting the wine, before it be hot, that
by the heet of it in the vessel, the virtue of the medicin may be mixed with it:
So the most men with us prepare wine of wormwood, and they let it stand a
hooll winter in the vessels, ever filling the vessels again, if they draw any
thing out of it, in the beginning of vere they take the herbs out: sum leave
them in al summer also, but yet it is easily corrupted, waxes hoor and mouldy,
and sower specially if the vessel be not full. Sum set a plate of iron tinned
boored Cariophyllata dry be put to, y^ wine shall be preserved the logar. Other
sis simpely with wine the medicine whose virtue they would have to pas in the
wine, at any time of the Inula. c. Wine may also be mixed and streined with the
iuices of herbs clarified: or hanged in a little bag in it a few days, to be
pressed out and when it is strained to be mixte with the wine, and new
medicines to be put into the bag, c. for if the matter be pressed out often and
new put to, the wine shall be the stronger, and we shall fill the vessel now
and then for that that is drawn out: for if not, the wine will become every
foot weaker.

Wines medicined (as we have said) may be made, leaving the medicines put in
a bag, or Arnold in his book of wine. Such as a ma list to sethe, it should be
best to sethe it in a double vesselor in Baln. Ma.

Aromaticall made wines or with spices may be kept for.iii. or.iiii. days
clear, afterward they are troubled. Plinius teaches the confections of wines
of diverse simple medicines. 14. 16.

Wine of Wormwode howe it is made, I have Wormwode: other mixte with it other
diverse herbs, specially hot: as Hyssop, Rue, Sage, Cardnus Benedictus, Penny
royal, Costus Hortensis, Phyllitides, the flowers of Eldar, the Barks of
Ash. I make sometimes in a glass forthwith, putting the leaves of Wormwode dry,
into Malmsy and burning water, thrice destilled of ether like much. This may
be long kept: a little of it put to a great deal of wine, doth season it holly
with the quality of Wormwode. It is good for a cold stomach, Arnoldus in his
book of wines. A better way of making it saith he, that the Wormwod grene or
dry be beat, and that the wine warm be straind upon it certain times, till it
receive the savour and virtue of it, and to season it with Sugar or Honey: this
way to make this wine is better then other, because all the strength of the
Wormwod is in the superficial Galangal or Anise may also be added, or any
other thing as a man thinks good. Wine of Mugwort is made in the same manner
that wormwode wine is.

Wine of the kirnels of Alkckengi or Haliacacabus, is made the same way,
straining the wine up on them beaten, for one Dosis, of it thou shalt take
from.v. to.x. it brings out stony matter fro the Arnold in his book of wine)
whereof I my self also made a trial of late, straining together Anise, the rote
of Carlina, the kirnels of Peches, and y^ little stones of crabs, whereupon the
vrin holden now of long space, followed within an hour. Some put the grains
of Haliacacabus hole into new wine in a little vessel, that they may sis
together, and keep it for their use.

Wine of Betain is good for the griefs of the stomach. Alexan. Benedictus,

Wine of Buglos of the rotes of Buglos stieped in wine, is maruelouslye
commended of Arnold against the diseases of Melancholy, with a story of a
certain woman healed with the drincking thereof, which through anger, became
oftentimes a foal. Wine of Buglos, wherein the rotes of Buglos well washed have
ben a day and a night or the syrup of it, it brings mirth and is good for
melancholical persons. Certain me have ben cured by the use of that wine from
madness, and the Arnold, of the coseruacion of youth, the.iii. chap. An other
wine composed with the rotes and flowers of Buglos, with Sena or without it,
shalt thou read in Arnold in his book of wine, with this title. A marvelous
wine for Melancholik persons and cardiacal. c Wine of borage is made, if in new
wine y^ flours of borage be put till the perfect fining: or else if Dia

use: Arnoldus in his

Wine made with Inula. The Roots of Inula cut small as herbs to the pot,
sethe them in a new earthen pot glased in.ii. pintes or more of Inula
together with the new wine wherein they sod, and when as yet they have sod
a little while together, ye shall set it down from the fire and keep it.

An other way. When the new swite wine is skimmed and sod to the
consumpcion of the put in y^ roots of Inula. (for.xxv. congees or there about,
which is about.xv. galons of our measur, take.ix. vnces:) and when the must or
new wine hath yet a little boiled, take it of and when it is cold kiep it, and
hang the roots of the Inula (the very same that were separated in the
streining of the wine) in a bag within the vessel. The roots should be
gathered in October in the spring of the moan, or in the beginning of summer,
to be dried in the sun. This did I translate out of a certain Dioscorides,
which names this wine Nectarite.

Wine Arceuthite. For.xx. congees or there about of must, take half a fourth
deell of Juniper beries (a fourth deel we call of the measure of Heluetia, but
that varies also, the fourth part.) First thou shalt straw the bottom of the
vessel with thin chipes of hewed ash, lest the beries may stop ye entrance of
the tap: then straw the half part of the beries in upon that: thirdly the
rest of the chipes, furthly

Our contrymen make wine in summer, with ye Visula, putting them hool into the
vessel, leaving the fourth part empty, pouring in upon them white old wine,
which in short space will have a reed colour, and sooner if all the stalks be
cleen taken away, more slowly if they be so cut that part of them be left in,
but yet thus, they keep the colour logest. But they are wont when they have
drawn any wine out, to fill the vessel again by by. It strengthens the hart
and stomach, asswageth thirst, couleth, dries, binds. Other put them not in

Wine of wild Plums Bulies or Sloos, is made in the like manner in heruest,
when they shall be now sufficiently tender and ripe enough.

Wine Raspoticium (dutche men call it rappis) Raspish wine, that is, which
bites the tongue with a certain sharp biding, it provokes appetite byndyng the
hears of the stomach. It helps the body dissolved with heat, chiefly in
summer it is proffitable for Choleric and Sanguine persons: it is made in
this wise. Some sower grapes together with the ripe are put in the wine pres to
be pressed out together. Or yt is better, let the grapes be kept and brooken
together with Raspaciis, put into the vessel with the Must: That Must or new
wine, by the juice of this Raspacia (Scapos French men cal grappes, our
cotrymen rappen, whereupon the wine takes the name) or kirnels in the grapes
which are sower, doth get a certain ponticitie or taste like wormwood and
bynding: Arnoldus de Villa Nova. In our country they make it otherwise, they
fill the wine vessels with holl clusters well rypet, and power old wyn in to
them, and as often as they draw any wine out of it, they fill it again. Sum
put in clusters and Sage leeues in course. It refreshes the stomach, asswageth
thirst. Nicolaus My repsus in the letter D. the. 85. Chapter, describes the
making of a certain Dysentericall drink with good Raspe, or pure Marathratum,

putting Mulsum or Melitum, they cal it communly Claret and Nectar and
Melicratium but improperly, with white wine. If they put to sugar for honey,
with reed wine, they cal it Hippocras. There are made at the Apothecaries this
