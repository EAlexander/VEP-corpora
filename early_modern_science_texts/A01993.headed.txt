In this tretyse that is cleped Gouernayle of helthe: What is to be said with

IT nedyth him that woll have lunge list to know the craft of wholesome
gouerneyle. And so for to keep contynuelly the helthe of his body / for else he
may not com to his naturell end / but he shall dye or his kyndeli time come.
and therefore thus says Galye the conning. He saith of wholesome gouernauce is
marvelous / for it makes a man to live till he be old. and without sikenes
in to the last of his eld and age: Therefore the same Galyen after that he
knew the craft of wholesome gouernaumce. came never into no sikenes^ but seelde
/ that was in to a fymeram that is to say a sharpe fever. and that was for
trauayll in vysityng of his frendys. about the comyn profit. for thus he
saith / I take god to record and his angels assigned to keep me / that who
that wylfully and besily will study in the treatise of holsom gouernauce woll
keep alhole the doctrine thereof. he shall never dye but on and upon kyndly death
/ which death is sweet and soft without great pain as the same Galyen
wytnesseth in the difference of feuerys / But vnderstonde that wholesome
gouernauce may no man duly keep that most needs be occupied will him or nyl him
and may not when him needs leave of. for thy it needs him that he have that
needs him to his lyf without travail and pencyfull / and in alle things
that he be of fre condition / Ferthermore it is to wet. that viij. things at
the lest ben needful in wholesome gouernayle / of which the first is a
discrete chors of thoo things that shall be eten or drunken / The second is
wilful bodyli exersice to fore mete. and that till the swetyng begin or
namely till his wind change fro sloughe to swyftnes / The third is well
profytable and well needful that all that shall be etyn be wele and small chewed
/ The fourth is that thou ete while thou hast talent to ete. the v. is that
thou sleep on morrow till thou wake be thine own will / For as arystotle saith
not only in metys and drynkys be we noryshed and fostered. but also in sleep /
The vj. is that thou take no mete and drink in sorrow no in care but in Joye as
much as thou may: The vij. is that thou have no hold no cold in winter no
in somer after bloodletynge. The viij. is that thou use saffron in thy mete /
for it quy^neth kyndely hete and comfort thy dygesty on tarries thine eld
or age and brings in gladness. and lets thine humours fro rotynge and
driynge

IT is in stories of our elders that on a time a mighty king brought to gyder
three of the best leches that might be of Inde of Mede and of Greece / and he
commanded hem that each of them should study to assygne the best medicine /
which if a man would use should profit him to help of body and him should
need none other medycyn / Truly the leche of Greece assigned and said that every
day a man to take twys his mouth full of hot water / should make a man so
hole that him should need none other medycyn and the leche of Mede assigned and
said that it should profit much every day fasting to take gromel said: And I

What is first on morrow to be done.
AFter that a man hath wele and p^afible fulfilled his sleep loke he rise cloth
him self with good clothe sweet if he have them / then he owes to walk a
lytil euenli to stretch out his lymmes kembe his head for whi kebyng draws
out the vapours ye comyn from the stomach to the ^xd in time of sleep. and
therwyth loke that ye be besie to put out the superfluytees of the body. in
siegyng pyssyng koughyng and spy^tyng. then loke he wesshe his hands his face
in somer with cold water and in winter with hoot water Then loke he pray and
preyse his lord after the doctrine of his law and vysite the por^ in god.
then if it like him he should study or rede dyspute or talk and wise menys
^ouceyl and seyeg besily here / and in mesure be merry flee utterly wrath and
sorrow in as much as he may / and use him self mesurable trauayl as walking
or riding and in clean hihe places fro myer and marries / for this profyteth
much / for it breketh wind in a manys body and strenghyth lights his lymmes
and comfort the heete of the stomach and strengyth his joints / and melts
evil humours

Of the body exersice of his profit.
WE owen to know by auctors of leche craft / that thoo that shall live fair
wele in holsom gouernauce. owen to have euyn and tempered exersice to fore
mete. for that yeueth to all the body tempered hete euyn and not passing /
which should a manys exersice be / a fycysion discreuyth thus: Exersice is a
wilful meuyng by which a mannys wind is made great. and oft it needs that
this traueyll be wylful / and not stressyd by need / but that he be all fre and
worche after his oune will / And therefore labour of carpenters ploughmen masons
mariners and such other is none exercise of lechecrafte / for it hath not
propely wilful meuyng / Marchautes treuly burgeys cloysterers such other
walking wele and lunge / but it is not properly exercise of lechecraft / But
when a man walk freli of his oune will / and so swyftly till he begin to
feynt and his wind change / then anon he should sit and rest / for if he
meuyd eny further / hit should be pain and feyntes / and such exercise is
cleped tempered / for thereby grouen many goods to manys body. First for there by
is the kyndely hete strenghyd eched and so ben other iiij. virtues that is to
say. virtue drawing virtue defiynge virtue wythholdyng and virtue out putting
/ And so ben there v. bodily wits. that is to say / hearing seeng smelling
tasting and feeling / and so ben there iij. myndely virtues / that is to say
Imagynatyf dyscretyfe and memoratyfe.

And though error happed in all these worchynges of lechecrafte so it were not
to notable. and exercise were as should be. should never or seelde manys body
need other medicine / for exerecyse fulfyleth the defautes of all other / For
thy be they merry that dreden bloodletyng and other doutefull medycyns / but by
exercise they mowen be healed sanyd / Metheles ij. things ben needful to every
well exercysed that is to say / that he be not to full no to em^y / to full
then would the humours lose and so were great dread of the liver or some fever
or sudden death / for thy in such a caas loke therbe lunge discrete abstynence
so that he be not to empty / for then should his body be feeble out^ of mesure /
and at the last for febelnes it most needs lose. Therefore who that is to empty
it needs that he labour not till he be more and better releued / Truly aucturs
sayen that exercise is one of the hihest and nobelest thing that may be done
of to manys body and full needful it is in gouernayll of health and leng thing
of life for why exercise fulfylleth the medycynes of bloods and bathynges and
such other things / and therein is no dread nor bytternes no exspences / but
therein is pure recreation of body of soul so it be don in clean places / and
then should men show hem self to the clean ever and delyte in seeng far
ne'er. water land heaven and earth grene and falow / And in all thyse he should
praise and worship our lord god. Fulgens dyscryueth exercise in a full faye
manner thus seyeng / exercise is true keeping of manys lyf and prick of kind
slepynge / and the fylthe of foul colour and trendyng of slothes hete and
wasting of superfluytes / and saddynge of lymmes and sleeng of siknesses / and
dryuynge a way of vices medicine of langores / winning of time / and debt of
youth / and Joy of eld of age / and help of health / enemy of idelnes. and
dystroyeng of all evil: But emog all other things it is to wet that exercise
mesured meserably heteth a manys blood and dries it / And therefore mesurable
fleumatyk men should use it / and rest coleth a man and moysteth him / and that
is good for coleryk men / for thy he alone draws him self from exercise
that would fain fail Iope and felicyte / in this lyf: Galyen saith that great
pu^gacyons and vomytes should not be take bu^selden and for great need for why /
Who so woll each month ones or twyes greatly purge him self he shall bring
his body to man^ evil uses / for he shall engendre therein man^ noyous humours /
For why each day exercise is full needful to keep a manys health / for who that
eteth or drynketh much may not be hole but if he woll somewhat sleep and
swynke. Thenne theise things that be said it shows that mesured exercise
hath many profytes for it styreth the kyndly hete and opens the poores / and
losith cold / and thyck towgh humours / And when they ben losed bears hem
out at the poores / and makes a manys joints slipper lyghte / and it
comfort all the members of a manys body: Wherefore noi^us humours ben more
holsomly purged and mesured by exercise then by laxatyues or vomytees / for
another of them may be without empeyremet of kind / and right as due keeping
of kyndely exercise is needful / so other while is rest: For why rest in as
much as it is contrary to exercise / some is bodily some is ghostly / of
which each either if it be mesured after that kind would it is heleful both
to the body soul / and if it be not so it is contrary: For whi if rest be to
much it gendreth norysheth and multyplyeth evil humours ad increases much
corupcyon / For why when water rests to much it stynketh. so iron each
metal rustyth when it restyth:

The spices of exercise /
Spices of exercise ben there well many as there be diverse statys of persons
some be strong and some be feeble some rich some pore some prelates and at the
large and some subgettes enclosed. And sometime weder is fair clear / and
sometime not so but derke reyn / And therefore it needs to have spices of
exercise / for whithe best spyce the first is to walk to fore mete in hihe
places clean / Another spyce is to ride and y^ is for rich men / but great
prelates most have other manners of exercise / for whi in chambre shall be a
great c^rde knytted in the end hanged up. and take that corde with both hades
and stoned upright so that thou touche not the erche and stoned a good while
/ thene run as much as thou may heder theder with that corde / and
otherwhile skyppe / and if this please the not / ^ane a stone of xxx. li.
weight or theraboute and if thou wolt have helthe therein oft bear that ston
fro that on side of that house to that other side or a lunge while hold up
that ston or thou let it down or bear it a bonte thy neck or between thy
hands / and so of other manners till thou feynt or thus hold a staff in thy
^hand and let a another take hit from the if he may with euyn draught / or
thus close a penny in thyn hand let a another take it if he may or thus hold
thy breath as lunge as thou may and thenne puff it out as hard as thou may
do / And this manner of exercise is full profytable to put out noyos
superfluytees / for why many superfluytees in sleep ben wythholden therefore if
thou have non other manner of exercise holding of breath helps it much / Yet
there ben other manners of exercise for yonge men that ben lusty as to run to
wrestle to leap to caste the stone / and so of other plays also tempered
fleshly companyng with a young broun woman is good in winter / and with a yonge
white woman is good in somer is also good helping in governing of helthe to
body but not to soul / except to hem then that mowen have it by gods laws
so netheles that thee be so much tym between that he feel him selse eased
lyghtened in his body and that he ete the better sleep the better: But therwyth
vnderstonde that as much as helpyth tempered companyenge^ so much noyeth
dystempred copanyeg / and namely to much for it coleth him wastes him fills
him For why manys kind is made of the best blood best defied / that hastily
may torn into manys lymmes: And for whi when a ma casts out that noble
humours to much he is hugely dyscolored and his body much febled more then he
let four sithes so much blood out of his body / also who that much deleth
or copanyeth fbesly with a woman lightly kacheth ye palsy with more evil:

How a man should have him in etyng:
WHen a man hath well exercysed him as it is said to fore. rest awhile after
and then a lityl fresh whet breed wele baked and somdel soured. then drink
adraught of good clear wine or other good sauery drink: then rest a while
after and study in some wise means then have some solace myrthes with thy
friend and with other honest copany / Then ayenst euyn take thy mete supper
most sauorly but if thy costome be there age in: But a generalle rule of all
fysik leches is that thine hour of etyng be when thou art kyndly hunryg / and
to fore thyn hunger ete not / but if it be a lityll mess of good clean warm
mete / to provoke thyn appetite with when thou hast appetite let not / for as a
fycysion says the stomach out of use to suffer hunger. fulfylleth the body of
roten humours And then woll a manys body wax full of noughty humours / by cause
that the colere is drawn to the mouth of the stomach / so that afterward when
he wold ete he may not: Ferthermore it is to wit that no man should ete but he
knew certainly his stomach void of that thing that he ete tofore. and that
shall a man know by desire that he hath to ete / and by plete of spyttyng
coming up to his mouth. For whi who that eteth without desire his mete shall
find the kyndly hete of his stomach cold / and he that eteth with desire he
shall find the kyndely hete of stomach give up a smell savour like encense /
but thise shuche other should be understood of hem that have mete ordained at
her own will / who y^ that not ete when he may have it for they ben not
bounden to the laws of this crafteli dyatore as to the qualytees of thy metes.
understood that thilke mete which that most governs thyn helthe should not be
passing in any qualite: for whi the metes that ben to hot brene^ the blood /
as pepper ga^lek oynyos crosses sa^ge myntes persile such other. and tho metes
that ben to ^ld fresyn the blood. as letuse pursila gourdes such other / And
if thy metes ben to watery then they (...) thy blood / as be melons cocombres.
and if thy metes ben to dry it throwith out thyn vytayll virtues if thy metes
be to fat they let thy dygestio and if thy metes ben to sweet. they stop
the and make the constypat costyff. and thy metes ben bitter they utterly
noryshen the not: And if thy metes be to salt they brenen noye breken thy
stomach / and if thy metes ben to sour they maken the soon old: For thy non of
thise metes much contynuelly used is good to helthe of mannys body / but only
that mete is good that is tempored and wantyth to mykilnesse / as ben thyse
good metes for helthe of manys body holsom / lamb of on year yonge kyddes
soukyng calves henys capons chekyns pertryches ploueres fesautes small birds
of the field of the wood / but not of the water / And when the season comes
young rabettes. and pygges feet ben good other extremytees as groye eres and
scaled fyshe of clean rennyng water. Year eyren or eggis Also borage langdebuff
whet bred well bake / well leuyned and somdele saltyd of that that is one day
old or tweyn / and of other that ben not to much passing in eny qualyte and
if we dread excess of any qualite amend it by the contrary thereof. an
ensample. if thou be seek of evil tough metes use therefore sharpe metes
short / as a lityll of harde chese skraped small. and of lityll quantyte / and
also a pere or two or three of the most best fruit to thy complexion nature:
Sothly salt metes sour bitter may be amended with sweet appuls / sweet metes
be amended with sweet honey good old wine / and so of all other. if thou wolte
ete fruit ete hem fast as cherise grapes almondes / and after mete a few peers
quynces nottes / a few while they be grene and walnottes ben best. but let the
skyn be clean pyked away fro the mete: Also the complexion of a man should be
looked to as if he be tempered keep him so with like metis and drynkys / and if
it be dystempered by his contrare bring it lityll lytil aye to tempre / f^r whi
to sangweyn men dystempred give malincoliouse metes. and to malencolyouse men
sangueyen metes / and to flewmatyk men coleryk metes / for every evil
complexion may be brought to temprure / but if necessaries of lyuebode let it:
And know when thou wol^e and note it for a souerayye notabylite / who y^ etyth
oft milk fyshe / oft katchen thereof a lepre or a white skabbe. Also oft to
use wine as great hihe mighty or hihe coloured and milk to gyder brings a
man to both lepre skab. here none suffysyth of qualyte of metes / as to the
quantyte vnderstonde that thy mete no thy drink should be no more but as thy
kyndely helthe might overcome it else thy body shall waste and thy virtues wax
feeble And for the quatyte of metes drynkes may not certenly be showed loke how
thou felyst it hath don the most good and such quantyte use. Furdermore
vnderstonde that no man should ete anon after his exercise no anon after he
were bathed / but fryste rest him a while so that he hungre / and thenne when
he woll ete if he be a rich ma set tofore him many metes / of which that
one is better tha that other For a fycysion says it shall better save him
better noryshe him and skill whi: for mete that is taken with delyte the stomach
hugely covets hastily kacheth / log holdyth / and we^defyeth. and that mete
that is best defied is most noryshyng for manys body / Truly other mete that
is not defied. is taken with fulsomnes and defyeth not well / for whi if a man
desire more moton then a capon the moton shall rather be eten / and so of all
other metes. But there that is much dystauce in qualyte of metys we mowen not
do thus / and also bewar that it be none erraut appetite a^ in wymmen that ben
with child / and though (...) otherwhile be / yet shall it not always be
denied: Furthermore as galyen says that at one meal men sholden not ete
diverse metes^ therefore at morrow ete but bred alone / and at euyn flesh alone
/ for when two diverse mete: ben take at one meal. of hem comyn two euyles /
one in either by it sylfe. a another in hem (...) the together in hemselfe / for
then one traueyleth to torn in to great heavy humours and that other into
(...) in hem (...) the (...) mete (...) before it is (...) goyth fourth draws
with him the (...) mete vndefyed, and if the great mete goo first tofore then
the subtle mete is not defied and may not for the great goo forth. and so it
wexyth corupte / And which of thise manners ever it be / always it is evil /
but more evil it is that the subtle follow the great / for the / chaufyng
chaugyng into kind of raunes may be helped / but the chaugyng into corupcyon
never or selden and of wonder harde is helped: And thereto accords Galyen a
ficysion other old doctors. but (...) perauenture a contrary costume lunge
used may do away the corrupcon. Also wet well that virtue of defyynge is
oft brokyn when raw mete is put on half soden for the toon rawnes showueth
out the other / and so the half sodyn is corupte: Moreover that no man ete so
much that the stomach be heuyed therwyth no that his appetite cease / But how
that vsith great exercise to much and selde and therwyth eteth unruly
conty^eth it he shall dye by sodeyn, death or shall feel wicked likeness. ye
though his mete were right good for by cause his dygestyon is corrupt
therefore keep well thy stomach from to much mete drink / And it so mishap any
time anoon with water oil or such other spue it out anon and then sleep /
and if thou may not sleep walk softly up down. and xxiiij. hours ete not
after no drink not / then ete a lytill with a draught of good clean wine. so
the wine be not to great no of hihe colour. and on the thyrday have some
exercise and be bathed / then ete a little after / and after sleep thou may
then use this electuare dyatryon as saith a fycysion. Two causes ben of
sikenesses / that is diverse metes long sitting and much etyng of diverse
metes. for of hem ben gendred divers humours some good some evil: long sitting
for then the mete that is first take is defied er the last begin to defy,
and so yt is defied draws with him to the liver that is vndefyed / and so
thise two ben cause of great sikenesses: Also as old wise men sayen man should
never ete his fylle at one meal in taking diverse metes / for as a uycenne
saith no thing is worse than to multyple metes and so to sit long thereat /
for thy he saith that men in old time were satisfied at morrow with bred alone
and at euyn with flesh allon / And therwyth they sayden reasonably the more
mete should betowarde euyn / but the costume were contrary / for a eyrene says
that whole men should better ete at ^yenste night then no morrow / for the
kyndel^ (...) is closed within them and gadreth about the bowels. Netheles
flewmatyk me ete not to cold for they neden but lytill exercise to meue her
kindeli hete which mow ete by the morrow / But now the most usage is herr
ageyn and among / many me it is food more wholesome to ete by day then by night
/ and perauenture that is skill of costume / And therefore thus saith a wyseman
short so^per light soper is selden grievous. great sopers noye as leches tech we
rede it oft opeli also as a uycene says between two etynges (...). hours to

ageyward for that one most be amended by that other since it is harde to leave
without error: moreover vnderstonde that men that have good vnderstondyng.
etyn for they would live. but they that goon by fleshelynes wolden live for to
ete and contrary to nature / And wit thou well that to a coleryk manys stomach
when y^ virtue is strong / and great hete great metes ben good / as be off
pork great venyson g^te bestly fyshes rough and great bred salt mete flesh
half sodyn great mighty coloured wine / and if the hete of the stomach be feeble
and if he have but lityll exercise the metes aforsayd would much noye him but
to such a stoma^ give subtle metes as chekyns small fyshes of stony rennyng
water / Year eggs bred well baken and well soured small wine and of clean
oryet colour not deep such other But thise metes sh^en be corrupt of a (...)
stomach. And if the virtue dygestyff be in y^ mean time of dyetyng / as capones
(...) pertryches and such other: Also in gouernauce of helthe / fl all
excessyuous metes and namely these but if it be for a medicine / fl also all
fruit and also herbs that ben not good as thise namely. cole wortes letuys
for they make malyncolyouse blood. galye saith yt my fader ever forbad me yt I
should ete no new fruit grene if I would be without sekenes for he him self
did and was ever wythouten sikenesses / and while he lived so did I was also
wythouten sikenes / and when he was ded I eete fruit caught the feueres / and
after that I caught conning to keep my silfe I kept me from fruit I had
nomore the feue^s / but if it were a little sharpe feuere called offymera. and
all my friends that kepten my doctrine / kept hem from fruit had her health.
Arnolde a great / clerk saith thus / In is let lunge vsag of stoppyng metes
as fyshe pese potage. therefore it is profytable first to ete porcey of peses for
this is a water that wise men hath commended. and thus it is made / do pesyn in
fair water all night in the same water boyle them on morrow a / good while and
thenne cleanse them and keep the clensyng and when mete time comes do thereto a
lityl wine a lityll powder of spyknarde a lityll safron clean small white salt
and than boyle it on a walme. and so ete / for it opens clensith well the
capytalle veins of the liver the weyes oft of the vryne / and kepeth fro y^
stone grauelles namely if the foresaid pes^n be soden in the forsaid water with
persily How a man should have him in his drink.

THe less ye drink at mete the better it is enre so it be mesurably taken. for
a man should not at mete drink much lest it make mete to swim in his
stomach: forthy men should drink a lityll. so that the mete be well medeled
tempered together / And then let aloge while between or thou drink ayen. and
than drink a great draught at ones no drink not to much aftyr the first
morsel in no manner of wise / but drink oft a lityll a lityll if small clean
wine best according to helthe gouernynge of thy complexion and nature. and for
helthe of body is clean and small claret wine not to new no to mighty so it be
well and proporcyonli tempered with the quantyte of clean water / Moreover no ma
be so hardy to drink fasting cold water / no after that he hath accompanied
with a woman no after great travail no after excersice till he have first
rested him. no by night namely if he have do glove tofore. for whi lunge sleep
fast skpyng is cure thereto.

What shall be don after mete:
AFter when thou hast ete thou should stood or walk a lityll softly up down
till toy mete goo down to the botom of thy stothak and then sleep a lityll if
thou be used therein both day night namly sleep first on thy sight side for
that is kyndely for thy dygestio rhall be better / for then lies thy liver
under thy stomach / as fire under a caudren: And after thy first sleep turn on
thy lift side that thy right side may be r^sted of thy lunge lygyng thereon /
And when thou hast lain thereon a good while and slept turn ayen on thy right
side and there sleep all night forth / and loke y^ thou lye not to straight no
to crooked with thy legs but in a mean between straight crooked. And in no
wise lie not upright / for the woll the superfluyte^s abide within the and
turn to wyeked grievous evils contrary to helthe / Also to lye grovelling on
the womb is good / so that thy breath be not grieved there with the heuyer / and
the gretter thy mete be the more thou hast taken thereof / ever the ledger should
thy night sleep be: and ever y^ subtiler yt thy mete be ye less thou have ever
ye less should thy sleep be. For sleep is full helpy to old me for it makes
them moist therefore saith galye when he was old he ete letuses with spyses for
he would sleep the better / Morouer sleep is full helpy to the dygestyo of thy
metes but not anon after that thou hast even / for thou myghtist be strangled
Also wet thou that if a man before auyntisshid of his body / much sleep then
is not good for him for it woll waste his moystnes / and of one thing beware

To every tale soon give thou no credence

Between meles drink not for no lityl delight
But thurste or traueyll give the occasion
Over salt mete doth great oppression
To feeble stomach when they can not refreyne
Fro thing contrary to their complexyon
Of greedy hadys the stomach hath great pain
Thus in two things stodyih all thy wealth
Of soul and of body / who so list hem show
Moderate fode gives to man his helthe
And all surfetes doth from him remewe
And charity to the soul is dew.
This receyte bought is of no potycarye
Of master antony no of master hughe
To all indyfferent it is rychest dyetarye
