Robert Copland the translator hereof to the Reders.
Gentle reders in consyderacion that every science, art, and faculte that are
speculate practysed by Philosophers, not only ought to be showed and taught
unto such as be present with them in their days, but also for a {per}petuall
benefyte to be set forth by wrytynges vulgarily in every tongue, for the more
eredines and erudycyon of all yonge and pregnant practycyens, as fain would
attain to the perfytenes of every such science, art, and faculte. And not
withstanding that there be right many and sondry sorts, as well of very good
and scyentyke books, as of right expert men within this Realm in the
scyentycall art of Cyrurgery. Nevertheless this little questyonary formulary
with the other books added thereto have ben often required and sought for, to
be had in english (as well of me as of other) by divers and many persons of
the said science. In consyderacyon aforesaid, and that it is comodyous, vtyle,
behooveful, and benefycyall to the common wealth of the said science and art. A
certain yonge gentle man inured in the said science have a book of the same
in french moved the right honest {per}soon Henry Dabbe bybliopolyst stacyoner
to have it translated in to english. At whose instigacyon meaning the help
of God (though most rudely) with the symplenes of a good willing heart I have
enterprised to do it in following dyrectly my copy. For I knowledge mine
enernyte in pronoucyng the english of the names and terms naturally
expressed in the said book, as well in greek, latyne, other, which mine
author hath not reduced in to french, which names and terms I comyt to the
dyscrecyon, emendacyon, and grauyte of t^em that have the perfytenesse of the
said science and faculty. For as Phylyatros says, many terms and names
that are symply spoken in one language and science is harde to be spoken in an
other, except they be expressed, and what they signyfye. wherefore curteys and
gentle reders take this in worth, and desyst mine ygnoraunce in the same with
your scyentycall benevolence, and clear fronysate intellygence. And Iesus
preserve you. Amen.

Hereafter follows the questyonary of Cyrurgyens.
The Demand or questyon.
WHat is Cyrurgery? The responce or answer. Cyrurgery is science that teaches
the manner and qualyte to work / principally in knyttynge / in cutting / and
exercysyng other works of ye hand. In healynge of man, as much as it is
possible. And here science is put for kind. And albeit that Cyrurgery is of it
self proprely by art and no science / yet for the bond and affynytie that
art and science have each with other / sometime vnproprely that which is art
is called science / and that which is science is called art. It is otherwise
said (and better) that Cyrurgery is in two manners. One is that shows only
so yt by it we can do nothing as touching the operation / and that proprely
is called science / as we say in physycke that there be.vi. manners of simple
appostumes / that is to wit.iiij. humeralles / one aignous / the other vetous.
The other manner of cyrurgery is usance / that is to say / that it teaches to
use / that he yt knows it may help him self therewith as many times and as
often as he will as touching Cyrurgycall operacions / so that by it he is
governed and ruled when he will use it / as by the Cyrurgery that he hath in
his understanding / that teaches him that in all hot appostumes he ought to
put and lay to it repercutyues / sauf unto them that ben in the sumuytones /
and to such as be venymous / This Cyrurgery or art that thou haste in thine
understanding / teaches the to work use manually in medecynes / and is
proprely called art and not science. And in the end of thy dyffynicion beside
the particulers that are put for differences that are set unto that which is
possible / for it is not possible to all Cyrurgyens to heal all them that are
diseased and sore. Demand. In what case ought a Cyrurgyen to use very cure?
And in what cases is he permytted to use only palliatiue cures. Answer. In
all cases ought he to use very cure / except in three cases / where as lonely
he is permitted the cure palliatyue. The first is when the disease of them
selfes are uncurable as lazary. The second for ye inobedyence of ye patient to
suffer the pains that he ought / because his might can not suffer it / as is
the Canker in a pertyculer mebre. The third / if by the cure of such a disease
there follows a greater inconuenyent / as in to evil inveterate sores / or in
to old emeroides / if there be not always left an issue there as any danger is
/ for dread to fall in to ydropsy or manyake / as Ipocras saith in his
Aphorysmes. Demand. Whereof is named Cyrurgery? Answer. It is so named of chyr
/ that is a hand / and of Gow / that is operation / for it is a science that
teaches to work by hand yt is manually. Demand. What is the subject of
cyrurgery? Answer. The subject of Cyrurgery is the body of man that is
diseased sore able to be healed, for it is therabout that the Cyrurgyen
works. Demand. what is theffecte of Cyrurgery? Answer. Theffect thereof is
to take away the disease of manes body / and to keep it in health as much as
it is possible.

Demand. In howe many kinds or parties is Cyrurgery devised? Answer.
Iohanyce says that generally it is devised in two, that is to wit to work in
soft members / as in the flesh. And to work in the harde mebres as the
bones. And partyculerly Cyrurgery is divided in.v. That is to wit to work in
woudes / in appostumes / in sores / and in restoracyons / and in other things
belonging to handy operation. Demand. What divers operacions exercises the
Cyrurgyen? Answer. In three divers operacions. That is to wit dysolue the
thing continued / knyt the thing separated / and put out the superflue
thing. To dyssolue the thing continued is by incysynge / cuttynge / or
scaturysyng. To reioyne the seperate as in consolydynge the wounds and
redusynge the lyppes. And to put out the superflue things, as in curing
appostumes to cleanse them and put away the coores. Demand. Howe many and what
yrens ought a Cyrurgyen to bear in his case with him? Answer. He ought to
have.v. as Cysers / Nyppers / Launcettes / Rasoures / and Nedelles. Demand.
Howe many and what oyntement{is} commonly ought the Cyrurgyen bear with him?
Answer.v. That is to wit / an oyntement Basylycon for to ripe / Apostolorum to
cleanse / Aureum to increase flesh. And the white oyntement for to dry and
bind. And de Althea for to sowple.

Demand. Of howe many thing{is} / and what things the Cyrurgyen takes his
entencions for to heal sore folks? Answer. That after Galyen in his
terapentyc they ben taken of three things. That is of things against nature /
of natural things / and of unnatural things / and also of their annexes.
And first he takes this indycacyon of things against nature / that is to wit
to the knowledge of the malady in his nature after Galyen in the second of his
terapentic. And than come unto the naturalles / and after to the vnnaturalles
and their annexes. And so after his indycacyons taken he ought to proceed to
the healing of the pacyent in all that may lye in him possible. And let the
Cyrurgyen note that it is said / in all that may lye possible in him / because
it is not always possible. And with what things, and howe. For as galyen saith
toward ye end of his third book / and in the seventh of his said terapentyc
/ ^f the intencyons curatyues ben few / and according / the cure is easy to
the Cyrurgyen as in a simple wound. But where there is many consy^eracyons
which in it self are contrary / as in a holowe woude and apostumate and nyghe
to a noble membre, the Cyrurgyen ought to consydre.iij. things. The first is,
if there be two contrary diseases, whereof ye cure of the one lets the other
(which is most doubtful and dangerous if it remain) in such case he ought
to begin his cure at the most dangerous / where there is most peril in the
remaining of it / and oftentimes more sooner in the accydentes that happens
in a sore / then in the sore self. As when a great flux of blode ouercometh in
any woude or any sore fretynge that hath corroded any vain / in such case
often he must leave the healynge of the sore for to entende to the flux of
blode that is so great. Likewise if in a sore were any synew that was pricked
whereof follows cramp / there must he begin at the pryckyng of the synew for
danger of the spasna, which is most peryllous. The second thing that the
Cyrurgyen ought to consydre is / if one of the said dyseases be not the cause
of the other, and nouryssheth not the other. In such case he ought to begin at
the cure of it that is the syller and nouryssher of the other. For till that yt
which is the causer of the other be totally extyrped the healynge can not be.
Demand. Howe many consideracions ought the Cyrurgyen to have touching his
form and general manner to work manually? Answer. After Arnolde de villa
nova, he ought to have.iiij. The first is he ought to consydre what operation
it is that he ought to do to manes body. And it is known by the dyuysyon of
the operacyons of Cyrurgery aforesaid / that is to knyt the thing divided.
The second consyderacyon is / that he ought to consydre wherefore he works.
And this is known by ye general intention of Cyrurgery, that comaudeth to do
the operacions unto the body of man profitably with confidence or surenes. The
third consyderacyon is / that he ought to consydre if such operation be
necessary convenable to be done to manes body. And this he knows when it can
not be healed otherwise. And the fourth consyderacyon is / that the Cyrurgyen
ought to know howe to bestow his remedies to the body of man. In these
consyderacyons the Cyrurgyen ought to take heed in doing all things that he
ought to do / as touching this operation / as well before the working as after.
The which.iiij. consyderacyons thou may have and perceive by such an
example. If thou will draw water fro the belies of ydropikes by manual
operation. First thou ought to consydre that the operation which thou will do
is to draw out the said water. Secondely thou ought to consydre wherefore thou
doest it / for it is for to ^eale / or at ye least way to give ease. Thyrdly
why there such operation be necessary / needful / or possy^e. And thou ought to
wit that it is necessary at ^ast ways if thou will heal an ydropyke of the
^dropesy confermed / and thou know that it is ^defull and possible if the
might of the pacyent ^e strong / for if it be weke be well ware for to do it.
And fourthly thou ought to cosydre the manner to do it, which is such. First lye
thy patient upright, and than with a rasour cut the skin of his belly under
the navel unto the void places that are between the cyphac and the myrac. And
also thou ought to make incision on ye left side if the disease come of the
right side. Contrarywyse make ye incysion on the right side if it come fro the
left, and than put a little quyll or rede in to the hole, wherewith thou shalt
draw out of that water after the strength of ye patient. And when thou will
draw no more / take away the quyll and let the skin of the belie go that
will close the hole that no more water come out. And when thou will draw any
more do as thou did before. Demand. Howe many and what conditions ought a
Cyrurgyen to have? Answer, iiij, The first is that he ought to be learned and
a clarke / not only in the pryncyples beginning of Cyrurgery / but likewise
in Phisyke, and asmoche in theoryke as pra^tyke^ For in theoryke he ought to
know the natural things and vnnaturalles / and against nature, First he
ought to know the unnatural thing{is} / and chyefly the nathomy / for without
it nothing can be done surely in Cyrurgery / as it appears afterward more
plainly. Also he ought to know the complexyon of his patient / for after the
dyuersyte of the nature of the bodies ought the medycyns be diversified as
Galyen declares all along in his terapentyke against Thesilus. And by like
reason ought he for to know the strength. Secondly he ought to know the
unnatural thing{is}, that is ye meat / the drink. c. for they are cause of
all health when they be used as they ought to be. And also they be causes of all
maladies when they are evil used. Thyrdly he ought to knowledge the thing{is}
against nature, which are.iij. The disease, the causes, and the accydentes of
the disease. First he ought to know ye disease. Secondly the cause thereof /
for if he healed otherwise (it should not be of a sayntes disease / as good old
women say) it should be but case of adventure. Thyrdly he ought to know the
accydentes that chance to come in dyseases / for often times it preuaryeth the
same self cure of the dyseases / as Galyen declares in the beginning of the
book that he sent to Glauton his dyscyple. As I said before he ought for to
^owe the unnatural things / and to mynystre them as they ought / that are
meat / drink. c. Also by this ye shall understand that the Cyrurgyen ought
to know howe to mynistre medicyns ^atyues / which are one of the instruments
of ^syke as of Cyrurgery / without the which the ^ence of Cyrurgery can not be
coplete. And this (...) ought to know as touching ye practice. Thus (...)
appears the veryfycacyon of the first con^yon that a Cyrurgyen ought to have
/ for he ^ght to be lettred learned. And this condition ^areth Galyen in the
first book of the Tera^yke against Thesyllo, where he saith at this ^ynte. If
Physycyens had nothing to do with Astronomye / Geometrye / Logyke / Gramer /
nor with other good doctrynes / the Cobbelers / Corryers of leather / Carpenters
/ Smythes, and such manner of people wold leave their crafts rene to Physyke,
become Physicyens. The second codycyon yt a Cyrurgyen should have / is to be
expert / and ought to have sen other masters work. And this wytnesseth
Auenzoar when he said thus. It behooves that every Physycyen first know /
and than to have use and experience. The third condition that a Cyrurgyen
ought to have / is that he ought not to be a fool / vnwytty / nor of rude
understanding. But as Haly saith in the third book de regni / he ought to be
a man of good memory / of good judgment / of good dylygence / of a clear sight
/ hole of mind / and of his members, with sclender fyngers / a steadfast hand
without shaking. The fourth condition is that a Cyrurgyen shulde have / is
that he ought to be well manered / bold / and sure in things that be not to
fear. And doubtful, fearful in peryllous things. And ought to eschew all
desperate cures / and ought to be gentle to his patients, well willing to his
company / wyly in pronostykynge / chaste / sobre / meke / and merciful / not
anaricious / nor extorcyoner for money. but after the capacyte of the pacyent /
and the faculte received / competent and moderate reward. Demand. Howe many
what conditions ought the pacyent to have that will be healed by the art of
Cyrurgery? Answer. That he ought to have.iij. conditions. The first that he
ought to be obedyent to his Cyrurgyen / as the seruaunt toward his master /
as Galyen declares in the first of his Terapentyke. The second condition of
the pacyent / is that he ought to have trust in his cyrurgyen / for he heleth
most in whom he trusts most / as Galyen says in the first book of
Pronostykes. And the thyde condition is / that he take pacyence in him self /
for pacyence is it yt ouercometh. Demand. Howe many and what conditions ought
the assystentes and seruautes or mynysters of the pacyent have? Answer. As
Galyen saith in the end of the first comment of the afforysmes. The conditions
of the company / mynysters and seruautes of them that are diseased ought to be
such as pleases the pacyent / so yt they ought to have agreeable seruautes put
to them, being true, loving, peasyble, gentle, and discrete.

Here begins the second treaty / wherein is moved and assoyled certain
questyons and dyffyculties touching the Nathomy.
Demand.
Wither the science of the Nathomye be necessary and needful to the
Cyrurgyen or not / by howe many what manners? Answer. Yee^ The science of the
Nathomy is needful and necessary to the Cyrurgyen / as it appears by two
reasons. The first Galyen puts in the.vj. book of his Terapentyke, and is
such, for the Cyrurgyens that be ygnoraunt in the Nathomy may are in many
manners in their incysyon of synewes and their knyttynges, the which if they
knew the nature of every mebre, their setting and colligacion that they have
in all the body, and with every only membre partyculer / if it did happen yt
they were hurt they should know if the synewes were cut or not. And by this
same reason they should not are in their incisions. And this reason is
confirmed by an example yt Henry de Maudeuille puts / saying that the same
manner that a blind man works in hewynge of a log, so doth a cyrurgyen that
knows not the nathomy. For like as a blind man that heweth on a log knows
not howe much he should hew thereof, nor howe, therefore commonly he arreth hewynge
more or less than he ought to do. Likewise so doth the Cyrurgyen that works
in manes body without the Nathomy. Also the said Henry approves that the
Cyrurgyen ought of necessyte to know ye Nathomy, for every workman is bound
to know the subject of his work in which he works, or else he shulde are
in workynge. Tha^ likewise if it so be that the subject of the Cyrurgyen be
the body of menkynde, it must be of necessyte that the Cyrurgyen do know ye
body of mankynde in it self / and in the parties thereof, so tha^ it is
necessary for a Cyrurgyen to know the Nathomy. And this is for the first
part of the questyon. The second part where is demanded to howe many and
what things the science of Nathomy is necessary to the Cyrurgyen. That is to
wit howe many proffytes and vtylities be of the science of Nathomy? The
answer. The science of the Nathomy is necessary and needful to the Cyrurgyen
for.iiij. vtylyties. The first and the greatest is for ye marvel of the
great power of God the creator of men, that so hath made them to his likeness
form. The second is for to have the knowledge of the members yt may be
diseased. The third for because to have knowledge to tell the disposicions to
come of ye mebres. The fourth is for to heal the dyseases yt come to the
mebres. Demand. What is Anathomye, and whereof is it deryuate? Answer.
Anathomy is the right determynacyon and dyuysyon of every partyculer membre of
ye body of mankynde. And is deryuate of Ana, that is to say (night) that is to
say (dyuysyon.) Thus Anathomy is called night dyuysyon of members done for
certain knowleges. Demand. In howe many which manners ought ^he science of
Anathomy be taught? Answer. In ^wo manners. That is to wit by way of doctrine
as by books written thereof. In saying and redynge that which hath ben write by
aucyent doctors / and by experience / in deuysynge and Anathomysynge the dead
corpses. As did Mundy and Bo^oyne, and as likewise did master Bertruce, that
when he had a dead body by beheadyng or other wise / he laid him on a bench
in making.iiij. partycyons. In the first he divided the nutratyf mebres, for
they be disposed to putrefaccyon. And in the second the spyrytuall members.
And in the third the anymall mebres. And in the fourth the extremities. And
upon every mebre ought to be sought.ix. things. That is to wit the posycyon /
the complexyon, the substance, the quantyte, the nombre, the figure, the
operation, the vtilite, and what dyseases may come thereunto. Demand. What is
the body humayne? Answer. It is one hole together decorate with reason /
composed of many and divers members. Demand. what is membre? Answer. Divers
auctours have given divers diffinicions. G. in the first book of the vtylyte
of the partycles says it is a body that is not holly seperate, nor holly
conioynt to another. And also in the first book of his canon he defyneth it in
plurell, and saith thus, that mebres ben bodies that are engendered of the
first comyction of humours. Demand. Howe many manners of members are found?
Answer. Two. That is to wit, simple members called conseblables, and mebres
compost. The simple members ben they that may not be divided into another
kind, but what party thou take of them it bears always ye name and the
dyffynycyon of his hole. As the bone / for what part thou take of the bone
be it more or less ever it bears ye name and diffinicion of the bone, for
every part of a bone in bone / and every part of a synew in synew. The
compost members contraryly be they that may be divided in other kinds, for no
part of them separated bears not away the name of all. As the hand, the
leg, the head. Demand. Howe many simple mebres ben there? Answer. There
be.xi. That is to wit the bones, grystles, or cartilages, the synewes, the
veins, the anteres, the pannicules, the s^rynges. The cords, the skin, the
flesh, the greece or fat, the hear, and the nails. The which although that
verytably they be not members / nevertheless in asmoche as they have vtylyte in
ye body of man kind, have regeneracyon as the members, they be called members,
though it be vnproprely.

Demand. If all the mebres may regenerate after their perdition, knit
again after their dislocacio^ Answer. For to declare that behooves two
things to be noted. First yt the simple members be of two manners. Some be
sanguyne members of whom the generation is of sanguyne matter, as the flesh
and the greece. And the other mebres be spermatyke members so named / because
they have their breding and beginning of sparmatyke matter. Secondly it is to
be noted yt there be two manners of regeneracyon. One is very regeneracion,
which is very reformation of the mebre in the same self substance, form,
qualyte, and quantite, and other such accidents proprely as it was before the
corrupcion and alteration. And the other is regeneracyon not very / but like
thereto as nyghe as may be. And likewise there is.ij. manners of consolydacyon /
one is true, that is when both the parts of the thing that is dyssolued by
seperatynge / and reassembled and knyt without any manner of apperynge of the
dyssolucyon before / and without any means. And ye other is untrue
consolydacyon / and like to the other as nyghe as can be done, by means of the
poor that the Physycyons call Porus sarcoydes. These things ^derstande noted
/ I say first that all sanguyne members may regenerate and knyt by very
regeneracion and consolidacion, for continually there engenders blode enough
within the body for to regenerate the substance of the sanguyne membre lost,
for to reconsolidate and knyt it again. I say secondly that no members
sparmatyf after the loss of their substance may not regenerate because that
their matter is attribuate to them at the very beginning of their creacyon, and
after that never engendre again. And also for their so lidite, because they
are weke of here moisture. And for these causes and reasons they do not
reconsolydate with true reconsolydacyon after the desolucion of their
seperatyng, but nature strengthynge always possible thing{is} the best that
she may / will not leave them thus dyssolute, reioyneth and knytteth them the
best that she may / and engenders a flesh (for to hold ye dissolved
parties) that is called porus sarcoydes. Demand. Be all the members
consemblables of one coplexyon. Answer? No / for some be hot moyste / and the
other cold moist / and other cold dry. And of the hot dry there is none /
for amoge all members coseblables, there is none more hot dry tha the skin
that is temperate. And it is not only temperate among the members of mankynde
/ but also among all the substauces of thing{is} that may engendre and
corrupt / as Galyen says in his first book of coplexyons / the last
Chapytre. The members hot moyste be the mebres that are sanguyne / as the
flesh / the spyrytes / and the natural humydities / as wills Auerroys in
the ^. of collyges. The members cold and moyste are the flewme, fat / or the
greece, and the maroughes. The members cold and dry are all the other mebres
after their degrees / as the bones / the cartylages / the strings or cords /
the lygumentes, the ^newes / the veins / arteres / pannycules. And here is the
mayne see / where as it behooves ney^her Physycyen nor Cyrurgyen to sail, for
a phy^eyen and Cyrurgyen ought for to know ye com^xion of the mebres / as
natural Philosophers. Demand. Which are the mebres compostes / and wherefore
are they called organykes instrumentalles? Answer. The members compostes be
meores that are composed of the simple and consemblable members. And therefore
they be called therogenes / that is to say of divers natures / and may be
divided in divers kinds / that is to wit in to members consemblables / and
their parties bears not away the dyffinycion and reason of the hole. As to the
second questyon that asks why they be called organykes ins^rumentalles? The
answer is, because they are ins^rumentes of the soul / as by the hands / the
fete / the liver / ye face, and the semblables. Demand. Howe be the organyke
members ordained and composed. Answer. Some of these members be pryncypalles /
and the other not pryncypalles. Demand. Howe many vnpryncypal members be
there? and howe many vnpryncypal. Answe^e. There be.ii^. pryncypalles / that is
to wit the heart / the liver / the brain / the genytalles / all the other be
called vnpryncypalles. Demand. Of what complexyon is the heart? Answer. The
heart is hot because it is like the very brenynge hot oven of all the body /
fro whens comes the heat to all the body. And albeit that Philosopher have
willed to say that it is teperate because it is pryncyple / and that it gives
beginning of life. Nevertheless the heart is dry in his complexyon because
of his composycyon / for it is composed of strings pannycles / and of harde
and styf flesh. Demand. Of what complexyon is the liver? Answer. It is hot
and moyste. For the mos^e part of the things that it is composed is flesshely
/ blody / therewith ben transmysed divers pypes or arteres.

Demand. Of what complexyon is the brain? Answer. It is cold and moyste,
because it hath a marowy substance. Nevertheless it differs fro the
maroughe / because the brain is a sparmatyke membre / the marough is a
sanguyne membre. And thereby it is cold in comparison of other members / and
that not symply / for all members be naturally hot. Demand. Of what
complexyon are the kydneys and the mylt? Answer. The kydneys be hot moyste /
how be it the kydneys be not so hot as ye mylt, because of the gross blode
that is in the mylt, like as the mylt is not so hot as the liver. Demand. Of
what complexyon is the lunges? Answer. Hot and moyste. It is hot because
that heat is sent to it from the heart as Galyen says in ye fourth book of ye
vtylite of the particles / is moyste / but not so moyste as the greas / for it
melts not at the fire as the greas doth.

Demands upon the Anathomy of the skin or the leather.
Demand. What is the skin. Answer. It is a covering of the body of
mankynde / ^at is composed context and wonen with thre^s and veins / with
synewes and arteres / for to ^nde the body give it feeling. Demand. (...) many
manners of skynes or leather are there? ^swere. Two, one is extrynsyke or
outforth, and ^at is proprely called leather. The other is intryn ^ke / and that
is proprely called pannycle rym or skin as be those of the head yt cover the
brain and the skull / they yt cover ye bowels of ye body.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the greas.
Demand. What is the grease? Answer. It is a thing in the humayne body /
that is as oil that chauffeth and humecteth the body. Demand. Howe many
manners of greas be there? Answer. Two. The one is without forth ne'er to the
skin / that proprely is called adeps or fatness. And ye other is inward nyghe
to the belly / proprely is called auxunge or fat grease.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the flesh.
Demand. Howe many manners of flesh are found? Answer. Three. One is very
flesh and propre / and it is found but in a little quantite, one in two
places of the body of mankynde. That is on the heed of the yerde / and between
the teeth. The other is glandulouster, odenose, or cruddy and kyrnele, as is
the flesh of the ballockes / of the dugs and the flesh of the emuntores.
The other is flesh musculous or lacertous yt is harde as bawme styffe or
knotty. And this is found in great quantyte, and over all the body where as is
any manifest moeuynges.

Demand upon the muscles and lacertes.
Demand. Be the muscles simple membres^ Answer. yea, as touching the
sensyble iugement / Howbeit of very troth they are mebres composed of synewes
/ of lyens / strings / thredes^ and flesh that fulfylleth them / of the
panycule that covers them. Demand. Wherein agrees and differ the muscles
and lacertes? Answer. It is all one thing / which after divers consyderacyons
hath ben called muscle and lacerte / for it is called muscle for his
resemblance of a mouse / that in latin hight mus. And it is called lacerte
^ycause it hath thy form of a Lyzard / for like as those two beestes are byg
in the middle and sclender toward the tail / so is the muscle or lacerte.
^Demaunde. What is the manner howe do the muscles and lacertes proceed in the
body of mankynde. Answer. After that the muscles is composed as is aforesaid /
from it descends roude strings and cords that comes nygh to the joints /
the which when they be nygh the joints they do ^de abroad and enlarge / and
reyse the joint all ^out with the panycle that covers the bones. ^d when they
are passed the joint / they do wax ^unde again / and return into cords
with ^he flesh make another muscle. And of this mus^ proceeds and rises
another roude corde and ^ges that binds the joint all about moe^. And so
cease not to {pro}cede till they come (...) ^he extreme and ferthest
partycles of the body. (...) thus always ye muscle proceeds the jointure. ^d as
the synewes that proceed of the noddle ta^th form of muscle at the neck and
at the breast, and than comes to the joint of the shoulder. And ^ecometh round
strings and spredynge flat in comprysynge all the joint / and do plant them
in the bone of the joint and moeueth it. And when they come fro the joint of
ye sholdre a two or three fyngre breed they wax round in cordewyse. And with
the flesh and string that comes from the head to the bone of the shouldre
is made muscle upon the midst of the bone of the jointure / fro which comes
a corde that three fyngre breed fro the elbow enlarges and comprises all the
elbow and moeueth the little arm. And three fyngers be pond it waxes roude
returns in to a corde. The which with the string that comes fro the neck
and with the flesh make a muscle upon the said little arm / of the which
muscle is made a corde / and three fyngers fro the joint of the little hand it
spredeth and comprises all the jointure of the said hand / than it twisteth
roude again and enters the muscle of the midst of ye hand / of the which
comes cords that move ye fyngers, by the which things it appears that the
wounds that are made about three fyngers of the joints be peryllous, for the
synewy cords be made bare of the flesh and apparentes. Of the which all
only pryckynge is cause of spasme or cramp / and of death as Galyen saith in
the third book de regny, and in the second of his terapentyc / which is to be
noted of the Cyrurgyen.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the synewes.
Demand. What is synew. Answer. It is a simple membre created to give
feeling and moving to the members deputed to nature. Demand. For howe many
distributary intencyons were they created? Answer. After Galyen in the fourth
book of the vtylyte of the partycules in the last Chapytre, they were created
for three intencions. One is to give feeling to the organykes sensytyfes. The
second to give moeuynge to the motyfe or styrynge members. And thyrdly to give
knowledge to all the other members of the things that hurt them. And it is
notably said to the sensytyfe or feeling members. For in the cartilages or
grystles, nor in bones, nor glaudylous or cruddy ^lesshe the synewes be not
penetrate but in ye teeth / as Galyen saith in ye book aforesaid. Demau^ Fro
whens bredeth the synewes? Answer. All the synewes of the body breed and come
out of the ^ayne by it self / or of the noddle that is his vy^, between the
which some breed of ye foreparte (...) the brain / and they be softer and more
propre ^ g^ue feeling than moving. And the other come (...) and breed of the
hyndre part of the noddle / (...) descend fro the brain / and these be har^
more propre to give moving than feeling. ^emaunde. If the feeling moeuynge by
one ^ynew alone or by many? Answer. After Ga^n in the first book of the
interyours / sometime they are borne by one synewe alone, and sometime by many.
Demand. Howe many apparel or like synewes be there that without mean spring
and breed of ye brain. And howe many pareyle or like synewes comes fro it by
mean of the noddle? Answer. Fro the brain immediately springs.vij.
pereylles. And.xxx. pareylles come fro it by mean of the nuke that breed
behind by the end of the lossarn / as Haly Abbess says in his book de Regaly
dispositione, in ye second sermon of the fore party.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the strings ^r lyens.
Demand. Of what nature ben the lyens or strings / and whereof breed they?
Answer. They be of the nature of synewes / how be it they breed of the bones.
Demand. Howe many manners of lyens or string{is} be there? Answer. Two. Some
binds the bones inward. And the other binds the joints outward / as
Galyen says in the.xii. book of the vtilite of the partycles in the first
Chapytre, of cowplynge of bones / that they are comprysed about with strong
brauched string{is}.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the cords.
Demand. Of what nature are the corbes? Answer. The strings ben almost as
all of one nature / for both be of the nature of synewes / but yet the cords
more than the string{is}. For like as the strings be mean among the cords
and the bones / so be the cords mean among ye strings the synewes. Demand.
Whereof breed the cords / and whens take they feeling and mouynge. Answer.
They breed of the muscles / and take feeling and mouynge of the synewes /
whereby the members are moved. Demand. Wherefore is it that when the cords
withoutforth are cut the membre leases bowynge / and when they withinforth are
cut the mebre leases ye stretching. Answer. Albeit the cords be round when
they issue of the muscle, yet do they sprede when they ^ome to the joint / and
they are lyens or strings that are set round about the said joint / as the
cords about the mebre / so that they withinforth ^awe the mebre / they
withoutforth do stretch it. And when the one draws ye other loses. And
(...) when they are cut outward the bowynge is (...). And when they are
cut inward the stret^ynge is lost.

Questyons upon the Anathomy upon the veins and arteres.
Demand. What is a vain? Answer. It is the place of the blode of
nourysshyng. De^. What is artere. Answer. It is the pla^ the spyrytuall blode.
Demand. Wherein ^ag^e and differ the veins fro the arteres. An^. They do agree
in that they be of consembla^ dystryoucyon through all the body / that is in
^rynge of blode. And they differ in two things. The first appears by their
dyffynycyons aforesaid / that is yt the veins bears the nourysshyng blode /
and the arteres the spyrytuall blode. The second difference between them is
taken of the place of their breding. For the veins breed of the liver, and the
arteres of the heart as Galyen saith in the.xvij. book of the partycles.
Demand: Do they separe in any wise one from the other in the body of mankynde
/ so that the veins may be without the arteres, and the arteres without the
veins. Answer. In some places the veins do separe from the arteres. And the
arteres be food without veins. As it is manifest both in ye arms / and in
rethe mirable, howbeit no vain is found without artere. Demand. What is the
manner of proceeding of the veins arteres through the body? Answer. When they
go forth of the place of their breding, they rene forkewyse in two parties /
the one upward and the other downward / and yet of them every party
braunchet^ and proceeds unto the last and extreme parties of ye body for to
nourysshe and give life to all th^ members thereof.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the bones.
Demand. Wherefore are the bones made? Answer. Because they shulde be the
foundacyon of all the body susteynynge thereof. And therefore they are made harde
and strong the better to here the burden of all the other. How be it some of ye
bones are made for the defece of the inward members / as the bones of the
heed, the breast bone, and the back bone. Demand. Howe many in nombre are all
the bones in a body of mankynde^ Answer. Auycen says that there
is.CC.xlviij. sauf the bone that is called (os laud) where the tongue is
founded. The which bones thou may consider and se by the figure here before
written / and of which partyculer mention shall be made, and declared in this
present treaty. Demand Howe ben the dyuersytyes among the bones of the body
of mankynde? Answer. They be deuersyfyed in divers manners / for some because
of ye joints are full of maroughes / the other not. Some are straight / other
crooked. Some are little / and ^ome byg. And all bones are bigger at the ends
^han in the midst by reason of the joints. And ^ome are enbossed for to
entre, and other have va^nytees that receives. And some have both the one and
ye other. And other have neither one nor the other. And of them that have
enbossyng{is} and ^a^uytees, some have them clauelares like keys (...) ye teeth
/ And other ben sacratyles or saw wise, as the skull of the head. And other
knotty in each ^de as v^na in the thyghe. Other be foueable or ^olow as the
faucylles or fork bones. Other ha^e both sorts as the fyngers. And they that
have ^eyther one nor other ben joined solidatiuely, and they that have the
enbossynges and vacuacyons be they that make the joints / of whom comes
dyfloracyon and other separacyons.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the cartylages or grystles.
Demand. What is cartylage? Answer. It is a substance as it were of the
kind of bones, but it is softer or sowpler than the bone is. Demand.
Wherefore were the cartylages made? Answer. For two reasons. One to fulfil the
lack of the bone / as in the palpebres or eye lyddes / the nosethyrlles, and
ears. The second to make the better coniuction of the bones with the parties
next them, as in thorax and parties of the loins / because that the soft
substance, (as the flesh and other parties) be not hurt by the mouynge of
the bones which are harde.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the nails.
Demand. Wherefore are the nails made of the utter parts of the body?
Answer. The better to take hold.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the hears.
Demand. Wherefore were the hears made^ Answer. For two reasons / that is to
wit / to increase beauty and to purge.

Here ends the first partycle of the second treaty. And begins the
second ptycle / where as is moved ass^ysed certain questions and difficultees
upon the Anathomy of the members composed.
Demand.
WHat is the skull or scawpe of the head? Answer. It is that part of the
head that is full of hear / wherein the anymal members are contained.
Demand. Upon the seven things yt a good Anathomypost ought to consydre on
every mebre which are in the skull or scawpe of the heed. Answer. First his
helping appears by diffinicion abouesayd. The posycyon thereof is on the
highest place of the body. The col^ygaunce is notorious / for it hath
collygaunce with the face and the neck, and of it comes all the parties of the
face / the muscles moving the head be planted in the neck / which are of.ij.
manners. Some be proprely lacertes that breed nyghe the ^res / till they come to
the furcules or forks of (...) breast. The other be comyn in the neck heed /
which shall be said when we speak of the neck. The quantyte is more in man
than in any other beast / as the brain is more in man than in any ^ther
beast. The form thereof is round compry^ate lightly fro one part to another.
And it be^oueth that the part before behind be bony / ^s Galyen says in the
second de regni. And the ^ther cause of this form saith Galien in the.viij.
^oke of the vtilite of the partycles / because that it may be the less
passyble. The substance is bony and full of maroughe as appears by
experience. The complexyon is cold by means of ye parties that it is composed
of be cold. Demand. Of howe many and what parties is ye scawpe of the head
composed. Answer. After Auycen in the.ii^. book of his canon and.j. Chapytre
it is composed of.x. parties. That is to wit.v. conteynyng and v. sondry. The
contenautes that be without, first ben the hears / than the leather or skin /
than the flesh musculous / than the great panycle, and than the brain pane
skulle or crane. And the sondry ensuing withinforth ben the dura matter and the
pio matter / and than rethe myrable / and than the substance of the brain,
than the bone that is the foundacyon of the brain / than the rotes of the
synewes yt breed of the brain / which shall be spoken of by ordre. Demand.
Of what substance is the great panacle that is called Per^eranium / and whereof
bredeth it / and with what parties hath it collygaunce? Answer. First it is a
neruous or synewy substance. Secondly it is bred of the dura matter. And thyrdly
it hath collygauce with the said dura matter / and is bound with it / by
strings / synewes / veins that go in and out by ye comyssures or seames of
the brain pane or skull. Demand. Is the brain pane of one bone or of many /
and for what reason? Answer. It is of many, for it is of.vij. that join
together / and is so ordained because that if anoyauce come to one that it
shulde not come to another / and is conioynte with the comyssures called
sarratylles seames endented as teeth of a saw to thyntent that the fumosytees
or vapours may have issue fro the brain. Demand. Which are the.vij. that
the head is composed of? Answer. The first bone of the fore part is called
Coronall / that dureth and compryseth fro the midst of the orbytauntes unto
the comyssure that trauerseth the Crane or skull. And in it is the holes of the
eyes the collatores of the nosethyrlles. The which col^atores be departed by
the adding of bones in ma^er of a crest of a hene / within the which is
fast^ed the cartylages or grystles that deuydeth the ^osethyrlles. Howbeit it
is to wit that sometime ^he coronall is divided by a comyssure in the midst of
the brow / which most often is found in women, The second bone of the
head in the hyn^e part is called Occipitall / and is enclosed by a ^omyssure
thwartly in manner of a greek lettre cal^ Lampda / and is harde / and full of
pierced holes (...) by the which descends the nuke of the ^ayne through the
midst of the spondylles or ^dge bones till unto the end of the back, The
^yrde fourth bone of the head ben in the myd^e of the sides thereof / therefore
they high pery^sles / and be divided by a comyssure after the ^ength of the
noddle of the head / and by two commyssures be led unto the bones of the ears
/ and are square, The, v, and the, vj. be ye bones that are called Petrous /
for they are harde as a ^tone, Also they be called Scamous or scale / for they
be conioynte in manner of the scales of a fysshe with the said parietalles which
are the holes of the ears, and the instrument{is} mamylares of ye emuctures.
And be branched as like the bones called peryetalles with ye comyssure (called
Lampda) unto the bones of the temples. The.vij. bone is the bone bafylare /
that is like a wedge that closes susteyneth all the said bones over the rofe /
this bone is pierced and hath great spongeosyte to purge the gross
superfluytees and is of a gross substance. And these.vij. bones abouesayd are
pryncypalles. Howbeit beside these said bones there are yet other small bones
less pryncypalles that are made for certain helps, as is the bone of the
crete that deuyde the nosethyrlles within the coronall / and the equal bones
that are in the face. And the clauall bones y^ are the bones of the ears
whereunto are fastened ye muscles and cords that cover the Jaws. Demand.
Howe ought the parties inward of the head be well seen and known at the eye?
Answer. Ye ought to deuyde the skull with a saw after the roundenesse. Demand.
What is the dura matter and pie matter? Answer. They be two panycles full of
veins and arter{is} / whereof one is of the party of the head / and the other
of the party of the brain / that wraps and covers all the substance of
the brain. Demand. From whens comes the nourysshynge in to the brain?
Answer. It comes fro the soft moder by veins and arteres that comes by ye
holes of the inward bones / and outward by the comyssures of the superyour
bones. Demand. Where is the substance of the brain sytuate / and of what
shape, and of what substance and colour is it of? Answer. First it is
situate under the foot of hard moder / and is round in shape / white of
colour. Demand. By what reason are the members organykes / sensytyues / and
divers other double. Answer. Because that if one of them suffered the other
should not suffer. Demand. Howe many ^lies hath the brain after his length /
and howe ^any parts in each ventrycle / howe many and what virtues takes
their orygine in each party? Answer. First ye brain in length hath three
ven(...) / that is to wit / the ventrycle before / that (...) / that in the
midst / and the anteriour a^d mean / each is divided in.ii. parties. In each
(...) one virtue takes his origyne. In the fyrs^e (...) of the ventricle
before is put ye common blode. (...) second y^ virtue of ymagynacyon. In the
(...) ventry^le is put the cogitatyfe and racyo^. And in the hinder ventrycle
is put the virtue (...) or memoratyfe. Demand. Whi^ of these three ventrycles
are the byggest? An^were. The formoste is the byggest? The middle ^ost the
least, the hyndermost is mean. Demand. Hath the blode of ye other ventrycle
any ways? Answer. Yes, wherthorow all the spirits pass. Demand. In which
of the ventrycles is the wit of smelling founded? Answer. In the foremost
ventrycle where the adding mamyllares are / it is founded. Demand. Howe many
cowples of sensityfe synewes come fro the brain / and fro which part?
Answer. From the anteryour part comes.vij. pair of synewes sensytyfes
which go to the eyes / to the ears / to the stomach / and other mebres.
Demand. In which ventrycle of the brain ben the places called lacune /
vernus / fornus / ancafernis / the glaudynous flesh that fulfylleth them?
Responce. They be in the mean ventrycle. Demand. Where is rethe mirable set,
whereof is it composed? Answer. It is set under the panycles / and is only
composed of arteres yt comes fro the heart. Demand. Where is the vital spirit
made anymall how? Answer. It is made of the said arteres that rethe myrable is
composed by the labour of ye complexyon of the brain? Demand. Is ye nuche any
party of ye brain? Answer. It seems to be a party thereof, and therefore the
signs and accidents are as they of the brain / as Galyen says in the.xi.
book of the vtylyte of the partycles. Demand. Whereof bredeth the maroughe of
the nuche, and howe? Answer. It bredeth of the hinder part of the brain /
wrapped with two pannycles as the brain. Demand. Howe proceeds the maroughe
of the nuche / what synewes breed of it? Answer. It descends by the
spondyles unto the end of the back / of it bredeth motyfe synewes. Demand.
What dyseases may come to the scalp of the head? Answer. There may come
wounds / appostumes / ill complexyons. Demand. What wounds of the scalp of
the heed be most peryllous? Answer. To penetrate all the skulle / but more
the touching the rymmes / but most of all yt touches the substance
medulare. Demand. Wherefore is it that the operacyons Cyrurgycalles that are
done about ye comyssures be suspect? Answer. For fear lest the dura matter
fall not on the pie matter / that it compryme the brain. Demand. Howe ought
the incy^ons of the heed be made? Answer. They ought ^ ^e made according as
the hears do proceed / (...) so proceeds the muscles.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the face / and parties thereof.
Demand. Which are the parties of the face / whereof it is composed? Answer.
The ^owes / the iyes / the nosethyrlles / the ears / the ^mples / the chekes /
the Jaw bone / with ye teeth. Demand. Whereof is the forheade comsed? Answer.
One of the skin musculous flesh / ^or the bone vnderneth is of the
coronall. Demand. Howe is the form of the brows made? Answer, Of the bone
that is under the brow, for ^he spongeosite of the second table of y^ said
bone is raised along as if it were double / and that makes the form of the
brows. Demand, wherefore are ye brows made, Answer. They are made for the
more beauty / and to save the eyes / therefore the eyes are armed with them,
Demand, Howe ought incysyons be made in those parties? Answer. They ought to
be made after the length of the body / for so proceeds the nuche, and not
after the rugnesse. Demand. Wherefore are the eyes made / where are they set?
Answer. They are made to be instruments of the sight / and are set within the
bone arbytall that is a party of the coronall / the bones of the temples.
Demand. Wherefore are the synewes obtykes pierced? Answer. For to be the way
of the spyryte vysyble. Demand. What is the manner that proceeds the obtyke
synewes from their bredynge unto the eyes? Answer. It is thus / for first
they proceed from both the sides / one here and another there. And when they
are within the skull they come and join together / and than deuyde them each
from the party that it is breed / proceed not thwart each over other cross
wise from the right side to the left side / nor fro the left side to the right
side, as some have wened. Demand. Of howe many vestures or tunycles ben ye
eyes composed? Answer. Of.vij. The first without is called coniuctiua / that
is thycke and white. And it compasses all the eye / except that yt appears of
that yt is called cornea / and it is bred of the panycle that covers the
skull that compasses all the eye / suppose that in it self is but three / yet
for the dyuersyte of colours that takes about the midst of the eye that is
called yris, it is said that there is.vj. where of the other three ben of the
party of the brain / the other three be of the party withoutforth. The first
bredeth of dura matter / and in the inward party it is called slirotiqua / and
in the outward cornea. The second bredeth of pia matter / and of the inward
party it is called Secundina / and of the outward party it hight vnca. The
third bredeth of the synew abtyke / and of the inward party is called rethina
/ and of the outward part on the humour Crystallyn it hight Aranea. Demand.
Of howe many humours is the eye composed? Answer Of.iiij. The first that is
set in the midst of the eye is called humour crystallyn / by cause it is of
colour of Crystal in form of a hayle done / wherein pryneypally is founded the
syghte. After this humour so nyghe the brain is ye giasy ^umour that
susteyneth compryseth all the hyn (...) party of ye humour crystallyne. And
both these ^mours ben wrapped with panycle oblyke. The ^hyrde humour that is on
the fore party is called the humour Albugineus. And this humour is be^wene the
said weithe or tunycle called Rethina ^ ^hat which bredeth of pia matter. The
fourth hu^our puts Galyen in the book of ye vt^lytes of ye ^rtycles last
chapitre y^ is called the humours ^era lu^ida in the region of the black of
the eye and it is all spyrytuall. Demand. Whereof is the eye composed beside
the parties aforesaid? Answer. Over and beside these foresaid things the eye
is composed of mouynge synewes / descending fro the second equalyte of synewes
coming down fro the brain / and the six muscles that move them / and fro the
veins and arteres / and the spongeous flesh that fulfil the places about the
lachrymall / the palpebres neighbours cartylagynouses with hears determined
closing the superyour parties with a muscle / opening with two transuersall
muscles. Demand. Of howe many substauces is the nose, and howe many what
partycles hath every substance? Answer. It is of three substances / that is
to wit of substance flesshely / bony / and cartilagynous, The flesshely
substance hath the skin and two muscles about the hinder part. The bony
substance hath two trianguler bones wherewith the bridge is raised up / and the
foundacyons do join on the one part by the midst of the length of the nose,
and on the other after the days. The subcartylagynous is dowble / one outward
that makes the typ of the nose / and the other inward deuydeth the
nosethyrlles. The nosethyrlles ben two gutters ascendyng unto the bone of the
collatory where as are applicate the addicions mamylares of the brain where as
smell is descending unto the palace nygh lanulle / by the which channels is
drawn the fumous vaporacyon to the said places. And the air is brethed
respyred to the lunges / and the brain is purged of superfluytees. Demand.
Of what substance / form / and what place / and for what cause were the ears
made? Answer. First they are made of cartylagynous substance. Secondly they
are holowe of form. Thyrdly they are set on the petrous bones. And fourthly
they be ordained to the hearing.

Demand. Fro whens comes the hearing to the ears? Answer. It comes by the
streyt holes of the bones petrous by mean of a synewe that comes to the ears
that bredeth of the.v. equalyte of synewes of ye brain. Demand. Whereof
serves the glaudinous flesh that is under the ^ares? Answer. That they may
be clensers of the brain. Demand. Whereof ferueth certain veins that
parnygh by that place? Answer. Af^er Lanfrankes in tencyon / because they cary
the ^ater sparmatyke to the ballockes. And therefore if ^hey be cut a man is
never apt to generation. Nevertheless Galyen holds the contrary / as ^ycen
recyteth in the treaty of the lygnage. ^Demaude. Whereof serve the temples /
the che^ / and the Jaws? Answer. They be parties of (...) sides of the face.
Demand. Whereof are ^he chekes / the temples / and the Jaws compo^ Answer.
Of the musculous flesh with veins / ^teres / and bones. Demand. Howe muscles
^re there in the said parties / and fro whens come ^hey? Answer. First there
is.vij. muscles that move the lyppes / the chekes / which after Auycen comes
from the forcule of the lower parties. After Haly there is also.xij. that move
the nether Jaws / of the which some opens it that come fro the place of the
party of ye ears. And the other close it that descend from above in passing
under the bail of the bones of the temples / those are called tymporalles /
and are right noble and very sensyble / therefore their hurt is very peryllous /
by the reason whereof nature hath wrought wisely for to save the / hath ordained
ye bought of the temples bones / and the other muscles are made for to grynde
and chawe / and those proceed of the balle of the chekes. And to all these
muscles comes sinews fro the third pareyle of synewes of the brain.
Demand. Comes there any veins or arteres with ye said muscles? Answer.
Yea, chyefly about the temples, and the corners o^ the eyes / and the lyppes.
Demand. Howe many bones is there in the parties abouesayde? Answer. There is
many. For first there is.ix. bones of the chekes as Galyen saith / though
there appear but two that are joined under the nose. And than is there two
apparel that are called the bones of the temples / the which in making a party
of the orbytall / or emynent pomall that is round bright apples of the chekes
compassing ye chekes^ producynge an addycyon round about the addycyon of the
bone petrous, and makes the bought under the which be conserved and keep the
muscles of the temples. Than is there ye nether Jaw bones whereof Auycen saith
that ye nether Jaw is composed of two bones / which be narowe under the
chynne / there are knit by an only joint, and in the top of every of the other
extremytees / in cuttynge is a bowed sarrature which is composed with an
addycion very subtly made and bred there. The bones that come there are
fastened with strings. Demand. Of howe many parties is the mouth composed?
Answer. Of.v. partycles. The lyppes / the teeth / the tongue / the roof / and
^ncl^. Demand. Fro whens comes it that the ^the have feeling saying that bones
feel not? An^e. Albeit that the teeth be of bony substance, ^rthelesse a^ter
Galyen in the.xvj. book of the (...) of par^ ^ey feel by reason of certain
^wes desce^ (...) ^ro the third pareyle of the ^ewes of y^ bra^ ^at have there
their rotes. Demand. Howe many teeth ought every person to have? Answer.
Some have mo / and some (...). In some is soud.xxxij.xvj. in every Jaw. ^nd
in other is found but.xviij. That is to wit / (...) donales / two
quadruples.viij. molares / and (...) cassalles. And their roots are fixed
within ^he Jaws / of the which some hath but one / and (...) other two / and
some three / and other four.

^Demaunde. What is the tongue? Answer. It (...) a partycle / flesshely /
soft / and spongyous com^osed of many synewes / strings / veins / and ar^es
for the taste / pryncypally ordained to speak / and vtyle to govern ye meat in
the mouth. Demand. Whens comes the moeuynge to the tongue / and the virtue
of taste? Answer. It comes fro the veins tastynge and moeuynge that comes
fro the.iiij. and.v. pareyle of the synewes of the brain. Demand. Howe many
muscles comes to the tongue / and fro whens come they? Answer. There
comes.ix. that breed of the addycyon called sagitall of the bone named
Lapheoides. Demand. Whereof serves the glaudynous flesshes that are under ye
tongue? Answer. They be ordained for ye mortyfyeng of ye tongue, for in the
said flesshes is two oryfices whereby the spatele yssueth. And upon ye said
flesshes ye tongue is sytuate as upon a molle hill. Demand. Whereof serves

belly. Demand. Where is the wesaut set? Answer. Upon the two ways of the
parties of ye mouth. Demand, What is the wesaunt? Answer. It is a
cartylagynous grystled partycle created and formed for to be iustrument of ye
voice / and the key of Trachea arteria in the time of transgluttynge / by
mean of an addycion called lingue form / that is one of his parties,
Demand, Whereof is the wesaunt composed? Answer. Of the grystles, About the
said wesaunt is planted, ix, muscles mouynge all the hole of each party / in
mountynge and descending, making the other moeuementes / as Galyen clearly
shows in his book of the voice / of clear moeuementes. Demand, What veins
and arteres be they that passes by the parties of the neck / that are to be
noted at the Anathomy of the neck? Answer, They be the great veins arteres
that are led by the furculles in styenge upward ye sides of the neck to the
superyour parties / which be called Guy degi / and popleticis / deep suberall,
Thyneysyon of the which be very peryllous, The Cyrurgyen ought to be right
well ware, Demand, What is rydge? Answer, Spondyle is a bone (that
constytueth the back) bored in the midst / whereby the nuche passes / and
hath in the rybbes that the synewes do issue many addycyons moutynge and
descendynge outwardly making the chyne of the back, Demand, What is the
back? Answer, The back is like ye kele of a ship conteynyng fro the hyndre
part of the heed unto the neck composed of divers spondyles successyuely to
defend the nawpe, Demand, Howe many spondyles are there in al ye back.
Answer. There is in all and by all.xxx. The which to declare it is to be noted
that as Galyen saith in the.xij..xiij. book o^ the ^tylyte of the partycles y^
in the back is fo^e great parties / that is the neck / the shol^s / the
r^ynes / and the bone that some call (the holy bone) some the broad bone or
sholdre blade. And in the neck be.vij. spondyles. And in the shol^s or back
there is.xij.. In the raynes.iiij. then (...) and by all there be.xxiij. very
spondyles. And ^s^de these there be.iiij. in the holy bone / and.iij. (...) ^he
rump / which be not very spondyles, but sy ^tudynarres, as vycares. For the
three first (...) lunge and byg / and have none addycyons nor ^es in the rybbes
/ but before they be much gry^ied / specyally the last / and breed sklenderwyse
as (...). Thus the some in all and by all as well of (...) as not very there
be.xxx. spondyles. De^de. Howe many payres of synewes issue of (...) ^oddle /
and in sum of all ye brain? Answer. ^h^e bre^eth of ye noddle.xxx. payres of
synewes (...) there bredeth a pair of sinews on every spoon (...). And beside
all them there bredeth a synewe ^out fellow by the end of lostary. And thus on
(...) party of the noddle there bredeth.xxx. payres (...) synewes and one
alone. And on the fore party ^redeth.vij. pair of synewes / and thus in some
in all and by al bredeth of the brain.xxxviij. payres of synewes. Demand.
What be the loins / and whereof were they? Answer. The loins are musculous
flesshes lying in the sides of the spondyles of the back that serve as
hacoytes of the synewes. Demand. Whereof serves a thycke panycle as that
which is upon the skul and on the other bones that are on the spondyles?
Answer. They be to bind the spondyles together. Demand. Howe many manners of
flesh are food in ye body of mankynde? Answer. Three, the flesh of ye
loins proprely called cerniees, lyenge next to the spondyles as it is said.
And the musculous flesshes of which is made the tenants moeuyng the head and
the neck / which are.xx. in nombre as Galyen saith / and in the flesh that
fulfil the empty places. Demand. Howe many string{is} be there that holds
the heed with the neck and the sholders? Answer. There be divers, First the
fore part where as be two byg ones that descends fro under the ears unto
the furcule, And in the hinder {per}te there is yet other greater yt binds it
to the spondiles of the back the sides. There be other that descend to the
sholdres in such dysposycyon that the tenant muscles and the strings ben
about the neck that makes the head bow and ye neck, to lift up and turn
about, for without them it is not possible to make artyculacyon or moving,
Demand. What dyseases may the neck suffer? Answer. Divers, as well in it
self as in contained places, as woudes, dislocacyons out of joint and
appostumes / which in it be all peryllous, Demand. Howe ought incysyons be
made in the neck? Answer. All along / for so goes his parties.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the sholdres / the great hands,
IT is first to be noted that a sholdre / homoplate / the humere is all one,
Demand. Wherefore be ye hands made? Answer. To take and defend the organes
/ and for that cause man is garnished with hands in stead of weapons,
Demand. Whereof ben composed the sholdres and ye hands? Answer. They are made
of skin (...) flesh / of veins / of arteres / of synewes, of mus^es / of
cords / of strings / of panicles / of gristles, and bones, Demand. Whens
comes the mus^es and cords that move the arms / and howe are they sytuate?
Answer. They descend fro the (...) / and pass by the breast / and compryse
and be ^peth all the joint of the bone called vlna / or of (...) addycyon / are
planted therein, Demand. (...) whens comes the synewes that move the ^oldres
and the arms? Answer. Fro the noddle (...) pass thorough the neck, Demand.
From ^e^s comes their veins arteres? Answer. ^hey are sent fro the arm,
Demand. Howe ^any bones are in ye sholdre? Answer. Two, the ^one sholdre
blade / and the bone furculare, The bone spatulare yssueth fro the party of the
back / and is like a pal / for it is large and thynne fro the back part /
with an appearance holden by ye midst, A^d at the party of the joint it is
somewhat lunge and round in manner of a helue / with three addycyons in the end,
The first in the midst that receives the end of vlna in a socket, The
second in the height is crooked, and sharpe in manner of a ravens bill, And the
third is on the left side outward more crooked like an anchor. The bone
furculare comes from the party of the breast / and is round and styfe in the
holownes of the superyour party of the breast bone / hath two branches / one
goes to one sholdre / another to another sholdre / and binds closes these
two addycyons called Rostralles because the said middle socket hold ye end of
vlna more styfly in ye joint, Demand. Be the addicions abouesayd other bones
than the bone of ye sholdre? Answer. No, after Lanfranke and Henry / but are
substancyall party of it / as it appears by experience. And also Galyen in
the.xiij. book of the vtilite of partycles the second and twelfe chapytre /
where he says that the homoplate towcheth the extremytees of the sholdres,
and joins and covers together in manner of a covering / which is guard of all
their artyculacyon as touching the sholdre / ought to defend the upper end
of the arm that it go not out of his place. Demand. What collygauce hath the
bone furculare? Answer. It hath three great collygaunces that goes from the
end of the sholdre unto vlna / round about is boude and strained with great
tenants that breed of the great muscles that comes from the breast, of the
sholdre plant in ye bone that styreth it / of the which some do stretch
upward and the other downward, and ye other two converse all about it.
Demand. In what party of the sholdre is it where as is assigned the memory
of the heart? Answer. It is assigned in the party that is under the joint that
is under the arm pit that is filled with glaudynous flesh Demand. In how
many parties is the arm devised that is called ye great hand? Answer. After
Galyen in the second book of the vtylyte of partycles second chapytre it is
divided in three great parties. One is called vlna / the other little arm, and
the third the surall hand. Demand. In howe many and what particles is the
great hand composed? Answer. Of such partycles as the other / that is of
skin, of flesh, of arteres, and veins. Demand. Howe many and what veins
is found apperyng in the arm? Answer. Divers / the which^ after the
branches that they make / and the ^tending by ye arm are diversified, for
although ^hat they in making of branches they come vn^r the arm pyttes / yet
agaynwarde they ramy^ in to two parties. One part goes on the out (...) of
the arm / and the other on ye insyde. That (...) the outsyde yet branches
more / and makes ^ branch over the sholdre in to the head. And ^he other
descends and makes two brauches / of the which one is divided on the
outsyde of the arm in divers parts / and is called the corde of the arm /
b^t the other part descedeth to ye part of the arm / appears in the fold
of the elbow / and there is called Cephalyca / and fro that place descends in
to the hand / and appears between the thombe and the fore finger / and there
it is called cephalica occularis. And that party that was divided under the
arm pytt{is} that goes in to the inward party in descending appears within
the bought of the elbow / and is called Basylyc. And fro that place descedeth
in to the hand and appears between the middle finger and his neighbor / and
high Saluatell. And of these two said veins that are in the bought of ye elbow
is made a branch that appears in the midst of those ij. is called Mediana.
And divers other veins are food in the arm / that for their smalnes the
Cyrurgyen hath little a do with them. Demand. Howe many notable synewes come in
to ye arm / and whereby, and whereof breed they? Answer. By the spondyles of ye
neck descedeth in to each arm four notable synewes that breed of the noddle
/ one above, and another beneth, one behind, and another before.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the great hand.
Demand, Howe many bones are in ye first part of the great hand that is
named vlna or adiutor / howe it is figured? Answer, There is but one alone
full of maroughe / and is round of figure at both ends, for at the upper end
it is round as one only entering in to the socket or pyt of ye sholdre / at
the nether end the roudnes is double in the midst in form of a poully. And
in the inward part is a little appearance / and in the outward part
backward is a concauyte wherein is received the end of the addicyon like a
beke of a raven, in to ye byggest socket, what time that the arm is raised /
in such manner that the said roundelles entre in to the holownesse of the
sockett{is}, And when the arm is stretched bowed it comes and makes the
joint of the elbow,

Demand. Howe many bones is in the little (...) / and howe be they figured?
Answer. There ^e two and hight focylles / that is to wit the byg^st that is in
the arm / and is greater and lon^er than the other for the addycyon that it
hath / that resembles a beke / and it goes toward the (...) finger, In
making outward an enbossed ^peraunce in manner of a wedge, The lesser goth
^warde / and goes fro the bought of the elbow (...) the hand toward the
thombe / like as it (...) ^oyne to it, And in both the ends of ye same ^yttes
receyuynge the roundnesses, Toward ^owe ben received ye roundnesses graduales
(...) adiutory with the addycyon that is like a (...) of the said elbow, And
toward the hand (...) roundnesses of the bones of the hand / they (...) both
bigger toward the ends because of the ^oynture / and sklender toward the
midst / and longer ye synewes and the muscles, Demand. Howe many conjunction
of bone be in the hand / and howe many bones in every conjunction / and howe
they are figured formed? Answer. There be three coniunctions of bone in the
hand. In the first conjunction be three / and in the second conjunction
four. And of this nombre Auycen gives his reason / because yt the first
conjunction touches the focyll bones / as holding all to one bone / and
therefore there may not so many hold. In the second conjunction there be
four, because there might be no mo for the space of three in the first
conjunction toward the focyll bones. And the bones of these two coniunctions
be short, and these two coniunctions of bones be called the recepte of the
hand. In the third conjunction be four bones longer than the other. And that
conjunction is called the breast of the hand or pecten. Howbeit Auycen puts
to these three coniuction of bones one bone mo / which is added to the two
first coniunctions of the recept / and was create for to defend the synew of
the breast of the hand. And this dyuysion of bones may be seen in the figure
that was figured before. Demand. Howe many fyngers is there in the hand, and
howe many bones in every finger? Answer. There be.v. fyngers / in every finger
three bones. And thus in all the fyngers is but.xv. bones. By the which things
aforesaid it may be known that in all the great is but.xxix. bones. That
is.xv. in ye fyngers.xj. in the little hand.ij. in the arm / and one in the
adiutor. Demand. Which bones out of joint of the abouesayd mebres ben most
easyest to set in again / which be most dyffycyle? Answer. The most
difficyle is the joint of ye elbow / and the easyest is the sholdre joint /
the mean is that of the hand.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the breast.
Demand. What is the breast? Answer, It is the arc of the spyrytual members.
Demand. Of howe many parts is the Thorax and breast composed? Answer. Of two,
for some be contained / and the other containing. Demand. Howe many parts of
conteynynges, and of contained ben there in the breast / what be they? Answer.
First there be four conteynyng{is} / the skyn, the flesh musculous, the
paps, and the bones. And in the parties contained there be.viij. That are the
heart, the lunges, the panycles, the string{is}, the veins, the arteres, the
Merry of Ysophagus. Demand. Whereof be the paps composed / and with what
members have they collygaunce? Answer. They be composed of white glaudenous
^esshe, and with veins, arteres, synewes. Ther^re have they collygaunce with the
heart, the liver, ^nd the brain, and with the genytall mebres.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the muscles of the breast.
Demand. Howe many muscles be there in the breast? Answer, After Auycen there
be. lxxxx. of which some are comune at ye neck / other at the sholdres / other
at the mydryfe / other at the rybbes / other at the back / proprely other are
at the breast. Demand, In howe many and what manners ben the bones of the breast
divided? Answer. In three manners / some be in the fore part / other in the
hyndre part, the other at the sides. Demand. Howe many bones be in the fore
part of the breast? Answer. Seven, after as there be.vij. rybbes that join to
them / of which that upward is nyghe the throat, that is received in the foot
of the bone of the furcule aforesaid / that below in the furcule is an
addycyon cartylagynous called Ency form. Demand, Howe many bones are in the
party behind the breast. Answer.xj. that are spondyles whereby the nuche
passes / whereof bredeth.xij. payres of synewes, bringing feeling and moeuynge
to the muscles aforesaid. Demand. Howe many bones be on each side of the
breast? Answer. There be.xij. that have.xij. rybbes coniuct to ye.xij.
spondyles above said. Of the which.xij. rybbes there be.vij. very, and.v.
false or lyengly, for they be not complete as the other be aforesaid.

Questyons upon the parties contained within the breast.
Demand. Howe is the heart situate within the breast? Answer. Because that
the heart is the beginning of life / and is within the body as king and lord
of all the other mebres / of whom all the other members do take influence. And
for that cause it is set in the midst of the breast / not declynynge to one
part more than to another, as Galyen saith in his.vj. book of the vtylyte of
partycles. And this is certainly understand, for from the nether part it is
inclined a little toward the left side / to give place to the liver that is on
the right side above the heart. And as to the upper part it declyneth somewhat
toward ye right side for to give rowme to the arteres. Demand. Of what shape
is the heart? Answer. It is of the likeness of a pine apple / for the narowe
part is towards the nether parties of the body. And the larger part where as
the roots are holds to the upward parts. Demand. Of what substance is
the heart? Answer. It is of a harde substance / and lacertous. Demand. Howe
many celles is there in the heart? Answer. Three, that is the right and the left
between the said bentrycles is a pyt wherein the nourysshynge blode coming fro
the liver is dygered and made spyrytuall / that is sent by the arteres to all
the body / and chyefly to all the pryncypall members / as to the brain / where
by dygestyon is take another ^ature, is made anymall. And in the liver where in
it is made natural. And to the ballocke where it is made genytall / and to all
the other members cause life. And by the right ventrycle / the branch of the
vein mountynge that bears the blode fro the liver upward and yssueth of it
self, of the which vein the one part called vein arteryall goth to
nourysshe the lunges. And ye rest in mountynge makes sondry branches unto the
hinder parties / as is abouesayd. And fro the left ventrycle of the heart
yssueth ye vein called pulsatyle / fro the which one part goth to the lunges
that there is called Arterea venalis that bears ye capenous vapours fro the
lunges and introduceth the air for to cool the heart. And the other part
makes brauches upward and downward / as is abouesayd of the other veins.
And over the three oryfyces of the said three ventrycles there be three pellycles
that open and close the entering of the blode and of ye spyryte in convenable
time. Demand. Howe many ears hath the heart, and howe are they set / and
wherefore serve they? Answer. The heart hath two ears, on each side one set
upon the said laterall ventrycles yt serve for to let the air in and out that
is appareylled for it fro ye lunges. Demand. Whereof serves a cartilaginous
bone that is in ye heart? Answer. It is to stay and strength it. Demand.
Whereof is the substance of the covering of the heart? Answer. It is called
precordi^m, is of a skynny substance / where descends synewes as unto other
inward intraylles. Demand. With what membre hath the heart collygaunce?
Answer. With all mebres and specyally with the lunges, wherewith it is bound.
And with the mediastinu wherewith it is steyed and strengthed. Demand. May the
heart sustain disease lunge? Answer. No, for his great dygnyte.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the lunges.
Demand. Of what substance is ye lunges^ Answer. Of a soft substance,
clear, spongeous, and white. Demand. Howe many manner of vessels be conjoined
by the substance of the lunges? Answer. Three, that is the branch of the
vain arteryall that bredeth (as it is said) of the right ventrycle of the
heart. And the branch of the vain pulsatyle that comes fro the left side.
And the branches of Trachea arteria that bears the air to the heart.
Demand. Howe ben these three manners of vessels set within the lunges?
Answer. They be divided over all ye substance by small ones and less, unto a
very small quantite. Demand. Howe many lobbes hath the lunges? Answer.v.
Three in the right party / and two in the left. Demand. Howe many pa^tycles
be there in ye breast? Answer. Three. The first covers inward all the
ribs, and that is called pleura. The second hight Mediastu^um / ^nd that
deuydeth all the breast in the right party and left. And the third is called
the mydryfe that ^nydeth all the spyritual mebres from the nutry ^yfes / and is
composed of pleura, of the cyphac, and of the panycle that hight Cordorus /
that is of synewes sent to it from the spondyles, and the flesshely parties
chyefly next the rybbes, that proprely is a muscle, the operation whereof
serves to put out superfluytees, as Galyen saith.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the belly / and parties thereof.
IT is to be noted upon these things that follow, that the belly may be taken
for two things. First for the stomach. Secondly for the regyon of all
nutrytyfe members / and so it is taken here. Demand. What is the hole
posycyon of the belly? Answer. It is vndre the region of the spyrytuall members
/ so that the superyour part that is at ye entering called pcordyal / toward
ye forcule, the party that is called stomacle, a three fyngers nygh the nauyl
downward / and the party vmbelycall synual is fro ye nauyll downward / and
the ypocondres be in the side under ye rybbes. And the parties called yliac are
over the hauches. Demand, To se the Anathomy very well in the parties of the
belly, as well the conteynynges as the continued / howe ought the Cyrurgyen to
open it? Answer. He ought to open it along and overthwart / this way and that
/ that he may the lyghtlyer se the parties before (that be the Myrac and Cyphac)
as behind / where as are the.v. spondyles of the kydnees, and the flesh over
them.

Demand. Of howe many and what howe many parts is the myrac composed.
Answer. It is composed of.iiij. parts. Of the skin, of the grease, of the
flesshy panycle, and of the muscles, of whom yssueth the cords. Demand. What
is Cyphac? Answer. It is a panycle only that is added to the Myrac. Demand.
Howe many and what be the parties contained in the belly? Answer.vij. First
the ars gut, secondly the guts, thyrdly the stomach, than ye liver, than the
mylt, and the kydnees. Demand. Wherefore are the muscles of the belly formed?
Answer. For two reasons. The first is to strength it. The second to expel
the superfluytees of the members. Demand. Howe many muscles be in the belly?
Answer. After Galyen in the.iiij. book of the vtylyte of partycles / and in
the.vij. of his Terapentycke ^here be, viij, That are two all along coming fro
the boucler of the stomach unto the share bone / and two overthwart the back,
and entrelace by the midst of the belie, And, iiij, from the angles
transuersalles / of the which two breed in the rybbes of the right side, and go
to the left side, and of the hakle bones, and of the share / the other two of
the left side, go to the right side of the said ^ones / in crossynge by the
middle of the belly.

Demand. What is ^he perytoneon / and wher^f is it dyryuate? of what
substance is it / wher^re serves it? Answer. It is sytuate under the ^ayde
muscles, and it so named of Pery / that is to ^y round about, and of Tonnes /
that is to say ^ntestynon / for it goes round about the nutry^yfe parties /
is a little panycle, synewy, subtle, and harde / and serves to keep that the
muscles compryse not the natural members / and it may be enlarged, and
comprymate in manner of other members / and that it be not lightly broken / and
that the things contained in it issue not / as it happens to them yt are
grieved therewith / and it is proprely called Cyphac. Demand. What woudes of
t^e belly are most peryllous and most dyfficyle to heal, either they of the
midst of the belly / or they in the sides? Answer. They in the midst of the
belly / because the parties there ben more treatable / the bowels there come
sooner out, than by other places, Demand. What is Epypleon / and whereof is it
composed? Answer. It is a pannycle that covers and wraps the stomach
about / and is named of epi / that is to say over all or about, or pleon,
that is to appear, for it pereth over all the stomach / and is composed of two
tunycles, the one thycke, and the other thynne, laid one on another, of divers
arteres, veins, and synewes, and great quantyte of fat / and is called ars
gut. Demand. Whereof bredeth the pypleon / wherefore serves it? Answer, It
bredeth of the parties that be under ye back / and of the Cyphac, it is
ordained for to rechaufe the parties next thereto, as Galyen says in the
fourth book of the vtylyte of partycles, xiij, chapytre. Demand. May the
pypleon hold lunge when it is hurt without great alteracyon / and howe ought
it to be dressed? Answer, No, but it is lightly altered changed for the
fatness, and ought to be boude and not cut for fear of flux of blode,
Demand. Of howe many skynnes or tunycles are the bowels composed / and
wherefore serve they? Answer They be composed of two tunycles / and serve
first to make dygestyon / and to bring the Chilus to the liver by means of
the veins mescraykes / to put out the fylthy superfluytees. Demand. How many
gut{is} be there. Answer. Six / although that they be joined together / yet
have they divers offyces / divers shapes / whereby they are divided. Of the
which six guts three be sklendre three byg. The first of the three sklendre
is named Portanarium / or Duodenum. The second is called Ieiunium. And the
third is called Subtle. Of the three byg / the first hight Esac / the second
Colon / the third is the ars gut called Longaon, or ye straight gut. Demand.
Be the said guts garnished with muscles? Answer. Yes / for the gouernynge
of the superfluytees that they receive put out. Demand, What is the manner to
make incysion for to know, dyscerne, and se well every gut by the Anathomy?
Answer. First it behooves to begin ^t the ars gut / that is called longaum or
rectum / and because that ye fylthy matter shall not let the / ^ynde it at the
upper end, and let it be two ends, and be cut in the midst of the lygature /
and let the nether part be left / proceed in dyscaruynge almost unto yleon /
where as the gut begins that hight Collon, which is byg with little celles /
wherein the fecall matter takes form / and is two fathom lunge, or there about
/ declyneth much toward the left kydney / in mountyng toward the mylt /
reuolueth of ye party coming toward the right side of the stomach, under the
panycle of the liver, where receives a porcyon of the humour coloryke / which
moves it to put out the superfluytees, and in the rancluyng it descends to
the right kydney at the hyndre end of the hauche there as begins the gut
called one eye, or the bag / for it seems yt it hath but one eye / although it
have two after ye very truth. One whereat the fylthy matter / and another that
it goes out / but because that they be very ne'er it seems yt it hath but one
/ and this gut is very short / for it is but of a handful lunge. And because
of the nyghnesse of the haunches / and because it is not well boude it
descends sooner in to ye ballocke coddes, when a man is grieved or broken than
any other gut / and of this gut is bred y^ sklendre gut that hight Ylion /
the which Ylion is well.vij. or.viij fadoms lunge / it hath many reuolucyons in
all ye back. After this is the gut that hight Ieiuniu, because it is always
empty for the great multitude of messerayke veins that be about it
continually suckynge it / for the colour that is scene between it and
Portanarium that incyteth it continually to expel that that is in it. And to
this gut is contained the gut called Duodeum / which is so called because it
is.xij. fyngers of length / after the which follows ye gut called
Portanariu, so called by his offyce, for it is the nether gate of the stomach,
as Merry is the upper gate. Demand. Wherefore is it yt the wounds made in the
small guts never heal, yet those of the great guts heal sometime? Answer,
Because that the small guts be full of panycles / the great guts are full of
flesh. Demand. Howe may the Mezentereon be known by Anathomy? Answer. To
se the Mezentereon very well thou ought to bind the guts toward the gut
Portanariu and cut in manner as the longaon is / and than put all the guts
out. Demand, Whereof is Mezentereon composed, and howe is it set? Answer.
First it is composed of veins messeraykes innumerable branched fro the vein
of the liver called Portanaria / and is covered garnysht before with panycles
and strings yt conjoin the bowels with the back / and with glandynous
grease / and is commonly called seam / which when it is out ye may clearly se
the Anathomy of the stomach. Demand. What is the stomach. Answer. It is the
organ of the first digestion engenders the chyl^s. Demand. What is the
place of the stomach within the body? Answer. After Galyen in the.iiij. book
of the vtylyte of partycles and first chapytre. The place of the stomach is
in the midst of the body / because it is the common almoner alms dealer and
preparer to all the members of the body / natwithstandynge that the superyour
party thereof somewhat enclyneth unto the left side toward the.xij. spondyles
where as the dyafragma ends / and the lower part declyneth to the right.
Demand. What mebres have be made for to serve the stomach? Answer. The
first is the mouth / for in likewise as the veins Mezeryalles be
preparatyues of the second dygestyon that is done in the liver / likewise is
the mouth of the stomach. For as Auycen saith / ye chawyng acquyreth some
digestion. Afterward serves the Merry and ysophagus of the upward parties in
bringing the meat in to the stomach. And of the nether parties serves ye
guts, the veins Mezeraycalles to put forth the noyfull things / and
dystrybute the profytable things dygested and chylozed in it. Demand. Whereof
serves the stomach? Answer. Proprely it serves to digest by his heate of
his own carnosyte in the botome thereof, as Auycen says, and by the heates
gotten of the next parties / for it hath the liver on the right side that
warms / and the mylt on the left side that trauerseth it with his grease ways
/ whereby it sends the humour melencolyke to the stomach for to provoke it
appetite. And above i^ is the heart with the arteres that causes life / and the
brain that sends it a branch of synewes from the upward parties gyuynge
to it feeling. Also from the party of the back / and the veins called
kyllis, and adorthy, and divers other strings descendynge fro it / whereby it
is bound with the spondyles of the reins. Demand. With howe many skynnes is
the stomach covered? Answer. With two, one is flesshy that is outward, and
the other is synewy that is inward. Demand. Of what villes is the stomach
composed. Answer, Of longytudynalles to draw in transuersalles to reteyne /
latitudinalles to put forth. Demand. Of what shape is the stomach? Answer.
It is round endlong in manner of concorde such wise curbed that his entrynges
be higher than his body / because ye issue of the things that it conteyneth be
made inducly. Demand. Of what quantyte is the stomach? Answer. It is
manifest / for commonly it holds.ij. or.iij. pyntes. Demand. What is the
liver? Answer. It is the organ of the second digestion / engendrynge blode.
Demand. Howe or where is the liver set in the body of mankynde? and of what
figure is it? Answer. First it is set vndre the bought of the rybbes / is of
figure as of the moon / curbed toward the rybbes / and is holowe toward the
stomach with.v. laps or panulles in manner of hands comprysynge the
stomach. Demand. whens comes the feeling to the liver? Answer. It comes by
a panycle that covers it / to which comes a synewe for his feeling.
Demand. With what members hath the liver collygauce? Answer, First with the
dyafragma by his panycle yt covers it which binds it to ye diafragma with
strong strings. And also it hath colligauce with the back, with the stomach,
with ye guts, with the heart, and all the other mebres. Demand. Of what
substance is ye liver. Answer. It is the substance of flesh / and red as
quayl^ed blode, entrelaced all about with veins and arteres. Demand. Whereof
serves a great vein that comes out of the holownes of the liver called
Portanaria? Answer. It is because that all the succosyte that chyllus draws
by his brauches it transmytteth and dystrybuteth by all the liver / for that
vein is divided Mezeraycalles innumerable that are planted in the stomach and
in the bowels for to draw bear away the said succosite fro the liver.
Demand. Of what party of the liver yssueth a great vein and hollow called
killis / and whereof serves it? Answer, It yssueth out of the boss of the
liver / and serves to dystrybute all the blode that is engendered within the
liver over all the body / for that vein yssueth out of the liver, and makes
branches upward downward through all the body / whereby it deals the said
blode to every membre to fed it. Demand. What are the medycynes yt ought to
be applied on ye liver? Answer. That for the substance seldom dyssoluable
lightly it ought to have medicine somewhat styptyke. Demand. What is ye gall?
Answer. It is a bag or bladder panyculous set in the holownes of the liver
about the mean panulle for to receive the coleryke superfluyte. Demand.
Howe is testis fellis composed? Answer. It hath two entrynges or necks
between which is a dystauce, whereof one is on the right side that adresseth
toward the midst of the liver to receive the colere. The other is at the
botome of the stomach / in the bowels to send them colere for the vtylytees
aforesaid. Demand. Of what quantyte is the gall? Answer. It conteyneth
peradventure a glass full / or the mountenaunce of a fyoyle. Demand. What
dyseases suffers it commonly? and howe be they known? Answer. It suffers
opylacyons as well in the neck propre, as in the neck comune. And the disease
known when the stoppynge is in the neck comune / because that the colere may
not issue out of ye liver / nor the blode may not cleanse but abides with the
blode and makes the vryne yelow, all the body. And it is known when it is in
the neck propre because that the helpynges do fail, that it was wont to have
/ even accydent follows as Ga^en saith in the.vij. book of the disease the
accydent, and in the.v. of the interiors. Demand. What is the mylte? Answer.
It is the receiver of melancolyke superfluite engendered in ye liver. Demand.
What is the situation of the mylt in the body of mankynde? Answer. It is of
the left side embracing trauersly the stomach. Demand. Of what substance is
the mylt? Answer. It is of soft substance spongyous, blacker then the liver.
Demand. Of what shape is ye mylt? Answer. Of a lunge figure in manner of four
corners. Demand. With what members hath the mylt collygaunce? Answer. It is
bound by his panycle with the rybbes / and of his boss and concauyte it hath
collygacyon with the stomach, and with the ars gut. Demand. Wherein serves
the mylt in the body of mankynde? Answer. It serves by these two ways / for
by one way it draws the superfluyte melancolyke of the liver. And by the
other way it sends it to the oryfyce of the stomach, for the causes
abouesayde. Demand. What manner disease doth ye mylt suffer? Answer, It doth
suffer opylacyons because that his ma^er is gross / whereby the said
opylacyons follow other inconuenyentes / for when it fails to cleanse the
liver of the said superfluytees the body is faint and ill coloured. And when it
fails to transuyt the stomach / not sendynge yt it ought to do / the
appetite wastes or is taken away.

Demand. What solucyons of contynuyte be most peryllous in them of ye liver,
or them of the mylt / and which of both suffers strongest medycynes? Answer.
The solucyons of contynuyte be more dangerous in the liver than in the mylt?
and the mylt suffers stronger medycyns then the liver / purges chyefly by the
belly. Demand, What things are the kydnees / howe many are in the body of man
/ and of what substance are they? Answer. They are partycles ordained to
cleanse the blode of heinous superfluytees / and there be two of them on every
side one, and are of the substance of harde flesh. Demand. Of what shape
are they? Answer. They are long of shape as an egg comprymate / and have in
them concauytees / wheri^ ^hey receive that which is drawn by them / and each
of them have.ij. holes whereby they draw the aquosyte of the vein called
kyllis / and by the other send the said aquosite called pysse to the bladder.
Demand. What members comes to the kydnees / and with what members have they
collygauce? Answer. There comes to them veins, arteres, synewes, whereof
their panycle is made / and their fat is like talowe / have collygaunce with
the back. Demand, Whereon are the kydnees sytuate? Answer. They are situate
upon the tumbes, whereon they be as on a coytte. Demand. What veins pass
between the kydnees over the spondyles. Answer. There pass the vein adorty /
descendynge to the nether members / from the which very ^ere it yssueth the
members sparmatykes. Demand. What dyseases may the kydnees suffer? Answer.
They do suffer many dyseases / and specyally they suffer opylacyons and stones
that are harde to heal.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the haunches bones.
Demand. How many bones are in ye huckles? Answer. After the veryte there is
but one / howbeit after divers parties of it there are three. The first is
called the halowed sacred / or yt there be three or four spondyles on the party
of ye back / and on that side it is very byg / and toward the lower end / yt
is to say th^ foundement it comes in lessenynge / and there is i^
^artilaginous / this bone hath a hole before whereby passes ye synewes and not
by the side as do other spondyles of the back. The two other be two great
bones / one on each side that be coniuncte with this great spondyle of the holowe
bone behind and before in making the pectynall bone, these two bones are
large on the yliake parties / on the party of the share they be narowe in manner
of brauche / and joins to ye share before / and therefore are they called the
share bones. And in the midst of these bones of the back party there be two
concauytees called exides or boxes / wherein are received the ends o^ the bones
of the thyghes, called vertebres, there are called the thygh bones. And all the
said bones thereby nyghe the parties of ye foundement echone hath a great hole
whereby descedeth synewes, m^scles, veins, and arteres, that be brought from
above downward. Demand. What is the bladder / of what substance / and of
what shape / of what quantyte / howe it is sytuate? Answer. It is a receiver
of aygnous superfluytees of the kydnees / and it is panyculous and strong /
for it is composed of panycles / and is round of shape / the bygnes for to
hold a pynte, is sytuate under the share. Demand. Whereby receives the
bladder the superfluite vrynal of the kydnees, and whereby is it put out?
Answer. First it receives the superfluyte vrynall by two lunge ways that
descend fro the kydnees that entre by the sides of the bladder dyagnonelly by
two angles / yt which ways are called the pores vritides, and by a carnous
neck / with muscles closing and opening in bowing and ouerpassynge to the
yerde in men. And in women without reflyxyon unto two fyngers within the neck
of the matryce / whereby she puts forth that vrynall aquosite. Demand. To
what diseases is ye bladder disposed? Answer. It is disposed to opylacyons /
as well by stones as by graueylous vryne / yt it receives of ye kydnees.
Demand. Howe are medycynes applied to the bladder? Answer. By cyrurgery.
Demand. Where ought incysyon to be made for the stone in the bladder?
Answer. At the neck without the ^eame perignous. Demand. What are ye
sparmatyke vessels? Answer. They are certain veins that breed ne'er the
kydnees / and nygh the vein kyllis and adorthi berynge the blode to the
genytal mebres, as well in man as woman wherein by the last generation it is made
sparme or sede of mankynde nature. Demand. Howe many manners of sparmatyke
vessels be there? Answer. Two / for some brings the matter sparmatyke ^n /
and some puts it out. They that bring it ^e branches of veins and arteres
that breed of ^he vein kyllis and adorthi. And they that put it out be they yt
mount ne'er to the neck of the bladder / and puts the sparme out of the
hole of the yerde, and with them is the synew suspensory and sensyfe that
descends to the genytalles. Demand. Howe be the vessels sparmatyke situate?
Answer. They are set thus for toward ye grynde about the Myrac and Cyphac is
a hole whereby descends from above the three bodies aforesaid, that is the
vein and artere that brings / the synewe sensytyfe that is harde to the
neck of the bladder at the rote of the yerde, and the hole of the yerde /
whereby mounts the matter sparmatyke for to go out. And thus may be seen that
if ye hole toward grynde be out of measure large / the bodies superyours as
the zyrbus, or guts may descend in the loceon, and swell the purse of the
ballockes as if one were broken, and often makes brustenesse where as may
descend moyste matter that will make a hermen.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the pyntyll.
Demand. What is the yerde / and whereof is it composed? Answer. It is the
yerde vyryll / that is the cultyner and labourer of the field of mankynde / and
is the way of the vryne / and is composed of skin, of muscles, of string{is},
of veins, and arteres, of synewes, and of right great bands. Demand, Where
is the dysposicion of the yerde. Answer. It is planted upon ye back of the
share. Demand. Fro whens are sent the skyne, the string{is}, the veins,
arteres, flesh, and the synewes? Answer. First the strings are sent fro
the bone satron / and the parties next it. The veins, the arteres, the
flesh, the synewes, the skin are sent to it from the superyour parties.
Demand. Howe many pryncypal ways hath the yerde? and what dyuersyte of names
takes it in sondry parties thereof? Answer, It hath two ways / that is of the
sperm, of the vryne / and the end of the yerde hight balanum. The bowel
hight mitra / and the head hight prepuce. Demand. Of what quantite ought ye
yerde of man to be? Answer. Commonly of.viij. or.ix. inches / how be it to be
plyfyke with any woman it ought to be proporcyoned at the neck of her matryce.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the losseum.
Demand. Whereof bredeth the losseum / and whereof takes it name. Answer. It
bredeth (...) Syphac Myrac / their parties passing and hanging outward of it
upon ye back of ye share at the begynynge of it. It is called the Dymdyme and
there it doubles / and fro the lower party it is called Loceum / and is the
coddes of the geny^alles. Demand. What are the ballockes? Answer. They are
the pryncypall organs of the generation of mankynde / for in them the matter
spermatyke is made parfyte sure. Demand. Fro whens comes the sperm to the
ballockes? Answer. From all the body / and specyally fro the pryncypall
members for the bredynge of their vesse^les, as of the heart, the liver, and
the kydneys. And for the cause of delectacyon the brain hath comutacyon
therein, for the synewes that descend fro the brain to the ballockes. Thus of
all the body it takes nature / not by quantyte but by vygour. Demand. What is
the matryce / and in what place is it set? Answer. The matryce is the field of
generation of mankynde, organ susceptyfe of gendrynge matter / and is set
between the bladder and the longaon. Demand. Of what substance is the
matryce? Answer. Of a panyculous substance. Demand. Of howe many skynnes or
tunicles is the matryce composed? Answer. It is composed of two skynnes / of
which the inward is full of sharpe veins / with ye ends of which veins be
contained with the pannycles Lembryon / and are divided in two parties
pryncypalles after ye nombre of the dugs / though there appear but these two
chaumbres in the matryce / yet after Mundyne there are.vij. small chaubres in
the matryce, three in each of the two chaubres / and one in the midst / and the
outward tunycle neruous. Not as Auycen says that it is create of synewes
coming fro the brain / but as in substance is conseblable neruous, for it is
white, and pryuate of menstruall blode, is stretchynge as the synewes / for it
streyneth and loses as needs requires. It comes but very little of synewes
whereby it feleth / this outward tunycle is all plain, and is not divided.
Demand. Of what shape is the matryce? Answer. It is the shape of the
instrument of generation of men / for it is proporcionly made to the yerde and
coddes of manes genytours, except that it is reversed, and is holowe within
for to receive man yerde in the time of copylacyon / for the neck of the
matryce is like a manes yerde / and the matryce with in is like coddes or purce
of ye genytalles of men. And as men have two ballockes or stones yt pass and
appear outward / so have women inward / except that they be bigger in the man
than in the woman. And in men they are longwyse round / and in women they be
round and flat, and are set on both the sides of ye matryce each on a side.
And even so as the vessels spermatykes ben in ye midst of the ballockes
outward / so be they inward in women. Demand. With what members hath the
matryce collygaunce? Answer. Their collygauce pryncypally is with breasts by
the veins of milk, menstrualles, for the which things nouryces have not well
their menstruous flowers. Demand. Of what quantite is the matryce / and the
neck of it? Answer. The matryce comes almost fro the nauyll unto ye utter
part of the cont, in comprysynge the neck and all the body of the matryce.
Howbeit the neck of the matryce ought for to be naturally of.x. or.xj. fyngers
breed / after as the woman hath to meddle with man flesshely little or much /
it waxes lunge or shorteneth. And also it waxes lunge or short after as the
man that medleth with her hath his yerde short or lunge.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the ars gut / which was left before the better
to se the Anathomy of the other nutratyfe members.
Demand, What is the Longaon / of what length is it / and where is it set?
Answer. It is the ars gut that is a palm or handefull lunge almost to the
kydneys / and is set right over the foundement on the back and tail. Demand.
Howe many muscles be in the ars gut / and where to serve they it? Answer. There
be two that open and close it when it needs. Demand. Howe many veins comes
to the gut nygh to the foundement? Answer. Five branches of veins named
Emorroides or Emorroidalles. Demand. With what members hath the ars gut
collygaunce? Answer. With the bladder, and therefore when one of them suffers
so doth ye other. Demand. What is the pigneum? Answer. Pigneum in Arabyke is
to say the ars hole. And it is the place between the ars the yerde / which is
a seam that follows the coddes / and the stock of the yerde. Demand. What
are the gryndes? Answer. They are the clensynge places of the liver / are of
Glaudynous flesh ordained to the bought of the thyghes. Demand. What are
the buttocks? Answer. They are gross musculous flesh ordained over ye
bones of the thyghes, and hukcles wherfro descends muscles, cords, and
strings, moving the thyghes, and the great leg with the hukcles.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the great foot.
Demand. Where begins the great foot / and howe f^rre it lasts / and in
howe many parts the great foot is divided? Answer. The great foot lasts fro
the joint of the hukcle called (...), unto the ferdest part of the toes / and
is divided as the great hand in three parties. The first is called the thyghe
/ the other the leg / and the last the little foot. Demand. Whereof is the
great foot composed? Answer. At ye great hand, with ^ynne, flesh, veins,
arteres, muscles, stryn^es, grys^les, and bones.

Questyons upon the veins of the great foot.
Demand. Fro whens comes the veins to the great foot / howe do they dyuyde
them (...) the great foot? Answer. After that the veins (...) making
branches, at their beginning ben ^scended to the last spondyle there are
dyuyded (...) two parties / one on the right / another on the ^ft / each of
them likewise are divided in two brau^h^s / fro thens one goes to the outward
part / and the other to the inward in making branches descendynge by the
legs to the ankles and fete. Demand. Howe many and what veins ben let
blode commonly in the great foot? Answer. There be.iiij. the sopheynes that are
upon the ankle inward toward the heal / and the scyatyke under the ankle
outward / and the popletyke that is under the kne / and the arenal that is
between the little too and his next fellow. Demand. Whereof bredeth the
synewes that comes to the great leg / and where pass they? Answer. They
breed of the last spondyles of the kydneys / of the holy bone, and the most
part of them pas by the hole of the thyghe bone / and make muscles in the
bought of the ^ne / so that they descendynge from the hukcles cleue to the bone
of the thyghe with the cords mouynge the joint makes the great brawn that
are on the thygh that styreth the kne and the leg, and the calfe over the leg
moving the foot and ankle / the muscles of the fete mouynge the toes / after
the form and manner as is before said of the hand. Demand, Howe goes the
lunge and byg strings / where end they, wher^ appear they most? Answer.
They descend by all the leg / and appear greatly in the greyndes under the
knees, and under the heal, and on the joints of the toes, and the sole of the
foot is all full / and there they end.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the great foot.
Demand. Howe many bones are in ye thygh and of what shape be they? Answer.
There is but one bone / and that is full of maroughe, and is round in one party
/ and the roundness thereof upward hight Uertebrum yt declyneth inward, and
is received in the pyt of the hukcle bone / and is somewhat bossed outward /
but in ye inward party toward the kne are two roundnesses which ben received
wrapped in two concauytees that are in the focylle of the leg. And over it one
round bone above that is called the knop of the kne.

Demand. Howe many bones are in the kne / and howe be they named? Answer.
There be two that be called ye morteys bones / whereof ye greatest is on the
insyde part / whereof is made the sharpenynge and conioynynge of the leg / and
goes fro the kne unto the foot making the ankle inward. The lesser pyt bone
is in the utter part / descending under the kne a little / and is smooth unto
the foot ioynynge there with the other pyt bone ma^ynge the outward ankle.
Demand. Of what shape are yt two focyl bones? Answer, The grea^est hath two
pyttes toward the kne which re^eyue the roude ends of the thyghe bone / for
the ^sser comes not unto the joint / but is smothe as (...) is said / and
lies nygh under the kne / and ther^ore it is called arcus. And toward the
foot in the ^ynynge with the bigger bone both they make (...) holowe pyt or
morteys wherein the first bone of the foot is received. Demand. Howe many
coniunctions or assemblyng of bones are in the little foot / and howe many
bones are in every conjunction? Answer. There be three. In the first
conjunction be three bones assembled in one roudnesse. The first hight Caab in
Arabyc, in Greek Astra gallus, is in manner as yt nut of a crosbow round on
each side. In the upper roudnes thereof is affyrmed the holownesse of the pyt or
morteys bones, and there the foot is moved, and the nether roundness is affyrmed
to the concauyte of the manyculare bone / and after that forthwith toward the
bone called Nanyculer / that is a synew concaued on each side. In the first
concave is received the roundness of Cohas aforesaid. In the second concave is
received ye second coniuction of the bones of the fete / and under them is the
bone of the heal, of the which all the foot is stedyed / and yssueth toward
the hyndre part for ye strings that are fixed in it. Demand. Howe many
bones is there in the second conjunction / howe are they figured? Answer.
There be four that be short enough / one of them is called grandmos^n / that
is on the utter part toward the little too. And these bones be round toward
the nanyculare / holowe toward the third conjunction. Demand. Howe many
bones are in the third conjunction of the little foot? Answer. Five lunge
enough that coresponde receive the toes. Demand. Howe many toes is there in
each foot, and how many bones is in every too? Answer. There be five toes / in
every too three bones / except the great too that hath but twain. Thus in
nombre there be.xxvi. bones in the foot. And in all ye great foot or great leg
there be.xxx. Demand. Which of the said joints is most easy to set again,
and which is most dyffycyll? Answer. That of the little foot is most
dyffycyll / that of the kne is more / and the scyatyke is mean.

Here ends the second treaty of this present questyonary.
Here begins the third treaty of this present questyonary / where as are
moved and soylled divers questyons and dyfycultees in the manner of byndynge /
wyndynge / or rollynge / to sew / to make boylsters / lynte / and tents.
Questyons upon the manner of rollynge or byndynge. Demand.
HOwe many manners of lygatures or rollynges ben there / and howe ought they to
be made / and where each of them brings together? Answer, There ben three
manners. One is incarnatyue / and it competeth to new wounds, and fractures,
and is done thus. The wound is bound at both ends unto the midst / in
beginning fro the party opposite to the hurt place / in ledynge one end
toward the upper part of the membre / the other toward the nether in taking
the parties or about them till it be seen what is best to be done, in
streynyng more upon ye hurt place than on ye parties about it. Nevertheless
how be it heed must be taken to strain to harde or to loose / but the time to
bind is when the pacyent may well suffer it. And ye fore end of the said
roll ought to be sewed. And if need be there ought to take divers rolls
woude by one self manner of wyndyng. The lyppes of the wound are joined one to
the other / and so the appost^macion is deffended / and some put to double
clothes / and strain them and sew them on the place. Other manner of byndynge
is called expulsinc / and it proprely agrees to deep wounds, for to expel
and put out the matter from the botome / and to deffede that other matters come
not in the place, this is done with a roll folded at the heed beginning at
the nether part of the membre in streynyng most there. And fro thens in
vnwrappynge toward the upper part. The third lygature is called the lygature
holding the medycyns and it competeth as unto the members where as straynynge
can not be made nor other ligature, as at the neck, the belly, and in al
apos^umes, and dolorous dystrybucyons. And this is done with rolls of one
chyef or divers chyefs, or arms, beginning upon the hurt place in byndynge to
the contrary of the said place. Demand. What ought ye manner of byndyng to
be? Answer. They ought to be softly and without payne. And if the bonds or
rolls cleue fast / let them be moysted only with wine till they be losed.
Demand. Whereof ought the rolls to be made? Answer. After Galyen they ought
for to be made of boleyn cloth, old, soft, smooth, and clean. Demand. Of what
quantite of length and breed ought the bonds to be? Answer. They ought to be
lunge and large / commonly they that bind ye sholdres ought to be of six
fyngers breed / those for the thyghes fy^e / those for the leg four / they for
ye arm three / and those for the fyngers one / and the length to b^ after the
necessyte of wyndynge. And this saith Galyen in ye fourth book of his
Terapentyke, that th^ partycule vlcerate may not well be bound with ^ut to have
learned the indycacyon of the forming of the membre.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of seamynge or stytchynge.
Demand, Howe many and what manners are there of seames? Answer. Three / that
is ^ ^eame incarnatyfe / and it agrees to all woun^es whose lyppes be far a
sonder, if they may be ^pproched and made eagle / and which lygature ^ely
suffices not / and have no strange thing{is} ^etwene the lyppes / that be new
or renewed by ^caryfycacyon / in taking the skin away. The other seam
sowyng hight restrayntyfe of blode / and is done with the nedle in entering
foldynge as skynnes be sewed. And this is done when for the great effusyon of
blode the other seames can not be made. The third is called the seam
conseruatyfe / and it is done as the other be / but it is not so narowe / for
it is not made but for to maintain the lyppes till the wound be closed.
Demand. In howe many manners is ye incarnatyfe seam made? Answer. In.v.
manners. The first is making the first stytche in the middle of the woude /
and the other in mean space of each syde^ and going also between let two
stytches be left the space of a finger breed overthwart / and also ye ought to
have a quyll with a hole in the side wherewith the other side of the lip shall be
steyed / because it shall not swerve / and because that when the nedle is
passed thorough it may be sen at ye hole in the quyl. And when the nedle is
passed to draw it the thread in steyenge the lip that it follow not the
thread. And first knyt it with two reuolucions. Secondly with one, than cut
the thread fer fro the kno^. Secondly the seam incarnatyfe is made with nedles
or with steal of feathers led in with the nedle in to wounds that be great
deep that have lyppes wide seperate in putting threded nedles in to them as
need is / in wrappynge them with thread as ye would fasten a nedle with thread
on your bosom or pouch lid, and to abide there unto the consolidacyon of ye
woude. Thyrdly a seam incarnatyfe is made with egal the mylles made of tow
well wrythen sklenderly, as straws the length of a finger / or of the steal
of a feather / which appertain to the places when we will that the seam
remain lunge time. And it is done when threded nedles are put in to it by both
the lyppes. Than is the nedle returned by the same hole till that there
remain a pyt / where i^ is put one of the ends of the wedge / and than the
tails of the thredes are strained and bound on the other end of the wedge /
and there cut of the ends of ye thredes / and let the wedge lye unto the
parfyte consolidacion. Fourthly a seam incarnatyfe is made with hokes / and
they ought to be small mete for the membre, curbed on each side, in fastnynge
it in to one lip / and than brought to the other. And in the same let the
hokes be fastened like as the shere men do in hokyng their clothes. fyfthly an
incarnatyfe seam is made with cloth, and is made in places wherein we would
that no ^catryce shulde appear, as in ye face / it is made o^ two peaces three
tryangled / and of the bygnesse of the quantite of the membre. And anoynte them
with oyntementes myscatyues and conglutyna^ues, made of ye powdre of dragons
blode, of en^nse, mastyke, sarcacole, and steynge meal of the ^yll,
encorporate with white of an egg, and that ^ery peace be laid in every side
of the wound ^ter an inch of dystauce / and when they be dry ^ewe them
subtly / and the lyppes will reioyne to ^ydre. Demand. What nedles ought
they to be for to make these incarnatyfe seems? Answer. They ought to be even
and smooth, and three edged at the point / and at the eye they ought to be hollow
/because ye thread shall not let it to pass easily. Dema^nde. In what wounds
accords the seames conseruatyues? Answer. They conjoin in wide wounds
(where as the flesh is lost) for to approach ye lyppes, wherein it behooves to
draw some thing out / because they may the sooner be consolydate. Demand.
When is it time to take away the seames / and how ought they to be taken away?
Answer. The time to do the away is when they have done their operation. And
the manner to take them of, is to put the tail of the prove under the fist /
to cut the thread of the said tail of the prove / and in putting the flat of
the prove above the lip whereby ye thread is drawn out, for dread of
dyuydynge the wound.

Questyons upon the manner to make and to applycate the bolsters.
Demand. What is the manner to make bolsters? Answer. Auncyently they were
made of feathers sewed between two white clothes / and therefore are they called
plumeceaulx or pylowes of feathers in french. And because that they behooved to
often to be renewed removed / which was over anoyous / it is found to make
them of tow or flax of hemp well boucked and cleansed / and sometime with wol or
cotton / and sometime is put soft and thynne clowtes in two or three folds or mo
/ as it needs. Demand. Wherefore serves the bolsters? Answer. To stay and
conpryme the places dissolved / and confort the natural heate of the membre
vnioynte / and to deffende ye greues of the lygatures. Demand. Howe ought the
bolsters to be applicate? Answer. Sometime they be laid to dry / sometime they
ought to be moysted or bathed in gleyr of eggs, in wine, or in oil, as the
dysposycyon requires. And they be of three sorts, some be three square, which
(Auycen saith) serve to breed flesh / and ought to be laid on each side of
the wound / and the other on the wound in ioynynge them together / and some
are round that are laid dry on the other to keep the natural heate, and to
ripe the rottenes / other be square, and they are laid to deffende the
hurtynge of the lygatures.

Questyons upon the manner to applycate lyntes and tents.
Demand. In how many what case ought to be used lyntes tents? Answer.
In.viij. cases. First is if so be that the wounds that we will enlarge,
cleanse, or draw out any thing fro ^he botome / as in deep wounds that have
need to be searched for the lycour that assembleth in the botome of the
spaciosite. Secondly they be used in ^olowe wounds / wherein we ought to
engendre flesh. Thyrdly in wounds altered of air, which ought to be
cleansed. Fourthly in wounds bruised. Fyfthly in appostumes. Syxtly in wounds
that must be wrought about the bones. Seventhly in bytynges. And last in
wounds vlceres. And all other wounds without tents and moches ought to be
understand to be consolydate. Demand. Wherefore be tents and lyntes made?
Answer. Some be for to cleanse the wounds / and they be made of soft tender,
as of sear old lynen cloth / other are made to keep the lyppes of woudes open
and they ben made of very clean tow / or of fine clowtes, or cotton, or of
quyll of bras or silver holowe, as to the nosethyrlles for to have air, or in
deep wounds that the rottennes reclose not but come out. Other are made to
enlarge the oryfyces of the wounds / they be made of sponges harde wrythen or
of Gencyan rotes.

Thus ends the third treaty of this present questyonary.
Here begins the fourth treaty of this present questyonary / in
containing.iiij. partycles. In the first partycle is moved solved certain
questyons and dyffycultees upon the manner of bledynge.
Demand.
WHat is bledyng or blode lettynge? Answer. Divers Auctours have given divers
diffynycions of bledynge. Arnolde of the new town in his book of partyculer
operation that bledynge is incysyon of veins / by the which incysyon the
blode euacueth and the humours that rene in the veins with ye blode. And
Auycen in his first fen, of the first book of his canon saith / that bledynge
is an vnyuersall euacuacyon of emptyeng the multitude of humours. And in the
third book of the said canon he hath dyffyned that it connue euacuacyon of
humours. And Galyen upon the syxth article of the affoe of Ypocras upon this
canon. Quecun{que} flomia. c. saith that it is the comyn help of pleurisy.
Demand. What euacuacion is most surest least dangerous / either the
lettynge blode or the medicine laxatyfe? Answer. After Galyen in his little
book that he made of blode lettynge / that letting of blode is the least
dangerous / for it is restraint when we will, and not the medicine / for after
that it is ones taken it will do ye operation. Demand. For howe many
intencions be the bledyng{is} made? Answer. For.vj. The first is for ^o purge
/ and of this intention says Galyen in the third of his Terapentycke that
euacuacyon for the object regards all only ye replexion. The ^econde
intention that bledynge is made is for to dyuerte, and this intention puts
Galyen in the ^econde book of blode lettynge / it is sometime an^yspatyc / that
is to say dyuersyue / and this declares Galyen in ye fifth book of his
Terapentycke / as the flux of blode at the nose of the right nosethrylle, is
restraynte by the bledynge of the right arm. And when the left nosethrylle
bledeth the blode lettynge of the left arm restrayneth it / for the diuersion
of the blode that for the blode lettynge takes another way / and turns in
to other places than at ye nose. And this likewise shows us Ypocras in ye
fifth partycle of his affor / where he saith that if the hinder part of the
head did ache / yt the sovereign remedy is to make the right vein of the
forehead be opened / and not only for the euacuacyon that is made by the
bledynge, but likewise for the antispase and diuersion. The third intention
wherefore bledyng is made is for to attray as Galyen declares in the book
aboue-sayde of blode lettynge. If we will cause the menstrues of women to come
we cause the sophynes of the fete to be opened / nyghe to ye time that they
shulde come / or else we apply to them ventoses with scaryfycacyons in the nether
parties. The fourth intention wherefore lettynge of blode is made is for to
alter / as saith Galyen in the fourth book of his Terapentycke / and upon the
first article of the affor / that blode lettynge unto Lipothomie / that is to
say unto fayllynge of the heart, suddenly coleth all the body / and restrayneth
the fever as if it had slain it. The fyfthe intention is for to preserve /
and this intention declares Galyen in the said book of blode lettynge, and on
the syxte of affor, upon this affor / that to who soever ye blode lettynge is
good convenable where as he says that many dyspose to periplemonie and
spyttynge of blode, to quynsees, to epylence, and appoplexy were preserved of
the said inconuenyentes / by lettynge of blode at the spring time. The syxte
intention is for to lighten nature / as Galyen declares in the eleventh book
of his Terapentycke the xv. chapytre, toward the midst of the said chapytre /
saying that it is than better to cut ye vein, not only for the fevers
synocalles / but also in all the other that are of rotten humours / and to them
that have aege and suffysaut strength thereto. For nature dyspensed over all the
body is lyghtned because yt the thing that grieved it is taken away / as a
great burden lessened and made light. The rest it dygereth that ye ought to be
dygered / and dyuyde that yt ought to be dyuyded / and return to kyndly
operacyons. Demand. What be they that may well bear the lettynge of blode?
Answer. To this questyon Galyen in the book above said of blode letting saith
that it is they that are robust and strong / and that have byg and large
veins / and that be not to lean, to white, ten^er. And contraryly the other
may scantly suffer it for they have but little blode / and their flesh is
^argely enaporable. Demand. What folk ^uffreth not blode lettynges? Answer.
It is they ^hat are of contrary dysposycyons to the dysposycyons aforesaid /
as whytely coloured and lean folks, or over fat and weyke, yt have streyt
veins and tender folk / specyally little children before. xv. years / and old
folk after.lxx. years / if it be not by great need and with great cautel /
and he that be not wont to be letten blode, and they that have weyke stomachs
/ and have flux of the belly dyatryc / and people gullyng, fraungyng, and
dronkerdes, women with child, chyefly in the first and last months / as
unto.iiij. months / and after.vij. months unto the end / and women having
their flowers, and Rasis in his fourth book of his Almansor puts to them
that have fasted and suffered huger. The fleumatykes, them that and wont to
diseases of cold maladies. And those that dwells in very cold regyons, or
vehement hot. Demand. Howe many and what veins are to be let blode in the
body of mankynde? Answer. As Haly says in the nynth sermon of the second
part of his book / de regali dispositione / there be xxxiij. Of the which
there be.xij. amid the arms / that is to wit two medyans, two cephalykes, two
basilykes, two affelleres, two cubytalles, and two seynalles. And in the head
there be.xiij. That is two behind the ears, two in the angles of ye eyes, two
organykes, two on the sun of the head, one on the forehead, one on the
hyndre part of the head, one on the nose, and two under the tongue. And there
be.viij. in the fete, two on the knees, two sopheynes, two scyatykes, and two
at the ankles. How be it Albucrosus puts in all but.xxv. That is to wit.xv.
in the head.v. in the arms, and.v. in the legs. Demand. Is it lefull and
convenable to let blode on the arteres? Answer. Yea, howbeit it is very
doubtful / and yet may ye let blode at the arteres of the temples and behind
the ears. Demand. Howe ought the arteres to be opened? Answer. It is better
to cut them thorough then otherwise. Demand. In howe many manners ought ye
veins to be opened? Answer. After three manners, that is to wit the common
veins be cut in length, the partycules overthwart / and are cut thorough and be
canterysed. Demand. In what quatyte ought the blode to purge by the blode
letting? Answer, It is not possible to measure the blode lettynges by certain
rule / for all medycynall euacuacyons ven coniecturatyues as Galyen says in
his foresaid book, and in his second book of his Terapentyke. How be it Arnolde
of de villa nova the new town after the doctrine of Ypocras measures ^t by
coniecturacyon / saying that in blode lettynge is not to be considered the
quanty of the blode all only / but also must be considered ye time, the
regyon, the aege, and the disease. Demand. Which of the said consyderacions
that ought to be had to measure the quantyte of the bledyng be most necessary
/ and that ought syngulerly to be ^nsydered? Answer. There be two among the
other / that is the strength of the malady, and the virtue / for if the malady
be great and the necessyte and the virtue be strong, a great bledynge ought
to be made for one time. And if the virtue be weyke and the necessyte great /
it ought not to be done so much at one time / but ought for to b^ withdrawn
taken away at two or three times / after as the virtue may suffer at once. And
this to do ought to be considered the poulce / and when it is seen that it
alyeneth to vnequalyte / and that it minissheth the vein ought to be stopped.
Thus likewise ought to be considered the colour / for if it change to better
disposition colour / it ought to be stopped. As it appears by Galyen in ye
fyfthe book of sharpe dyseases. And the great bledyng after Galyen and Auycen
is of two pound / and the least of half a pound / the mean of one poude.
Demand. At what hour / and at what time ought the bledynge to be made?
Answer. At all times necessary and constraynte. The time constraynte is the
time when the bledynge ought to be made / and can not be in any wise tarried /
with out more danger whereunto ought not totally to be regarded in things that
shulde hyndre or let it / if the lettynge were not so great (as says Bernard
of Gordon) yt there might ensue greater inconuenyence. In such case it may be
correct turned to some other euacuacyon / as in a child that hath a fever
synocall in stead of letting blode to be boxed. How be it that Auynzar let his
soon blede that was but three years old, healed him. Auerois recounts in the
seventh book of his collyget, in speaking of this time, and this hour, at all
times, and at all hours, as well by night as day, and ought to let blode
without any delay. The time chosen is the time convenable to do it / after the
instance of the bodies above / and the dysposycyons below / as to the
dysposynge of the bodies. That is to wit that the moan have good light / as
of.vii.ix. or.xi. days in encreasyng, or of xvii.xix. or.xxi. in wanynge / and
neither be in conjunction nor opposycyon / that she be in a good place, and
good sign / fre of all ill signs. And master Arnolde de villa nova says in
his affor. That to let blode is best about the midst of the third quadre /
because that than be but little condensed, no renmatizanted. And the
salernytans do choose the bledynge at divers hours / after that at divers
hours the humours have their course. Nevertheless it is to be noted as touching
these things that are said / that there where as the two influences may not
both together overcome. The Phisycyen or Cyrurgyen ought soonest to stey at that
yt is best known unto him / that is to the influence here beneth / which is
effect of the dysposycyon above. Demand. Howe many and what conditions
ought the workman to have that will dyspose him to let blode? Answer. He
^ught to have four conditions. First he ought to be yonge, virtuous and
strong / so that he be ^at caduke nor shaking of his hands. The se^onde is
that he ought to be of good sight, that he may well dyscerne the veins on ye
places where they be. The third is that he ought to be accustomed for to do
it. The fourth that he ought to be furnysshed of bends and cotton / and red
powdre / because that he may ouerceas^e morogie if it hap to come. Demand.
What ought to be the manner to set blode? Answer. First he ought to rub the
place well all about that he will let blode / and than he ought to take a list
or a gyrdel wherewith he must bind the membre higher than the place where he
will make the opening. And than he ought well to hold the place where the
veins is that he will open / and seek it with the end of his finger / and
than open it softly / and pearce it not thorough / but ought to reyse somewhat
the point of the launcet upward for fear to hurt ye artere or the synewe /
and his euacuacyon thus suffycyently done, to take away the gyrdell that it
was bound with / and diligently close the wound with a little cotton and bend
it. Demand. Howe ought he to be governed that will be letten blode before he
do blede / and after that he hath bled. Answer. To the first demand I say or
he be letten blode / if he double that the blode be gross / or in cold whether
as in winter / he ought to walk a little and travail / or be banned the day
before / specyally if he shulde blede at any little vein of the hands or fete.
And if ye veins as yet appear not well, a day before he must have a plaster of
leueyne And if he doubt of his strength that he were to weyke / or he blede
give him a ^o^te with wine / than proceed and make him blede ^yttynge if he be
strong. If he be weyke let him ^yt in his bed somewhat raised. To the second
d^maunde howe he ought to be governed when actually he is let blode. First if
he have rings or stones that have specyall virtues for to stanch that he
leave them of. And than when ye opening is made give him a staff in his hand
/ and that he remove his fyngers and cough / and that he be a little stricken on
the hand and sholdres. And if the whether be cold / or that ye doubt that the
blode be to gross, or that ye make fecodacyon / ye must make an opening lunge
enough. And in whether / and opposyte dysposycyon ye must make it lesser / and
if the virtue be weyke ye must have cold water all ready for to rub him. And
make him other things that are accustomed to be made for faylyng of the heart,
if his heart do faint. As to the third questyon, howe he ought to be governed
after the bledynge / I say that if for the bledynge he chaufe, ye must give him
some of a pomgarnade to eat with a little cold water, by ye counceyll of Galyen
/ and if he be not chauffed give sauge leues wet in wine. And then lye him
upright upon a bed decly^yng somewhat on the side that he hath blede on / and
close the door and the wyndowes / so that by over much light his even be not
troubled. And an hour after, (not before) let him ^ate temperatly not gredyly
/ let his meat be of good substance and qualyte / and that it eugendre good
blode and rectify the i'll if any be, and let his drink be more than his meat /
but not so much as he is wont. And if he be accustomed to sleep.ij. or.iij.
hours / after let him sleep a little. How be it Auycen forbyddeth holly the
slepynge soon after lettynge of blode / for the cofraction that than after
ensue in the members / that the pacyent take good heed that his vein open not
again / and he ought to keep this rule three days after. Demand. Is the
Cyrurgyen bound to have the knowledge of the blode that is drawn? Answer.
No, but the beholdynge of the said blode belongs to Physycyens. Nevertheless
for to comfort him yt hath bled / to rejoice him he ought to loke on it, and
tell him that his bledynge was good / for ye blode that is drawn was good /
and that is better that is remained, and if it be ill it was a good bleding for
him. Demand. If the Cyrurgyen would have the knowledge of the blode yt he
hath drawn by the blode lettynge / howe shall he dyscerne the good from the
bad? Answer. For the good is it that is his substance is neither to thycke
nor to thynne, and that is frangyble / and in his colour is red. In odor
pure, and in savour sweet and amiable / and the ill blode is it that is devoid
of the said conditions, as the coleryke yt is to thine and yelowe and bitter /
and is sharp in smell. And the melancolyke blode is thycke and black, or
yellowysshe drawing to dymine^ aygre in savour. And the blode stewmatyke is
thycke and gleymy / and white in colour, and sweet in ^auour / and the blode
where as is much water betokens that the pacyent was a good drynker / or
that his reins be feeble and weyke. And that that is graueyllous, and of
colour and substance of ashes / betokens that he is a lazar / the blode
black and asshy is ill, betokens corrupcyon of humours / and dysposycyon to
fevers and appostumes / and evil pustule blaynes. And yt which is thycke / and
the skin over strong, so yt scantly it will break / sygnyfyeth disposycyon
to opilacions. And ye blode that hath the colour of greas and blode,
sygnyfyeth coldness, or over great heate and adustyon. Of the which thou shalt
know the difference by the behauyng of the body. And the blode that can not
congele, signifyeth that he is waxen cold and ^nnatural. And that that
congeleth in competent time, as in half an hour, sygnyfyeth that he is
natural. And of all these manners and sygnyfycacyons it is very good for the
Cyrurgyen to cal the Dhysycyens because of parfyte knowledge.

Here ends the first partycule of this treatise.
And here begins the second partycule wherein is moved and assoyled certain
questyons and dyffycultees upon the manner of ventosynge or boxynge.
Demand.
WHat is ventosyng. Answer. It is the putting of boxes upon any membre for to
expuls the matter between the sky^ne and the flesh. Demand, What are vetoses?
Answer. Uentose is an instrument made in manner of a box with a streyt neck
and a wide belly. Demand. Where of ought ventoses to be made? Answer. After
Albucrasis they be made of three things. Some of horns, some of glass, and
some of brass. Demand. Howe many forms is there for to use ventoses / and
what is their effects? Answer. Some be with garsynge / and other without
scaryfycacyon. Those that be done without scaryfycacyon draws the matter out
feeling, and ye other contraryly. Demand. What difference is between
euacuacions done by blode lettynge, by ventosynge, and by snails blode
sowkers? Answer. The most difference is of blode lettynge / for it draws
the blode deper than the boxynge or the snails / and the snails deper than
the ventoses / which proprely draws but between the skin and the flesh.
And therefore Auycen says yt they purge more the thynne blode than the thycke
/ and more the vpperest than the nether. Demand. For howe many and for what
intencyons are ventoses appli^ate with gar^ng upon a mans body? Answer.
For.xij. intencyons. Some general, and some {per}tyculer. The general is made
to cleanse sensybly / and have the place of a blode lettynge / when blode
lettynge dare not be done for dyners things that lets blode letting, as in
a child of.xiiij. year old, in aged folk above.lxx. years. And for this
cause Auycen calls vetoses curates of ye veins. The.vij. intencyons whereby
the said ventoses is applied, is taken of the places yt they be set to. The
first is to purge the matter of the head, and the parties thereof / and
therefore they are applied in the nawpe of the neck, and kepeth the place of
the cephalyke bledynge. And therefore they be good for the dyseases of the eyes,
to the infections of the face, and stynkynge of the mouth. The second
intention is for to cleanse the spyrytual maters / and therefore they must be
applied between the shuldres / kepeth the mean for blode ^ettynge of the
medyan / and therefore they be con^etent to the dyseases of asma, palsye,
spettynge of blode. The third intention is to empty the matter that is
contained in the nutrytyfe members / and therefore shulde they be applied to the
raynes and to the loins / and there they take the place of ^asilica / therefore
they avail to the opylacyons ^ostumes, and dolor of the liver of the reins,
and scabs of all the body. The fourth intention is that it is applied in the
midst of the arm, for the ache pains of the parties thereof. The fifth
intention is for that it is applied in the midst of the thyghes and the legs
nygh to the ankles, and applied there is in the stead of the blode lettynge of
the sophynes / and therefore they provoke the flowers to women / and causes
them to pysse, and eases the pains of the matryce and the bladder, and
cofereth to the gowte of the fete evil sores. Demand. For howe many / and
for what intencyons the ventoses applied without scarificacyon? Answer. But
for one general intention / and for.xi. partyculers. The intention general is
for to draw, and the particulers do vary after the places that they be applied
to. The first place is upon the ypocondres to reduce dyuert the blode of the
nosethrylles after Galyen in the fifth of his Terapentyke saying that when the
right nosethryll doth blede, for to stanch it ye ventose must be applied upon
the liver / and when one bledeth at the left nosethryll it must be applied on
ye mylt. The second place where they be applied is under the breasts for to
stanch and dyuerte the flowers of women, as Ypocras saith in ye fifth of his
affo, and as Galyen declares in the beginning. The third place where they
ought to be applied is on the interyour part of the head for to reyse the
euela / to stanch the room. For to draw the deep matter outward as Galyen
declares in the xiij. book of his Terapentycke / and for that cause they be
often applied upon ye appostumes that be in the clensyng places / the which
Auycen hyddeth to be drawn out as much as may be. Likewise they be applied
for ye same cause upon ye thyghes / for to provoke flowers in women. And also
nyghe to the appostumes of the joints / to wtdrawe deffende that the said
appostumes do not breed / and to put ferof the humours fro ye said joints.
The fourth place to apply them is upon the bredyng of synewes, in palsy, for to
heat them as Auycen says in the third book of his Canon in the Chaptour of
palsy. And Galyen in the third book of ye interyours, where as he proves
against Archygenes that the brain is pryncyple and beginning of the virtue
anymall. The fifth place to apply ventoses is upon the belly in colyke passion,
for to resolve and vnuapen the vetosire, and cease the payne. The.vj. place is
upon the matryce, and upon the bowels for to reduce and withdraw them to
their places, as Auycen saith in his third canon. The.vij. place is upon the
rybbes like bones for to reduce and return them in to their places, when they
are broken or dysioynted. The. viij. place is upon the ways and poores whereby
the vryne passes from the reins to the bladder / as Auycen saith in the
third book of his Canon. The.ix. place is upon the ears gappes of deep
wounds, for to draw out the filth or other noyaunce if there were any. The.x.
place is upon the neck for to enlarge the ways of the breath and of the meat.
The.xj. place to apply ventoses is upon venymous bytyng{is} and blaynes to
draw out the thycke venym. Demand. Howe ought they to governed that must be
ventosed before after it? Answer. To the first answers Galyen in the third
book of the cretyke days, and the same proves Albumazer i his great
introductory that the chosen days for to apply ventoses is when the moon is
full not in the wane. For as the moon increases in lyghte / likewise
increases the humours within the body / and as it waneth so descreaseth ye
humours withdraw them inward. And therewith it ought to be an australl day /
that is to say hot and moyste / and the ventoses ought to be plied fro two of
the clock unto three. And after ye intencyons of doctors / first ye place
ought to be bathed and fomented (which shulde be ventosed) with warm water if
the blode be thycke / but if it be thynne it is not need at all, for it should
be danger of to much resolucyon / and that the strength should weyken. And it
is to note / that never scaryfieng ought to be made but first ye must put to
the ventose dry, because the blode must be drawn or it be voided. As to the
second question it is to be noted as is before spoken that there be two manners
of ventoses. Some be of horne / and some of glass. They of horne are applied in
suckynge. They of glass with tow put in to the ventose / and fire in the two
and laid on the flesh / than the fire quenches where the ventose takes. Or
after Albucrasis / take a little candle of wax and give it a little stey
below that it may hold right upon the flesh, and light it, than set on the
ventose, and the candle will quench and the ventose take hold. And the
Cyrurgyen ought with his hands to rub all about the place to move the
blode to it. As to the third questyon after that ye have applied and set to
the said ventose by two or three times if it be need when it is taken away ye
ought to make certain scaryfycacyons very deep with the rasour / and than wipe
and dry the blody place / and than ones again set to the ventose as ye did
before / and keep it on half an hour till it be half full of blode, and then
take it away and ^ype the place, and set it on again, and hold it there more
or less till ye have suffycyently half a ^ounde of blode, or to a pound,
after the tenor ^f the strength the quantyte of the replexyon. And (...) after
the first apposycyon after the scaryfyca^on if it blede not well rub the place
with the mouth ^f the ventose, or give it small fyllyps with your (...) / and
garse it a new that it may blede well / and when it hath ben ventosed wipe and
dry the (...) / and than anoynte it with oil of Roses or ^her oyntement to
mytygate the smert / and go^rne the pacyent as is aforesaid of them to be ^ten
blode. Demand. Shall they be set upon ^restes of women or other soft place?
Answer. ^ay, for danger that it do not entre to deep in quantyte, may not be
had again. Demand, If the ventoses will not hold when they be set on, what
ought ye Cyrurgyen do to make them fast? Answer. He must bath and foment the
place all about with warm water in such wise so lunge that the eyre entre not.
Demand. Is it needful for to continue keep them lunge? Answer. No,
specyally about the pryncipal members that are the mines of strength / for
behind the neck they hurt the mind / and behind the shuldres they annoy the
heart / in the right ypocondre they noye the liver.

Thus ends the second partycule of this treatise.
Here begins the third partycule of this treatise / where as be moved and
assoyled some dyffycultees questyons upon the manner to apply blode souckers or
horse leches.
Demand.
Wherefore are horse leaches applied? Answer. For to understand ye solution of
this questyon is to be noted what horse leches be. They are well known to be
certain little black worms like to Mice tails and have small yelowe
streykes on their backs somewhat brownysshe under the belly / and to the
question they are put and applied to draw or soucke as is beforesaid. Demand.
Which are the blode suckers that ought to be chosen / and which are wholesome /
and which are dangerous and ought not to be applied in any wise? Answer.
They that be good are food in clear waters / and they that be of a loathsome
colour with great heads, and that be rotten, and found in noughty waters be
dangerous, evil, and venymous. Demand. To what bodies and to what members
ought they to be applied? Answer. They ought only to be applied in bo^es
void of replexyon / for in cacechymyke bo^es and replete they ought never to
be applicate as touching the places and members that they ^ughte to be put to
/ they are applied but only to ^uche places as ventoses can not be set, as to
sy^ewes, in the lyppes, gumes, in places dry and ^ar^e of flesh, as the
fyngers and joints. And ^hedery^ wills that sometime they be set upon
^ostumes of the clensynge places, which are of ^ffycyle ^uracyon and
maturacyon / some will ^aue them set on emoroydes for to open them.

^Demaude. In howe many maladies are blode ^kers good? Answer. Auycen says
yt they be ^ood to scabs, to emoroydes, and to apostumes of the clensynge
places as it is said. Demand. Howe shulde blode suckers be applied? Answer.
They ought not to be applied when they are new taken / but kept in fresshe
clear water all a day till they have purged of all that was in their belyes.
And than rub the place that ye will put them to till it do wax r^ddy / and
wasshe it or anoynte it with a little blode, or garse it with a rasoure that
some blode issue / than put them to with a rede or your hands / and put them
in two or three places as need shall be. And when they have well sucked and
drawn till they be full, they will fall of by them self / or else put a little
vyneygre on their heads, or white salt, or aloes, or seperate them with a
horse hear or a fine thread. Demand. Howe shall the place be ordered after
that they are fallen of? Answer. Rub and wasshe it with salt and vyneygre.
Demand. If after thextraction and fall of the worm there follow emororgie or
to great flux of blode, what ought the Cyrurgyen to do? Answer. To stanch it
with a plaster of Bolarmynyke galls, balastye, other that stauche blode.
Demand. Howe ought he to be ruled that hath ben blode sucked after that they
are fallen of? Answer. He ought to be ordered as they that be let blode, as it
is written in ye first partycle of this treatise / and he ought to take
tryacle for doubt of ventosytees that blode suckers do breed.

Thus ends the third partycle of this present treatise.
Here follows the fourth partycle / where as be moved and soiled other
dyffycultees touching the manner of canterisynge or searynge.
Demand.
WHat is canterysacyon? Answer, It is an operation made with fire artyfycyally
in ye body of man for certain vtylytees. Demand. Howe many manners of
Canteres be there? Answer. Two manners Some are actualles and they appear
suddenly in ^ffecte, as they that are made with instruments of ^etall, and
brennynge / or with the rote of Arysto^ogie, or of Affodylles that are sore
heart, or with water, or with sethyng oil laid to the place, co^yngly not at
adventure. Other are potencyall whose operations are not so sensible nor so
soday^, but appears afterward as they that be made ^th brening or ruptycke
medecines. And there is (...) manners of them. Some are of strong op^ssyon,
and makes scars as lyme soap and ^ardus. Some other thyrleth more lightly
(...) make no scars, but blysters as canterides, ^mule, and pantalupina.
Demand. Which ^anteres are the surest, the actualles, or the poten^yalles?
Answer, The actualles, because ye action of fire is most simple. And also it
hurts less the next parties, and pryncypall members than the action of
rupture / for it is greatly suspect to the principal members / and therefore
it ought not to be applied, but if case be that the pacyente were faint herted
and durst not abide the fire / and in case that ye would apply canteres lastly
and for to purge / for in such case the rupture for the payne that it makes
and for the byg scar that it leueth, and in weykynge of ye place is cause of
bigger flux of blode. Demand. Which is most profytable to make actual
canteres with gold or with yren? Answer. In pryncypall and tender members, as
the eyes it is better to do it with gold than with yren. Howbeit in other
mebres it is more behove full to do it with iron as saith Albu. For the fire
may be better esteemed in ye yren than in the gold or in silver because of
their colours, but if it were a goldsmyth that is wont thereto. Demand. If
actual canteres be necessary, and to whom, and wherewith? Answer, First
they be necessary to conserve health and to heal diseases, and kepeth the rowme
of profytable purgynges, as blode let tynges, and clensynge by medycyns
laxatyues, in such that may not suffer them. And the rest that remains after
the purgynges it corrects in great and strong dyseases, where as it is wont
to be given. Secondly they be necessary and convenable to be given in all
dysposycyons of maladies / and specyall in materyal maladies, sauf in such as
are hot and dry / wherein they do many evils / and that it is true that they
be profytable in the other first dysposycyons, and cold dysposycyons and
moyste, in as much as it contraryeth them holly. Thyrdly in hot and moyste
dysposycyons in which suppose that holly they do not contrary, nevertheless
they contrary accydentally / in as much as it voydeth the cause of the
malady. How be it it is to be noted that suppose a cantere be a profitable
remedy very convenable, yet it is not now adays so much in use as it was
wont to be for the abusers of the art and that exercysed it, the which
indyfferently and in all dysposy^ions, that is to wit in replection or
otherwise apply them. And it is evil done / many evils follows thereby. And
therefore good Cyrurgyen beware right well, that in a person full of humours
good or bad never to apply Cantere without precedent purgation. Demand. For
howe many and what vtylytees are canteres made and ordey^ed? Answer. For.vj.
vtylytees. The first to com^orte the members, for they chanfe and dry the
members that were dulled with cold and humy^te. And therefore Galyen says of
the auctoryte (...) Ypocras, that the dry thing is nearest the hole ^hynge /
and the moyste thing ferdest of. The se^ude vtylite is to withstand deffende
the mem^re from corruption. And therefore Auycen in his fourth book comaundeth
them to be done round about the estionoenes sores spredyng or compassynge,
and to corrupt bones. The third vtylyte that Auycen puts is to resolve the
coarted maters in any membre / and therefore byddeth Albucrasis and Haly abbas
that they be applied to the pains of the joints, great dolor of ye head.
The fourth vtylyte is to stanch the blode, as Auycen puts, and Galyen in
the fifth of Terapenty^ / because they make scarre. The fifth vtylyte is
purging old fluxes as the eyes, of all the body, this vtilite puts Arnolde
of villenensis. And for that cause be the cetons canteres done (behind the
neck,) and in the fontenelles of the lacertes where as one is divided from the
other) under the said lacertes a two or three fyngers fro the joints. The syxth
vtylyte that Galyen puts is to entrebreake, and intercyde the matter. And
for that cause are the veins of the temples canterysed / because that the
matter rene not in to the even / and in ruptures that the bowels shall not
descend, and in the cyrcuyt and next places to wicked sores. And of this
vtylyte Arnolde of vylle. makes an afforysme / where he says yt the rennynge
can not be diverted nor issue kyndly / that his abiden may be copetently
cleansed by canteres. The.vij. vtylite is for to draw out the superfluytees.
This vtylite the common usage approves by operation of apostumes by canteres,
and by cuttynge of kyrnelles, extyrpacyon of flesh quycke or dead. Demand.
Which are the places and partycle of actual canteres? Answer. After men of
this time there be.viij. The first is applied to the ^oppe of the head where
the master finger may reche beginning a span fro nyghe to the rote of ye
nose stretching upward / the doctors will that there ought to be applied a
round cantere with an oliuare for to resolve the brain and dyuert the rewpose
maters in the subject places by lowe / and some deep them to the bone / other
race make bare the first table of the skull. How be it Alb. approves it not /
and the said canteres applied to the said places avails to ydlenes, falling
evil, pains of the head, and to rennynge of the eyes, to ptysyke, and to all
rewmes. The second place to apply canteres ought to be in the flesh of the
head behind in ye noddle. And they ought likewise to be applied round with
an olyuare / and avails for to heate and conforte the head in palsy, in
trembling of limbs, cramp, and to pale lazery. The third place to apply
can^eres is on the eye lyddes to correct them reyse ^hem / and is done with a
cantere mytilyn in stead ^f pytche, for to close ye holes or places of ye
drawn ^eares, to let them grow again / and ought to (...) actual, that is
in manner of a nedle. Likewise ^ey be applied to ye lachrymalles to consume the
^perflue flesh / and is done with a small actual ^ntelayre nygh to the nose,
for the fystula, with (...) quyll. Likewise to ye temples with a cantelayre to
close the veins, to stanch the room that falls over the eyes. And it is
applied to the nose with an actual through a quyl or rede for to consume the
stink. The fourth place is for to apply them within the vnulle for to cut it
with a sharpe cantere through a quyl. The fifth place is the neck where as
cetons are applied with tongues cetoned or with a nedle cetonned behind the
neck in the pyt / and they are applied to depart the humours that rene to the
eyes / as Lanfrancke says. And other say that they have sen by experience yt
r^ude canteres applied to the said places left lunge open heal the madness,
and the fransy, furious. And Galyen in the.xiij. of his Terapentye says, that
a ventose made on the noddle is good help for rewmes that descend over the
eyes / and for the most help so did Guydon. The syxth place is in the fore
part of the neck under the chynne (by the counceyll of some masters) for to
cleanse ye matter of gout rose / other infections of the face and mouth / and
they will that there be applied a cantere with cetons. The seventh place is on
the homoplate under the fontelles of the arms three fyngers fro the joints,
where as manyfestly is divided the lacert from the lacert with a cantere and
roude clauall with head and plate pierced. And in the said place is applied
inwardly the canteres for remedies of the face, fore part of the neck. And
applied in the said place outwardly on the arm, is for dyseases of the heed,
and hinder part of the neck. The.viij. place to apply canteres is on the
parties of the breast or thorax under the furcules with a round cantere or
cetons for disease called asma, or shortness of brethe, and disease of the
lungpype. And likewise they be applied under the arm holes for the pains of
the sholdres and to cleanse and appal y^ lepry / and likewise for the disease
of epimace, or apostumes of the rybbes is opening made with a knife ansall to
draw out che rottenes / howbeit it is dangerous of the fystule or of death
for the weykenes of the heart / by cause of the air that thyrlleth in at the
opening as Albucrasis says. The.ix. place is on the fore part of ye belly on
the stomach with round canteres, or canteres with cetons, that kepeth it
better open, for the dyseases of the stomach, or on the liver, or on the
mylte, for the dyseases of the said members. And under the nauyll for the
water of ydropesy. And Albucrasis and Haly do them with claualles, dowble or
treble. The.x. place is in the flanks for the rupture, and in the coddes for
swellynge of the coddes, and flanks, with ceton / and on the share for the
bladder. The.xj. place is behind on the reins / and is made with a round or
clauall cantere. The.xij. place is on the fonty^elles under ye knee.iij.
fyngers breed, there as the ^ert is dyuyded fro the lacert / and is made with
^ounde claualles with place for the purgacyon of ^l the body / and the dyseases
of the legs. De^aunde. Which are the general vtylytees of can^eres
potencyalles? Answer. Potencyall canteres are profytable / and serve to such
things as the actualles do, sauf that they conforte not as the actualles, but
they weyken the members / therefore be they more appropried to empty and derive
the humours, open apostumes, and restrain flux of blode than the actualles.
Demand. Which are the partyculer, and profitable places of potencyal canteres?
Answer. First as touching their partyculer vtylytees, they are taken of the
places where as they are applied / and the places where as they are applied ben
such / for the brennynge potencyalles ought to be applied i f^esshely places,
because of their de^e drawing / and deper than the actual brennynges.
How be it they be more grievous in noble members. And the blysters potencyall
canteres be applied upon places between flesh and fell, as under ye chynne,
behind on the neck, in the face, on ye ankles, and on the hands, for it
holds but humours that are between the skin and y^ flesh, as it appears
by experience. Demand. Which and howe many be there of actual canteres,
where they be used, and what shapes have they? Answer. Divers auctours have
used and dyscryued the form or shape of certain. Wyllyam of Salicet
discriueth.vj. or.viij. Lanfranc.x. Henry of Mundeuyll.vij. Howbeit of all
common canteres Guydon dyscryueth but.vj. whose names forms follows. The
first is called Cultelere (of C^ustean) that is a knife, and it is of two
manners / one is called Dorsall because it hath a back cutteth but on the one
side / and the other is Ansall because it is made in manner of a sword cuttynge
on both sides. And with this Cultelere be the superfluous flesshes cut, and
apostumes are opened, and the sores vlceres rectified. Of the which Culteres
the shapes or forms are such as be here figured.

The second cantere is named Oliuare because it resembles a kyrnell of Olyue,
as says Haly abbas in his.ix. book de ragali dispositione in the second
party, and chapy^er of doctions of the head, and not like to Olyue leaf as
wened Lanfrancke, Salicet, and Henry. Also his operation declares it, the
shape is thus.

The third Cantere is called Dacteler because it is in semblauce of a Date
stone / and it is bigger than is the Olyuare / and the form is such.

The fourth is named punctual, which hath the point sclendre and round / it
is of two manners. One is made with a rest or plate, because it shall not ^erce
thorough the skin / and with this there be ^anteres to the dyseases called
knots in the fontenelles / and in the arms and legs. The other is plain
lunge in manner of a beme of the soon / which is applied with a quylle / The
forms of them are such.

The quyll.
The fyfthe is called a cantere subtle wherewith the Cetons are applied with
small tongues broad and pierced. And this is lighter and more durable.

The pl^.
The form of the second is such / that the punctualles because the name of
punctualles do fall often, have need of byndynge more tydeous than these be /
the form is such.

The tongues.
The.vj. is called Cyrculare / which hath.v. adiutours to make.v. canteres ad
nodulum with plate pierced of.v. holes after this form following.

Demand. Howe and in what manner ought the canteres be applied? Answer. They
ought to be applied in the form as follows. That is, first the place must
be sought where yt they shall be applied, and wipe it well and dry it, than
bliss it, after take your platyne or quyl and apply them all cold / but ye
must not let them ^ye long / and than give the canteres to the work man that
shall apply them all hot and very flamynge, so yt the pacyent se them not.
And let them be applied upon the said places in reuoluynge them continually
from one place to another that they cleue not to the flesh, till the rednes
begone. And they must be harder pressed upon the bones ^han on the synewes,
and more lightly / and let it (...) done as oft as need shall be. Demand. In
what time, and in what hour ought the canteres ^o be applied? Answer. After
Galyen in ye third ^nd thyrtene book of his terapentyke, at all times ^nd at
all hours as necessyte requires / so that ^he body be clean and not full of
humours. Demand. Howe lunge ought they to be kept open after the
canterysyng? Answer. After ye doctrine of Rog. of those masters by ye space
of.xl. days or more, by the space of three months / for that is the last
term of apostumes as Ypocras saith in the.vj. partycle of his afforysmes / and
second of the pronostyces. And the cause is, for ye virtue confortatyfe
enters by the canteres by the foresaid time is evaporate, and the place
weyked / and also there abides replexyon of evil humours by the said
opening. Demand. Howe ought the place to be kept open after the
canterysynge? Answer. They must be kept open with tents or knots of wax, or
with water in the which is steped and dyssolued the virtue of Euforbie, or
scamony, or colloquintida, or of elebora, after the kind of the humour that
shall be purged, or with a peas, or a nut made of the wood of yuy, or of
Gentian / and over it lay a cole leaf, or an yuy leaf / over that a lynnen
cloth three dowble, and a platyne of brass or laton, or of silver bound
thereon, and be removed twyse or thryse a day. Demand. How must they be ordered
that shall be canterysed? Answer. Thus. First or they be canterysed they must
be conforted, and to them declare the vtylytees and goodness that canteres will
do to them / and if it be need to make to hold him fast, and to bind him
well. And after that they be canterised ye must apply on the said places oil
of Roses (with white of an egg well beaten together and well in corporate) by the
space of four days. And than apply upon it a maturatife made with butter well
washed and vnsalted / and a little wheat flower, or with some other vnctuous
thing and sweet without salt unto the scar be fallen / and than to be dressed
healed as vlceres be / sauf only that if ye will keep them open for to purge
ye humours and the vaporous fumes, or that ye place had ben opened lunge
aforehande. For which thing it shulde not be sure to close it without that it
were ^uacuate by another place, for it should be danger that the humours that
were wont to rene in the said membre shulde remain within / and that
peradventure it wold deryuate to other members and do more harm than was
before. Demand. Is it of necessyte that after it is closed to open it again,
if it be lefull to open it in ye same place? Answer. Yes, or in another membre
ne'er to it, or to the next place, as Arnolde of new town saith in his
parabolles. Demand. If they that be canterised with potenciall canteres may
be ordered as they be canterysed with actualles? Answer. Yes sauf that they shall
not be bound. And also those that blister make no scarre, which must be well
applied, correct, and reprymate of their malyces. And after that the blysters
be raised pierce them with cysours or a nedle, and lay a coleworte leaf thereon
/ and cover it with lynnen, and ordre it as ye list. And because that they be
not blystred nor make no scar thus they fall within.vij. days.

Thus ends this present questyonary made in the honour of almighty god /
profit of yonge studyentes in Cyrurgery / willing to apply their study in ye
same art.
The manner to examine lazares / to approve lepry mesel^y / after the minds of
Doctors.
AS Galyen wytnesseth it is great injury be it done to man or woman to depart
put away them that be not infect with lepry, nor touched with meselry, not
being lazares. And also it is great danger to support, haunt, or be with
such as are stricken or diseased therewith / for it is a contagyous and
daugerous malady. And therefore they that ought to judge and approve them shulde
right diligently behold them considre the vnyuoke signs and equyuokes also.
And not for one only token give their sentences / but by many conuenaunces /
and specyally vnyuokes. First than when that the approvers come or cal them
diseased to their presence for to examine them, they ought to conforte them
with wholesome words, and tel them that the said disease is penance salutary for
the salvation of their souls, and bid them to take it pacyently. And that they
fear not to say the troth / for if they were found lazares it should be
their purgatory in this world. For albeit that they were refused of the world
/ yet they were and be chosen of God. c. And than cause them to swear to say
the troth / and enquire of them such things as follows. Secondly the
examyners ought to enquire of them by the prymatyfe causes of lepry. And
first enquire of them if there were any of his lygnage that he knew to be
lazares / and specyally their faders or mothers / for by any other of their
kynred they ought not to be lazares / but if it were by some constellation that
influed equally upon a kynred / and specyally on them that dwelt together, and
have one self manner of living / as we se oftentimes by the time of
pestylence, if any of a kynred be stricken or enfect / yt also many other as
bretherne, and cosyns, or other parents soon after are stricken, yet or they
have be borne. For as Auycen says in his second treatise the first son of
the fourth of his Canon in the first chapyter of rottennes. The first cause
of rottennes is meates / and the nourysshynge that is of evil qualytees. And
for that cause if a child be nourished of a woman corrupt and infect in her
humours ought also to be infect. And not all only if the mother be a lepresse
/ but let us behold also yt for the said cause by experience that they being
conceyu^d in the time that ye woman hath her flowers / ^nd that she be not
clean that scantly the child ^apeth lepry, or to be scalled, or tached with
such ^fecte dyseases / or that he bear some tache upon ^ym. Also if the father
were fecte and in the matter whereof he is composed. For as Galyen says in the
first partycle of the efforysmes of Ypocras upon this canon Et qui crescunt.
The things that are dyssolued of an other thing necessarily extends of the
nature of the thing whereof they are dissolved. Than ought ye to enquire if he
hath had ye company of any lepresse woman. And if any lazare had meddled with
her before him and lately / because of the infect matter and contagyous filth
that she had received of him. It is to be noted that a woman is not so
daugerous to be a lepresse to habit with a lazare, as it shulde be a man to
habit with a lazarous woman, or with one that hath habited newly with a lazare.
For all infections remain in the matryce of the woman, unto the time that they
be pourged by their flowers cleansed / which a man can not do, because he hath
no receptacle where to hold the said imundycytees. Than ye ought to enquire
of him if he hath had the quartayne fevers / and howe lunge sith? For howbeit
(saith Auycen in his first fen of the first book of his Canon) the fever
quartayne delyuereth a man of evil melancolyke diseases / and wit if he hath
not had the emorroydes, and sith when? Like reason / the emorroydes kepeth that
he fall not in to inconuenyence. Than enquire him of his dreams / if his
dremes be not terryble / and that he sees black things, and devils / such
dreams betoken the melancolyke humour to have domynyon whereby he is so
inclined. And wit of him how he is wont to live / as if he hath used meates
with strong spyce and in great quantyte, and strong wives, or garlyke, lekes,
onyons, and colewortes, old chese, gotes flesh, of bears, of foxes, of
mesyl swyne, or salt meates, and of vnclene fysshe all at one table, if he have
continued therewith. And also of all manner herbs, and such meates as brenne the
blode, and holly consumes it. Than ask if he hath had great solycytudes,
chargeable thoughts that hath dried him made him melancolyke. Than ye ought
to behold and consydre in your self of what complexyon he is, as well natural
as accydentall, for suppose that lepry be a cold disease by incineracio of
humours, yet Auycen saith, the most aucyent cause of lepry is the evil
complexyon of the liver that is so hot and dry that it breneth the blode
melancolyeth it. After yt the patient hath ben examined upon the first causes
that dyspose a person to be a lazare / he ought to be examined and approved
by the signs of lepry as well equyuocalles as vnyuocalles / and are the signs
that coueneth only in this disease / and the equyuocal signs conueneth them
in divers maladies. Of the vnyuocall signs. First than in procedynge as it is
said to the knowledge of the vnyuocal signs, in following the doctrine of
Ypocras in the first book of ye pro^ostikes saying. Primo enim egri facie
{per}notabis. First you shalt note ye signs apperynge in the face for they are
the truest / for all the signs vnyuocalles are holden there because yt in ye
face among al other mebres of the person is no greater nombre of spyrytes
because of the.v. organes of knowledge yt is there. That are the hearing,
speaking, saying, smelling, feeling / also it is the barest of flesh /
therefore it is soonest altered of all ye other mebres / at this cause Gordon
preserved a man at Moutpyllier.x. years to be cast out, against the intention
of all other doctors there, because ye tokens appeared not in the face, yet it
did over all the other members. First than begyne at the height of ye heed,
behold his here his brows, pluck at them, loke if with ye rote they draw
any flesh by the rottenes corrupcyon of their flesh. Such by defaute of
nourysshynge is soon seen. Item feel with thy finger if his brows be not
grauellous, and full of grains, because that in al lepry the virtue
assymulatyfe defayleth. And for that cause when ye nourysshing comes to the
mebres they may not asseble them to the mebres at all / therefore they remain
grayny / the which thing mounts always next the members bare of flesh as
is the face. Than behold his even if they be round specyally to the domestyke
party. Also likewise if his ears be round thycke and rugged. Also if his
nosethyrlles be wide outward narow within gnawen. Also if his lyppes gumes are
foul stynkyng and corroded. Also if his voice be horse, and as he speaks in
ye nose. And also if his brethe and sweat stink, and all that comes fro him
/ and if there apere any straytnes of breath as if would querken / and for that
cause have the most haunt. Also if his loke be steyed and horrible in manner of
monster. These signs be vnyuocalles that always betoken lepry / when they are
all or the most part of them with the equyuocalles as it shall appear / and
such signs come in lepry by these causes as Auycen says. The first
generation of lepry is in the entrails, for that cause the lunges and lights
be hurt / the pipe of the voice assysteth it, and causes them to speak as it
were in the nose. And for the rotten and corrupt fumes yt mount upward by
the conductes of the brain, and the hears lessen and fall for defaute of good
fedynge. And they appear in the face and in the breast.

Of the equyuocalles tokens.
THe Doctoures put.vj. tokens equyuocalles. The first is hardness and
tuberosyte of the joints outward as the arms, legs, hands, and fete, for
the dry matter, that is stopped by melancholy. The second is a morfewe colour
derke ^or the black melancolyke humour that corrup^eth the blode. The third
is falling of hear, spoken of in the vnyuokes. The fourth is wasting of a
brawn, and chyefly of a poulce, so that when it ^s pynched it abides upright
by the consuption of the said muscle. The fifth is the insensybylyte of the
rotten humours of the outward parts ex^cemytees, spread within them. The.vj.
is black ^operous skal and scabbe in the face, and sores on the body by rotten
humours and corrupt, yt strive with ye evil fumosytees. The seventh is grains
under ye tongue, behind the ears / the causes are in the vnyuokes. The.viij.
is brenynge and feeling of pryckynges over all the body. The.ix. is ruggyshnes
of the skin in manner of a goose, for the great drythe of the blode and
humours. And therefore they ought to be vnclad water caste on them / and loke
if it take and synke in the skyne by cause of their drythe / where it seems
that they are anointed they seem so much to be fat. The.x. that they be of i'll
rule / and are commonly begylers. The.xj. that they have terryble dremes, as I
said before. The.xij. yt they have weyke pulses. The.xiij. they have white
vryne, thine, and asshy. The.xiiij. their blode is black and dusky^he, of
lady colour, and sandye / to se this it must be wasshen and strained.

The manner to let them blode, and to wasshe and strain it.
FYloyne saith, that there must be a great opening in the vein when they be
letten blode because the thycke blode should not remain and the thynne only
come out. And when it is drawn, consydre the substance and the colour if it be
so as is abouesayde, and than wasshe it, and pass it through a fair white
cloth / and than loke on the flesh that abides in the clout / and if it be
graueylous and troublous it is a great token. Otherwise take salt and meddle it
in the blode, and if it melt soon. Another way, take his vryne and vynegre /
and loke if they will myngle together. Yet do thus, put some of the blode in to
a basin full of water / and if it go down to the botome like meal it is a
token that he is a lazare.

Then good Cyrurgyen do not as a foolish jug that forthwith gives his
sentence / but first or thou give it prefer God before thine eyes / and
consydre diligently the vnyuocal signs and the equyuocalles, and se if they
agree / but yet neither judge a man to be lazarous by the equyuocalles / nor
for one or two of the vnyuocalles / nor by the least of the pryncypalles / but
there as the vnyuocalles in all or in the most part, and of the pryncypalles
accorde with ye equyuocalles of the most part / and of the pryncypalles.

FINIS.
Thus ends the manner for to examine lazares / and to approve their diseases
after the intention of Doctors.
Here begins the Formularye of the aids of apostemes and pustules ordained
at Parys by master Guydon of Cayllyac Cyrurgyen and doctor in medycynes at
Mount pyllier.
Because that after the doctrine of Galyen in tertio de ingenio sanitatis
likewise as of yt workman is the taking of the essence of the disease. Also
the science of things whereof it is given it behooves that it proceed of the
same / I than Antydotary ordynary in the science of apostemes whereby the local
remedies of the same apostemes shall be accomplished / but we must first
know the matter of the same. And that done may be food and chosen the
intention cutatyfe after the natures of them. And I say for certain that it is
right and artyfycyall way to work as it is proved in ye treatise before
alleged. Than I will put in this present formularye the knowledge of apostemes
the aids whereby may be given local remedies after the intention of Galyen,
Rasis, and Auycen, such as I can compryse in their doctrine. And merueyle you
not if I have not willed to publysshe this work, have kept it secrete. For it
hath not ben for pride / but for certain reasons which admonysshed me there to
because that the wepons that a man may beat down his enemies with all ought
not to be put in to their hands. For when one enforces his ennemye wytyngly,
it is no marvel if he fall in his own turn. Than take this little
Antydocary in worth. And that howbeit it coteyneth but a little / if God lend
me time and give me good fort^ne I shall perforce me to make it hole complete.
In the which shall be given doctrine and artificial manner for to ordre after
Rasis, Galyen, Albucrasis, and Auycen. And this present treatise shall have
four chapytres. The first shall be of the local remedies of hot apostemes.
The second of ye local remedies of pustules. The third shall be local
remedies of cold pustules. The.iiij. shall be of the exitures Rubrica, of yt
cures of hot apostemes. The cure of hot apostemes have.^ij. intencyons. The
first is to egal the matter an^cedent. The second to govern the matter
con^uncte. And the third is to abate the accydentes. As of the first and
third I hold my peace / but of the second whereby the matter conioynte is
go^erned is fulfilled by repercussyon at the beginning except in.x. cases /
which I leave as now because of bryefnes, with repercutis resolutis, and
maduratis, in the encreasyng, and with resolutis in ye estate, and with
dessicatis in ye declynynge.

THe local remedies that fulfil thentencyon of ye beginning be of three
forms. The first is Epitheme de Auicena. R.succi solatri, succi super vine,
aque ros{is}, acete an..i.fiat epithema. The second form is a plaster of
Sandal. de auicena. R. farine ordei..i.sandalis rubei psidie, acacie, sumac
an..ss. Epithema predicta {quod} sufficit fiat emplastrum. The third form is
cerot de.G.that Auycen aloweth / and is. R. Olei Ros..iiij. cere..i. fiat
vnguentum / and be it washed in cold water two or three times.

THe local remedies that accomplish thentencion of thencreasyng ben of.iij.
forms. The first is Epithina. R.vinum dulce. quart troy.i.aqua Ros. aceti an
quar. ss. croci..ij. infundantur per horam, et coleti / and make epitheme. The
second form is de volubili of Auycen / thus. R. malua{rum}. M.i. Ros.
abscinthij.an.. s. farine ordei..i.olei camomille, aque fabro{rum}, {quod}
sufficit ad decoquendum, fiat emplastrum in seething it on the fire. The third
form is Cerot of Camomyll. R.olei camomille, olei ross, an..ij. cere,.i, fiat
vnguentum.

THe local remedies that accoplysshe thestate are of three forms, The first
is de paritaria of master Dinus, R, paritaria, malue, an, M, i, camomille
aneti fenu greci, siminis lini an, s, olei vini albi, aque fabro{rum}, as much
as suffices to seth it make a plaster. The second form is diaqui^lon common
made thus. R. litargiri lib. s.olei comunis quar.iij. mustilaginis, altee,
fenugreci an quar.ij. fiat emplastrum cum custodia litargiri. The third form
is basilicon triafamarcum de.G. made thus. R.cere, resin, picis, spice, licij,
olei an.{quod} sussicit fiat vnguentum. And these two abouesayde have such
virtues than when they find matter ready to rypenesse they do maturate / and to
resolve, they resolve, And the remedies that accomplish thentencyon of the
declynacyon, be all things dissycatyues and consumynges of the matter / and
specyally dyapalma is much praised, and is of, G, in Cathegenis, and is made
thus, R, auxungie porci veteris, lib, ij, olei antiqui, lib, iij, litargiri,
lib, ij, Coperose quart, s, fiat emplastrum cum spatula de palma viridi, vel
^ane, vel iunipero, and apply it.

The second chapytre of the local remedies of hot pustules.
THe cure of hot pustules accomplyssheth three entencyons / but the first two
be left. The third is which is eagle, The matter antecedent hath two
intencyons, and ye other is after, before the vlceracyon first ought to be
mynystred medycyns that be cold, dyssycatyues, infrigidatyues, with some
repercucyon. And herto is the plaster of solatra and farnia order are well
allowed / and it belongs to colerykes. But for certainty unto sanguynes is
appropriate emplastrum of Arnoglossa / the form whereof is after, G, R,
Arnoglossa, M, i, lentisi quar, i, panis furfuris, quart, s, ros, aut gallaru,
as the faculte of ye matter is,, s, and be put with smyth water (as master
pilgrym saith, till it be thycke, And for the same is ye plaster of
pomogranato of Auycen proved expert in the one and other regyment, the form
thereof is thus, R, pomo{rum} granatorum, ij, seth them in veneygre or water
acetum put thereto. The gouernall accomplysshynge the intention after the
vlceracyon is to dry the rottenesse that is thycke and flesshy, blody, and
vyrulent / and after need to deffende the ambulacyon in the one and the other.
The rottenes dries with divers dissycatyues and are made dyuersly after the
dyuersyte of the case to thacomplysshyng of the said intention in five forms,
of the which. The first is vnguentum apostolico{rum} / of Auycen called
venera, and of Hebemesue / and is called the oyntement of Sarrazeos that
rectyfyeth the evil vlceres and woudes of ill consolydacyon and fystules, The
form whereof is, R, cere, resin, armoniaci, an., xxiiij, litargiri,, viij,
thuris, mirre, galbani, bedellij, Aristologie an,, v, floru eris, oppoponaci
an,, iij, olei comunis, lib.ij, In winter and somer, lib, ij, and do make an
oyntement, The second form is vnguentum Egiptiaru, and is put of Galyen and
Albucrasis / and is stronger, well proved at Boleyn, where it is used, R,
florum eris,, iiij, alumis, ij, aceti,, s, melles,, ij, make an oyntement, and
boyle it on the fire till it be thycke red. The third form is vnguentum
viride for the same intention, but it is stronger, and therefore Auycen
comaundeth it in the chapytre of hestiomeno / because that in clensynge, it
lets not the vlcere to grow large, and is made thus, R, floru eris,, s,
mellis,, ij, make an ointment and stir it on the fire, The, iiij, form is
trocisu aromatici that are put of Auycen and of Galyen, and in falling makes
crust, and opens with cantere, R, vitrioli, calcanti alumis, an,, s, corticis
granatorum,, x, gallarum,, v, aristologie, mirre, an,, s, put all to powdre /
and with sweet wine be well trocysked. Also the trocyskes of Caldaron, that are
called Affrodillorum of master Roger / the form of them are, R, calcis vine
partis, i, arcenici rubei et ^rini alkali, an, partis, s, let them be
encorporate ^e of affrodylles et fiani trocisci / and when the ^st is very
harde make it ^al with butter, Auycen couceleth to meddle a little sulp^ere with
butter. The ^yrulent dries and wastes with one of these, iij, dyssycatyues,
that folowen, Of the which the first (...) vnguentum litargiro, proved at all
exitures, (...), litargiri puluerizati vt alcofol,, ij, olei ros, lib, ^
aceti,, i, ducendo in morterio fiat vnguentum. The second form is vnguentum
de cerusa / ^ is approved of Rasis, to all fleyenges. R, ceruse, s, litargiri,,
ij, olei.ros,.iij.cere..s, de albu mib{us} ^uorum, ij, numero caphore,, i, make
an oyntement, The third form is vnguentum de calce, of, G, that is proved at
the barynge of synewes R, calcis, vine ^onies ablate et dissicate..i. olei
ros..iiij.cere albo..s.fiat vnguentu. The prohybycyon or deffendynge of the
vlceracyon is and ambulacyon is made with red ointment, made this wise.
R.baliarminaci..ij.terre sigillate,.i. aceti modicu, olei rosa{rum} {quod}
sufficit, fiat vnguetu.

The third chapitre wherein are accomplished the local remedies of cold
apostemes.
IN the cure of cold apostemes be.iij intencyons. The first is to eagle the
matter antecedent. The second is the conioynt matter. And ye third is to
correct ye accydentes / leave we the first. The second is to accomplish
with repercutyues in propres, that is not often / and with stiptyke resolutyues
for the most part, and for common workmanshyp. But for asmoche that the
materes are dyuyded in to hardness and softness, and resolve them by right way of
workynge, keeping the matter soft that it fall not in to rottenes / how be it
the soft matter hath an only intention / that is to wit to resolve. Therefore
shall I say in the sum of.xvij. Antydotes / that now are belonging to the
soft matter, and shortly to all cold maters, of the which some resolve some
mollyfy, and some do both. Therefore the dylygent workman, working the matter of
cold apostemes ought to wit to which resolucyon is due / and to which
mollyfycacyon, and to which both. The first Antydote, or the first form is
Epythime of liriniu of ashes / and is of.G.Ras. and Auycen / and competeth
proprely in vdimia, in apostemes mollified, whereby it appeases and resolves /
of the which the matter is thus. R.lexinium cineru, ^la^llatorum cinerum. vij.

of Auycen and Rasis Serapion proved in pains (...) joints of cold maters.
R.mirre, aloes, acas ^li^ij, ciperi, boliermenici, croci, an..s.fiat pul^s et

plaster that ^cyally avails against ye swelling of ye pains (...) the
joints. R.urine vacce, absinthij, abrotani, ^cenardi, calami aromatici, an..

olei antiqui {quod} sufficit, fiat emplastrum. The.x. form is emplastru de
semine vrtice, which Auycen saith resolves hardness in a weke and less, that
is in three days. And. G. puts in Cathagenorum. R.seminis vrtsce, seminis

emplastrum, ad modum dyaquylon.

The cure of the exitures.
THe cure of ye exitures hath four intencions. The first is to ripe the
matter. The second after the maduracyon to open it. The third is to purge the
place. The fourth is to dry it after the opening and clensynge. The first
intention accomplyssheth four forms. The first form is tetrafarmacu of.
G. that makes it with meal of wheat, saffron, water, and oil. The second
form is a plaster of malowes yt is made thus. R.radicis maluanisti
quar.ij.farini fenugreci, se minis lini an..i.auxungie porci..iiij.fiat
emplastru. The third form is a plaster of Tebes, that is propre to our
form. R, ceparu coctaru su^ pr^nis, iiij, numero frumenti quar, i, farini fe
nugreci,, i, auxungie porci, ij, fiat emplastrum, The fourth form is
dyaquilon and basilicon, and to the same intention is dyaquilon magnum
abouesayde,

THe second intention is accoplysshed by hot iron in vnsynewed places or by
blode suckers to such as be fearful, and by corosynes, in mean places ye
form whereof is dowble, The first form is a plaster of Galbanum that
opens the exitures of children, R, galbani,, i, fermenti,, s, stercoris
Columbi,, ij, mellis,, i, make your plaster and lay to it, The second form
is rupture that is made with lyme and soft soap, cum salina aliqualiter
pistata,

THe third intention is accoplysshed by three mundyfycacyons, The first is of
honny that is made thus, R, farine ordei,, i, incorpor^ndo cum mell rosato,
fiat emplastru, The second form is mundyfycatyfe with eggs, and is of
Auycen, R, vitellorum ouo{rum} numero, iij, mellis,, i, fenugreci {quod}
sufficit, fiat emplastru, The third is mundyfycatyse of Apio / and is propre
to ^ytures vnmadurate, because that in mundyfy^ng^ it madureth, and suffers
not to fystule, R, ^cci apij,, iiij, mell{is} optimi quar, i, farine frumeti,
i, incorporentur in patella ad ignem et tunc fiat emplastrum.

THe fourth intention accomplyssheth by the oyntement of calcadum / and is
dyapalma (...) as Auycen saith bathed with tow in vyney (...) as Galyen says
/ is the same that abides (...) our dyscrecyon in the agregacyon of local
remedies of apostemes, after as I may compryse by mine understanding, the
manner to make it I do ^aue to the wit of the workman, for I shulde be to lunge
/ and it is to presuppose that he knows it,

Here follows the Formularie of the helps of wounds and sores, ordained in
Auygnon by master Guydon of Cayllyac / cyrurgyen master in Physycke.
FOr doubt to forget, for the necessyte of mine own propre brother I will
show the remedies proprely localles whereby is healed the sores and dyrupcyons,
solucyons of contynuynge, after the doctrine of Galyen, Auycen, Rasis,
Albucrasis / and some masters that I have seen work, I intende to form
sumaryly, and abredge with the formulary of the apostemes and pustules that I
ordained of late at Parys, And because that, G, prince of Moges, in tertio
terapen, saith that the cure of vlceres hath two general intencyons, That is
to wit one taken in the essence of the disease / and the other for certain to
the nature of the membre / And therefore this preset treaty shall have two
parties, In the first shall be the propre forms of the helps in al simple
woude or sore in asmoche as a woude is simple, In the second party of woudes
composed,

The first Chapytre of the cure of wounds simple,
AL simple wounds after ye intention of Galyen in the place alleged ben new
wounds in the parties of ye flesh, that only requires consolydacyons
wounds after the agreement of al^ workmen hath four intencyons, The first is
to draw fro the woude yt ought to be drawn, The second to stanch the flux
of the blode, The third to the form of the wound, The fourth to dry it,
The first is to accomplish the wit of the workman in working, The second
accomplyssheth it by one of.viij, manners of blode staunchynge, after Galyen in
the fourth Canon, as by ^ood stytchynge, or by good byndyng, by convenable
dryeng, The aids to accomplish thyntencyon / that is to draw fro the wound
that is to be drawn (without the words of the Empe^ykes) be of three manners,
The first is a common instrument, (as is contained in ye great work, and ^ere
be named, viij,) that is to wit the tongues, The first is good red wine with
tow wet therein ^nd wrong laid on the wound, The second is ^mentum rubium
common, that is such, R, tera ^tyne lote quar, i, pulueris rubei dicti superius,
(...), misceantur, ley it on with tow, and a play^, for it dries, encarneth,
and conforteth.

The second Chapytre of wound composed,
THe wounds composed after the intention of Galyen aforesaid, be they yt have
sometime dysposycyons that require divers intencyons for their healynge. And
although it be that the dysposycyons that make composycyons in wounds be
sondry / nevertheless because of breuyte I will put here but the comunes /
that is to say the best known. The wounds are sometime composed with
unnatural matter / sometime with loss of substance / sometime vyrulent fraudelet
venymous fylthynes / sometime with fystule and canker / sometime with concussyon
apostemes. And sometime with pryckyng of synewes, and ache, and with superf^ue
flesh, and other like thing{is}. The help of composed wounds with loss of
flesh requires two things. First the regeneracyon of the flesh lost.
Secondly the consolidacion of ye flesh and the skin.

The regeneratyfe medycyns any mundyfyement, abstercyon be of.viij. forms.
THe first form and the second is v^guentum aureum that I make.
R.cere..v.resini quarti. i. Terebentyne lib.i. mellis quarti, i. thuris,
masticis, sarcacole, mirre, aloes cicotrini, ^ fiat vnguentu. The third form
is vnguentum aureum of Hebemesue / that is, R, cere citrine, ^, vt, olei boni,
lib, ij, terebentyne quar, ij. resin, colophonie, an..i.. s. croci,, s,
olibani, Masticis, an..i. et fiat vnguentu / for it bredeth fles^he,
conforteth, makes strong. The fourth form is the great basilicon that is
praised over all / and (...) called tetrafarmacum / and is of Galyen. It is
regeneratyfe of flesh, with rypynge purgynge, and is one of mine own making.
R. cere, resin, picis niger, cepi vaccini, olei cominis an, quarti, i, vel
quantum vis fundantur ad ignem, et fiat vnguentum. The fifth form is
vnguentum fuscum, of Nycolas, of Roger, of Iamerius, and of all Apotycaryes and
Barbers. R. olei lib, i,, s, cere,, iiij, Colophonie,, ii, picis nigre, cepi,
arietam an,, ij, fiat vnguentum. The syxthe form is vnguentum de lino that
Auycen and Hebumesue puts, which is, R, ^asure vetusce, pa^ni lini
bumundati, ^, oppopanici partis, ij, vini, mellis, olei to ^, an partis duas,
litargiri, aloes, sarcacole an, partis vnius fiat vnguentum. The seventh
form is emplastrum croceum made by master Peter de Bonaco, R, fenugreci,
partis, i, infundatur {per}.ix. dies in vino albo, donec tumescat, deinde tere
fortiter, cola addendo cepi hircini quart, iii, insimul teratur et coquantur,
et postea pinguedo et mustilago congregantur quibus addatur cere quart, i,
resin..ij. fundatur oia, et colentur, fiat emplastrum. The, viij, form is
vnguentum ^eruo ^, qualiter preciosum, taken in my comyne ^tulary, to heal all
woudes, R, arthemesie, sca^rose, aurum valens, absinthij, galbani, laceolate,

oia mundata a radicibus, et extra^itur succus, et cum lib.ij. auxugie porci, et
lib.i. cepi hircim et lib. iij. olei, et partis.i. mellis coquendo,
incorporando in mortario, et fiat vnguentu. And master Peter of Bonaco wrought

The fourth book of the Terapen^yke or Methode curatyfe of Claude Galyen Prince
of Medycynes / wherein is syngulerly treated the cure of woudes and sores.
Translated by me Robert Coplande. Anno. M. CCCCC.vlii. the.iiii, day of
February.
Philiatros the translator in to French to the Reader gretynge.
Friend dylygent redder, Quintylian in his first book of the Oratory instytution
recyteth howe Philosophy and eloquence are conjoined by nature, and vnyed
together by offyce and actyon. Nevertheless ye study of philosophy and
eloquence have ben seperate one from the other, such wise that the neclygence
of men hath made that they seem to be sondry acts, and divers scyences. And he
yields the reason wherefore. For sith that the tongue eloquence hath begone to
give it to the practyke. I say lucratyue exercytatyon, that men have abused the
goodness and graces of eloquence, they have forsaken and all holly left the
cure of virtues. And good manners, which is the very philosophy the which of
very propre n^e ought to be coiuncte with eloquence, in following the sentence
of Quintylian. I say likewise that the parties of the art of Medicine (yt is to
wit dyetityke, pharmaceutyke, and cyrurgery) ben such wise cowpled (...)
connexed together that in nowyse they can not be separated one fro the other
without the damage and great detriment of all the medicynall professyon. For
the one is helped, made perfyte, and consumed by the other. In such wise that
the one ^lteth, and stombleth without the other. How be (...) now a days I
wot not if it be by neclygence, or because of the lucratyfe practyse, where
the most part of Physicyens do study more than to the Theoryke, which is none
other thing but ye parfyte and entyer knowledge of dyseases and tem^ere^s of
mankynde bodies, with the facultees ^tues of the medycynes, whereof the
indycatyon ^atyfe is taken) the said parties of physyke is ^parated. Of the
which the first is abyden with ^e^ that ye vulgar people call Physyci^ns. The
^nde with the apotycaries, whereof they have ye ^me of pharmacopoles. And
the.iii. to the Cy^rgyens. So that the physycien (now) trusts ^all or
almoost to the apotycaries in the knowledge of simple medycyns the which are so
necessary that they can not well compose, nor well use the medycamentes sometime
composed without ye same. And as touching the Cyrurgery (which is but a
manual occupatyon) the physytions esteem it a thing to vile and unworthy of
their professyon. And not only ye said manual occupation the which Hipocrates
and Galyen have not shamed to treat of and to exercise, but also the Methode
to cure the vlceres and tumoures against nature, hath ben left by them in
such manner yt the Barbours and Cyrurgyens in these days are more ^tudyous
than many physytions. Which is the cause wherefore I have traducte out of latin
in to freche this fourth book of the methode of Galien moved of the great and
ardaunt desire that I have known among the said Cyrurgiens to have knowledge
of some things. Wherein I would desire gladly the grekysshe tongue or the
latin, because of the great payne taking in the translation, and also because
that every tongue hath his properte in such wise that many things can not be
sowned in the french speech, so well as they be written in the Greek or Latin,
prayeng the good reader take this my present writing in worth.

Here begins the.iiii. book of the Terapentyke, of claude Galyen prince of
Physycke.
VUe have said that there is a kind of disease, that is called solution of
cotynuyte, which comes in to all parties of the body of mankynde. Howbeit it
hath not one name in them al. For solutyon of cotynuyte in the flesshy part is
called vlcere, in the bone, fracture. The greeks call it catagma. In ye synewe,
conuulsion, the greeks cal it, spasma. There be other kinds of solutions of
continuite, that the greeks cal Apospasma, rhegma, and thlasma. That is to wit
thlasma in the ligament, Apospasma, and rhegma in the vessels and muscles,
because of any violent stroke or grievous fall, or any other great mocyon. The
solution of contynuyte called ecchymosis in greek comes most often with
concussyon and ruption. Sometime solution of cotynuyte comes by opera^yon of
the oryfices o^ the vessels, in greek named Anostomosis. Also (...) comes
because that the greeks call it dyapede^s. Other solutions of con^ynuyte
happens of e^oysion in greek called Anabrosis. But it is a dysposytyon already
meddled and composed with an other kind of disease that consists in the
quan^te of the parties, as before hath ben showed, (...) we have spoken of
holowe vlceres which ^ede of two causes, that is to wet of excysyon ^d of
eroysion. It is notorious in what man^r ^cysion comes. if eroysion habounde
inwardely ^s caused of catochimie. if outwardly it is done ^her by strong
medicine or by fire. It behooves ^hen as before is said to take heed dylygetly
and dysc^rne the simple dyseases fro the compound. For to a simple disease a
simple healynge is due, And ^o a composed disease a healynge vnsymple. Also we
have said before what Methode must be kept for to heal the composed dyseases.
Howbeit it is not enough to know the generalyte of the said Methode / but
behooves to be exercyced in all the parties thereof, saying that in the same is
need (by manner of speaking) of sondry partyculer Methodes, because yt every
kind of disease hath his own Methode. Than that which rests of of the
curatyon of vlceres must be performed in this book, taking the beginning
here. Every vlcere is ey^her simple and alone without other dysposytyon or
affectyon beginning with it, or precedent, or suvsegemet, or it is with some
other dysposycyon, or divers / whereof some have not all only excyted the said
vlcere, but have augmented it. The other are without the which the said vlcere
may not be cured / of them have we treated here before. We shall treat in this
present book the dysposycyons which augments the vlcere / in the which lies
double council of curacyon / that is to wit, either to take the said
dysposycyons all holly out of the body / or to surmout the incomodite that
abounds (...). The which thing may be easily done / if the dysposycyon be
little. But if it be great the vlcere may not come to cycatryce until that
remedy be put to the said disposycyon, whereby we must diligently consider what
the said affeccyons and dysposycyons be / and howe many in nombre, in taking
our beginning as is aforsaid. Every vlcere is be it alone or with holownesse
requires and demands that the flesh subject be natural / and that there
be nothing between the lyppes and extremytees that ought to be conglutynate /
which oftetymes happens, so that hear, a spider thread, matter, oil, or
such like thing lets the knyttyng. And those things are as symptoms and
accydentes of the said vlceres / which if they be present may hinder and let
the curacion, if they be not, they let not / but the dysposycyon of the flesh
subject is cause of that which follows. For with the same flesh / and by
the same the lyppes that were asonder are closed and the holownesse filled. It
beho^eth than that the said flesh be kyndely, because that these two things
may well comodyously (...) made parfyte. Than shall it be kyndly if it keep it
self temperatly / the which thing is common to all other parties. Whereby it
behooves that the flesh subject be holly temperate / as well to close ^he
viceres as to fill them with ^lesshe / but is it ^oughe of that? Must not the
blode that gathe^h to it be good also? and moderate in quatyte? (...) seems
thi^ to be true / for it lacks asmoch ^t the corrupt blode be as wholesome
for the clo^sge, and as to fulfil the flesh / as sometime it ^keth erosion
and exulcere the body. And if it be (...) habundaunt in quantyte it engenders
exe^ment in the sores / and as is aforesaid lets and hyndreth the curacyon.
And also there be three manners of vlceres dyffycyle for to be healed. The first
manner haboundeth by the vntemperaunce of the flesh subject. The second by
the vice and ill qualyte of the blode gatherynge to it. The third for the over
great measure and quantyte of the said blode. Ought not the dyuysyon to be made
thus? or otherwise / that is to wit the cause wherefore some vlceres are
stubburne and defycyle to be healed is for the mystemperaunce of ye flesh
vlcerate, or for the gathering of humours Yet again, the mystempered flesh
ought to be devised in two dyfferences. The first is when the subject flesh
is out of nature in an only qualyte. The second is when with the evil qualyte
it hath tumour against nature. The flowing of humours is dyuyded in two
dyfferences, that is to wit in the qualyte of gatherynge ye humours, in the
quantyte. Sometime divers of the said dysposytyons are meddled together, and
sometime all. But the Methode for to cure the all together ought not to be given
but each one by it self. As if the intemperance of the flesh be dry fylthy
moderate it with bathing, and wetynge in temperate water. But at all and as
many times that this remedy shall be used, the end of the bathing and wetynge
shall be forth with that the partycle becomes ruddy and rise in a lump. Than
seas yt bathing moystynge. For if ye bath it any more ye shall close the
humour again that was losed out, And so ye shall profit nothing. Like wise
the moystynge faculte of medycyns ought to be greater then it is commanded in
hole party if the flesh be more moyste, than natural habytude. Ye must have
regard to the contrary, for the faculte of medycyns ought to be desyceatyfe,
and in no wise to use any water. But if ye must wasshe the sore take wine or
posca, that is to say oxycraton, or the decoction of some sharpe herb.
Likewise ye shall cool the pride of the flesh that is to hot, and heate
that which is to cold. Ye shall know such vntemperaunces partly by the
colour, and partly by touching, and partly by feeling the diseased. For
sometime they feale great heate in the party, sometime manifest coldenes, delyte
them in hot or cold medycyns. And sometime appears rednes, and sometime
whytenesse. But it is an impertynent thing to this work to dystynke these
things. In the which work we show not the Methode to know the affectyons,
^ut for to heal them. In such wise that by one consequence of words, we be
come unto the said Methode to know the affectyons. Return we ^han to our
purpose. If any parties are vlcera^ with swellynge against kind, first the
swel^ynge must be cured, What ought to be the cura^yon of all swellynge we
shall say hereafter^ Pre^ntly we shall treat of which is couycte and comune
to the curatyons of unkind humours or swellynges with the vlceres. if the
lyppes of the vlceres are dyscoloured only, or somewhat hardened, they must be
cut unto hole flesh. But when such dysposycyon or affection hath to proceed
further / there must be had delyberacyon, to know if all the party dyscoloured
and hardened vnkyndly ought to be cut, or if it ought to be cured by lunge
space of time. And without any dowbte in such case it is necessary to know
the pacyentes will. For some had lever to be lunge in healynge than to suffer
incysyon. And other are ready to endure all thing{is} / so that they may be
soon healed. Likewise here shall be spoken of the curacyon of evil humours
that gathers in the parts of ye sore places, in as much, and because that
it is an humour gnawynge about succorosyfe. But in as much as it is a wicked
humour or over encreasynge in quantyte / the curing thereof shall be spoken of
in his own place. Than when the humours that gathers in the vlcerate parties
is not very fer of, nor in quantyte, nor qualyte, it behooves to dyuert drive
away, that is in restreynyng and to cool the heate of the parties that are
before the sore place. Like manner ye must begin the lygature at the vlcerate
party, in ledynge it toward the hole party / as Hyppocrates wills in the
fractour of bones. Also that the salves that are laid to the said vlceres
must be more vndryeng than they that are laid to a single sore. And if the flux
or renynge will not stop with salves, seek the cause of the said fluxyon, and
take it first away. If the fluxyon come by weykenes and feblenes of the party
that receives it, ye said weykenes must be cured. And such curacyon also shall
be propre for ye vlcerate party. But if cause of the said fluxyon haboude
either by over much blode, or fylthynesse of all the body, or of any of the
superyour parties, ye must first delay the said causes. The weykenes of the
party for the which gathers to much humour haboundeth holly of the
intemperancy. And not all together of intemperancy / whereof follows that the
vlcerate flesh is only intemperate / not weyke and feeble. And sometime
chances both the one and other, that is, both intemperate and weyke. For ye
great vntemperaunce is cause of the weykenes of pained party. The which
vntemperaucy shall be cured (as it is beforesayd) in coolynge the heate,
moystynge the dryth, warmyng the cold, dryeng the moist. And if the place be
to cold and moyste together / in warmyng and dryenge also together. And so of
the other vntemperaunces in doing away ever the qualyte that surmouteth by his
contrary qualyte. The reason is / every thing that behaves it well, is
according to nature / not only in quycke ^hynges, or plants, but also in all
other things, (...) moderate (which the Greeks cal symmetron) and without
excess of all vicious humours. For ^he thing wherfro nothing can be taken, nor
put ^o it, neither any party, nor any qualyte, it is all parfytely moderate.
Contraryly, the thing that must be taken fro, or somewhat put to it, is not in
a natural estate, where is not possible to return, but in doing away the
excess, and putting to it that it lacks. In an other place we shall speak
of the over much or lack of ye parties / but when any qualyte is over
excessyue, it is needful that the other qualite contrary be overcome. And that
the corrupcyon vntemperaucy be delayed, in restorynge the said qualyte that
was overcome. For in colyng that which was to hot, thou shalt restore that
which lacks / and dymynysshe that which was to much haboundant. Thus it is
necessary that the enracyon of the things that are put fer fro their natural
beynges, by some in temperacy be made by thing{is} of contrary vertne. And thus
the flesh / or any party thereof wherein is fluxyon because of weykenes, ought
to be cured in this manner. And when the intemperaucy is cured, heal the
vlcere. Curing the temperaucy as if it had come without vlcere. By the which
thing it is manifest that all such curacyon is not propre to vlcere, but to
intemperacy. Likewise if any corrupt fluxyon happen in the vlcerate parties /
as well by ye occasyon of any partycle as of all the body where the blode or
any ill humours do gather. First remedy must be had, either to the party that
is cause of ye fluxyon, or also to al the body. Thus than we shall heal first
the varyces that are often over the sore place / because that anon after we
may heal the soore. Likewise in them that have disease in the mylte, or of
any other notable party. First it behooves to cure the said party / and than
after we shall come to the curacyon of the sore or vlcere / howbeit none of ye
curacyons thereof is not propre unto an vlcere, but to some other affection and
dysposycyon, either that engenders vlcere, or that nouryssheth conserveth it.
Now it is time to make an end that no strange cause (or as it is now said)
the first judicial is iudycatryce of curacyon, but the curatyfe judicial
affection disease. But the things yt ought to be done particulerly are found,
either that the first judicial shows either of the nature of the sore party,
or of the temperauce of the air / and of other like things. For to speak
bryefly no indycacyon may be taken of things that be not yet parmanent. But
in as much as for to know a disease that is not evident by reason nor by wit,
we are often constrained to enquire of the extern and prymityfe cause. For this
occasion the vulgar means that the said prymytyfe cause is indycatyfe of
curacyon, the which is all other. As it appears clearly that may well parfytly
be known. For if ecchymosis, or vlcere, or erisipclas, or putryfaction, or
phlegmone be in any part, it a superflue thing to enquire the effycyent cause
of such ^yseases, but if it be yet present and remaining. ^or in this matter
we will heal that which is done all ready / and shulde prohybyte the effycyent
cause to proceed any ferther. And if the said effycyent cause which hath
produced the effect thereof hath no longer being, we shall do away the said
effect. For to do away the cause that is no more / it shulde not be possible
for us, when we would do it away, because that the curacyon appertains to the
thing present, as prouydence to the thing to come / but that which we fear
not that it may hurt neither for the present nor for the coming is out of both
the offyces of ye art, that is to wit, of curacyon and of prouydence. Wherefore
in such a thing ought to be no serchyng of any judicial, neither to cure nor
to purvey, but (as said is) the knowledge of the prymytyfe and extern cause
only vtyle in the dyseases to us unknown. Nevertheless the Empirykes take
sometime the prymytyfe cause as party of all the course of the disease (that is
called in Greek syndrome) wherein they have observed and experymeted the
curacyon / as in them that have ben hurt with a mad dog, or venymous beasts.
Thus doth also some Dogmatystes / which do affirm to heal such dyseases by
experience only without racyonall indicion / for they enquire the cause
prymytyfe as party of all the syndrome, and vnyuersall course. But the
prymytyfe cause serves nothing to the indicion of curing, although it be
vtyle to the knowledge of the disease, to them that have known the nature of
venymous beasts by use and experience, and thereof takes curatyfe indicion.
For put the case that I know that the venom of a Scorpyon be of a cold
nature. And for that cause as of a cold thing that I take indicacion of the
remedy, howbeit the case is such that I have no sign whereby I do understand
that the body is hurt of a scorpyon. It is manifest if that I know that ye
said body is hurt with a scorpion that I wold enforce me to warm all the body
/ and also the party stynged without abiding for any other experience in
taking mine indicion of the nature of the thing. For like as we have showed
in the book of medycamentes / wherein it behooves to be exercyted who soever
will take any fruit of these present comentaries. No such faculte can be
found with out experience. Sothely it should be a gyfte of fely ^yte so that
any having the sight of Litargiri, of Castoreum, or Cantiride forthwith to
vnderstade their virtues. But likewise as in all things is comytted error, as
well by excess, as by lack, so is it presently. For if they that afferme that
the virtues of medicamentes is not yet known / that after so great
experience. And the other yt esteem the said virtues to be known by one
experience ^lone, do gainsay each other. For the first speak ^er lightly and
to iprudently, if it be iprudence to afferme a thing impossible, and the other
are all together stupydes, sturdy, lytygious. But for this present time we will
say no more, because I have spoken more plainly in ye third book of
temperamentes / and also in the book of medycamentes. Nevertheless for
knowledge of ye diseases some prymytyfe causes are proffytable / but after yt
the present disease is all together known / than the cause prymytyfe is
totally vnutyle. Now have we abouesayd / that it behooves not to meddle and
confound both the doctrynes together / but the emperyke ought to treat by it
self / the rational also by it self. We must now call to mind (because we
have preposed in these present comentaryes) to treat all only the doctrine
rational. Albeit that to some thing{is} that we say we do not add that them
all and absolutely be not true, but only after the sentence of the Methodyke
sect / howbeit every one of himself ought to reason it, and for to add it.
And at this present time we have added that any cause extern and prymytyfe is
profytable to the indicacion curatyfe / albeit that it serves well to the
knowledge of the disease. And we confess that the cause prymytyfe is a party of
the syndrome, and of all the emperykes course is that they cure all dyseases, by
reason or by experience. But in all that we will say hereafter it shall not be
necessary to add such words. Than let us return to our first purpose in
taking the pryncyple certain and vndowbtfull / whereof also we have used
heretofore / there as we have said that the disease that requires to be cured
jugs the end whereunto the Cyrurgien ought to entende / and of the same all
other indications ben taken / whereby ye may understand pryncypally of the
vlceres, whereof we have begone to speak, that the said indication hath no manner
of societe with the cause prymytyfe. For put we the case that any vlcere be
come of a fluxyon in any party than it is manifest that ye said vlcere
proceeds of corrupt humours / for nature is wont for to do so in dyseases /
when she purges the body she sends all the corrupcyon to the skin / in
such a manner that the said skin is vlcerate / all the body purged. What is
than the curacyon of such vlceres? Certainly as of other vlceres wherein no
corrupt affec^ion or disposition (that the Greeks call Cacoctes) is adjoined.
And if it be so, it is evident yt none indication is taken of the cause that
hath excited and made the vlcere. But if the vicious humour remained some
indication might be taken of the said cause / or otherwise it shulde be a deaf
thing that yt thing which is no more being shulde require curacyon^ Or if
any thing judged and showed curacyon / where there no manner of ^de. Wherefore
it is a strange thing / all ho^e against reason to say that the indication
cura^fe ought to be taken of the cause extern prymy^yfe. And for because that
the said indication (...) not taken of the same cause / it is evident that
(...) ought to be taken of the cause that is present. But what is such
indication fyna^y? Certainly who that shulde well and pr^prely speak / it is
^hat thing that belongs to providence, who so would be abused with the
vocable. The greeks cal it Prophylactice. For ye curation of vlceres either
being only single vlceres, or being with holownesse (if ye esteem and consydre
diligently) is parfyte in eschewynge and foreseing the thing{is} that may annoy
nature. And the sum in effect when all is done, it is the work of nature, as
is closing of a sore vlcere / and regeneracyon of flesh. In the which
things belongs all the cure to that part of the art medycynall / that is
called Prophylactyce in Greek / yt is to say prouydence / although that
vulgaryly it hight, healynge. And therefore this party that is named prouydence
is divided in to two kinds. The first is it that doth a way the disease that
is present. And the other with stadeth the disease that is not yet in estate.
Thus the yonge leaches understand not that their contencyon and dysputynges is
of names. How be it that if they were studyous of things / they should invent
and know that there be two first dyfferences of the functions and actions of
medicine. That is to wit, either to cure heal the dyseases all ready grievous /
or to let and withstade them that are not yet present. Than is there no man but
he will say that to cure and to heal is none other thing / but to do away
the diseases all ready present and grievous / be it but that is done in doing
away the things that do let the work of nature, or by medycamentes. But
prouydence is none other thing but to let that the said dyseases come not.
And certainly they that by reason Methode admynyster the art of medicine do
cure y^ vlceres that come before of corrupt humours / in purgynge the said
humours / and also in doing away the things that lets the work of nature.
And proprely to say these two manners of curing are called Prophilactykes in
Greek. For they let (as is aforesaid) that the fylthynes engenders not at the
sore / or over much moyste corruption. It behooves not than thus miserably to
strive of the names. But rather it is more convenient to give some good Methode
to cure the vlceres, such as I have given (after my iugement) as well in the
book precedent as in this. But I merueyle me much of the ^ole hardiness of
Thessalus writing so of the curacyon of vlceres, that is named Cacocthe that
is to say wicked. The comuny^es of vlceres that last lunge time that are
uncurable / or that return after the cycatryce induct ben very necessary, in
likewise as in vlceres that may not grow together and be closed. It must be
esteemed what is the cause that lets and pro^yteth the said cleuyng, or
growing together / (...) which cause ought to be done away. But in ^hem that
renew ye cycatryce induct / it behooves ^o keep ye said cycatryce, that is to
wit in strength (...) confortynge the suffrynge membre / or all the ^ody in
comune / and in ordrynge it that it endure ^at lightly, by the remedies
appropryate thereto. And after that Thessalus hath proposed such words in the
beginning of his book of Cyrur^ery, he writes afterward more plainly of this
matter, in this wise. The vlceres that endure lunge, that may not be healed, or
that renew and come again after the cycatryce, give such indications. That
is to wit / in them come not to cycatryce, it behooves the letting{is} of the
vnyon and coalescence / and renew the vlcerate place. And after that ye have
made it like unto a fresshe wound / it must be healed again as a bledynge
vlcere. And if the said cure profit in nothing, ye ought to mytygate
thynflamation / and make all other dylygence. But the vlceres that come to
closing and open again in ye acts and outward sores / ye ought to heal
them, like unto the where there is fresshe brennynge. And afterward ye ought to
lay upon the said vlceres a plaster made of mytygant things, until that the
ire and fyersnesse be abated. After this done ye ought to help to dress the
cycatryce. And than that ye make the parties about it wax read / in wrappyng
it about with a malagme (that is to wit a salve malactyke) the which is made
of Mustard / or with some other medycament that may change the said parties,
and make them to be the less subject to disease. And if they cease not i this
manner / ye ought to have cure of all the body / in strengthyng it with divers
exercytacyons, iestynges, and vociferacions, in comyttynge them that keep him
to such things. Also by manner of living, dymynuyng, or augmentyng by degrees /
in beginning at vomytynge made by Rayfortz. Ye shall also use white Elebore,
and all other things, whereof we use in dysseases and dyffycyle to do away that
are subject to reason and manner of living / behold here the saying of
Thessalus. Now we must esteem the stupydyte or audacyte of the man. I say the
stupidite if he think to say well / and the boldness if he foal him self
culpable to say nothing. And by this means hops to abuse and deceive the
readers. But tell me Thessalus / what is the indicacyon curatyfe taken of old
sores? In good soth I never found curation that was indicate and showed of the
old vlceres, nor of new, nor also of the time in what disease that it be / but
of the affection dysposycion that I have purposed to heal. For totally if we
regard time / as if the indycacyon cura^fe were taken of it, the second day
we should give all other indication than the third. And likewise to give
the.iiij. day another, than the.v. and so of the.vj. and all other days
following. And by ^he mean we shall no more consydre the dyseases that we cure.
And the indication shall no more be ^ken of them / whereby we could never
think a ^aunger reason. Howe than are the comunytees (...) vlceres necessary
that endure a great while, se^g that ye time of it self can indicate in
nothyn^ For when one vlcere is with erosyon, that co^eth of evil humours / we
shall not take for that ^he months after another indication, but that which
we have taken at the very beginning, and for a troth I will not parmit that
such an vlcere should abide lunge time / but at the first I would take the
cause thereof away. For it is leful ye most often to knowledge the disease at
the beginning, and it is necessary that the indication be taken of the said
disease. But I can not coniect what may show and ensygne the time more than
the nombre of days, but that Thessalus will say that to have knowledge of
such vlceres / we must tarry the time / but in such a manner he should be an ydyot
all together. That is to wit, if he confess openly that of other thing the
indication curatyfe is taken / and of other the knowledge of the disease. For
although that the time serves somewhat to yt disease / nevertheless the
indication curatyfe is not taken of the time. But whereof serves it if any
vlcere be inveterate, to do away that which lets the coition and
coalescence, and to renew the place that is pained? For a man inepte if by a
fylthy fluxyon (that the Greeks cal cacoethe) the lyppes are disposed in such
or such manner / what shalt thou proffyte if thou cut it before thou hast
provided to stop ye fluxyon? That is to wit / thou shalt make the vlcere wyder
than it is / as some do that cure vlceres in the same manner / because that as
lunge as the cause lasts that before made the vlceres harde and flynty. Other
thing shall not come of thexcysyon of the said vlceres but amplyfycacion. For
them that thou cut shall be again as hard and stony as they were before,
albeit that the prudent and wise Thessalus (God knows) hath not added this
word, that is to wit, that the party of the vlcere that is stony and harde
vncoloured ought to be cut, but comaudeth by absolute sentence and diffynytife,
that we ought to cut that which lets the closing of the vlcere, and renew
it, if he counceled to do away ye causes that let and hyndre the agglutynacyon.
And that this reason and manner were antyke I wold not excuse him. For it is a
precept and commandment almost of all the auncyent masters / which have
written by any reason and Methode of the cure of vlceres that it behooves to do
away the effycyent causes of the said vlceres, like as of al other sores, ^or
to say that in vlceres the cause effycyent must (...) first done away, not in
other diseases, it were of no purpose. But totally in all dyseases wherein the
effycyent cause remains styll, it behooves to begin the curacyon at the same
cause. And if the ^ayd Thessalus hath left to tel all the causes that let the
coition and conglutination, that he hath ^nely spoken of the labyes (as he hath
showed af^warde) it appears that he ignoreth, more than (...) knows not what
belongs to the curacyon (...) vlceres. For it is possible that the same cause
(...) alone, wherefore the vlcere may not be cured, as (...) said the
intemperancy that is in the vlcerate ^tyes, without any tumour against nature
may (...) the cause. It is also possible that the said intemperancy be
coniunct with tumour, the which natwithstandyng requires not al together that
the labyes shulde be cut. It may so be that varix / that is to say a swolle
vain that is above it may be the cause, or that the mylte is augmented, or
some disease of the liver, or the weykenes of the party grieved, the which is
none other thing but a clear and notable vntemperatnes, or evil and vicious
humour in all the body that the Greeks call Cacochynne. The which is the
greatest cause of all them that may vnproffyte and annoy in the vlceres. As
much also may grieve the vlceres the superhaboundaunce of humours egal to the
same that the Greeks cal Phethora. If Thessalus command to do away every of
these causes above said, I allow him, as he that consents and is conformed
to the auncyent{is}. But also if he be not of the opynyon that only the labyes
should be done away, I say that of many thing{is} he hath known one alone,
which is so evident that the shepeherdes are not ygnoraunt thereof. For if a
shepeherde saw the labies of a sore, harde, flynty, wan, and black, or of any
other notable vice of colour, he wold have no dowbte for to cut it. Than for to
cut is a ready and easy thing / but for to heal by medycamentes is a greater
thing / that requires workemanshyp. Nevertheless Thessalus never knew what
the labyes are that may be softened by medicament{is}. For all confess that he
hath swerued from this party of the art. And thus (as him self shows) it
seems that he had never experience nor rational science of any medicamet{is},
which is a manifest thing of the book that he hath made of medycamentes. But
to the process of this work we shall treat of the passages whic^ he hath not
written well.

ANd now we will dyspose us with delyberacyon to speak of the curacyon of
inveterate vlceres, the which he hath treated in saying aforesaid. Certainly
it had ben better to have called them Cacoethe, that is to say wicked, and not
inneterate, and than declare their nature, and expos^ the cause of their
generation, and curacyon of each of them. That is to wit, first the comune
cu^acion of al vlceres, in asmoche as they be vlceres, ^e which I have written
in the third book next ^fter the partyculer and propre curacyon of each of
them, after the kind of the effycyent cause, as I have taught in this present
book. And howbeit ^at Thessalus hath done nothing of all these ^nges, yet he
esteems yt the vlcerate place must ^ewed. Than when yt it is made as a fresshe
^nde, to heal it as a blody raw vlcere, what (...) / if he be exercysed in
the works of the art (...) understands not evidently that such do^ hath
ben written by him that never healed (...) Is it possible that any may heal a
inue^e vlcere as it that is cruent and full of blode, (...) y^ he hath made it
like a fresshe wound? shall (...) in drawing the labyes of the vlcere together
by rolls, or ioynynge them by stytches, or sooner neither by the one nor the
other / but by medycament apt and convenable in vlceres cruent blody with
lygature? What is he that knows not that an vlcere Cacoethes is caued, saying
that it is made by erosyon? Is it possible than (O fool and imprudent
Thessalus) that an vlcere caued may grow together and be agglutynate before
that the cauyte be replete with flesh? Is not that to cure an vlcere as a
grene woude? Than hast thou written in vain / that ye indicacyon to cure caued
vlceres is not closing, but fyllynge. And howbeit that every vlcere Cacoethes
and wicked were not caued of it self and of the own nature / nevertheless when
it is made as cruent in cuttynge the labyes (as thou comaundest) necessarily it
is made caued / and acquyreth right great dystaunce of labyes / in such manner
that I can not se howe thou may conglutyue it and make close as that which
is cruent. For if thou assay to approach them by force and violence, the labyes
that are fer asonder, is of necessyte that there come a phlegmon / and also the
said labyes may not mete and close together, which as me seems is only to be
under stand of Thessalus. Than afterward he adds these words / if the
vlceres be not bound yt thou mytygate the phlegmon. For it is necessary that
they be not vynculate / but because that the same also be give to Thessalus,
and that we pass over without so curious examynacyon. It is evident to every
one that he follows not the comunyte that him self hath given. For if we take
y^ which let^th we shall take no more any thing of the comunyte of inveterate
vlceres, in asmoche as they be such. Natwithstandynge this, put we the case
that it be so, and let us se what follows. Thessalus writes in this manner.
The vlceres that come to cycatryce, and open again shall be healed in the
acceys and vlceracyon / in such manner as they that lately have be vexed grieved
by phlegmon. Than after he saith / ye must cause readnes to come to ye parties
that are about it by a plaster, that is to say reuollytyfe, which is made
of mustard sede. What say thou made foal? if the fluxyon be bitter and hot,
must the party be made read with mustard sede? In such wise yt that which
the said party ought to have of the fluxion ^t shall obtain forthwith by thy
salve? That is, ^hat it be all vlcerate and read. For the auncyen^ made the
weykenesses of ye parties that was ^me of cold, or habundauce of humour
without ^anyfest heate in making read them. But thou (...) rubryfycacyon in
all sores. First without ma^ any difference, if the vlcere be not cured ey^ by
the weykenes of the party, or by the ma^ of the fluxyon, than thou tournest
the ordre. (...) after that thou hast brent ye party by mustar^, and hast
proffyted in nothing, than thou (...) to the curacyon of all the body.
How be it ^t after my judgment, all the countries be ordained and stablysshed
in such things, as well by reason as by experience. That is to wit that all
the body be first emptied of supfluytees, or that any dare admynyster any
bitter or hot medytament to the party. For all those medycamentes draw unto
them from all the body like unto the cucurbitule, that is to say ventose or
boxyng. And thus if thou do not empty first all the body thou shalt leave
matter of fluxyon to the bitter medycament / which thing the emperyke confess
/ and so do the dogmatistes, the most auncyent doctors have esteemed it so. For
in as much as Thessalus hath made mention of them, it shall be no strange
thing to cite and allege them as wytnesses. That is not leafull to heal the
eye well before all the rest of the head, nor the head before all the body.
Such was y^ sentence of Arystotyll Plato in the curacyon of dyseases. Likewise
of Hypocrates, Dyocles, Praxagoras, and Plistonicus / but Thessalus alone
gaynsayth this opynyon / and comes first to the composycyon of mustard / and
than he hath sollycytude of all the body / without showing any thing wisely.
For as if it were lefull after to have ones purged all the body / forthwith to
fed it with wholesome and good meates, of vocyferacyons, and exercytacyons, and
of iestynges / and of the manner of change of living / by certain cyrcuytes
and acts. Than of the vomytes made by Rayffortz / and for sum and conclusion
he hath ordained the elebora. It is him self that hath promised to heal al
diseases easily, but I can not understand howe that any hath so well healed,
either in more longer space of time, or by more vnprofytable labour. Now than
like as we have seen by usage and experience / put we the case that there be
any to whom it behooves to cure an vlcere malygne and Cacoethes / put we the
case also that there is any other that is in health / but because he hath
scratched himself in any party, as on the arm, and suddenly is risen a blister
or pustule. Than within a while after there comes an ytche to the party / and
after the pustule is broken there comes an vlcere dyscoloured with fre^yng
vnegally / and that such things is come in. iiii. days fro the beginning. To
this purpose let the master Thessalyen answer me / in what ma^r it behooves
to heal such an vlcere. I call it ^ntyerly malygne cacoethes. And therefore
forth ^th I will consider what is the disposycyon and ^fe^ion of al the body.
For I will invent of what ^de the humour superflue shall be; as well by the
^mptomes of ye vlcere / as by the signs of all the (...). Than forthwith I
will purge the said su^e humour / without taryeng yt all y^ elbow of y^ ^ent get
any disease / stoburne wayward to ^yon. But the sectatours of Thessalus / that
(...) wit they that observe his precept{is} will tarry (...) vlcere be old,
because it may return to (...) wondrous, and marvelous comunyte of in^rate
vlceres, as if it were not much better to ^howe the comunyte of contumace
wayward vlceres / the which wold indyke the curacyon, and not of the
inveterate vlceres. Afterward y^ said Thessalyes wold do one of both / either
they wold cut the vlcere and make it as it were fresshe, and approach the
parties as for to knyt them, or else they would first use of the salve that
is made of mustard. And all that proffite not, they will have their refuge to
vocyferacyons, gestacyons, and other exercytacyons, and to the manner of living
that changes by cyrcuytes / and after they will move vomytynge by rayffert /
and if the vlcere be not cured by such things they mynystre elebore called
veratra in latin. And if the elebore serve of nothing / they send the pacyent
in to Lybie for the change of air, undoubtedly Thessalus ought to add this
word. After this excellent and synguler curacyon of froward and rebel
vlceres. For of troth the Thessalyens stay in vocyferacyons, gestacy^ns, other
like things, as if they should cover the evil habytude of the body (which the
Greeks call Cachexte) and not the vice of the humour (that the Greeks cal
Cacochymie) Is it not merueyle if they confess not to know the vlcere
Cacoethes as soon as it is made / and that they tarry till it be old? And that
often they use cyca^ryce / and open many times or they understand what to do?
saying also that they counceyll them that have the fevers in what manner soever
it be / to pass the excess that ought to come the third day or no? God
knows howe they have well and parfytly known the contemplacyon of the Cryse,
and in what manner they may fore ^e the great encreasynge of the sore. What
comes thereof most often? Of a certainty it comes that the pacyent{is}
abides in their beds / and consume through their default / which might
have ben healed the second day. Of a truth not ones, or twyes, or thryes
lonely, but.vj.C. times have we washed many febricitans incontinent after y^
first acts, which we have seen done by our preceptours and masters. And
consequetly have permytted them to live without fear in their manner
accustomed, as they that should no more have the fever, whom wise Thessalus that
hath exigited ye first dyete, that is to wit not to eat in three days should
ha^e dried up and consumed in making them starve for hungre in three days loge.
Than as I coniect he would fed them a little on the fourth day / and ^o
nourysshe them by little and little / in such wise th^t the.vj. or.vij. day they
should scantly be able to (...) about their customable besynes, they that ne^
had the fever but ones only. Of troth he co^med his pacyentes always in their
dyseases / the ^iche right easily might have ben helped. For (...) so were that
the vlcere began to swell at ye be^nyng, it might have ben helped in few days,
^hessalus would suffer it to rene a year or more. (...) tarried often so long
till the said vlcere often ^e produced cycatryce / and would often open it to
wit if it were contumaced. Than after that he had begone ye curacyon he purges
not forthwith the body, but first of all used his salve of mustard, and than
his Jests, vocyferacyon, certain manners of living, than his vomyte of
rayffort. And fynably of the Elebore what it is? any other thing than to lyngre
a hole year? That is to wit (by the living god) when the patient may be healed
in.vj. days or in.vij. at the most / shulde we prolong a month to know if
the vlcere be Cacoethes and wicked / and than that we shulde begin the
curacyon? But what necessyte was it to speak of the propre comunyte of vlceres
iueterate, saying that they are mutyle in the curacyon / albe it that it were
lefull to write, not of the comunyte indicatryce, but of the curacyon of
vlceres, not inveterate, but contumaced and rebel. For it happens that some
vlceres and diseases are contumacy and rebellyon to heal. Howbeit indicacyon
curatyfe is not taken of this contumacy and rebellyon. But it is the disease
that gives the first indicacyon of healing. And of the said first indycacyon
are found the remedies as I have declared. That is the manner to heal by
Methode, as that we do in following the auncyentes, if it so be that Methode is
an vnyuersall way, which is coming to all partytuler things. Here is Thessalus
be gyled, for he weueth that all y^ knowledge of them that do any thing by
Methode, is Methode / surely it behooves that he that doth any thing by Methode
have notyce and knowledge of the like and unlike. Nevertheless that is not
Methode / that is ^o wit the said notyce of like and unlike. Also Arystotyll
and Platon affermeth it not / which Thessalus dare falsely allege. But at
this time is not convenient to reffute reprove such purposes / wherefore I will
return again unto the Methode curatyfe, promyttyng to show that there is a
pryncyple of Methode in all curacions, and that the way that ledeth fro this
pryncyple to the end is semblable in all partyculer things, where by (albeit
that in all dyseases it seems that there is one propre and pryue Methode to
heal) nevertheless in all things there is one comyn gendre / for it behooves
always to begin at the indycacyon that is taken of the disease that we entende
to heal. And than we must esteem and dyscerne if the cause of the disease be
ceased a ready, or yet presently it augments makes the said disease. If the
said cause be already ceased, we must come so ye Methode whereof hath ben
treated in ye third book of this work. But if the said cause yet presently
make the disease, the Methode is treated in the.iiij. book. By the which
Methode thou shalt find the remedies of a phlegmon and of a ^euer, and shortly
to speak of all maladies. That ^s to wit, if nothing is done, thou shalt not
take ^ayne to enquire the precedent causes / but shalt begin only at the
disease. But if any thing be done presently thou shalt prepose two fynalytees
of curacyon. And than do the other things by order, as it is said. Now it
behooves to merueyl of Thessalus dyscyples / not for because they fail in such
things, but because they do use these names, Dyspathies, Metasyncrises,
Imbecyllitees, ^yrmytudes, and sondry other such names. And if ye questyon them
what such names mean / they wot not what to answer. For to know what it
sygnyfyeth that they call in all inveterate vlceres Metasyncrynien ten exu in
Greek / they answer not with one accorde, nor clearly, nor prudently, if that
it were an ancient name, or usurped by any of the Greeks, at adventure we
might understand of that they have written, what thing it sygnyfyeth. But
because it is a propre name unto their stupydite, that is to wit, that is come
of the supposycyon and Hypothese of Asclepiades like as their other decrees, is
it not then just reasonable that they iustyfy their dreams? That is to wit,
from whens this that is said Syncrinestai ta somata ^ai diacrinestai. As ye
would said meddle dyuyde the body. And that it were only leafull to usurp
such names, to them that call and constytute the little body Atoms, and the
poores, and conduytes or the indiuidnes, vacuyte. And fynably the impatable and
inalterable things to be the first elements. As that for certain they
usurp and continually use such manners. Moreover Thessalus in his Canon when he
confermeth the pryncyples renews some thing beside that which was put in
writing by Themyson and Asclepiades / and ensigneth clearly what he will say,
for he hath not esteemed all together as As^epiades. That is to wit euyn in such
wise as in Symmetrye, that is to say, that in competent and comoderacyon of
small conduits lies and consists the health. And in Ametrie, that is to say
/ in vncompetence and immoderacyon in them the disease. Also that curacyon or
sanacyon is none other thing but a return to the first symmetrye or
comoderacyon of the said conduytes / but he weans that all the state and
condition of the said conduytes must be changed. And of this opynyon is
proceeded ye name of Metasyncresis, which may sygnyfy as much as Metaporopoesis
in Greek. That is to say, mutacyon of the state of pores small conduytes.
Howbeit it was not leful for him to use the name of Dogmatystes, in places
where he comaundeth to eschew the uncertain and dark names only have the
understanding attentyfe in the comunytees which appear evidently. Than his
dyscyples and servants answer that he must not be herd as a dogmatyke / when
he uses of these names, Mais alephos, that is to say, symply. For of a troth
some of his dyscyples are accustomed to sustain and defend him in this manner
/ in reuokynge us again to another name, that is Arphi^a, which we translate,
symplenes. The which name (of a troth) I can understand what it sygnyfyeth.
For if he did send us again to a name more vain (that is in Greek vioticos)
the which they expose doth signyfy as much as semblably to the vulgar of men.
Truly as much should it be to say Aphelos not duly nor ryghtwysly / but
without art or science. For the men that are the most lyghtest and quycke of
speech use names of arts and sciences, under some sense that hath no
foundacyon. And when they are demanded what they mene, they can neither tell
nor show. The which thing th^se Thessalyens confess to be their decent
custom, the which thing we do object them, and for certain they will also
confess that they understand not partfytly exactly what is Metasyncrysis, if
it be said of ye mutacyon of poores, that in Greek is called Poropoia, in dede
it shulde have some understanding, and sygnyfy somewhat, but vain in many
manners, because that our bodies are not composed of corpules motes / nor of
poores. And if they were true, yet shulde it not be possible to show in what
manner Mustard might change or alter the state condition of the poores. And if
any can show it, yet should he not be consenting and confermed to their sect,
saying that they say, to be content with the apparent comunitees, whereby that
they use no more such names, and that they hyndre and let us no more, for it is
leaful without the name of Metasyncrysis, to say in other words the curacyon
of froward vlcere^, as the Emperykes do. Also we have showed in the second
book, howe the said Thessalyens ar^ likewise abuse at the vocable Atonias,
that is to say, Imbecilite, for they take the name as the emperykes, for it
sygnyfyeth none other thing, but that the actions is not kept. But if they
propose that there is any facultees and virtues that governs man, which we
afferme, and almost all the auncyentes, besides that they gainsay to the
precepts of Asclepiades, they propose uncertain things, of the which the
Auctours agree not well together / how be it they command to fly such things.
But tell me Thessale clearly, what bet^keneth this vocable Metasycresem? if
thou say that it betokens to change the poores small conduytes, thou
begylest thy self, and usurp uncertain things / if thou say that it is as
much to say, as to yield the party of ye body steadfast and hole, or al the
man, thou say no more to this purpose than the Emperykes, except the nowne.
For they know well that man becomes hole by other remedies, but they know not
by what cause and reason the remedies restore health. For none of the Emperyke
can tell if the faculte of medycament changes the poores / nor if it make
symmetry and comoderacyon / nor if it alters the qualyte of the pacyent
party, howbeit the Emperykes are discrete if they say yt they know only one
thing, that is to wit, if they have noted and observed often times, that
vtylyte hath followed when ye me^ycament of Mustard hath be mynystred to such a
sore, and in such time. Nevertheless they speak not of Methode, nor reyse their
brows at it. And be not pleased with such notyce, and myssaye not the
auncyentes, nor dysprayse not Hyppocrates, not estemynge him as nothing / but
they allow him and afferme that he hath said all verytable things. But if
Thessalus here that myspryseth Hypocrates, and al the other masters,
understands not that all the precepts that he hath written of the froward
and rebel vlceres ben Emperykes. Albeit if he wrote them well comodiously it
shulde be somewhat profytable / but it appears not that he hath done so / saying
that he parnerted the ordre of remedies / and used remedies for the party, or
that al the body was prepared. In good soth it is a sign and argument of an
untaught and great ygnoraunce (saying that in this thing almost all the
masters of medicine do agree, albeit that in sondry thing{is} they jar) that
is to wit, that all the body must be emptied and purged of all his out
waxynges, or that any party be take subject to the strong and vehement
remedies. For who soever would judge, either by experience or by reason (for
there is none other third manner to judge, nor in what art soever it be, nor
in any party of life) he shall find yt it is a great incomodyte to mynystre
to ye sore party any salve or plaster that is bitter and hot, or he provides
for all the body, which first requires his propre cure. For the said
medycamet draws to it from all the body in ye manner as cucurbyte and ventose
doth the excrementes and superfluytees. And so it cleueth and stycketh to the
said party grieved and sore, in such wise that with great payne it may be
scantly pulled of. Wherefore it must be asked of these Thessaly^ns, from wkens
ye said fantasy came to Thessalus to write fables and toys, as touching the
curacyon of froward and rebel vlceres, saying that none Emperyke, nor
racyonall hath so written before. Albeit neither Thessalus, nor any of his
dyscyples and sectatours dare not afferme that such ordres or remedies do agree
with expexyece or with reason. Moreover they can not show in what manner of time
indyke and not the disease, nor also (that is yet more) howe Th^ssalus is not
all holly foolish and dull, that judges that the cause must be esteemed yt
lets and kyndreth the cycatryce of vlceres, the which cause is to be done
away / and likewise sees not that it suffices, and that ye length of time of
vlceres s^rueth of nothing / with this he considers not that he must do
thus, not only in vlceres, but also in all other dyseases, as the auncyentes
do admonysshe. But they answer nothing to these purposes, but that they say
always, that we do not understand them well, as if they knew parfytely ye
thought of Hyppocrates, and of all the auncyentes. And afferme that Thessalus
hath a good opynyon when he saith that there is a comunyte of ye inveterate
vlceres, and that Hyppocrates understood it so in the book of vlceres, which
writes in this manner. It is profytable that the blode do flow continually
from ye old sores, in what manner that it hath ben seen needful. At all
adventures than what may come to speak somaryly of the sentence and
intelligence of Hyppocrates, though I have not promised that I would speak of
it in this place / but that which I will say shall be of the interpretacyon, of
the wit knowledge of the auncyent{is}. The which as we have said as yet hath
given no feet, but studyenge with simple and pure thought to invent some thing
profytable to health, it is well semynge that they have found some things by
use some by reason. Than did they write their inuencyons many times without
gyuynge any reason to their inuencyons, sometime they did, the which they have
done for cause of the profit of the readers. For they trusted to be profitable
to their successors, as to the good and right usage of invented things to
know the reason of their inuencyon) and have written it diligently. To the
contrary, where they have esteemed that it shulde be superflue to recyte, they
have obmysed and left some. Now it is well known to all after that I hold my
peace, that the auncyentes have well loved shortness of speech, and pryncypally
for that cause. Not a lonely Hyppocrate, but also all the other auncyentes.
Sometime without making mention of the myddel most added the third thing. For
if the first thing be sign of the second, the third necessarily follows
after the second. For this cause the first they put ye third, obmyttyng and
leaving the second. I have showed sondry times howe the auncyentes and chyefly
Hyppocrates have written such things. And he that will know and parfytely
understand the manner of interpretynge, that the auncyentes had, ought to be
exercysed in their style and manner of writing. For this time I will expose
only that which^ I have purposed / that is to wit the vlceres the which
(after well and duly to have done all things requysyte) although they be not
cured, the masters in medycyns call them Cacoethe in greek, we call the
malygne or wicked, stoborne and rebel. Now have we spoken in the book before
what curacio of vlceres is. Tha these vlceres here all are called Caroethe,
inveterate, and dinturnes in vsynge such names indyfferently. Likewise for to
know the disease Cacoethe is (that is to say wayward, stoborne or rebellyous
for to heal) it makes somewhat with ye other signs, neuerthe^esse the
dyuturnyte, or that the said vlceres be cal^d dyuturnes, of lunge contynuaunce.
And inue^rate, as waxen old / and in dede ar^ such that (...) manner of
convenient indycacyon of curing / (...) it must be invented because that the
vlcerate ^arty is ill ordered and painful. That invented, ^he manner of curing
is evident. But thou must ^ye, howe so? Of a troth if thou heal the vlce^ate
parties, provided that they only are pained, but if all the body habounde in
vicious, and corrupt humour. In emptyenge clensynge the said humour / for
truly the sign of the vicious humour is the dyuturnyte of the vlcere, but ye
inuencyon of that which is vtyle and expedyent comes not first of the
dyuturnyte, but of the malice of the humour / whereby these three things follow
each other by ordre. That is ye sign, thaffection, and the curacyon. The sign
is the dyuturnyte, thaffection is the vice of the humour, and the curacyon is
the euacuacyon of the said humour / by this mean ye shall find that the
auncyentes many times after the first anon make mention of the third, leuyng
the myddylmoste. As Hyppocrates did when he said it is vtyle to cause the blow
flow often out of vlceres inveterate in what manner that it be, so that the
thing be seen behooveful not that the dyuturnyte indyketh the curacyon / but
the vice of the blode. For a little after he saith thus. The vice of the blode
hyndereth greatly the healing of the said vlceres. Also putrefaction of blode
/ and all thing that is come by transmutacyon of blode lets all other
vlceres for to heal. Anon after when he speaks of vlceres that come not to
festring he saith this wise. The vlceres may not be closed together if the
lyppes and parties that are round about it become swarte or black, because
of the rotten blode, or varyce (that is to say a tumyde vain) that causes the
fluxion if ye heal not the said parties that be about it. Afterward he
writes of the cure of the varices. And furthermore he makes mention of the
purgacyon of all the body, as well in other wounds, as in them where there is
fear and danger of rottenesse (called in Greek spha celos) and also in
serpentz vlceres, and in al Eschirmenes, that is to say that are eaten and
read. And thus Hyppocrates is accustomed to name the vlceres that be reed by
any humour. And also when he speaks of them that ensues he says in such
words. In every vlcere where as chances to come Erysipclas / all the body
must b^ purged. And fynally if ye rede diligently the book of vlceres, ye shall
fynd^ that he takes indicacyon of the disease always, as sometime of the time,
but that is to know the disease. And that it is so, ye may know it at the
beg^nnyng of the said book, which is such. It b^hou^th not to moyste y^
vlceres, what so^uer they be, but with wy^e. Then tells he the cause saying.
For the dry vlcere is ye nearest of health, the moyste to ^orenes. Then anon
after he saith / for ye vlcere (...) moys^e, but y^ is dry is hole, therefore
in all the ^e, in asmoch as he hath constitued y^ end of al ^e ^ure of vlceres
to be dryness / forth with he hath ^ude the {per}ticuler thyng^ admonysshing us
many ^ymes of ye said end / for when he writes in this manner. Every vlcere yt
is dyuyded with a cutting in^ument or sharp pointed receives medycamet ^is
mynysire at ye beginning in blody raw vl^s, yt which medycament in greek is
called Enhameon, or otherwise a drying medicine yt lets it to come to
suppuracyon / for it becomes dryer because of the fluxyon shedynge of ye
blode, yet again Hyppocrates saith. All vlceres yt are purged i time
behoueful, so yt they come always to more dryness, in the most part of them
come none o^ergrowynge nor superfluyte of flesh, but that there is bruise, and
again. If any vlcere may not cleue or grow together, the moyste flesh is
the cause. In all these passages Hyppocrates admonyssheth us of the first
indicacyon curatyfe of vlceres. For of a very troth the curacyon of an vlcere
(if as) being but vlcere is mean and moderate dryinge, whereof the
demonstracyon hath ben given in the book before, but the curacyon ^f an vlcere
yt is coniunct with another affection, whereof the cure ought to proceed, is not
like an vlcere alone, but the first curacion shall be of ye same affection, and
the second of ye vlcere. For if there be either phlegmon or swart colour, or
ecchimosis, or erisipclas, or tumour, yt is called ^edema in the vlcerate
party, first ye must begin ye curacyon at one of the said affections, howbeit
every one knows well yt the vlcere sometime not only is not well comodiously
cured, but becomes much greater, for if in the parties roude about ye vlcere
there is either bruise, phlegmon, or other tumour, we must find the propre
curacyon of the said affection, have it for a certain yt it is not possible to
heal ye vlcere, if ye place where it is be not cured first. And therefore
Hyppocrates putting us in memory yt which he had treated in ye beginning of his
book to write al ye other thing{is} coprised above, yt are ^set when he saith.
Every vlcere yt is dy^yded with a cuttynge instrument, or sharpe pointed
receives medycament called Erhaemon dyssycatyfe that lets the vile matter.
But if the flesh be contused or cut remedy must be given, in such wise that
it come soon to suppuracyon / for in so doyng^ it shall be the less gr^ued
with phlegmon. And al^o it is ^e^essary that the flesh that hath ben
contused, and incis^d, the which putryfyeth, and comes to suppura^yon, in
collyquieng and melting, and after that the new flesh is engendered. By these
w^rdes Hyppocrates shows manyfestly that al d^seases of the vlcerate parties
ought to be desic^t^ except them that we will suddenly breed pus, t^at is to say
rotten matter / and passing forth ^e teach^th us that pus or suppuracyo^ is
made with ^ome pu^t^faction. Now all things putrefy by heate and moystnes /
and therefore the Cathaplasm^s made of barley meal (se^ng that they chaufe and
moyste) we shall m^nystre, to all dyseases whe^t is expedyent to engendre pus.
For the barley ^ea^e with water and o^le, and likewise bread ^ith oil, or also
a fomentacyon with much hot water, and the strength of the salve called
Tetra^ne make, and fynally all things that warm ^nd moyste, forthwith
engendre rotten matter or pus. And for ye cause in ye parties where as phlegmon
is, if there be all ready vehement pulsacyon / in such wise that there is no
more hope of the curac^on of the said parties without suppuracyon all the
auncyentes appl^ the said suppuratyfe medycynes, and not sooner. The which
thing Hyppocrates shows plainly in ye words beforesaid, whereby he byddeth
to dry much the wooded parties without brusure. And they that be with
bruising, it behooves to bring them soon to suppuracyon. Moreover when he
says, that all vlceres that be not well and duly purged, begin always to
breed increase, in them the flesh over grows greatly / but they that are
purged as it behooves, and always comes to drines, in them the flesh
ouergroweth not, but if that there be contusyon. Of troth to ^he purpose, when
he adds, but if that there be contusyon, he reduces us to mind of that he
hath said before. That is to w^t all vlceres require for to be dried, but they
where as is brusynge. For if ye do lay to the parties where as is phlegmon, a
Cataplasme that is hot and moyste, it is not done by the first pryncypal
reason. That is to say, as remedy to ye sore, but asswagynge of the symptom
and grefe. For the remedies of phlegmon are of dissicatyfe virtue. Herken now
what Hyppocrates says. The players of tumours called Cedemata, and
phlegmons that consists round about, be verbascu soden, and leaves of
trifolium raw, and the leues of Eperitron soden pol^m. All these medycamentes
have virtue dissycatyfe, as we have showed in the books of simple medicynes.
And the sum and short cure of the parties where as phlegmon is, is done by
the remedies that doth away all ye hole disease. Or if ye said remedies have
left any thing remanyng yt comes to matter, it is needful to have another
medycament bitter strong, yt may make suppuracion. Or yt the skin yt is
about it be thynne, that you will not yt the pacyent be sooner delivered o^ i^,
ye must make incysyon / but of the cure of phl^gmon by barley meal is sooner
lenition than curacyon, fyghteth against the disease, of ye dyfierence of such
thing{is} we shall sp^ke hereafter more at large. N^we me thinks to have
manyfest^y showed how Hyppocrates hath commanded yt all vlceres ought to be
dyssyccate, that he hath ordained confermed yt it is the end of the curacyon.
In asmoche as the indicacyon is taken of the disease, not of the ty^e. And if
any desire to have greater persuasyon, let him red^ diligently al the b^ke of
Hyppocrates, that he hath written of vlceres. For he shall understand clearly
that there is one general indycyon of all vlceres, that is to wit yt which we
have showed in the precedent book. And also yt there is none indycacyon that is
taken of time, nor at vlceres, nor a^ p^legmon, nor at other greues. And
therefore we are come to the purpose place to speak. It is a thing just and
true to show that Hippocrates hath ben inuentour, not only of that we have
said be^ore, but also of all other things that is for to be known to him that
ought to heal an vlcere well. For it appears that he hath invented the reason
and manner to heal the simple vlceres, and that are without other affection,
which lies and consists in dissiccacion^ But also partyculerly by the kinds
of every disease. For either the vicious humours flow no more in the sore
party, or else it flows styll. If it flow no more, it behooves only to
succour and remedy the party that is pained. That is to wit if it appear pale,
black, or read, it must be scarified and made to blede. Then afterward
(because that I may use his words) must be laid thereupon a sponge more dryer
then moist. I think that no person is ygnoraut that this partycle (that is to
wit than) hath in this place any strength of denial, as if he said thus dry
and not moyste. And afterward ought to be applied remedies dyssyccatyues. And
than (if it be requisyte) for to draw blode again, and forth with after make
such things as is abouesayde, unto the time that the health be all together
gotten. And if the lyppes of the vlcere appear harde and stony, they must be
cut, whereof is spoken in this wise. If the vlcere that are cyrculer and roude
be caued somewhat, it behooves to cut in manner of a circle the parties that are
come in swellynge, which in Greek is called call apostema. Either a whole or
half a circle according to the length. Also it is written of all tumours that
are coniunct with an vlcere how it ought for to be cured, Likewise of the
varyces / for by the occasyon of them the vlcere is wayward and rebel to be
healed, if that any humour of the said varyces do flow in the vlcerate
parties. In likewise when the fluxyon of humour comes ^rom all the body, he
byddeth that all the body be purged without taking of any indicacion of time.
And for certain it should be a laughing thing that so many of divers and often
contraries shulde be taken of a comunyte. For put the case that any indycyon of
time be taken / yet fynally it must be said what it is, and compryse it in a
sum / as Thessalus doth (not only we) which hath always an indycyon of the
disease of the body that is stopped, that is to wit that it be vnlosed / and
another vnlosed of the body to be stopped. Likewise in the vlceres, yt that is
fylthy requires to be cleansed, that yt is caued to be filled, that yt is egal
to be festered. And that that ouergrowen f^esshe, that it be had away, as
Thessalus self is author. Let him show than that there is a thing
proporcyoned in the dyuturne and inveterate vlceres, as there is i all them
aforesaid, which is not possible to him, for he byddeth that they shulde be
cut. But what is that racyonall indycyon taken of time / and than to use
remedies of Mustard / of the which he takes and vsurpe^h this vain word
Metasycrisis? after that he provokes vomytes, by Raffortz. And at the last
when he finds none other remedy to use Elebore? Of the which things shall be
spoken more plainly hereafter, when we shall show that no indicacyon in what
disease soever it be not taken of time. Albeit that ye time is sometime sign of
the disease. But I find again a^ Hyppocrates, whereof I merueyle of his great
dylygence in all other things, and chyefly y^ he hath not forgoten yt which
is pryncypally to be considered, of the master in medicyns touching to
indicacion. Not only in one disease or two, but in all. That is to wit the
indycacyon yt is taken of the myghtynes of the disease, which the Methodykes
only have not left (which is no merueyle) but also divers of the racyonalles,
Emperykes although it be in divers manners. For when they say yt they have
observed the euacuacyon of the course of to much blode / they confess
manyfestly yt they have no regard of other things yt appear in the sores for
to come to such euacuacyo, which yt I say therefore ye purgacyon is euacuacyon,
the which is not indicate by the course of to much flowing of blode, but also
for because yt (although yt there be no course of redoundyng blode) we must
sometime come have refuge to the sending of blode, in greek called phlebotomy?
For when the disease is great, with the force of strengthes there is none but
he make phlebotomy, if he be expert in the works of the art. And sothly we se
yt the emperykes comes to the sending of blode when any is fallen from a hye
place. Or when there is any parties sore bruised hurt with any wound though yt
the pacyent were hole sound before without superhabundaunce of blode. By the
which it appears yt it is not the redoundyng of blode yt indicateth the
phlebotomye, but it is the myghtynes vehemence of the disease, the force of the
strengthes, accepting always children. And by an other reason, as if a man be
hole sound in no wise hurt is full in habundaunce of blode, for all y^ it is
not necessary to take his blode from him. For to some, fasting may satisfy,
to another small eating, to another^ flux of the womb, or purgation, or
hauntynge of batthes, to another only besynes, or habundaunt fretyng may be
enough. But the phlebotomye is not necessary to such folks, as the emperykes
say also. Likewise purgacyon is not couenable in the only habundaunce of
vicious humour. But like as the phlebotomye is made either for habudaunce of
blode, or for the magnytude fyersnes of the disease, also the purgacyon is made
for the habundaunce of some other humour, for the vehemence force of the
disease. As touching the myssyon of blode we have treated in another book,
shall treat hereafter. In this present book I will speak of the purgacyon. For
they yt be diseased desire it. Not only because yt it euacueth the superflue
humour noisome, wherwt they be grieved, but also to put it out be clesed. And
for this cause Hyppocrates as well in his other works as in yt that he hath
written of vlceres considers the vehemence strength of the disease to ye
indication of purging saith thus. Purgacyon by the belly is profytable to many
vlceres, to the wounds of the head of the belly, of the articles, or also if
there be danger of rottenes in the bone, or where sutares behooves, or also to
gnawyng. Likewise to serpent vlceres other affections yt makes the vlceres
long in healing. And also where as rollynges must be used, in all such
affections behooves purgacyons. By these words it is clearly showed yt
purgacyon is {pro}fytable to all vlceres woudes, at al every time yt they are
greatest. For in asmoche yt not only the said affections, but also other be
made grievous great in three manners. That is to wit either for y^ exc^llency
nobylyte of the party, myghtynes of the disease, or because yt the said
maladies affections are Cacoethe, yt is wicked. Hyppocrates hath made mention
of all these things by them selfes. That is when he shows of wounds of the
head, belly, the dygnyte excellency of the party yt is hurt. I think yt it is
manifest to all yt here must be understand not only the inward belly, but
also the superyour. For in dividing ye tronke which is between the neck the
legs, is two great capacytees. The first is contained under the Thorax. The
second under the fondement, yt is to the mebrane yt is stretched under
labdomen, for certain ye woude yt hath pierced within the Thorax, or within the ars
hole is very dangerous, pryncipally if any of the inward parties be wooded.
Likewise there is but few but he knows well yt all wounds of the articles
are Cacoethes and wicked. The which thing the Emperykes understand by only
experience. And they yt have studied to have the science of the nature of the
body, understand it by the nature of ye hurt parties. For in the synewes and
bony places without flesh there is danger of payne, waking, pryuacyon of
rest, also of con^ulsyon. Such wounds abouesayd, such as be stytched, yt is to
say yt are so great yt they have need to be sowed, or at leest ways of
byndynge or rollynge require purgacyon. We have said in the next book before yt
all the great vlceres ought to be conjoined, either by seames or by
byndyng{is}, like wise yt the vlceres where there is danger of the corruption
of ye bones are with magnytude of phlegmon. Also they yt are with erosion be
cacoethes wicked, proceed of evil humours. And also cankers comes of bylyous
excrementes. That is to wit coleryke superfluite, al other old vlceres comes
of such a cause / wherefore in all ye vlceres aforesaid Hyppocrates comaudeth to
purge by ye belly, and following after he adds these words. In all vlceres
where erisipclas is come the body must be purged in the party most vtyle for
the vlcere, so yt the purgacyon be made either by the upper parties or by the
inward, whereof he hath taught us the dyff^rence in the book of humours / where
he by^deth to return to the contrary parties deryuat to the side. And when
there is great fluxion yt it behooves to make another vlcere in the contrary
parties, thereof he speaks in the said book, whereof if yet again if the
fluxyon be ipetuous great we shall make reuulsion in the contrary parties, yt is
to wit if the vlcere be in the upper parties, by purgacyon downward, if the
vlcere be in the inward parties, in purgynge the upper belly. But if the
fluxion be stopped all ready, in such wise yt it is drawn to, fixed in the
membre, it is more expedyent to drive it out by the next places, saying that the
translacyon transport is by ye parties yt be next it. Saying also ye thaccesse
actraction of the purging medycament is more easy prompt ne'er then fer. The
which reason belongs also to another party of ye art, yt is to wit of yt
which treats of the purgacyon of humours, as it is well known to all,
therefore hereafter it shall be necessary to repeat it, and make it all parfyte^
Now will I show yt the force or if ye will cal it the myghtynes, or fyersnes,
ought to be stablysshed ordained by indicatrice of phlebotomye, or of purgacio,
and yt Hyppocrates was ye first inuentour of the said indicacyon, which I will
show as touching to other dyseases in the books yt follow, in this present
book I will treat of vlceres. I have all ready spoken clearly of the purgacyons.
For sith it is so yt every disease is grievous fyers in.iij. manners, yt is
either by precellence nobleness of ye party, or for the strength magnytude of
ye affection disease or for ye wyckednes frowardness of the same, called i
greek Cacoethia. Hyppocrates hath made mecyon of all these thing{is} where as
he spake of purgacyons, but some perchance shall say. Howe than? doth not
Hippocrates persuade sometime for to draw the blode for the same causes
abouesaid? It seems yt he comaundeth them thus, but in few words, nevertheless
not without demonstracyon, as he is accustomed, also all the other auncyentes.
Thou shalt understand yt it is thus. First if thou rede again his words yt
are such. In all vlceres newly made, but if it be in the belly, it is expedyent
yt forth with it flow in blode either more or less. For by yt mean the vlcere
shall be less grievous by a phlegmon, also the places yt are about it. And
after these words yt be written i his book of vlceres (if you hast mind of it)
yt he hath often proposed it in his other books. Howe yt medicine ought to be
imytatour not only of nature, but also to those thing{is} yt are {pro}fitable
when they come to their, {pro}pre natural flyryng you shalt clearly understand
ye mind of Hyppocrates, that is, yt blode must be drawn when the wounds are
great. For if it be expedient yt the blode flow in such vlceres, that be not
leten slow, you must add supply that yt is needful. T^ese words yt he
writes after the declaring thus, conioyneth them forth with to them abouesayd.
It is profytable yt the blode be leten flow many times from the inuetera^
viceres (in what soever manner yt s^all be seen opportunate) as well in the
vlcere, as in the parties about it. For in asmoche as he hath said before ye
blode ought to be taken from every grene wound, seeing yt he made no metion of
veterate vlceres, it wold have we^ed to some yt he had only spoken of grene or
fresshe wounds, whereby he hath well added yt it behooves to draw blode from
ye inveterate old sor{is}. Now sith it is so yt the doctrine yt we have taken
of him is {per}petual always true, that is how fluxyon ought to be drawn (the
which begins) as ye contrary parties, that which is all ready fixed in the
party ought to be purged, either by the said painful party, or by ye next
party to it. It is now easy to us to conclude of the detraction of blode, how
from the beginning it ought to be done in the party far of most dystaunt,
then in the vlcerate parties. Likewise if ye add to the abouesayd things yt
Hyppocrates admonysshed to empty the superflue humour, sometime ye shall use
detraction of blode, yt is when the blode surmounts. Sometime ye shall give a
medycament yt hath virtue to purge ye humours coleryke or melancolyke, or else
phleume. Having ever in mind in all these works howe none of them is the
curacyon of vlceres. In asmoche as vlcere. But rather of cacomye yt is coniunct
with the vlcere, or of Pletore, or of phlegmon, or of herpes, other like
dysposycyon, without to forget yt any of the accydentes of the vlcere give any
force of his propre indication, as magnytude. In the book before we have spoken
of vlceres, wherein we have exposed all the differences of vlceres, how many,
what they be, what is the indycacyon of each of them. Howbeit I have not spoken
in ye said book howe sometime to purge is taken of the force vehemence of the
disease, because it should be to lunge demonstracyon. Also in the said book I
have not conjoined ye cure of al the body with the vlceres, but I have written it
in this present book, in asmoche as it is good vtyle for ye thing proposed. For
the parfyte absolute exposycyon of this kind of indicacion, which we have said
is taken of ye myghtynes strength of the disease, shall be also treated of
hereafter. Likewise of the indication taken of the age, and also of it yt is
taken of purging of humours. And likewise the indicacion yt is taken of the
pained parties shall be parfytly declared in the books yt follows. For as now
we have only made mention of the curatyfe indicacion, which may be taken of
the nature of the said parties, yt is to wit of ye temperance substance,
without touching of yt which is taken of the situacyon of the form figure, of
the vtylyte usage, of ye feeling sharp dull, Now then let us speak of the said
indi^acions yt is profytable to the curation of vlceres. The party yt is sharp
of feeling ought asmoche as ^s possible to be cured without dolor or payne. The
^ater of such remedies is treated in the books yt be written of simple
medycamentes. But the par^ye yt is but of small feeling receives stronger
remedies, if the disease require it so. Now we must consydre the strength of
the pryncipal membre, as we shall say more at large when we speak of phlegmon.
But if it be not a pryncypall membre, it is lefull surely without danger to lay
to it such manner of medycament as mytygate assuage, the greeks call it
Calastyce, we shall speak of it plainly h^eafter. At this present time we will
show ye reason manner to heal, which is taken of ye situation figure of the
parties, than we will impose the end of this fourth book. For this cause we
have cogitate inueted yt we must give medicamet{is} to drink to him yt hath
his vetricle vlcerate, which vulgarily is called ye stomach, if the bulk yt
properly is called ye stomach, yt the greeks cal cesophagus be vlcerate, the
said medycament{is} ought not to be taken swalowed at ones, but by little little
in contynuyng, because of the passage, also of the touching there come vtylyte
in the vlceres yt are in yt party, not for to contain the said medycamentes yt
be adherent, as in the vlceres of the ventricle. Likewise we have indicate
showed by the sytuacyon figure of the said party yt such medycament{is} ought
to be made grosser thycke, more gleymy cleuyng, because yt the bulk is a
passage of the things yt is eaten drunken. For yt cause it hath need of
remedies yt may draw to it, almost in all parts to be coagulate cleuyng, not
such as are thine easy to rene flete lightly. And also the course thycke
medycamentes do crud make concrecyon in ye parties of the bulk or oesophage,
they yt be gleymy do cleue to. Likewise in vlceres yt are in ye thycke inward
guts have more need of remedies which are cast out put out by the syege, in
asmoche as the said thyck^ are next to ye syege. But of the vlceres yt are in
the intestynes upward thynne, because they be ferdest from the syege, are set
in ye middle situation, require both the two medycyns, yt is to wit, those yt
are received by ye mouth, those be infused and cast out by the syege. Now for
certain the comune indicacion of all ye interyour parts is yt we ought to
choose those thing{is} yt be most famylyer to the nature of man, be they metes
or medycyns. And yt we leave cast away all contrary things. Albeit yt in the
vlceres which be in the outward parties, the usage of such medycament be not
noysom as is aerugo, aes vstu, aeris squama cadmia, papholix commonly called
thutie, argenti spuma, yt is litargiri, ceruse. Such like medycament{is} ought
not to be used nor admynystred to the vlceres of ye inward parties, of whose
nature we have written in the book of teperamentes, and in the book of the
simple medycynes. And if ye will bring ye vlcere to a festre or cleuynge ye
ought to choose tart meates gleymy yt have no manner of erosyon. But if ye will
cleanse the vlcere ye must choose things yt absterge or wasshe moderately, as
raw honey, which above al thing is clesing thus. As touching scarre potions
meates they are commonly know over all. I cal austere which in greek hight
(styphon) yt is to say a little adstryngent. For sour or vytter is it yt is
tart (in greek stryph^ion.) The medycyns yt may be taken surely and without
danger is treated of in the books of medicamentes. Nevertheless we will say some
formulary for the inward vlceres such medycamentes are wholesome, as hypocistis,
balaustium, yt is the flower of tame pomgarnets, galla, malicoriu, y^ is the
husk or pyl of the pomgarnet, terra samea, et leminu, yt is terra sigillata,
the pyth of Rhus, yt is symac, also the juice of roses, achatia, other like,
which annoy not the bowels inward {per}ties. And ye must show give ye said
medicamentes with some decoction of tart things, as decoction of quinces, of
lentister, or of the highest boughs of rubus, or of vynes burgeons, or grene
myrtylles, or with tart wine. It is now manifest none is ygnoraut, yt he must
beware of drinking of wine if there be phlegmon, or else there is no danger.
In likewise it is well known evident yt the said medycament{is} must be
prepared received with the decoctions, moyste thing{is}. Also ye must meddle
together fraga, cauthu, geme, chyefly to ye vlceres yt are in the bulk
resophage. Also it was commanded to make gargarysynes to the vlceres yt are in
the parties called fauces pa^ysthmia, but in the vlcere yt is in the sharpe
artere called tracheia, the pacyent must be laid upright, keep the medycament
lunge time in his mouth in losing all y^ muscles yt be in yt place. For in so
doing some part of the medycament will flow by little little in to ye artere
sesibly manyfestly. As we may know when the said artere is well disposed after
the nature of it, yt somewhat of ye which is drunken reneth passes through it.
But likewise as in health good lust it must be kept yt it influe not to much,
so in it must in disease for fear yt it engedre not ye cough. For as lunge as
the humour descends in every part nygh the tunycles of ye artere as water
doth by a wall it exciteth not ye cough, but if some thing pass in the midst
of the way of the spert, yt is the air, forth with it bredeth the cough. All
the indicacyons of it is taken of ye situacyon form of the party. Likewise
also huny must be meddled in all medicamentes destined ordained to the vlcere of
the Thorax the lunges. For if ye use only tart medycyns they will remain in
ye belly. The thynstrument of the dygestyon and distrybucyon of the said
medycament{is} over all the body shall be huny. Also of their sudden passing
as a vehicule, with yt there is huny it noyeth not the vlcere. Like manner all
and as many times as there is vlcere in ye bladder in ye raynes it must be
myxed with the medycamentes of the vlceres, not with huny, but with some dyurytyke
medycamentes, yt is such as provokes styrreth to pysse. I think that yt is
patent manifest to every man, after yt I hold my peace, yt is to wit yt they
can know dyscerne the vlcerate parties by their substance, action, vtylyte,
position figure, the which hath ben showed plainly in the book of the signs of
ye pained parties, but this is not now yt time to speak of them. I will
return to ye Methode curatyfe, I say that not only the thing{is} abouesaid,
but also many other are the indicyons of the figure, sytuacyon of the parties.
For ye can not well comodyously bind the sore party, but if first ye have
taken indicacyon either of ye figure, or of the sytuacyon, or of both two
together. Nor ye can not set the pipe of a clyster right without such indycacyon.
It is also many times necessary to make iniectio of the medycamentes in the
bladder by the yerde, wherefore it is no need to make mention here yt totally ye
can not well use a syring of bras yt the greeks call Cathering, but if ye know
parfytely the posycyon, figure of all the bladder. Than in all these things it
appears clearly yt the pained place indicateth much to all the curacyon, but
of the ruptions (yt the greeks cal Regmatha) divers indicacions are concurraut
to one purpose, pryncypally ye indicacion yt is taken of ye posicion ought to
be examined. For saying yt the rupcyons be hyd in the depth of ye body,
therefore they require other curacions than the vlceres yt appear outwardly,
because yt all holly always such rupcyons be with ecchymosis or ecchymonia,
sometime with contusyon about the broken flesh, therefore there be divers
indicacyons curatyues therein, for always the curatyfe indicacions are
correspondent to ye nombre of ye affections dyseases, which we shall show more
plainly when we speak of phlegmon, howe the dyseases yt are in ye deep places
requires stronger medycament{is}, than they yt be at ye superfluyte of the
body. Than for the least I do think for to be manifest and pacyent, yt it is
necessary that the strength of medicament{is} yt are mynystred outward be
resolved dymysshed when the party yt should be helped remydyed is hyd in the
dypenes of the body, therefore it behooves asmoche to intende augment the virtue
of the said medycament, as it shulde be remyssed dymynysshed in ye depth of the
body. Certainly all acchymosis or ecchymonia indycateth vacuacyon for remedy of
ye cure, whereby it hath need of medycament{is} moderately hot and dry, for they
yt dry excessyuely, of troth do digest resolve at ye beginning more evidently
than they yt be weyke, but also some party of the disease scyryous, dyffycyle
to heal, we shall speak of it hereaft diligently, for as now we have spoke
enough, after as it belongs to the matter. Of troth all the medicamentes
oyntmentes, yt moysteth heteth more then they yt all the greeks call
chalastica, yt is to say laxatyfes, also among the said medycamentes all they
yt decline somewhat to dryness, nevertheless be not yet clear nor manifest
contraction (they be called syntatica in greek) such medycamentes ben the
remedies of all ecchymosis. But ye must take good heed yt the medycamentes
applycate to the ruptions yt are in depenesse of the body have strong virtue,
and yt they be sourer digestyfe, yt is resolutyfe. (And for to say somaryly) yt
such medycamentes to be of greater force effycace, in asmoch as lecchymosis is
ferther of, from the skin unto the depenes of the body. In such affections
dyseases the usage of the heart bytuleth, yt is to say ventose should not be
inutyle, which is an instrument invented excogitate of masters for to make
violent attraction. And when ecchymosis is all dygested resolved, than it is
parmytted to dry the broken flesh, much, to conjoin it with lygature, to do
all yt is convenable to coalesse close an vlcere together. Than if ecchymosis
be soon digested resolved y^ broken flesh gathers together waxes plain
easily, but if the said ecchymosis tarry lunge or it be resolved, much
fylthynes bredeth in it, occupies ye space yt is between the labyes or lyppes
of the vlcere, so y^ the rupcio can not close, wherefore it follows yt all
these things abouesayd admonyssheth us for all causes, how small soever they
be. For though that some hath had rigour, yt is to say vnegall concussyon of
all ye body, or that it hath not made good concoction, or yt it hath had the
fever, or yt it hath ben over wearied or fatygate, anon it shall have payne in
the said party where as the ruption is. For because of the said ruption have
ben vnyed nowryssneth together, but have lonely ben approached one to another,
whereby it follows yt a little thing may depart them easily, fill the place with
superflue humour, but what engenders it in such rupcyons continually but now
ecchymosis, like unto the first, that is to wit when y^ flesh was first
broken, except yt presently ecchimosis is made of more tough subtle corrupcyon,
at y^ beginning it was made of blode. And herfore now it digests resolves
more easily tha it did at ye beginning. And thus that which we have said
hitherto shall suffyse for the dysputacyon of vlceres. The^fore as now I make
an end of this fourth book.

Thus ends the fourth book of the Methode of Claude Galyen.

To the Reader.
Dear Brethren, and friendly Readers, we have here according to the truth
and meaning of the Author, set forth this needful and necessary work
concerning the Anatomy of mans body, being collected and gathered by Master
Thomas Vicary, and now by us the Chirurgions of S. Bartholmewes Hospital
revived, corrected, and published. And albeit this treatise be small in
volume, yet in commodity it is great and profitable. Notwithstanding, if the
things therein contained be not discreetly and wisely studied and applied,
according to the true meaning of the Author, we have to tell you hereof, that
therein is great peril, because through ignorant practitioners, not knowing
the Anatomy, commonly doth ensue death, and separation of soul and body.
Furthermore, whereas many good and learned men in these our days, do cease to
publish abroad in the English tongue
