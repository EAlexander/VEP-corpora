THE OVERTHROVV OF the Gout / Written in Latin verse, by Doctor Christopher
Balista.

IMPRINTED AT London by Abraham Ueale dwelling in Paules Church yard at ye
sign of ye Lamb. 1577.

TO THE RIGHT Worshipful, his very good Friend M. RICHARD MASTERS Doctor in
Physic, and Servant to her excellent Majesty.
SIR, I SEND you heer a short treatise of the Gout, written by one Balista a
Frenchman, and dedicated to a great Physician in France.

It came by Fortune (being as I think not any where else to be had) into my
hands, which for the benefit of diverse my friends troubled with that disease,
and partly for mine own recreation, that was something delighted with the
writer (in as good manner as I could) I Englished. The verse in Latin is not
very eloquent, and therefore no marvel though the translation be rude and
unpleasant.

But sure his Method and order is not in mine oppinio to be dissalowed, but
rather much to be commended. I have noted him in such places as I thought
convenient, and would have farther augmented him but that I thought it not good
to be to curious in an other mans work.

Such as it is: I send it you and commit it to your good allowance and
protection.

Your very loouing friend. B. G.

The Overthrow of the GOVTE.
AGainst the Gout with al her force
my mind desires to go:
And with a valiant hand to fling,
my darts at this my foe.
Lunge time this beast hath now presumed,
her wicked force to bend:
Against that good old man that doth,
the Sedun flock defend,
Diseased sore he lies and able,
not to stir a limb:
So hath the wretch benomd his Joints
and so hath plagued him.
That still he is inforste to keep his house,
as doth the Snaill:
O piteous hap and great mischance,
that each man ought to waill.
It grieves me to the hart to se,
the torments that he bears:
Her cruelty Constrains me,
to stain my cheeks with tears
My sorrows doth command ye doutfull hap
of Mars to try:
Why stand I still? I will assail,
the monster presently.
Draw near O sweet Redeemer of,
the World before undone:
Of that most glorious majesty,
the true and only son.
Vouchsafe to give thy speeding darts,
in this my quarrel just:
And cause that I with them may throw
this monster in the dust.
And thou O noble Phillip, by all
the Gods above that be:
I thee require to show thy self,
a man in each degree.
Hope well for hope avails much,
In driving grief away:
I dout no whit, but shortly thou
shalt see a fairer day.
More hapeneth in an hour sometime,
then in a thousand year:
And many great commodities,
in smallest time appear.
I trust to drive the Gout unto
the loathsome pit of hell:
And that thou shalt good Phillip have
thy feet again full well.
Do you no more but bear in mind,
the words that I shall say:
And these my lessons that I give,
do cary well away.
The subtle shackles that this Beast,
doth bind the feet withal:
Podagran all the learned of Greece,
have ever used to call.
Hence sprang at first the hateful name,
of this so painful grief:
That suddenly the feet unwares,
assails like a thief.
At first it rages in the joints,
and then assaults the toes:
And straight from thence with hasty course
unto the heel it goes.
And sometimes to the buckle bones,
where as it swells and shows:
With pain while as abundance great,
of humours thither flows.
Sometime the Cod beside, that both
the stones encloses round:
Doth swell withal and hanging lowe,
it oftentimes is found.
The causer of this great disease,
not evermore is one:
Oft times the parents are the cause
it falls the Child upon.
When as the seed but feeble is,
whereof the fruit is wrought:
For since the root such weakness hath,
the plant must needs he nought.
Besides to vehement exercise,
the Gout doth often breed:
Of service long in Venus court,
it likewise doth proceed.
The very frame of all the limbs,
is shaken with this game:
Each Sinow eke enfeebled is
by using of the same.
And Bacchus thou that wanted art,
the spirits to revive:
Dost use to hurt the feet of such,
as in thy service strive.
Of Martial acts in stately stile,
did Ennius always write:
And in his cups did blase the deeds,
of many a worthy knight.
Yet of the Gout at last he dyed,
nor could his verses save:
(With all the sweetness that they had)
their master from the grave.
Great hurt beside unto the joints,
doth evermore arise:
Of cold, excessive Idleness,
and to much exercise.
The hart with fury once inflamed,
doth kindle presently:
And fires all the humours straight,
that in the body lye.
Whereby unbridled all, they rome
and range in every place:
And paining all the Senous sore,
they vex in piteous case.
Oft times of thick and clammy fleume,
this vile disease doth breed:
Sometime again, of both the sorts
of Choler doth proceed.
And tomuch blood while as it doth,
the tender joints oppress:
Is many times the only cause,
of this vnquietnes.
Most grieved with this disease are men.
the women not so much:
The cause is plain and evident,
who lists it to touch.
One reason is because that heat,
in man doth more exceed:
Which causes that the humours pearse,
the senowes more with speed.
Most subject to the gout are those,
that greatest age have seen:
And such as with some sickness great,
have long tormented been.
And cares of mind and sorrows great,
do breed this grievous sore:
And want of wanted exercise,
as hath been said before.
Let this suffice to show the spring,
of such a ^lish sprite:
Now time it is my weapons for,
to show and fall to fight.
And first I will begin with herb,
with Juice and metals bright:
And then of stones that serve the turn,
I crave the aid and might.
Then Beasts and Birds I set in rank,
and cause them to restore:
The weak and wearish limbs of those
that lamed were before.
And last of all my Tables do
I spread with meat and Wine:
And there the perfect diat for
this sickness do assign.
First Toutsane unto thee I give, Not our common Toutsane but Dioscorides his
Panacaea reed Mathiolus.

the chiefest place before:
That dost derive thy worthy name,
of bealing every sore.
Thou beaten small and mingled well
with reasons good and sweet:
In plaster made applied well,
dost heal the feeble feet.
An herb there is that in the Sun, Mary Goldes.

doth woundrously delight:
And after him doth evermore,
direct her course aright.
That when be once begins to rise,
doth spread and open wide:
And mourning hangs down her head,
when Westwards he doth slide.
This meddled well with sewet of
a Got, doth drive away.
The Gout, the like doth Balm stamped
if to the feet you lay.
And Ueruen sod in water doth
the feet from sickness save:
Which herb the noble Romans wont
in great account to have.
The alter fair of Iupiter,
with this they used to sweep:
And therewith every corner of
their houses sprinkled deep.
Beside the Herald when he gave,
defiance to his foe:
Commanded was with Garland all
of Ueruen clad to go.
Coleworts in this disease are good,
being sodden specially:
The broth whereof refuse not thou,
to drink for remedy.
Put Coliander to the Cole,
and Salt and Few beside:
And flower fine of Barley that,
by grinding small is tried,
A Pultise made of these, if to
the aching joints ye lay:
It greatly doth the pains assuage,
and drives the Gout away.
And if the Gout be such as in
his rage it doth not swell:
The Radish root will help, if that
in Wine you sees it well.
The noble Radish that our fathers
old, did greatly love:
And did indeed the same esteem,
all other meats above.
At Delphus was it then decreed,
it should be graved in Gold:
The Beet in silver to be framed,
the Raape in leaden mold.
This to the Gout is to be laid,
the Juce of Woodbinde thick:
And mingle there withal the meal
or Flower of Fenugrick.
And Nettel roots well bruised in
the strongest Uinager:
The leaves beside being pouned with The leaf the seed with Beres Grease.

the tallow of a Bear.
And stinking Assa faetida,
in spunges well applyde:
Will like wise help the grievous Gout,
and Fever sore beside.
If thereunto you put the War,
that is from Cyprus brought:
And see that with the suet of
a Got it well be wrought.
Plantain being pouned well with salt,
and Lens with Pap made with Barley
Polent good:
The water Betany, besides
Hemp roots, and Sothernwood.
The Juice of Henbane mixed with meal,
that from the Mil doth fly:
And war, with Gum Armoniack
in equal quantity.
And boiled well in Uinagre.
the branch of Poplar small:
With Herb that bears his name of Age,
that Grounsil we do call.
To this it needful is to put,
the grease of fatted Bore:
And mingle wax with Willow leaves,
that well have sod before.
An Herb there is that in the Sea, Phicus marina Sea weed.

doth always wind about:
Which (if it be not over dry)
will heal the painful Gout.
Who would believe that heaps of Corn,
should drive the Gout away,
And bring the feeble foot his force,
to stand without a stay?
As Sextus searching of the Barnes, Sextus Pompeius

was taken with the Gout:
He laid him down in heaps of Wheat,
that closed him round about.
When suddenly he felt him self,
as well as any man:
And rising up with joyful hart,
to walk about began.
For all the humour out was drawn,
and dried by this releef:
That was the head, the fountain and
the cauie of all this grief.
For such a force is in the Wheat,
as that it hath been seen:
The vessels full in shortest time
to draw and dry up clens
To Elder leaves. the Sewet of
a Got put orderly:
This laid unto the feet will be
a present remedy.
Forget not that same herb beside
that green doth always grow: Houseleek or Singre.

It heals those same angry Goutss,
that red and fiery show.
The Gourd that grows wild his rine,
is thought to do the same:
Which also helps the head that doth
with fiery humours flame.
The like being sod in Uinagre The wild Cocumber.

the Cocumber will do:
So will the Cole, the surging Seas
that grows near unto. Sea Colwort it grows under the Clyfts besides
Seaforde in Sussex

And Purslain pounded well with Salt,
doth heal this painful rage:
And likewise doth the fiery heat
of shingles soon assawge.
Tis very strange that rust of Iron,
will heal the grievous Gout:
The wound beside with Lancel made,
will let the poison out.
When Telephus with staf of fierce
Achilles wounded was:
And never a Surgeon there about:
could bring the cure to pass.
They took advisement of their Gods,
Apollo answered thus:
Achilles Sword (quoth he) shall save,
the life of Telaphus.
With joyful mind went Telephus,
to meet his enemy:
Who striking gave him with his wound,
a present remedy.
The treacle good beside, that cures
the deadly poison strong:
Is souerain to be used against
the Gout retained long.
What should I heer of Salt entreat
Nature that all things spun:
Created nothing needful more
for man then Salt and sun.
With salt we savour all our meat,
and do preserve our food:
Take Salt away our banquets loss,
no Uiands seems good.
Salt makes strong and lusty Joints,
example good may be: A Bag of Salt beat small wet in boiling wine and laid to
the feet. Or salt very fine beaten with Oil of Camomil made in an Ointment.

The tough and sturdy limbs of horne,
in Fishers that we see.
Salt with his fretting force, doth enter,
pearce and thorough spring:
Dissolveth, eats, burns up
and fineth every thing.
With Honey, Oil, and meal being mixed
and beaten as it ought:
It makes good the feet again,
that feeble were and nought.
And if you list my poor advise,
in this disease to take:
Go get you to the Sea and bathe,
your feet when they do ache.
Tis good in Brimstone bathes sometime
to wash your self beside:
Which will refresh your crazed limbs,
and stop a stormy tide.
Take water with Salt Peeter mixed
and Brimstone, let them boil:
And wash your legs, or if you list,
with Lees of sodden Oil.
And now for stones, let three suffice,
the Jet as one of those:
From whence a stinking sulphur asre,
ascends to the nose.
The smell whereof do Serpents shun,
wherewith what soever you write:
In brittel vessel made of Earth,
will never out of sight.
Lay this unto your Gout, the stone
that Iron up doth take:
Doth tame this mad unruly beast,
and quickly out doth shake.
Beat small a Medstone, mix it with
the Milk of such a wight:
As at her first delivery brings
a pretty Boy to light.
This will assuage the Gout, if that
you lay it thereunto:
And bring the Senowes to their force,
to do as they should do.
You worthy creatures that have life,
with haste your selves address,
And let me have your helping hands,
in this my business.
The bones of man to ashes burnt,
and made in powder sine:
Being drunk, is not of littie force,
against this foe of mine.
And woman's milk, if that you join
the Humlock therewithal:
Applied to the feet doth heal,
the raging torments all.
Put Goosegrece heerunto and ad
green Isop to the same:
Or Opium wherewithal you may,
a parfect medicine frame. Opium the Juice or Gum of black Poppey.

With greece of swine, join woman's hear
and this shall do you good:
Being laid unto the aching feet,
that rage with angry mood.
Refuse not thou to bath thy feet,
with Urin of a man:
Provided that the party be,
as helthy as ye can.
The right foot of an Egle, to
your right foot look you lay:
And to your left leg lay the left,
to drive the gout away.
Sometime again with Horseleaches,
beset your feet about:
That Blood suckers are termed of
the rude and common rout.
These never will forsake the legs,
where they cleave and pull:
(So great desire they have to blood)
till all their skin be full.
But all the vilest humours that,
they in those parts do find:
Which were the causers of this grief,
they drink with greedy mind.
And when they once have fiid them selves,
as full as they may be:
They leave the place and fall away,
as beasts that drunken be.
But if they chance to cleue to fast,
and will not leave their hold,
Then sprinkle beaten Salt thereon
burnt wul or ashes cold.
It holsom is beside to open in
thy feet some bleeding vain:
Whereby the humour passes out,
that breeds all thy pain.
An aged Cock well stewed in broth,
being drunk doth pleasure great:
In filling all the joints and limbs
with sweet and pleasant heat.
The milk of Asses drunk doth heal,
the gout with raging mood:
So doth the flesh thereof if that,
you vss it for your food.
The Owl that hath a body fat,
you sees in water stall:
And often eat the tender flesh
and drink the broth withal.
The Greece of Swine, with Ashes mixed
of dung that Gates do make:
Is very souerain, if therewith Gotes dug mingled with Barley flower and Uinagre,
a good Pultis. So is the root of marsh malowes mingled with Ducks grease, for
old swelling goutes

you noynt the feet that ache.
O worthy Grease of Swine that dost,
deserve so great a praise:
What good unto the joints of man,
thou bring sundry ways.
When as the limbs and members all,
with cold congealed be:
Their natural heat again, and warmth
they straight receive from thee.
Thou supplest stifned parts and such
as weak and feebled be:
Restorste to health and sores dost heal
that loathsome are to see.
Thou drive the Gout from hand and foot,
what should I utter more?
In few words will I speak at once,
thou healest enery sore.
Such force to thee the helthful roots,
of noble herbs do give:
Wherewith the wandering herds of Swine
in pleasant pastures live.
The Romains, that by valor all
the world did once subdue:
Had thee in honour great for this,
thy virtues that they knew.
With thee the gladsome Bride, when as
the house she enter should
Of her new married mate, the posts
and thresholdes cover would.
Heer of the wife first took her name,
because in times before:
The charge to her committed was
of noynting of the door.
For they supposed this Grease would put
all troubles unto night:
And that for ever after, no
misfortune enter might.
But to my Gout again, The Dung
of Kites and ashes fine:
Of Snails and Wesel burned both
will heal this Gout of thine.
Let Legs that thus diseased be,
be bathed with Wesels blood:
The Sewet like wise of a Calf,
for this is very good:
To this may also added be,
the flesh of fearful Deer:
And there withal the Broth wherein, A For fleaed cut in small Gobbits
destilled with Oil of Camomil, Oil of Few, oil of worms, of each (...).
ounces, a quantity of Aqua vite. A good water to noint the joints.

the Hare hath boiled clear.
With case of crafty Fox let all
thy foot well wrapped be:
And for to noint them with the Grease,
of Reynard helps thee.
And good it is in skins of D^gs,
to keep and wrap them well:
And with the grease of them to noint,
the painful feet that swell.
Moreover take a Crow and quick
put him in Horsedung deep:
And close him so that he may have,
no place away to creep.
When four days once be full expired,
go take him from his grave:
And burn him straight, then mingle Wax
with the Ashes that you have.
This laid unto the feet, doth drive
this monster quite away:
And makes the poor diseased man,
to go without a stay.
And Iunoes bird, the Peocock helps
if that his dung you take:
And plaster wise apply it to,
the lamed limbs that ache.
Anoint thy feet with drippings hot
of greasy roasted Cat:
And take the Beavers stones beside,
and mingle well with that.
To Ashes burn the Mullets head,
that in the sea doth swim:
With pleasant Honey mingle it,
and noint thy crazed limb.
Go take the crauking Frog, and with
thy knife, go quarter out
His members all, and lay his feet
unto the painful Gout.
So that the right do touch the right
and that the left do lye:
Upon the left, so shalt thou find
a present remedy.
But leaving now these creatures heer,
though many more there be:
Of like effect, for who can write
of all in each degree?
I will thee straight ways show how thou,
thy table shalt prepare:
And in what sort for thine auail,
thou shalt appoint thy fare.
Great Gluttony and surfeiting,
the limbs doth quickly lanie:
And therefore would I soberly,
thy diet thou should frame.
First see thy bread be baked well,
that thou at Table hast:
And neither black nor yet to white,
but pleasant in the taste.
All trifles banish from thy board,
and meal with honey made:
As Custards, Pies and Florentines,
and other of this trade.
All Salt and slimy meats, and flesh
that long doth poudred lye:
And fish in Salt preserude, all such
I warn thee for to fly.
Both Garlic, Rue and Onions sour
expel them far from thee:
Although the fond Egiptians do:
suppose them Gods to be.
Abstain from Pepper, Raapes Grapes
that in the spring time be:
From Apples, Pears, and such like fruit
as winter gives thee.
Nor suffer thou the deadly Beans
to come upon thy board:
Which once the wise Pithagoras
condemned by his word.
With this the holy Preests durst never
deal in all their rites:
It longs unto Goblins and
to black and fearful sprights.
It doth the sense and wit of man,
both dull and dampish make:
And raises in the night such dreams,
as makes the hart to quake.
Both Peason, Nuts and Chestnuts gross
despise thou in this case:
And take thou heed that at thy board,
no Cheese have any place.
Let these suffice for food, the Hen
and Chanticlere the bold:
The Whether and the lusty Steer,
who never yet was cold.
The Cunny, Hare, the Partridge, and
the Egg that's roasted rear:
And all the smallest Birds beside
that tender limbs do bear.
Such Fishes small I like, as in
the running Rivers fleet:
And such as have no scales, for to
refuse I think it meet.
The Lamperns shun, that licking of
the rock was would to lye:
And therewithal the Crab that sidling
seeks her self to wry.
Let not the Eel thy Table touch,
a clamy humour still:
Doth from this fish proceed, that all
the joints of man doth fill.
The Lamprey long agone was had,
in estimation great:
And taken for his dainty taste,
to be a Princes meat.
Antonia (Drusus wife) was would,
the Lamprey for to feed:
And set her out with rings of gold,
the farther to exceed:
A Lampry dead Hortensius did
bewail with many a tear:
Such was the favour of the great
goodwill that he did bear.
But meddle not with it whosoever
thou art that hast the gout:
For why, it doth increase thy pains,
and brings thy grief about.
In few words for to make an end,
For who can all things touch:
In this disease much helthsomer
is flesh, then fish by much.
Take for your drink the mildest wine,
and clearest you can get:
And mingle it with water well,
the fume away to fet.
What quantity you ought to drink,
I need not heer define:
Your own discretion heerin best,
a measure may assign.
But this I only warn you of,
that when you leave your meat:
You leave with some desire to drink,
and some desire to eat.
Then feed on Coliander seeds,
when thus you well have fed:
To make a merry hart and keep
the vapours from the head.
Give not thy self to too much sleep,
nor watch not all the night:
And let some distance be betwixt,
thy sleep and supper light.
Lye not upon the back for this
is for the body nought:
But very seldom use to ride,
take never any thought.
Sometime it shall be good awhile,
to pass the time away:
To hear the pleasant instrument,
of such as well can play.
Nothing then Music, more our grief
and sorrows banish can:
It glads the mind, and merry mind
doth make a helthy man.
Far from thee look thou ever have*
all grim and solemn Syers.
All louring lumpish looks that loathe,
bequeath them to the Fryers.
Make choice of such companions, as
be wise and sweet withal:
Whose talk delightful is to hear,
and void of any gall.
Whose gravity is poudred with,
an honest pleasant mind:
Not tedious to the hearer, nor
vain waster of his wind.
Take such into thy company,
eschew the fleering mate:
The flatterer, and such as where
they come do so we debate.
Use alwaes wholesome exercise,
thy feet to walk assay:
This exercise consumes and wastes
the humours il away.
For long and slothful Idleness,
decays the members all:
And doth disgrace the body quite,
And causes it to fall.
And like as Iron rusteth straight,
with loathsome Canker vile:
If that you suffer it to rest
and use it not a while.
So are our bodies straight defiled,
and unto mischief fall:
If that we let them idle be,
and work them not at all.
Beside a piteous sight it is,
a lamentabie case:
In see the King of Creatures all
lye lame and not have grace.
Nor will to exercise him self,
but Idle still to be:
And through his own great fault blame,
to want his liberty.
By little and little try thy strength,
with certain rule and rate:
Which force with labour will increase,
so it be moderate.
Avoid the air that flames still,
with ouerscorching heat:
And that which ouercolde the members all
doth il entreat.
If these my rules you do observe
I trust you soon shall see:
This cruel raging Gout, as she
deserves destroyed to be.
Enough now have we tried the field,
the Trumpet bids retire:
Heer stands the bownds of mine exploit
and end of my desire.
Soli Deo honour et Gloria.
FINIS.
A Dialogue betwixt the Gout and Cri. Balista.
Gout. ALas poor wretch alas, which way
now shall I turn my sight:
whil as so great a storm of darts
do full upon me light?
O haplesse wretch whom lews aspects,
of hateful stars have torn:
Accursed be the loathsome day:
that ever I was borne.
All appears with darts I am and know
not how my self to save:
My joints are all benumbed so,
and never a foot I have:
What favour more hath nature showed,
to beasts then unto me:
That hath ordained them a mean
to keep their liberty?
Oft times the Stag doth laugh to scorn
the Hunter and his Hound:
The Bore doth laugh and every beast,
that in the woods are found.
And why? for trusting to their feet
they escape the dangers all:
Good feet doth many times prevent,
great mischeefs that would fall.
But I alas more slowly move,
then any Tortoise great:
And lame and feeble as Ilye,
the darts upon me beat.
What now remains? but that to hell
pale death me down doth cast:
And make an end of this my life,
that may no longer last.
Alas and shall I dye?

B. Thou shalt.

G. Who do I hear?

B. Me.

G. Whom?

B. Thy greatest fo.

G. What is thy name?
what Region came thou from?

B. My name Balista is.

G. Why dost
thou shoot thy shaft{is} at me?

B. To make thee dye.

G. I not deserve
so great extremity.

B. A thousand Gallowses thou dost,
a thousand Fires with all:
A thusand racks, a thousand wheels,
and after death doth fall.
A thousand Hells thou dost deserve,
I have not long to tel:
The sundry sorts of torments that
thou hast deserved well.

G. Tel me the cause.

B. The cause is this
that men of worthy fame:
Thou with thy mischievous disease,
hast plagued and stricken lame.

G. Who have I plagued?

B. Who? it were
to much for me to tel:
Alas I am not able for
to stay from weeping well.
Besides a number that thou wretched
beast, bast lamed quite:
While in tormenting of their joints,
thou shewds thy cruel spite.
The good Sedunian Bishop thou
haste caused down to fall:
And overcome, dost keep him yet
in prison, as thy thrall.
Whose worthy life doth glister like,
the Sun with blazing beams:
Him hast thou in thy shackles shut,
and tied up in thy teames.
And therefore dye you shalt.

G. For pity yet
show favour unto me:

B. That can I not.

G. Thou art no steel,

B. I will be unto thee.

G. O spare me yet I thee beseech,
thy Philip shall be free:
And well shall have his health again,
and walk at liberty.

B. I more demand.

G. Whats that?

B. That thou
foul beast, do never such:
The limbs of any virtuous man,
nor trouble any such.

G. To this I grant.

B. I warn thee look,
thou keep thy promise well:
Thy members else asunder will,
I tear and send to hell.

G. Whom wilt thou licence me, with
shackels sharp to take and bind?

B. For that these words that I shall say
to thee lay up in mind.
First set thy shackels upon such,
as always fight and brawl:
And murder on an other still,
for every trifle small.
Whose feet are ever forward, for
to rome unto the sword:
Contrary to the sweet decree,
of Christ our saviours word.

G. But may I be so bold to touch,
the feet of mighty Kings?

B. Yea hardly for thence the roof,
of all this mischief springs.
what Region can you find where Mars,
his Banner hath not spread?
What Country now that is not with
the blood of Christians red?
For what so ever the ambitious minds,
of Princes forth doth bring:
Lis we poor souls that feel the smart,
tis we that only wring.
Go fetter thou their feet with bolts,
that never will away:
Except they cease their madness soon,
and from their follies stay.

G. And whom besides shall I attempt?

B. The burston bellied lout:
To him that scarce for fat can bear,
his loathsome guts about.

G. I never meddle with the paunch,

B. The paunches such I call:
As feed them selves until they be,
as fat as Ox in stall.
And nether feed with word nor life,
the sheep they ought to serve:
But slothful beasts do leave their flock
for hunger like to starve.

G. And shall I touch no more but these?

B. Yes, such as use to swear:
Whorehunters, thieves and surfetters,
their joints in sunder tear.
And for avoiding many words,
I thus conclude with thee:
For bear the virtuous and the good,
plague those that wicked be.

FINIS.
