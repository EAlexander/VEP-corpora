compiled by the most expert master Iherome of Bruynswyke / borne in
Straesborowe in Almayne / ye which hath it first proved / and trewly found by
his awne daily exercysynge. Item there after he hath authorysed and done it to
understand thrugh the true sentences of the old doctors and masters very
expert in the science of Surgery / As Galienus / Ipocras / Auicenna / Gwydo /
Haly abbas / Lancfrancus of mylen / Iamericus / Rogerius / Albucasis /

The Prologe of the noble hand work of Surgery.
TO ye laud of our sauyour Christ Ihesu. the honour of his blessyd moder our
lady saint mary. and all the holy copa ny of heuyn. for the help of mankynde /
this book is translated out of duche in to englis^he And for ye love comfort
of all them that entende to study the noble art of Chyrur gia / ye which is
called the handyworke of Surgery / very vtyle and profytable to al that entende
to occupy this noble sciens ye herein is openly expressed and showed / how it
shall be practysed used / For many one is therein very ignorant yt will meddle there
with / which never laboured nor never sa point of ye beginning or ending
thereof / wherefore it is often times senc and daily chances in small towns /
borowghs / villages / that lyefarre from any good cite or great town ye
dyuerie people hurt or diseased for lack of conynge men / be taken in hand of
them yt be barbers or young masters to whom this sciens was never disclosed /
not thinking on the words of the old lernydmen that say / It is not well
possible to man that he should bring well to a good end yt thing which he
never or hath but little scene. Thus ye yonge studyntys / masters / ieruautes
of barbers and surgyens that entende this noble art conynge / behold / ouerse
/ and rede with diligence this little book that I Iheronims Bruynswyke borne in
Straesborowgh / out of the lyne of Salerne / has with great labour copyled /
set / gadered together to your behoof great profyt this little volume /
thinking on many noble auctours in divers bokys / which playuly doth specesy
/ Iursyd be those that god hath with conynge endowed to the health / succour /
help of mankynde / will not occupy it. But vlessyd be they that among his
euyn crysten will liberally sheme and mynistre such gifts of grace as god
has endewyd him with for the preserua cyon of man. Wherefore my frendys think
yt ye may now for a little money have great learning conynge to your honour
profit / the which herafter ye might fortune not to get for ten times so
much gold as it should cost you now.

Oy yonge brgynnynge surgyens unclose yourerys w all your diligence and mark
well the words of the great masters which command you when ye be called or
desired to any pacyent or diseased parsone / that if the dyseas fall to your
conynge to ponderous / that ye be not fully parfyte / than be not ashame but
quicly get another discrete surgyen or ^mayndesyrynge them that they will
help ^ sell you in yt besynes at your need * sor yo^ honesty lyath in that
cure / also the great coforte of your paeyet so dy^eased. Ey^st ye learn by
chance / that thing that ye seldon or never have scene before. Serodarily / if
ought in your hands happen to misfortune * that ye other may quycly than
amend it. Thyrdly / that the wounded parson have ye less grudge or mystrust
in you. Fourthly / When the cure hath good speed / tha be ye parttaker of al the
honour thereof / if yt misfortune fall between your handys / than be they boude
every man to bear the charge of your hinder and losses / which were to much
for you alone.

Fyftly / for this wise dede ye be praised of all them that be discrete or
learned men yt speak of you / which say / he desires to learn / and will not
that any man should be by him neglygently spylt or peryshed. and thus mayye
come to yone poncpose with honesty and pleasure / which else might turn to
yourgrete shame dysplesure.

Also ye may consydere that two may better amend a fawte tha one / for no
only workman can well parceyue the fawtys of his own work alone till he hath
very lunge wrought upon it / or else ne'er hand fynyshte hit / and than is it
sometime evil ipostyble to be mendyd / but pryncypally in many operacyons
belonging to surgery / Therefore when ye go two or more about the pacyent / take
heed that ye make no dyscorde* In like wise when any of you be present alone
with your pacyent / blame ^at the other that is absent / nor dyffame him not
But what ye have to say withe each other let that be secrete within your self
for grewynge of your pacyente / for it might turn him to great payne
hyndraunce in his dyseas through your dyscoforte. The one shall follow the
others counsel and (...) shall ^de nothing from each other that ye shall
think profytable beho^ for your pacyent or seek body / for (...) turn you to
shame / and him to great payne. Also ye ought not only to be ^pert in surgery
but also in astronomy or philosophy / wher^ore ye shall diligently study often
rede such things as for you in this matter or scyens shall be vtylle profytable
whereby ye shall have parfytte vnderstondynge knowledge of your noble science
that ye do enterprise / ye shall for no gold nor silver take in hand ye
thing that ye think is incurable / or not likely to be cured / for sauyge of
your goodname Also ye shall not praise yourself / nor blame none other. Item
ye shall also counforte your pacyent how so ever it be with him but to his good
frendys ye shall show the truth give them parsyte knowledge of his dyseas.
Also ye should know under stoned parfytly your Anathomia / which is the
gaderynge and also ye dysmebrynge of the lymmes of ye body / becauseye should
preserve man for the iopardy of death / if it need required that ye should cut
him in any place would doing to him any scathe and to yourselffe an
everlasting / shame / and great dishonesty.

Here begins the handworke of Anothomia in general / of ye members / skin
flesh / veins / senowys / and bonys.


The Anothomia in general
THe skin is a covering of the hole vnyuersall body woven out of the veins
senewes / made for the defence of ye wits of man / and ye same skin is
twain indyfferet. The one doth cover the uttermost membre / that is named the
very skin / The other covers the innermost part of the membrys and it is
named panniculus / or pannycle / that is as a flece / like as by the felles or
chambres of the brain / and pyrocraneum is ye thyn flece above the braynpanne
/ and ye panycle of the rybbes is named Pleura and Siphac / and the pannycle of
the heart and other. c. Here after follows the fatnesses / some is within the
skin that is na / med greece / some is within by ye belly about the kydneys and
that is named talowe

Tha comes the flesh which be in. iij. manners / some is pure simple flesh
/ as is only the yard and the gomys of the teeth / that other is as carnel^ys
/ like the flesh of the coddys of the breast / the iij. is copre hendynge
almost overall the hole body is named caroplena lacertis. Than begins the
synewes to take their effect of the brains of the mary of the back / After
yt the veins takes their effect of the liver and of ye heart. Than follows
the bonys of ye body / and of them be in nobre. CC. xlviij. beside ye small
bonys that be called ossa cisanina and the bone laud / whereon ye tongue is
fowndyd. The nails be made on the uttermost part of ye mebres because they
should ye stronghyer grype and hold all manner of things. The hear is ordained
for fayrnes and to purifye the manyfolde partis of the body.

The anothomia of the composyde membris. Ca. ij.
HEre begins of the heed / and pryncypally of the brains / of the pan^ that
kepeth ye brains together / for that is ye place dwelling of ye reasonable
soul and all that is heard is namyd the (...) of the heed / and therein be ye
vnderstadynge members / that is in the highest part of man / the quantyte of
the brains of mankynde is much more tha it is of any other reature /
considering the strength of ma agyanst the gretnes of other dome creatures.
The {per}ties of this pane be. x. or. xj. first without is the hear / than ye
skin / than flesh of lacertes / than a gross pannycle or flece / than the
pan / than ^in be ij. small fleces named dura matter / and pia matter / than
the substance of the brains / and after the substance of ye brains is again
pia matter / and after that / lyath that marvelous net and is named Rethe
mirabile / tha above that is named the foudacion of the brains / out of the
which the senewes take their beginning. That panicle that is named of Galien^
pericraneum doth covers all the hole pan / is somewhat like to senewes /
and grows of dura matter / of her is strongly bownde senewes veins / after
this is craneu found and is named the pan of the heed / and that is not a
hole bone / but. vii. bonys ordained to each other / and that is because of
this / yfone by fortune were hurt in ye one bone / yt the other shulde not be
perysshed / and they be gadered together like a seem or a thing like the teeth
of. ij. saws joined in one / to thentent that the some of the heed should have
an yssewe. The first bone of the pan is named coronale going from the
myddest orbitarum to the ^whart joints of the pan / and therein be hoolys of
ye iyen and the out berynge of the nose / depart through a little bone like a
cock^s comb / but in ye women it is often founden that the coronale is divided
ouertwhart in the myddest of the forheed. The. ij. bone is of ye hinder part /
and namyd occipiciale / is closyd through a joint coming over thwarte ilyke
manner of this figure / is harde / thrugh persed / where as Nucha which is the
mary yt comith in / through ye rydge bone or chyne to ye end of the back The.
iij.. iiij. bone be in the myddys of syd^am be namyd Parietales / be divided
through a joint by ye length of ye pane coming to the bonys of ye eerys / they
be iiij. square. The. v. ye syxt bone be called Petrosa for their hardness /
also they be namyd Medosa / they be gaderyd with ye bonys by ye sides where as the
holys of ye erys the clensynge of the breast be in / be led toward ye commyssure
of the bone la^de to ye myddys of the temple bonys. The. vij. is yt fundament
bone namyd Basillare / is facyoned like a cradyll / and supports all the for
said bonys above the rose of the ^o^th / thus ye shall understand yt there be
vi^. manner of bonys in the pot of the heed which is all the vpperparte. thus
is to be vnderstade that therbe. vij. boys that keep the brains in. / yet
there be other bonys yt be no pryncypallys as ye bone c^yste which deuydeth the
nose thryllys between the coronall bone / there be other bonys that be namyd
Paria belonging to the face / and not to the pan / also there be crokyd bonys
under the bone of the eerys where as musculus is plated in / which opyn ye Jawe
bonys. The lymmys that in the inner part of the heed be holden we can not
show parfytely with ye Iye nor kno^ therefore we shall deuyde ye (...) pan
with a saw roundabou^ heed / and when they lift up ye (...) per part from the
neder part / ye first that follows is dura matter pia matter / and be ij.
s^nowlyke panycles / wyndynge about keeping in the holl substa^ce of the brayn
/ of dura matter grows through the comissures of ye pane pericraneu / of pia
matter is genyn ye fode of the brains / of he^ comes veins vain strigys fro
withinforth through ye holys of the undermost bonys / without forth through ye
comys^res of ye uppermost bonys.

The knowledge of ye. x. wits. v. interyall. and. v. comune wits. as it
scewyd i ye picture of the heed. (...).

AFter pia matter follows ye substance of the brain / and is soft whyt / and
round of figure when the addycyons be taken from her The brain hath. iij.
cellys or chambers somewhat lunge / and each celle hath. ij. partis / and in
every part is a part of our understanding / In the first celle is our common
wyttis / as it is expressly scene in this figure of ye heed / these be they
Saying in ye iyen / Smelling in ye nose / Tastynge in ye tongue / Hearing in ye
ears / Fylynge overall ye body. In the second is the ymagynacyon / in the.
iij. is wynynge reason / in ye. iiij. is remebrauce memory / there be ways from
the one to ye other / to the^tent that ye spirytis may have their fre course
from one to another / and in the first celle be more addycyons wherein is closyd
our smelling / thereof grows. ij. couples of synowes / they be led to the
iyes / to the erys / to the tongue / to the stomach / to other lymes through
holys closyd with panycles. By the second cell^ mark the place yt is namyd
lacuma / vermiformis / anchaformis / and the cornell flesh. And under ye
panycle is rethe mirabile yt only is woven with vaynst^ingis coming from the
heart / in the which is coprehendyd under fonge ye quick understanding
spiritys. Fynally / mark how that nucha or that rydge bone mary grows of the
last part of the brain / whereof pryncypally all our meuynge vnderstadynge
synowys have there first original begynyng / thus is ye A^nothomia of ye brayn
pane openly know may suffer many wouder hurtis / but ye ne^er ye brayn ye
worse. and in ye workynge of the heed if need require you shalt cut ye same
flesh of the heed according as ye here gothe which way so ever it be.

The anothomia of the face. ca. iij.
THe {per}tys of ye face be these / ye forheed browys / iyes / eerys / templis
/ chekys / mowth / iawys / with her teeth. The forheed hath but ye skyne upon ye
musculy / or flesh called lacerte / for ye bone yt is under it is of the
coronall bone / and is raised toward ye upper table like a dowble bone makes
ye form of ye brows. The brows be made for beauty / set above ye iyen with
here for to defend them / ye cuttynge yt is done to them must go after ye
length of the body / not ye way yt ye frounces go. The iye be ye instrumetis of
ye sight / be ordained a part in ye coronall bone by ye bonis of ye temple / ye
iye be made of. vij. cotys. iiij. humours / The first cote is without forth is
namyd / coiunctiua alba / and grossa / that roneth about the iye / and grows
of the panycle that covers ye brayn pane / after this there be. iij.
material circles yt run about the iye / and because they be so differet of
colours they be called yride or rain bowys / there be. iij. of these cotys yt
comes from the side of ye brains /. iij. from the utter parties / ye first
cote grows of dura matter / ye inner part thereof is named scly^otica / ye
uttermost part is named cornea The other cote grows of pia mr. / ye iner
part thereof is named secudina / the utter most thereof is named v^ea / hath the
hole of the ball of the iye. The third grows of the senowe optico / the
inner part thereof is named retina / and the uttermost thereof upon the bright
crystallyn is named Aranea / to this be. iiij. princypall moystours The first
moystour is named cristallyna / and it is set in the myddis of the iyen / and
is of colour like crystal / and is facyoned like a hayll stone / wherein the
sight is pricypally foudyd / after yt toward ye braynis is vitreous humour
which holds circuyteth from behind ye crystallyn humour these twain be
wode about with one panycle in ye senewe optico / after yt from before is the
humour albugyneus yt is whytysshe / and is conclud^d between ^he (...) be before
said the web yt grows of pia matter: G^enus alegith another moystours is in
ye region of the balle of the iye / and that is clear of a heuenly element
colour and is hole fomys^he or scomye / and this is the coposyssyon of the iye
in him self. The iye has cartilag^ above under which we name the iye lyddis
with here that close from above with one musclus / opyn with twhart musclus. The
nose hath flesshy / ^onye / and grystly partis / the flesshy {per}te hath a
skyne and. ij. musclus by each other and the bony part hath. ij. tryangle bonis
/ which corners comes on the nose shyftynge them on the one side along ye
nose / coming down to ye cheke / the grystyll {per}te is of two manners / the
one is without that ^acyneth the utter part of the nose / and ye other
deuydeth the ynner part of the nose thryllys. And the. ij. holys of ye nose
ascend upward to ye bonys colatorij / be addyd to mamillares cerebri / where
as ye smelling hath his begynynge / these go backward down to the rowfe of the
mowth behind vuula / through which holys is drawyn the brethynge vapour / both
out and in / the superfluyte of the brains puryfyde. The eeris be grystly upon
ye petrosu bone ordained for to here / to the which yt come otwahrt holys unto
the ^enewes of ye brains where the heerynge is / under the eerys is flesh
like carnellis that makes the puryfienge of ye brains / by the which goothe.
ij. veins yt convey ye spermatyke or seedly matter or substance down to the
ballockis. The temples / leyres / chek^ / be the parties of the sydys of the
face / and have in them much musclus flesh: first there be. vij. meuyng the
chekys and the upper lyppys / after these be. xij. that meue the undermost Jawe
bone / some opening it that come from beside the erys / and some closing it /
and they come from above beside ye teples bonys / if they bewoudyd / it is
great jeopardy. Though it seem yt there be but ij. bonis gadered to gender above
the nose / yet some say there be nyne.:* There be. v. partis of ye mouth / ye
lyppys teeth / tongue / rowfe / and vuula / ye which is a little deem hanging
in ye throat like the spin. The teeth of the nature of the bonys / of them
be. xxxij. that is in every cheke ^one or Jawe xvi. of the which ij. be named
duales. ij. quadrupli. ij. canini* ij. caysales. iij. molares. have rotis
festenyd in the Jawbonys / some one rote / some ij. some more. The toge is a
soft flesshy / spongy part / made of many seynowes / stryngys / veins /
pricypally ordained for the spece favourable taste / to rule the mete in the
mouth. Under ye tongue is a cornell flesh / where as. ij. holys like mouths
be in / where the spetyll comes out of: Behind the tongue is the Jawflesshe by
(...) rowf of ye mouth with knotys like an ^ and between those. ii. hangs
vuula (...) saith / is ordained to take the air and to make it apt. The upper
{per}te of ye mouth is named the rowf / is covered with a panycle / takes his
beginning on the forner part of ye maw or stomach.

Of the neck / and back bone. Ca. iiij.
TWo parts be in the neck / some do holden / some be holden / The holding
parts be these / shynne flesh / muscl^ stryngys / and bonys. The {per}tes
that be holdyn be these. the throat bolle or trachea / ^sophagus or meri / that
is where the mete gothe through Epiglotu or gula / veins and strings / and a
part of nucha. First is trachea arteria / that is a way of the brethe or ayr^
coming frome the longues to the throat which is gaderyd bound to the side of
merry with a strong soft panycle / after the throat on the spondyles is merry /
or ysophag{is} / is a way of the descedyng of our sode / gothe from the throat
to dyafragma is made out of. ii. cotys. the innermost is festyned with ye
skin of the mouth / and the uttermost cote is festyned to the panicle of the
belly is fleshye / on these. ii. ways on the side of the mouth is Gula or
Epiglotus / is a grystly part made for the voce / is the place of the
swelowynge down.:. Here after follows ye dowble senowes to the stomach / and
to the lymmes descendynge / again ascendynge upward by Epyglot{is}. After
these be great veins and strings namyd Guidegi / or Apopleti / or subetales.
The divided {per}tes go upward through the sides or the neck unto ye highest
parts / the cuttynge of these be very ieo{per}dus. Spodyle or rydge bone is al
through percyd or boryd / where as Nucha or back mary gothe through / there as
ye senowes in the side gothe up down / the back is it that gothe from ye heed
to the romp bone out of many strong spondyles following each other for the
defence of the back mary which be. xxx. in nobre. vii. in the neck.. xii. by
the should{er}s. v. by the lymmys above the hyppys. after the bone called the
holy bone / there be. iiii. In the neck be. vii. stodyles through ye which
gothe. vii. cowpies of senowes from that part of Nucha that gothe throught it
/ the which bear me uyng to the shulders / armies / some places of the heed
neck Thus do as before is said in the neck / work by ye length for it is
the right way of al ye {per}tes in ye neck.

Of the shulders / armies / and the great hands. Ca. v.
Descending from ye neck doth follow a graet rysynge like a hill / and on the
highest part thereof the shulders be platyd / and yt should{er} bonys be twain
First behid is one broad and thyme on the back party / on yt side of the
ioyntys it is somewhat lunge roude like a haft with. iii. edgys / the first is
holowe / the other above crooked sharpe like ye bill of a crane. That other bone
is named Os furfale / or the forked bone / and is roude festyned in a holownes
in ye upper part of the breast / hath. ii. brauches like a fork / the one
gothe to the one shoulder / the other gothe to the other shoulder / byndyth the.
ii. sharpe crokydendys / and is a hole deffence preserving of all the
should{er} wyntys. The part under the ioyntys of the arm pyttys is made of
cornell flesh / wherein is showed the purging of the heart Galien{is} deuydeth
the arm in. iii. great parties / the first part is a above ye oxcellys or arm
pyttys. the other part is namyde the little arm / the third ye little hade.
The stryngys opyne senowys that be found in the arm coming to the oxcellys
there be deuydyd in twain. The one goth on the highest of the armies / that other
part to the undermost part of the armies.. The veins that ascend be divided
in branches / the one goth up behind the should{er}s to the heed / the other
descendyth is yet divided in twain other branches / where of the one brauche
is divided through the arm on the utter side in divers places / is named funis
brachii / which is the rope of the arm. The other brauche comes up through
the upper part of the arm and is opened showed through ye bendynge of ye
elbow / is namyd Cephalica or the chef vain. From thens it comes for the on
the hand between ye thombe the fore finger / and is namyd cephalica ocularis.
The other veins frome the oxcellis that come to the under part of the arm
show them self in ye bought of ye arm / and is namyd basilica which is the
vain of the liver / from thens it descendyth down between ye gold finger and
the little finger / and is namyd saluatella / when the ii. fornamyd vaynys be
in the bought of the arm / than is there another vain scene between them both
/ and is namyd mediana corporalis / and thus there be in the arm. v. great
veins / and so many strings / the which be very ieopardus to stanch if
they were woundyd or cut. Of Nucha through ye spondiles of the neck descendynge
to every arm. iiii. pryncypall senowes / that meue and stere the aduitory or
little arm / and out of it comes. v. senowes into the hand that meue the
fyngers / and they show the self openly on the three fyngers towards the
ioyntys / which is dangerous to be wooded. In ye arms be great stryngys
stryngys the come from the bonys going through ye ioyntys / and keep them
joined / the which were very ieopardus to be cut. The bone namyd vlna or
adiutoriu / is a great bone full of mary / roude at both endys / but above it
hath but one roudnes / and beneth it hath. ii. the uppermost goth into the
holowe of ye gabone / makes the joint of the sholders / and the nether end
which hath. ii. roudnes is divided in. ii. and goth into ye holownes of the.
ii. bonys that be namyd focilium / and they make the ioyntys of the elbows
where as the little arm begyneth / in which little arm be ii. focill bonys /
that be namyd ossa focilia / and the grettest is benethe / and that goth
toward ye little finger / show a rownde knot outward / the small focille
bone goth above from the bought of the arm to the hand toward the thombe /
and in both ye upper part of these. ii. bonys be pyttes / or holys by ye
elbow / receive the roundness namyd graduales / of the bone called aduitorii /
by the handys they have pyttys also / which receive the roundne of ye ioyntys
of the hand / and be festenyd just unto the bonys of ye hand making ye
ioyntys / the which ioyntys be. iii. hepys of bonys / and ye uppermost be
gadered with a round nes in the pyttes of the nethermost. In the first hepe be.
iii. bonys / for the addycion of focilles kepeth above the place of a bone. In
the second hepe be. iiii. bonys / there above is a little box wherein is
festenyd ye first bone of the thombe. The bonys of the ii. fornamyd hepys be
short. The first hepe is namyd rafeta / or corp{is}. The other hepe is named
Pectenor Metacorpus.. In the iii. hepe be. iiii. bonys longer than the first In
every finger be. iii. bonys / and the fyngers be in nombre. v. therefore there
be xv. bonys in the fyngers. And in the (...) xi. ii. in the little arm. i. in
the upper (...) And thus there be in the hole arm and hade xxix. bonys. and
these must be cut for to becurydall lunge ways / like as the sacerres and
musclus gothe..

The Anothomie of the breast and his parties a mebres Ca. vi.:.
THe parties in the breast be some holden some that be hold The pappys or brestys
be made as it were a cornelly whyt flesh like a sponge / made with veins /
stryngys / and senowes / and there fore they have a festenynge of the liver of
the heart. The lacertes or musclus be many divers some with the skin named
Dyafragma / some do be lunge only to the breast / some to ye rybbes / some to the
back. Therbe. iii. manners of bonys in the breast. In the first part be. vii.
bonys namyd ossa thoracis Thereby on the side of gula is receyuyd the holowes of
Fircula / under fircula by the ^roppe of the maw or stomach is a grystly
addytamente namyd Cusifornu. On the hinder part be. xii. spondiles where as
nucha passes through / whereof wax or grow. xii. cowple of senowes / ye
which bring sterynge and me nynge to ye musclus or flesh of that part On
every side be. xii. rybbes. vii. ryghtewys rybbes / v. mendosa rybbes or faint
rybbes be cause they be not hole as ye other ryghtwys rybbes ^e. For to do the
Anothomia well of the lymmes that be holden ye must cut the breast towardys the
lyde / put away the first part for mediastum / than may ye inner part be scene
/ of ye which the heart is the first in the myddest of the breast / descendynge
a little toward ye left side / for the place of the liver / and to thentent
that it should give rome or place to ye stryngys. The form or shape of the
heart is like a pine apple / for the point of ye heart gothe toward the neder
lymmys or membrys of the body / the breed of the which is ye root gothe
vpwardys. The substance of the heart is harde having on every side a vetrycle
or holownes / and in ye myddyst a pytt as Galien{is} saith / in which is
consumed the gross fedynge blode that comes from the liver / and is made pure
/ is sent by the veins throughout all the parties of the body. First to the
brains / there it conceives another nature and becomes animalis or
vnderstadinge / to the liver where as it becomes natural fedynge / to the
stones or coddys for generation / so forth to all other membrys or lymmes /
makes them quycke or gives them lyf. The heart is an instrument of al powers
and might of the body / a fulcome bond or festener of ye soul / in it be.
ii. orificias or mowthes and through the right orifice roneth a brauche of ye
ascendynge veins / bringing up the blode frome the liver / descendith frome
thens downward again to vena arterialis for to fed ye longues. Of the lift
orifice gothe ye betynge vain / namyd vena pulsatilis / whereof one part gothe
to ye longues / and it is namyd vena venalis / berynge the vapours capinosos to
the logues / and ledynge the air in / for to cole the hart with all / upon
this orifice be. iii. panycles or skynes opynyng and closing / the passage of
ye blode. By this orifice be. ii. little eerys joined to the heart / where as
the air or breath goth out and in toward the longues. Also there is a little
grystell bone in it for to strength the heart with. The heart is coueryd with a
strong panicle namyd precordiu / where as the senowes come to / be boude with ye
longues festenyd / and subportynge through mediastinu. Upon ye heart comes ye
longues fleing wauynge for to cole it / whose substance is spongye / whyt soft
/ in yt which be. iii. holownessis.. The first is ye veins which grow out
of ye right ventrycle of the heart / the vain that grows out of the lift
ventrycle / the brauches yt comes from the throthe bring wind or breath to ye
heart. The longues hath. v. lobos or feders. iii. in the right side / and. ii.
in those ft side. Behind the longues / after the. v. spondyle goth merry / ye
vain tracea ascedynge / both these pass through dyafragma. Also there pass
through it matter adorthi that doth ascend fro the heart / all these with the
vein Trachea make a hepe fyllyd with panycles and strong bondys / with
caruelly flesh to gula. After this be in the breast. iii. panycles. First the
panycle that fro within doth couere the rybbys named Pleura. The other is
mediastinu / departyth the hole carkes in both sides. The third is dyafragma
/ and yt divides ye spyrytuall lymmys or mebrys from ye fedynge mebrys / and
is made out of pleura and syphac / of the short panycle that growyth of the
senowes between ye spondyles is most by ye rybbes / whose operation is for to
draw the air to her / for to withdryue ye superfluyte as Galien{is}
testyfyeth.

Of ye belly his mebrys. Ca. vii.
Merry is ye crop of ye neck going inwardly thrugh ye neck / till yt he
makyth a hole through dyafragma / where un to he is fast bound / dyafragma goth
into ye last {per}te of ye breast there as ye mouth of the maw or stomach
doth sprede him. The work of the stomach is dysgestyon / for it hath ye liver
on the right side / warning herself with the lobys or lymmes / ye mist thwart
on ye lift side with her fat veins for to drive away melacoly or heuynes / for
to lyghte releue ye appetite. Above it is (...) gyuyng her quyknes unto ye
brains lo^ have ye vndstadyng of feeling. Also it hath of ye back {per}te ye
senowes namyd chylym adorthi / where as it is bound with / unto ye spodiles of yt
kydnes. Unto ye vndmost mouth of ye stomach begyneth the guttys / and they be in
nobre. vi. ye first is namyd duodenu. for he is xii. inches loge. and is also
namyd portenare{is} / for he is ye vndmost {per}^e of ye stomach / like as meri
is up{per}most. The. ii. is ylio / is loge small / is woude up by ye back by
ye lyskes The. iii. is ieiuniu / for he is ever empty / because he is so nygh
the gall / there come to hi ye small veins mise raice / he receives ye colera
yt comes between hi portenariu. The. iiii. is cec{is} or sacc{is} / is ye
blind gut / or second maw or moke / is about ye length of a shaftmet / hath.
i. orificiu to receive ye hole fylthynes yt comes of ye first dysgestyo of ye
bowels. The. v. is namyd Colon / is gross fullof holownes / where as ye
fyshynes receives her form. The. vi. is namyd Longaon / and that is the ars
gut. The Liver is a place an organ of the second dysgest yo engendryng blode
set in the right side under the short rybbes / and is formed like a moan /
hath. v. little panys in the manner of a hade / wherewith passes above the
stomach. The Liver with her panycle is boude on Dyafragma with the back /
stomach / gut / and hath collygacyo with the heart / kydney / coddys / with
all mebrys Her substance is redflesshy like blode that is stollydor ron / is
full of synewes. Of the holownes of the liver comes a vain named the gate /
is divided in many small veins that be namyd miseraice / yt be platyd in ye
stomach / in the guttys draw out all the moisture of the vain Chyli / is
divided with her rotys through all ye liver / and of the hill of the liver
comes the vain Chylis / draws from the liver all the blode that is in it
engendered / beryn ge that blode for to fed ye hole body. In the myddys of ye
liver where it is hollow doth lay a little bladder yt is namyd the gall or deyned
to receive ye su{per}fluyte of Colera / it hath. ii. oryfyces / one in the
myddest of ye liver for to receive the colera. The other gothe aloge down by
the bothom of ye sto make / for to puryfye the guttys to drive out the colera.
The mylt is ordained in the left side ouerthwartly enbrasynge ye stomach / is
bound with her panycle to iii. eybbys with her back / with her hollow nes to ye
stomach The kydners be twain the one is ordernid for to purysy the blode the
watery su{per}fluyte / in them is a holownes wherein they receive such as they
draw to them. In each of them be. ii. entrees / through the one they draw ye
wate ^y humour of the vain Chyli / also from the liver. Through the other they
send vryn water to the bladder / and the kydnes be joined to the back be fat
roude about Behind the kydnes by the spodyles be the lymmes or nether rydge
bones there on restrynge as on a quylt / or matrys. Between yt kydnes passes ye
veins Chyli A dorthi to the netherm^mmes / by the which veins very ny^he
grows the semynall vessellys.

Of the flanks herpartyes Ca. viii.
Of the flanks ye shall und stand the nether part of ye belly frome the lap
to the secrete membrys / be of. ui. manners / somholde / as myrach / Siphae /
Sir bus / the bonys / some be holden / as ye semi nall vessellys / the moder or
matrix in a wo ma / the fudament gut / the senowes vay nes ye comes
downward. In every of them is a gryat bone / they be ordained together with a
great spodyle namyd ossis sacris on the back side / and on the for part
making of ye genytour bone / namyd os pectinis. Thus these bonys go abroad over
both ye sides of ye lymmes of the hyppes / where through having in the great
holys doth go both senowes / veins / strings / they be also but small by ye
side of pectinis / by the secrete members. In the myddest of them yt nether
part by the boxys or holownes / or pixides / wherein be stryngys of ye bonys.
Of the lymmes yt be holden is first ye bladder / is like a bag / where in is
gadered the su{per}flue water / or vryne / that comes of the kydneys / ye
bladder is of. ^i. strong panicles / is roundand great about the quatite of a
pynte. In it be. ii. loge ways named porri vritides / coming from the kydneys
a side half / berynge the vryne from ye kydneys. The neck or pipe of the
bladder is flesshy with closing and onclosynge lacertys or musculys / going
from the bladder beudyd through the myddys unto the yard of the man But in a
woman without beudynge / the quatyte of. ii. inches with there secrete mebre /
through that is the vryne drives.

Of the grain or semynall vessellys. Ca. ix.
THe semynalle vessellys be in them self veins / that have their beginning
by the kydneys / of the veins of Chyli and Adorati / descendynge be^ge the
blode to the coddes / both (...) man and woman / wherefore in the last^yon the
sede is namyd sperma / which is the sede of our humayne nanature. In a man
these vessellys be outwardys / for their coddys be without / and the women's
vessels be within / for their coddys or stones be within / and by this may be
marked that this sede hath the nature of the heart / the liver / and ye kydneys
and the brain / for this cause / for to make dilectacyon / the senowes com
from ye brains to the stones / also the hole body hath felowshyp therewith. The
matrix or moder is an acker of the generation of mankynd / and an organ for to
conceyne / whose manner posycyo or place is between ye bladder fudament / and is
made of. ii. strong pannycles / and is round / and hath armis with coddys or
stones like ye purse of ye coddis hath a thing like a belly i ye myddyl and a
neck holowe and small at the end like a manys yard that is crokyd / hath a
cleft namyd vulua / and hath aprepuciu or covering like a manys yard / and is
of length. viii. or. ix. inches. And though she hath. ii. holownessys yt be
openly know after the nobre of her brestys or pappis yet she hath each divided
in. iii. cellys or chabres / and one in the myddys / and thus she hath. vii.
cellys or places of coceyuyng She hath also collygacyon with the brains / heart
/ liver / and the stomach / and is bound to the back / between her and the
brestys be joined to gydder the milk and the menstruall veins. Therefore
Ypocras saith that the womans milk is the brother of mestruum. And Galienus
saith therefore that the woman can nathaue their costumable disease of menstruum
give milk at one time. Under ye moder is ye right fundament which is the
keeper of the su{per}fluyte of the first dysgestyon / and is made of panycles /
and is of the length of a shaftment / rechynge nygh to the kydneys /
stretchynge in length nyghe to the romp bonys and the undermost part of it is
namyd the ars / and the ars gut hath collygacyo with the bladder / therefore in
their sekenes they suffer with each other. The mannys y^ is a plowman of the
nature of mankynd / and is also a way of the vryne / is made of skyne /
musclus / veins / senowes / and gross stryngys / and it is plantyd upon the
bone Pectinis / and ye bondys com from the bone Sacris / or holy bone. In the
yard be. ii. pryncypall ways or pypes / the one for the sede / and the other
for the vryn. The end of the yard is namyd Ballanum the hole is namyd mitra.
The first ouergoynge skin of the yard is prepucium / and the yard is
commonly. viii. or. ix. finger breed lunge / and must be of reasonable bygnes /
according to the quantyte of the matrix or moder. Permenium or Peritonium is
the place between the ars and the yard / the which is a seem that follows
the lyne of the yard. Inguina or lyskes be ye clynsers of ye liver / ordained
in ye foldys of the thyges. Nates be the buttocks / ordained upon ye bone
semoris / and is grofe lacertous flesh.

Of the shynnes / and great fete. Ca.. x.
THe great foot or the shynne bone contynueth of ye joint Scie / or the
thyghes / to the uttermost part of the articles. This great foot is divided
in. iii. ye first is ye thygh the other is the shynne. the third is the little
foot. When the veins be descendyd with branches from their beginning to the
last spondyle or backbone / tha be they divided in. ii. parties. The one goth to
the right bray or thyghe / ye other to ye lift / and comme branch wise down
through the shynnes to the fete / and make. iiii. veins. The first is named
Sophena / of the innermest holownes of the anclewe. The secound / Sciatica on
the utter part of it. The third / Poplitica between the great too and the
other. The. iiii. is Renalis / between the little too and ye other. These veins
be let blode for divers dyseases / for this cause there be in the shynnes.
iii^. great veins that oftetymes brings in great course of blode with peril
and Jeopardye Auice. saith yt the senowes of ye fete come from ye fenowes of ye
hadys / but they take their beginning from the last spondylle of the kydneys
/ and the bone sacri. It is to be understand that by the form or dysposycyon
of musclus yt woudes by the ioyntys be peryllous / and sore to be feryd. The
gross boundys come out through ye shynys and be openly shewyde from beneth by
the knees and on the helys / and in the ioyntys of the articles / the sole of
the foot is all full of bounds.

Of the bonys in the great foot. Ca.. xi.
THe first that is namyd the thygh is a great mary bone / and round at both
the endys The uppermost roundues is named Uertebrum / and enters in ye broad
bonys of the hanches. The nether part toward ye knee has. ii. roundnessys /
which come in. ii. holownessys of the first shynne bone namyd Osfocile / and
thereon is a roud broad bone namyd the worle bone or knee shyue / and so is the
knee full made. Tha^ weth the shynne bone / and therbe. ii. (...) namyd focilia
/ ye byggest ^ former side makyd the gaderynge of ^es / and comes down from
the kn^ onto ye foot / and makes the anclewe on the inner side. The other on
the utter side like wise desce dynge shyftynge her self to the foot by the
other focili bone / and makes ye vttermeste anclewe / and these. ii. shynne
bonys make between them both one holownes / where as the first bone of the
foot is received in. And in ye foot be. iii. acyes or gaderynge of bonis In ye
first acyes be. iii. boys gadered together i one rowndnes. The first of these
iii. bonys is namyd Cahap / or Astralagus and is round onether side. In the up
permost roundness is festyned in the holownes of focilium / and there hath the
foot meuynge. In the other roundness is festyned the holownes of the bone namyd
Nauicularis. Than followed incontinent upon the foot the bone named Cahab. The
bone Nauicularis is like a shypholow on both sides. In ye first holownes is
received the roundness of the bone Cahap. In the other holownes comes the
roundness and gaderynge of the bonys of the foot. Under these. ii. bonys is made
the hole bone proporcyon of the heal / wherein is festynyd the hole foot / and
beryth outward behind for ye great bondis that be in it. Now vndstande that
after the bone Nauiculare is in continent the second hepe of the bonys of ye
foot / wherein be. iii^. short bonys / of ye which the one is namyd
Grandinosum. These bonys be round according to the bone nauiculare / and be
round toward ye third hepe of the bonys. In the third hepe be v. bonys loge
/ and receyuynge the articles of the toes / which be also. v. in nombre / each
hath. iii. bonys save ye great toe has but. ii. bonys. Thus there be in the
little ^te. xxvi. bonys. And in the hole great foot be. xxxviii. bonys. Thus may
a surgyon mark by this / howe he should break dysmembre / and join again
together / among all other the little foot is most dangerous to dysmembre /
and set again together / and the lyghtest is the knee / and the myddelmost is in
the thyghe. (...).

Here endyh the Anothomia of the body of a man / for to know ye cuttynge /
dysmembrynge and ioynynge again Here after follows the science and conyn^ of
Surgery




Of the helynge of small vuoudis, Ca, xii.
AFter the declaracio that is made of the Anathomia / ye shall understand that
I will begyne by ordre the handworke of surgery / first I will begyne with the
woudes / that be hewydor betyn only through the skyne unto the flesh / how ye
shall demeue your self to cure and heal them by the grace of god. Compelle and
join the lyppes of the woudes together (...) your hand / and lay tow thereto
with the white of an egg / tempered with a little common salt and bind it
according to the need. The woudyd joint must rest and be holdyn styll / for
through rest it must be cured or else other accydentis will put back your cure
through effusyos or corrup cyos of blode / non other curing is of need so that
the woude be without payne and ye depth well dysposyd / but if there be great
pair in it / for that should be a tokyn that the fas in the depth were hurt /
or the pannycle that is between the flesh and the bone which covers the
bone. Mark the words of Guidonis that saith / ye shall never begyne to heal a
would till all other ipedimetis be first voydyd from it / which to fallyngis or
accidentis happen most in great woundis.

Of the stichyng^ or festenynge of great woudis in the flesh. ca. xiii.
When there come to ye any great woude / that is not only through the skyne /
but also through ye flesh unto ye bone / without and to fallyngis or
accidetis. Than shyft the lyppes of it together proply and clean / and tha
festyne them according to their need. which festenynge may happen in diverse
manners whereof I will writ the most common. If the wound be than so great that
that byndynge only ware not enough for it. Or if ye wound were over twhart a
hole (...) / and that the lyppys of the wound drew ^de a sonder / might not be
bound together. Than shyfte ye lyppys or vpperparte of the woudis together / and
beware there come no manner of onclennes of dust / here / oil / nor non other
thing that the gadered helynge thereby might be let. Than take a iii. square
nedyll as the skyners occopy / and se that the nedyll be holowe graven out
about theiye / so that ye thread that shall go therein may lay flat in ye
holownes. The thread shall also be twyned together without any knottys waxed
wherewith ye shall festyne / and the feste / nynge is in. v. manners. First the
common festenynge as to the foresaid belongs / is that ye shall set the first
stiche in ye myddis of the woundys lyppys / the other a finger broad between
every. ii. stiches / and so to the end till there be stiches enough / but
begyne never at the end / thentent that the woude may be ye purer festenyd
^out any fro^cys. Therefore ye stiches shall be always add whather behooves more
tha twain Also ye shall vnderstade when ye woude is deep ouertwhart / than must
ye styches be ye deper festenyd for. ij. manner of causes / the first is because
that it should breast out ye less. the second it should matter the less / and
because yt should be the less holownes vnderneth. Ye shall not need to feste
it deep if ye woude be of length. And when ye have festenyd ye woude / se that
ye over cast your thread twyse or ye knet the knot / for else it would breast
out again or ye cowed knet it / as I have scene oftyn of vnlernyd surgeons /
but ever keep your finger upon it till it be fast knet that ye be not deceived
with one knot / but when it is overcast as before is said / ye need not to fere
the yeopardy. And when that ye have done as I have let nydin the stychynge as
before is said / tha do after my co^soll and folewe these noble lernyd men and
surgeons / as Lafrancus / Guido / Guilhelm? / Placeti^ de saliceto / do their
comaudemet and fail not to bear upon you this powder. A Powder. made of white
franckencence. ij. parties / dragons blode. i. part / and one third ^te of lyme
made of egg shellrs / make all these in one powder and temperit with ye white
of an egg / lay that on ye wound with tawe / though it have not be used till
this time but with the white of anegge salt. But this fornamyd powder is much
better and profitable. and this is the first manner for to stiche ye woudis. The
second manner is to sow over hand as ye skyners do / that fortunes in ye
bowels or sypha^ that is the call that keep the bowels each by other. The
third manner is for to put the nedyll through both the lyppys of the woude /
and let the nedyll bide therein stic king / and than take the thread and wynd
it about both the endis of the ne^yll. vi. or vii. times / and let it bide so
styll as lunge as it nedis / as it fortunes in wide or large woundis. The
fourth manner is that sometime a stychynge or festynynge happens for to stauche
blode / and that is when ye se a vain blede sore / as the vain of the neck /
or ye vouded betynge vain / thrust that vain through with the nedyll / and
after the nedyll / knet the vain fast with ye thread that is in the nedyll /
than draw the nedyll through / and let an end of the thread bide hagynge at
it a certain days till that upper part of the vain doth putrifye / and that
ye thread go out by him self. The. v. manner hapeneth in the face / or in such
place as would not be scene / and also in tether people that were not able to
suffer the fornamyd stychynges / and eke in great woudis that have ye lyppis
wide a souder thus if shall be ordered. Take little lynnen cloutys three square
and spread them (...) this salve / made of dragatu / dragons blode / Olibanu /
Masticis / Sarcocolle / of each one dragma. Myldust out of the mile three
dragmas. The white of an egg so much till it be ynowgh. Than lay upon every
side of the woude the pecys eueriche of them an inch from other. And when ye
cloutis be well dry / tha sow them or styche them together. Thus endyth th is
chaptuor of the stichynge or festynge of ye small or simple woudis / that be
chased in the skyne / or in the flesihe.



Of the woundys in senowes. ca. xiiii.
First it is to be regardyd whether the woude be in ye length of the senowe or
in the breed. Or that it is only a prycke with a nedyll / an alle / thorne / bod^
kynor any such like. Or that the senowe is over twharthewed clean of / or cut.
Or that it be cut through ye length. Nota when the senowe is hurt with a foyne
/ than is the woude close. than it is need to make the woude wyder and put
therein oil of rosys made with on^ype oil oylue / wermer tha he may well
suffer it. so lunge till the woude be full. furthermore yt shall be laid to the
woude fyn turpetyne that is pure / white / and well washed between. ij.
clothes. and ye woude and lyme about it

A Salve.
shall be enoynted with that warm oil of rosys temperyd with bolo armeno that
it may be some what thycke. thereupon shall be laid a soste lynen clothe yt hath
beu wet before in good warm white wine / tha bind it up softly. And if the
payne do not cease with this at the syrst / than do it oftyn yt it cease for
there is no better way / though ye payne vanysh not incotinent. This doth
Lanfrancke testefy / and many other noble surgeons. But if the payne contyne we
to lunge / than it is good be my coucell for to take oleum rosa^ / boli armeni
and opium thebaicum a little / and made warm / and occopyed in the fornamyd
manner. And the pacyent shall rest and meue but little / and keep him self from
anger. And whane the payne doth cease / and the woude draw to ye draught / Than
heal it with the grene woude salve and wound drink / the which I will show
you herafter in ye antithodari^ Nota / if ye senowe or ye vain be hewyd / or
cut a soder / tha festyn ye vain or senowe in such manner as the lyppes of ye
woudes be festenyd if that ye can get the vain with woude / upon the vain
woude ye shall lay oil of roses made with grene oil olyue where as ye little
groude wormys be sodt in / and howe ye shall sethe them ye shall know in the
Antithodario / and that shall ye use. ij. or. iij. days / and on the. iiij.
day take the foresaid powder that is showed in the. xiij. chapter of the
festenynge of ye woudis made in this manner. Of white frankecence c. but it were
very vtyle and profytable to put among it the powder of dried worms before
namyd / dried to the uttermost without brenynge. But the dryenge that naturally
behouyth to the woudis of senowes and veins as Lanfrancus / Guido / and
Rogerius testefye / is vnguentum de vermibus / made in this manner.

A Salfe
Take little Centaurea Lingua canina herba / consolidamator / consolidamedia /
an hafull of each / a pownde of grene oil olyue ground worms half a li.
whytt wine half. li. stamp all these together and let it stand stepynge in
himself. vii. days / and than ye shall stamp with it. ij. li. of shepis
talowe / black pytche rosyn / a quarter of each. Armoniaci / Galbani /
appoponati / meltyd in vinegre. v. dragmas of each / sethe all these together
till the wine vinegre be consumed / than strain it / and when it is almost
cold / than put to them half a quarter of turpentyn / frankencence / mastic /
sarcocolle. iij. dragmas of each. ij. drag mas of saffran / and take a spatula
styrie all these together / and thus make this salve for it is very precyo^ i
necessite. Roger? doth put to this millefolin / but Lafcancus comaudeth yt ye
shall keep ye woude moist first. ij. or. iii. days with oil of rose groude
worms when the wound is festenyd. This ointment following thou ought for to
have always by ye for to anoint about the woundis / for all conynge surgeons use
it for to defend all fresshe woundis.

A deffencyfe salfe.
And the deffencyf is made in this manner. Take. iiii. ouces of oliu Rosaru. ii.
ouces of boli armeni / terra sigillata / asceti / of each of them an ouce /
canfer one dragma / night schae / hows leke / of each an handful. Of all
these ye shall make a fine oynt met in a mortyr / for through these for said
festenynge of the senowes / and through ye oil / powder ointment / the lyme is
preseruyd helyd / and rectifyeth. Also ye shall not be to sore abasihyd of the
pain that comes of the pryckynge of the nedyll / for ye payne is swetnyd
again with the oil of Rosys when it hath been anointed there with iii. or. iiii.
times. But if the payne do not seas / that is a tokyn of the cramp or a cut
tynge of the senowe* Now may ye re^ue me of that I said before / that the oil
was a deffendour of the helyng of the woudis / because I docomaunde here to put
warm Rose oil in the wound / also abuut it. But to this I answer / Though
Galien{is} saith that the wounds ought to be taken heed of yt there come no
here / nor oil / nor other fylthenes / Therefore I say that ye oil of rosys
must be made of grene or on type oil olyue yt seems more a ioyst or lycour
than oil / and of the ground worm the oil receives a conglu^nacyon. Ye
shall never begin to heal up the woudetyll ye payne be passyd and gone / sor
if ye heal it up or the payne be passyd and gone / it is to be feared that an
i^ os^ume and swellynge with great hete / shall stryke to ye woude / and of
that to falling it fortunes so time the loss of a limb or death. The
surgeon may do no better for ye ease of the dyseasyd pson / but to keep the
wooded lyme from swellynge with great hete as it is before said Is that the
wound done not heal with ye for said oil and powder / that ye woude
dydonclose and began to matter or come to draught / than shall ye heal the
woude with the grene woudis salve which I will set in the antithotarius / and
that salve shall be stryked upon a lynen clothe and laid to ye woude at morn
and at night / and in the nedermost end of the woude / ye shall put a little
tent / yt the senowes be not meuyd or touched that there come no payne of it.
If that there were of yt matter to great a supsluyte than make this salve
following / the which doth not only purifye the woudis of the senowes / but
also all manner of woudes / though it were in a deep holowe woude / which salve
shall be made in this manner. Take strained rosehony. vi. oucis fine boultyd barley
flower. ii. ouncis / temp these together and sethe them / but loke that brene
not. And when ye have set it from ye fire / stere it well with a spatulum and
put thereto. ii. ouncis of white turpentyne* or if ye find no white / than
wasshe it in cold water till it be whyt / but for that common water I have take
one of these water that I could get best / as Sanicle water / small planteyn
water / consolida minor water / sidou wat rose wat. when ye would lenyth of
matterynge will dry / A salve. Tha take of ye forenamyd salve. iiii. oucis
whyt frankencens dragons blode / mastic / sarcocolle / a dragma of each /
temper them all together / and lay it to the wound as be fore is said. till it
be hole / and always lay above the woude / tow / stepyd in strong whyt wine /
well warm / that defedyth the wonde from all accedentis / payne swell ling and
hete / specyally when in the wine is sodyn Consolida mayor mouseer with ye gelow
flowers / and sent Johns wort with the brodleuys. If the common veins ve hurt
that be namyd vene or arteria whihe be the betynge veins / They may so sore
hurt that they shall never be helyd trwly / as some doctors say / But that
fortunes whane they be woudyd ouertwhart / But they be hurt in length / they
may be helyd truly / as it is opynly enough known by the veins yt belet
blode / which be helyd in few days without dryenge powders. But to heal the
woudyd veins is done with the for namyde powder that is made of the dried ground
wormys named Lombrici / and that laid in the woundr / and the forsayde rose
oil soden with the groude worcester mys laid warm upon it with cotton. Hereof I
have had much profit / also scene it of many good masters / though yt some
say that ye wormys should be brent to powder / but it is nothing so / but
they shall be dried in an ouyn where as ye breed is drawn out of till ye may
bray them to powder / For when they be brent to powder they less their strenght
of their coglutina cyon or gaderynge together of flesh / But they gader ye
skyne to soon toge^ / ye which to ye grieved senowes is no need. This fortunes
also in ye salve aforsayd of the said worms / as Lacfracus Guido testefied.

Tostaunce blode in the woundyd veins. Ca. xv
IF it fortunes yt vene capillares / which be the smallest veins / or vene
maiorum / which be the great blode veins / or are terie / that be the betyng
veins were hurt / and died blede sore / thane is it needful that ye behold
the manner of the woundyd man / the complexcyon / the age / the strength of
youth / specyally ye must mark if he have much blode in his body / than let
enough go out of it / if ye be called thereto betyme. But if ye come not intyme
by him / so that he through fawte of blode should become faint feeble / tha
mark if ye blode come from venis capillariv{is} / for they be veins as small
as heer / if it so do / tha after ye stitchynge of ye woude / it is s^ffycy ent
to lay to it / the white of an egg with tow with the powder before namyd /
for that powder stauncheth blode and cogluti nesh the lyppys of ye woude
together. When the blode comes from the great vain named vena matoru / thane it
comes slowly forth / it is gross / and enclyneth him to a purpre colour /
blackysshe / when it is not stauched / it is dedly / for the blode is ye tresour
of the life. And Auicena writes that if ye woudyd {per}soon have any of these
chau ches / that is to say Spasmus which is ye cramp / or Cincopis that is
the swowyng it is a suspect tokyn or sign / Also when ye blode comes from
the artery / which is the betyng vain / ye shall know it by this tokyn / for
the blode commyth spryngynge out / like as the vain closyth and open^* If it
be not staunchyd lyghtely / the won did parson bledyth him self to death.
Therefore it is not enough always to use the fornamyd staunchynge of blode. But
this vein behooves a mighty strong stauchyng of blode / yt may be done in. ii.
manners. Therefore we can not vndstade yt ye blode of ye woude ca be stauchyd only
with the drynes yt be laid to ye woude as it is before said. But ye shall have
therefore a rule / where with the cowrs of ye blode may be helped stoppyd / yt in
many sondry ways / sometime it fortunes that it will be helped with byndynge
of the contrary side over against yt woundyd place sometime with rubbing /
sometime with lettynge blodr in another place / sometime with boxinge / sometime
with ymagynacyo / that she woudyd parson doth imagine or think that he bledid
nomore. The second rule or manner is how ye shall use the utter more dryenge /
namyd the localia / howe it should be laid upon the woude and vain / and this
is of divers manners occupied ruled / sometime with noise that causes one to
start for fere that the blode roneth or congelyth / or the dryenge be laid to
it / sotyme it dries with fasting of the vain with the nedyllor the tread /
sometime with brenynge with other ways as ye shall here. when ye have dressyd a
woude with the drink substances before namyd / that it will not stauche / than it
is necessary for to remedy the cowrs of ye bledynge / in this manner / ye shall
bind and rub the cotrarye part as if the right hand did blede / than ye
should rub the lift arm well up and down / and after that rubbing bind it
with a woollen selue ege of clothe to tentent that the blode may ron to succour
the place that is so fore boude because that the other place so bledyng may
stauche / but not sully / for if it were hole stoppyd / the lyme or place might
ware styffe and less his feeling and be as deed. And thus may ye do from ye lift
hand to the right / and frome ye right side of the heed to the lift foot / and
in ye same manner may be done with boxyng fleemynge / also with closing of the
woudyd parson or with setting at wyndow his heed outwardis that he se no manner
of red / and say always to him that he bledyth nomore / than ye died fleem him
or let him blode for his health. And thus is ye natural strength enforcid /
blode stauched through the contrary ymagynacyon / and this is ye first manner
for to stauche ye flode of bledig The other manner or rule is how ye ought to
order your pacyent in the localia / that is in the laynge on of the dryinge
substance or syccatyf without with the hand. And this is done in many manners.
Galien{is} in qui to terapeti / Lanfrancus of myllayne / Gui do / conclude all
together that in the cour^ of the blode which can not be stauched with the for
said mysterijs / than lay your finger softh upon the mouth of the woude of the
vain / holding it styll till ye blode do ron or gely / or ye lay any drynes
or syccatyf to it. The other manner or rule is yt ye shall have always by your
powder that of their own nature doth stauche or restrain the blode / that the
powder have in him self such strength that when it towcheth the vain / that
it therewith may close / which strength is namyd stiptica / and that causes
also the flesh to grow. Another manner following / is that if ye cane get ye
vain by the end and festene it / as it is showed before in the. xiii.
chaptre. Another manner to brene the end of the vain that it may have an estra
which is a skurffe or shrynk^ ge together / that is in. ii. manner of ways. The
syrst is done with sharp dryeges or cy catyffes / as with vitriole / bret or onbret
/ or else with vnslycked lyme. The second with a breninge yro or gold which
belogeth to ye vain / as saith Aui. The hot cauteriu shall be done in this
manner with a hot brenyn ge yro yt it be deep to thetent it may make a gros estra
or skurffe / whose offallyng be natheuy. The cauterys or yros yt ye brene with be
figured here vnderneth / and ye need nomore instrumetis than here be figured /
for over many doth trouble.



Theodoric{is} praises Arcenicu sublimaticum with such brenynge / for that
stops all great flode of ye blode / also it makes aloge during estram or
scurffe. Another is that ye must lay that lyme right that it hang not as ne'er
as it is possible. Also if it hath bled much before / take it not of in iii.
or four days till ye vain be somewhat helyd. And take your bynding is of
wisely and not rechelessy lest ye hurt the vain cause it to brene upon a
fresshe. If that ye syccatyffes or byndynges be taken to it / tha ye shall lay
wet things to it an howr of twain because ye should not hurt your pacyent /
nor trowble your self / ye must do it thus / take the white of an egg / and
vile of Roses well betyn together / and lay yt to it / or else take a fair
lynen clowte deep it in wine and lay that to it. Another manner of dryeng as
this / ye shall lay your finger upon the mouth of the vain till the blode
besomwhat run that it be thycke / and than must ye have a powder

A siccatyf powder
Made of pure whyt frackencens. ii. partis Aloepaticum. i. part / temper this
powder with the white of an egg as thycke as honey / and deep therein white
haers hee^ yt is cut small and lay that to the woude or vain / for that doth
not only stauche the blode / but yt helyth also the arteries / as Lanfrancus of
melan hath often times provide / as he writes in the chapter of ye staunchynge
of wounds / that a child of iii. year old having a knyf in his hand / and
sell upon it and so hurt him self in ye throat / unawares he com by the
child which all ready had lost his sight / and the blode died ron white out
of veins / and his puwlce died beat but fayntly / and he laid incontynente
his finger upon the mowthe of the wound that there might nomore yssowe out the
wound / and with in alystonde the nature was reconfortith / and ye poulce
began to beat again / the iyen began to opyn / than died he lay the fornamyd
powder upon the wound / and upon that he died lay tow depyd in ye white of an
egg / and he commaundyd to give ye child a morssell of bred stepyd in water /
the next day the child was well strengthyd / yet he unbound not the bound
till the fourth day after / and on the. iiii. day the drynes or cyccatyf was
so harde back there to / that he cowed not well get it of. Tha he did lay to
it the white of an egg oil of rosis betyn together as before is said and did
let it lay upon it till the next day and than was the woude clean hole /
whereof all the people therabout had great marvel. If the blode will not
stanch with such cyccatyffes through any accydentys or tofallynges / tha
must ye work with such sharpe ferynges or brennyngys as is before specyfyed.
Also another stauchyng takyn by the instruccyo of Auicenna / A cyccatyf powder
Take onquenchyd lyme / dragos blode aloes succotrini / of each a like much /
and thereof a powder made / and used as ye other before. If ye will have another
that dries and resteyneth more.

A powder.
Take a great gall apple / drages blode voly armeni / frakecece / aloepatic^ /
mastie of all these a like much / and thereof a powder made / and to it / put
the guarter of as much whyt harys heer that is cut small and that occupied
in the for said manner. Another powder that Rogerius / Jamerius used / ye
which doth not only stau the blode but also it doth dry heal.

A Powder.
Take grek is pytche. vi. ouces / boli armeni. iii. ouces mastic / dragos blod
/ olibanian ouce of each / ye rote of cosolida mayor / roses of each an half
ounce / of all these make a fine powder / and use it as before is she wy^ After
this I will show you of many and diverse powders at more layser in ye
Antithodarius. Of all the staunchyngys of blode thateuer I se / I never saw
none better than one stone that is brought out of spain or galisce not far
fro ye way to saint Jamys which I used / as soon as I towched the mowthe of
the wound or vain / it staunchyd and closyd / butt I toke also of ye same
stone puluerysed strewed that powder round about it in the mean season that ye
stone was in it / when I would occopy it again / thadyd I pullys she the stone
(...) of ye old blode (...) it was fres^he again. also. ij. {per}tys of this
pow^ myxed among one part of the other and so used hath done me great
pleasure at my most ^e is very profytable / this stone is somewhat palewhyt /
and hath sometime in it small rede veins / and is namyd of ye pelgrymes the
blode stone / but it is not the stone Jaspis nor Ematites / and when the blode
is so staunchyde / the wound helyth as before is specyfyed.

Of the wounds where thornys spletys / or such like be in. Ca xvi.
IF now there were no vain hurt nor no flode or course of blode / that there
were between the {per}tys of ye woude a piece of a bone / a piece of ye arowe /
thorne / a splynter / that the wound were to narow. Tha it is need for you to
cut or make the mowthe of it more wyder / that in two manners. The first with a
tent made with ye rote of gencyane / or pyth of el^ or of a we^e piece of a
spoge boude hard (...) a thread and dried upon an iron / and tha the thread
taken of again / and here of make tentys / one smaller than another / occopy
th^m till ye have made the wound as big as need requires / or as ye desire.



The second manner is / that ye shall cut the wound wyder with a pair of
cysars or with sheres there to belonging / as here is figured / but that is
dredfull to the wou did {per}son^ counsel fo^ But if those ca nateas / yt ye
diseasyd {per}soon ca not for great feer abide ye cutting / Tha must ye make
this sleep drink and give it him to drink / whereof he shall (...) in sleep and
feel another cuttynge nor payne / thus must y^ make it.

A sleep drink.
Take ye rote of Solatru mortale / semen i^s^ami of each an ouce / white popy
sede / blak popy sede / opiu the baicu adragma / croci orietalis / corticis
madragora / lignu aloes / Cinamomi / Castoriu / a dragma of each. And of all
these make a course powder / and of this powder take. ij. dragmas and i^ ^e it
with maluesye / give it him at a draght. And when he is in sleep than cut up the
woude as much as nedyth till it be wide (...). Tha draw out such thing as
is in it with thy fyngers or with nipers. In the same manner gone stones / with
nypers or pynsons and other instrumentis as here after is more plainly
expressyd / And when thou will have him wakend again tha put a piece of a sponge
in his nose / that hath ben wet in vine gre or in ye Joyst of Few or fenell /
and there with all he wakens again. Some give him Opiu alone without any other
thing therein tempered / but beware thereof / for some become frantycke or made
thereof / thus it is very daugerous. If that the woudis were made wide with the
tentis or with the cuttynge that they were not wide enough / and that ye durst
make it no wyder with cuttig through fear of death / or leasing of a ^oynte /
than put into the woude this instrument balista yt is here figured / wherwt ye
shall enlarge it / and than ye may put your Instrument into the woude and take
out that is in it.

Of (...) ^is shot with poisoned ^ he dis and other thyngis ca. xvii.


When any pacyent comes to you / this is my coucell that ye demand of him /
howe and in what manner this chance died fortune him / in what manner and form
that this is shot or other wise come to him / as of ye things yt therein be
remained / like glass / iron / thor^e / arow heed / or other divers things /
some be right / sum crooked / some round / some hoked / sum square / some
triangled / some holowed where timber has ben in / sum venymed / and some
not venymed. Some stycke fast in the flesh / some in the bone / some so deep in
the body that it go the almost through both the sides. And when ye be well
assured of these / than it is need yt ye have some instrument in your besynes be
longing to this work. Of the which ye first be tongues or nypers / half moan
wise and inwardly tothed.



The other be ryhgt terebellys sharp before / like as ye se figured and
counterfayted here benythe / when the heed of the arow is broken of / than ye
may pierce with your instrument in the timber softly and so draw it out.



The other be nypers or pynsons / namyd Albucasys / and is formed like the bill
or nebbe of a stork within dentyd teeth which is figured as it is shewyde by
this instrument that stondyth here benethe between ye other. ii.

The other be tongues or nypers that be broad / indentyd and holowe as che nebbe
/ for to take out a gone stone / like as here stondyth benethe on the other
side.

The other be terebellys yt be viced going in a pipe / like as it stodith
figured here be nethe on ye one side / and it is for to take an arow heed out
when the wode is out of it.



THe manner in such cause to work is this. Thou shalt mark ye tokens of life
or death or ye shall begine to work yfye se any toke of death / tha take
nothige out of the body at that time for fere of death before he hath taken his
sacrament. The first toke / as when the shot is in the heed brain / so suffer
the pacyent great payne whereby the s^ome avoid out of the mouth and at the
woude. That other token / as the shot is in the heart / so commyth there out
black blode. The third token / as the shot is in the loungis / than there
comes scomynge blode out. The. iiii. token / as the patient is towchyd in
the maw / than gothe his meet vndisgest out. The. v. token / as the paciet is
towchyd in his guttis so he auoydyd his tordre out. The. vi. token. as the
patient is towchyd in his bladder / so he avoid out his water / and that is a
sign of death / And in all other places there the patient is hurt / there as
the sign of death is not pull out of the wound that shot / as I shall learn
you. and than heel it as another wound. And that shot shall be taken out in
sondry manners. And there is iii. principal manners of takenout. The first that
must be taken out with tongys and instrumetis. The. ii. that with might is
smitten through coming out on ye other side. The. iii. is / as the shot will
not come out / or may not be draw out without more harm / and you may not
make the woude greater with cuttynge or with tentys. So let the wound certain
days putrifye / so comes the shot better out / Nevertheless it must be
handled softly / and there upon ley the plaster drawing to the sore / as I
shall learn you If it be so that an arow is poisoned / if any body is shoten
with a gone / so do as I shall learn you. ye which drawn with plasters it will
not be well done with out the woude be wyder made with cuttynge or with tentys.
Also saith Henricus that it may be hastly drawn out. And so saith Auicenna /
Albucasis / and Brunus. And there after may ye heel the wound as ye will
heel an other woude / No more there to do than the superfluence blode which is
become to matter in the wound / that it be clensyd. If ye be in fear of
coming more payne / so may ye put in the wound hot oil often times. And as
ye will begyne to work / ye have knowledge whether it be an arowe / or a gone
pylleth / or another thing. And if the shot is in ye heed with any other dyseas
or to falling / so draw the arowe out craftily with a pyle tongge like as here
to fore the pyctor or figure shows. Is any body shot in the arm or leg /
and the tymbre be from the iron / so cut that other side against the wound /
draw out that iron. If he be shot in his body and the tymbre be out of his
body fro the iron / than must you ^erche the iron with a tongue or a small
instrument of iron where that it is / Than draw it proprely out / If ye woude
be to narrow than may ye do as is aforesaid with tentys or cutting / If he may
suffer it waking or slepynge / so draw it out with your instrument / If it may
not so be / ley there upon a plaster / give the pacyent a drink as I shall
learn you in this chaptre / also in Anthidotario The patient shall lye upon ye
woude as he may best suffer / because that ye said drink and plaster may the
better draw out the iron / And as ye may {per}ceyue ye yro / draw it out.
Never shall you pull out ye shaft fro the iron as one is shot with an arrow. If
the shaft be shot deep in the body / in the plu^ king out of the arrow ye
leese the iron of the arrow so that ye can not find it. So it was be happened
king Mathyse of hugri was shotten with an arrow in ana^me the timber cam out /
and ye y^on cowed not be found / The said king {pro}^ysyd who that cowed get
out that iron without harm doing he would give them great good. Tha cam to him
hans dockenborth and dressed ye woude there he was shotten in / and band him so
that there cam no matter out fro the woude in many days / and leyd upward above
ye woude an defensyfe a cold plaster

An defensyfe.
Made of bolo armeno / vynegre / camfere / a little roose oil / and ye white
of an egg myxed made as thycke as honey / because ye arm shulde not festre in
fire / by reason of the byndynge caused to gadder the matter about the iron in
the woude / so the skyne swellyd / where by the iron cam / there cut he the skyne
and toke out the yro without any tongue. Than the king made him knight an earl.
Wherefore ye masters remember upon it as ye can not find ye iron / or yt it be
in a such place that ye may not cut. yfit be in arm or leg / Is the timber
be goo out and ye iron is bide within / put therein that instrument called a
terebell in apype / and shrouyd upward and pull that iron out. If yt may not
be done so / make the woude wide with tenttys / or with cuttynge / and so may
ye pull it out. But first put in the wound that instrument called Balista /
and there after the terebelle / because it shall to softer goo in. And if that
iron will not come out lyghtely when ye begyne to pull tha prove it with the
pyll tongue / and as ye have the iron with the tongue / and it will not come
following / like as it happenyth in the borgonysshe fylde before Bloumoude that
a ma was shotten with an arowe / the iron bide in the body and the tymbre was
out / To the which was many surgeo called for help to have the yro out / it
would not follow / than cam there to a surgeon of Straesborowe called Hans
mayere / and he toke the pyltonge in his hand / and he {per} ceyuyd that the
iron was hoked cross wis and he turned the iron with the tongue about so that
the crossyd iron cam to ye same place as it went in / incotynent cam the yro
out / where by he was sore praysyd / yet cowed no {per}son tell how he had it
out.

If it be also that it is not possible so to do with that pulling out. And if it
be al most through going unto the further side / like yt happen the arowe to

through it / and pull it out on ye other side. And if the tymbre be out than
stryke ye yro with another arowe through. so must ye do like wise if such a case
of an arowe happen in ye body / and yt is more peryllous And if an iron ware
sounke deep in the body of a man / that it were not possible to take it out
with pyle togis nor with plasters nor with tentis / nor with cuttyngis where as
it went in / nor unto the other side with outfere / so lunge let that iron
styke unto ye time that the natour will drive him out to appear. Albucasis
writes of many personis that arow heedis gon pylleth that remain in the body

said that he hath provide / ye rote of a reed stampyd with honey and laid it to
the wound / that pull out all that is bonys / stones / glass / without any
payne. Is the wound to narrow so make it wyd with cuttynge or withe tentys as
I have before said. If that may not be done / so let the wound in him self
type with ye maturatyse / than it comes out of ye woude with ye matter / and
than cleanses the wound / if it be need do as is before said. Item here I will
learn you a marvelous mixture of many virtues / for it will suck draw out all

good to set on the wound a bore without pryckynge.

Of woudis that be shot with poyseneth arrow hedis and many other things. Ca.
xvii.
A Man shotien with a poisoned arrow or any other weep. and you have take out
the arrow in such manner form as is before write. For yt which venym shot the
same person hath great harm that the same venom comes from one joint to
another, for fault of taking heed betyme. I iheronymus brouswyk born in strae
soorow have scene one was bit in his thombe which he would a reested / he had
etyn in ye night some what / having in mind that day to poison arrows and
other wepes / and as he would a reested that man he cast him on the groude and
so cam his thombe in ye manys mouth he booted the thome and wold not leave his
bythynge unto to the time his mouth was full of blode / whereby he was almoost
choked with the said blood / tha he opened his mouth and let him goo / and
said he had enough to save his life / for as much as the thome was so fore it
must be cut of / and after that was ye hand cut of / after that was cut of the
arm / and ye body was swolle so byg that they cowed scant save his lyf.
therefore it is need to take heed with the first to give him tryacle magna one
dragne meddled withe wine / therein must be soden tormentyll dyptan master root
and few wat{er} as much as is ye wine each an ounce. And that shall be give him
at every. xxiiii. ouris. In ye woude there as the arrow is pulled out / put warm
violet oil made of lynneseed oil / and in ye same woude shall ye put a tent
deep in the said oil / and that will draw out the venym / and put the same
oil to the salve wherwt ye will heel ye woude. and do in like wise to them yt
is shot with a gone / for that takes ^ut the ^e^y^ that fire / and brings the
woudet^ fair matter into helynge.

An Oil.
Take lyn sede oil one pound / (...) an ouce of camfer / and temper it
together / and the ^he^ of a little warmyd / and deep therina tent and put thau
in the woude the ^yle and the tent / thereupon le^ a grene wooded pla ster /
and that shall heel it.

draw out ye venym of the woude and of the a^ow / and to bring the woude to

Of crusshed wounds. Ca. xix.
THrse wounds happens by inyght of falling / or that the one the other
pusshyth / su the woude happens also with (...) thing that is not sharp and not
cuttynge / and not pryckynge / as a clobbs / or a stat / or a crooked sta^ / or
that one falls fro heyth / in all such like case. Therefore these wounds be
indyfferente frome the wounds cuttynge with swords or daggers / or with other
sharpe wepens that cutteth or prycketh / or stytchyd. And also to this before
said won des behooves another cure / for to this wou des as they be fresihe we
behove one coglutinaturu / is as much to say as lymyng to gydder.
Mundificatiuum / is to say clensynge if it be need. Therewith Consolidati number /
that is the wound to heel. But it is never good helyng without fair clensyng
In this brushed wounds is not to do such a cure / for in ye crusshed
wounds is (...) flesh brusyd and the corpora of the vay nes synewes. Also it
fortuned sometime that ye brusynge happeth without woude that is sometime in the
flesh / sometime in the synewes / and sometime within the best of ye body. Of
this before said will I not write / than only of the brusynge that hap peneth
with wounds. Item If there co meth a fore you such a wound in the fles she /
and ye will begin to work with cosolidaty^ / ye must loke on the complexyo
of the person / and of his age / yonge or oldr / or len of body / or full of
blode or mo^ (...) nes / so must you let him blode on the va^ no on ye contrary
side / which takyth (...) (...) the matter that wold grow to an (...) me. And
if the complexyon of the pe^ (...) de weke or feeble / and old / or lytty^ of
blode / so behooves him not to be lett^ blode. The place of the body must be
defen did of the coming of yl^accyde^tys of an unpostume / and to flode of the
blode / and that shall be done with warm oil of roses strykynge often there with
about (...) wound there upon straw the powder of (...) berrys of myrtylle. And
as the wound^ begin to give matter so is need to clen se it with ye yelke of
eggs / and with oil of ^ofes / be tyn to gydder / so lay it an aly^ne clothe
and lay it on ye wound / and there upon lay a mundificatiuum of rose honey /
^rly meel and alytell whytte beten turpa^yn / and that must be done so often
unto the time it rot^yd and the matter and ye brusynge may co^ ^esshe / and
there after do the flesh growing as it is need. And if the brusyd place be
full of syne was as in the fete han des / Soleye not there upon that said yelke
of eggs / nor that mundificatyft / nor barley meal / but stryke the woude about
with warm oil of roses / and there upon straw the powder of myrtylle berrys /
And lay on the wound white washing turpantyn between twolynnen clotys / And
as ye payne is withdrawn / and the swellynge begin to syncke / than shall
you occupy that aforesaid mundificatyfe of rose honey and barley meel / as it

Of wounds in the bonys. Ca. xx.
When the bonys be broken without woundynge of ye flesh yt is namyd a broke
or breaking / and as the flesh with the bonys is woundyd and there with that
is callyth a broken wound / or a woude with the brekinge. And such wounds
happens in. ii. manners. The first. as the flesh with the bone is woudyd with a
sherp w^pen / that happenyth in sondry manners / sometime the bone is overthwart
hewyn of and sometime is but a part hewyn of / and some is but a piece cut of.
And another manner / when the flessh of the bone is wooded sometime when one is
beten with a clobbe / or with a staf / that the flessh and the bonys is brusyd
perysshed. sotyme that one fallyth from a heythe / or that one is hurt with the
cast of a stone or with another thing / not only the skyne / but also the
flesh / and ye synewes be hurt / wherewith the bone be wounded / nevertheless
seldon it happens yet it happens sometime that the bone is rent or splenttyd
/ sometime in great pieces / and sometime in little pecys. All these a fore said
poynttes must the surgyon have in the remembrance er he begin any cure te
do. The first / if any comes to you with a membre therein that is broke a bone
and skyne / nor flesh is not woundyd nor brusyd / than so do as I shall learn
you in ye chaptre of brekynge of the bonys without hurtynge of the flesh /

Ifany body com to you he that is woudyd through ye skyne / flesh / bone / with
a sherp knyf sword dagger or any other wepen / so be hold it well or yt bone is
a deell or hole cut thorough in l^ngth / or thwart / or pecys be cut of ye bones
or that ye bone hagyth on the utter skin or that there be any small splyntis
of a bone / yt is ofnedefull to have / as an arm pipe / or alegpype / or a
brain pan / or ytis a bone of no great need / as rybbis or kneshyfes or there
lyknes. ^s there a part of the bone cut with a sharpe sword / and that fleme
next the bone is cut of therewith from the bone / so is that flesh hard to
grow on that bone wherefore must that bone be shown with an instrument where with
that the flesh may grow again on the bone with vnguentum aureum secudum
Mesue / thereafter shall you lay one mundificatiuum and consolat^ / that is a
grene woundyd salve / like as it stondyth in Antithodario / which salve takyth
away the great currupcyon of matter / helyth withal / as the woude is before
fyllyd with flesh / and if there by any small little pecis or splyntis of the
bone / so it is needful that the pecys by subtylte with your instrument taking
the pecys a way / and than shall you heal the woundys like as I have said
before / if there be any pecys aperynge out / that shall you cut of with your saw
/ also if any little pecys of bonis be hagyng on ye flesh for need must ye
lose that from the flesh / and the skin sow to gydder again / so bind it
like an other wound / and if that bone belongyth to a pipe or to joint so
nedyth to bestow it with your hand in his place again / and thereon bind it with
your bond in like wise as I shall say in ye Chaptre of ye brekynge of ye
bonis / and as in your byndynge / ye must leave a hole opeayenst ye would so as
ye may every day dres ye said would without taking of ye said boude / this woude
is to heel like as another would with more mudificatyfe up that the matter the
lesser shall hurt the bone for ye losing of the bone / therefore need you to
lay adefensyuum above the woude round about the joint / that the joint have
no combraunce with the moystnes or superfluyte of the blode that ye matter
might make the bone ^o^e / And ye pacyent must have good rule in meet / in
drink / and laxatyfe / for that lets that no^postumacyo comes. But Rasys
says in the vii. book of his surgery / that the {per}sonys that has bonys
broke they shall eet but course meet which makyth course blode whereof ye so^er
may the bone be hole / yt is as the skyne and flesh is not woundyd / and that
ye bonys be not pery^hyd by the air / and incontinent all such woundys must
be set in his place and than sowed / that there come none impostume thereto /
and drive ye flode or the impostume away / and bind it so as I have said
before / and the wound shall be made hole without losing of the boude. As a
wound is in any bone that needful is to the body / ye shall hot take out one
of them / as many as there be / as ny as ye can ^teuery piece by him self in
his place.

Of a deep wound and not well scene. Ca. xxi.
OFten times is the privy and deep wound helped with a drink inward without
sowynge and byndynge And where it fortune not so to be / so says Galienus in
tercio teg ni / that he shall take away the multitude of blode / and it shall
be helped with a good figure. Through the figure vnderstonde Auice^ / that
the mouth of the wound shall be downward (...) the depte shall stand above /
for the multitude of ye matter may the better go out / as Galien? spekyth ad
Glaucone / when he helyth a deep wound and the woude was in the kne / the
stytchynge went downward to the skyn / than he commanded tolyfte up the skyn
bone upward hyer than the kne / because the woude ye sooner might be hole / the
matter the sooner should avoid. July ke wise may be done unto an arm. And if
the wound will not avoid the ma^tes and can not cleanse it with any water
spowted therein as thereto belogeth / Tha work after the words of Galienus / he
saith in ^ne tc^terapentis / As ye woude hath a deep hole and privy / so must
ye take heed if the wound may be clensedor not / And as the woude is to be
made clean / so make it clean with a washing and with threstynge out of the
matter with a good byndynge / beginynge at ye end of the stytchynge of ye
woude / and shall be bouden the longer the los^ for cause ye matter may not be
bound behind in the woude / and that at the mouth of the wound the matter may
better avoid out And if that may not be with byndynge / so must ye seek
another way / and that is in ii. manners. The first manner / that you begyne on
the mouth of the woude and cut up all holownes to ye ground of ye wound if
that may be done without harm of any veins / synewes and musclus or lacertes.
The other manner is / if that this cuttynge may not be / so put in the wound
a serchyng yro / or a wax cadell unto ye groude of the wound / so make a hole
at the end of the wound / that the matter thereby may be clensyde / and bind
the wound in like wise as is a fore said / Ateche mouth of ye wound shall
the byndynge be loser and so see / so as the wound may be cleansed the better
/ And master Brunus died put and use in both the endys of ye woudes tentr^

And master Guydo used with one tent because the pacyente shulde have the
lesser payne / and round about laid he one defensyuum / and upon the wound
laid he one mundificatyuum / and there after one consolydatiuum / and after that
he helyde the wound like another wound / And if the wound had many hooles
within / that you can not know / so wa^e ye woude with ye after writ water
that some what sherp as / and must be medlede with one mundifycatyfe / and so
must ye spout the woude thryse or. iiii. times / than dry ye woude / bind it
in like manner as is aforsayd / fro the nedermoste part to the mouth of the
woude / and ye matter or moystnes shall be take away with the spowte / not
threstyng the matter with the hand taking out the matter of ye woudis mouth /
and ye would thynk to threst ye matter out / but you should threst ye blode out
of it / which would be matter / whereby it lettyth the helyng of it / and doth
much harm. In like while I have seen by a harbour yt was not conynge / to him
cam one with a woude in his arm which woude gave much matter out / the
harbour threst out every day much matter / and with the threstyng threst out
much other blode which was matter after ward / and it was so lunge time during
/ toward marring of ye arm / which might at fryst (...) little labour be
helped / in like wise as I have helped him. The first manner should be / yt
above ye would upward should be laid one desensiuu about ye arm which should
defend the arm. That other is to rule him of good meetis and drink is whereby
ye les moystnes should be unto him The. iii. is to make holys on the other
{per}te of the woude / and there out taking ye matter / with washing and in
spowtynge / there with the woude should be clensyd / and the arm boude roude
about / that there come no hete thereto / In such manner in like wise have I
wrought made some holys / there the matter came out with a spowte / ye other
holys I stopped / one mudificatyf I need spowte therein / with a good byndyng I
bound it / and gave him good rule of mete drink / and of good purgacyons /
and so doing a weye the corruption from above / and wherewith was defendyd the
membre of the arm / whereby he was made hole / had I done / the hole arm must
be cut of. This have I done writ that ye shall know how ye may order you in
such a wound / so as all other parsonys not to be lost of their membr is /
whereby as all surgeons should come to great shame. Therefore take heed to these
woudys aforesaid. And that lauamente which is (...) clensynge water / it is
made in like wise as here under appears / it helyd all hooll woundys / an it
clensyth makyth flesh / it helyd therewith. If any body ware shot or stricken
through the body / or that ye woude will fystule or raacke / so spowte therein
ye same lauamet lewke warm / and that will ^ull all the matter out / this dod
twyse or tryse in a day there after as the patyent may suffer / so lunge that
the water may come clear out of the wound.

A clensynge water
Thus make the lauamet. Take rose honey strained. vi. oucys. rede rose levies /
Ca^myll flouris / of each. iii. ouce. mastic. i. ou. frakensens a half ounce.
myrra. i. dragne ^ryos. i. ouce. Frensshe wine / or soden elsate wine. ii.
poude weight. water of platayne small and great / water of rede rosys that
growyth in the coorne / water of caprifolium / water of peruinca agrestis /
water of oken levies / of each a pound. Will you have a stronger to dryut the
matter more out / take alume. i. ouce Balausti Pessidie Nucis cypressi / Orobi
/ curscely stamped of each a drane / will you that the flesh grow / put
thereto Sercocolle an ounce / is the wound hart / so put thereto camfere a drane
and a half / The drynes is made thus / take consolida mayor. viii. ounces
pensedanum. iiij. ounces / alum. ii. ouces. smiths water dystuled per filtru.
iij. pyntes / soddetyll the thryde patre be consumed / and that water shall be
made warm and ye bond shall be depttherin / wherewith ye shall bind the membre
like as is before said / If ye will make a stronger mudificatiuum / that more
clensyth caused the matter to rest.

One mudificatyfe.
Take vnguentum egypciacum. ii. ounces. Alum one ouce / white frakensence an
half ouce / myrra one drane. Reed wine ii. poude / all together sodden a little
/ than spowte this in the hole of this sore. For I have done great cures
therwyth.

Of wounds com by venymous stynges / or of wode doggys bytynges / or of snakes
/ adders / scorpyons / or of other such like. Ca. xxij.
Will you beholpen of the venym bytynges of beestes / So it is good that ye
follow ye learning of master Auicenna / Rasys / Rabbi moyses / and Heuricus.
For they have spoke of all venym / And the cure thereof which belongs more to
the phesycon than to the surgyon. And all such bytynge wounds it is in. ii.
manners. The one is done of a venymous be / ye other is done of no vem
mobeest / In lykenys as the bytynge of a man or woman / or of a dog / of an
hog / horse / or a katte / or there likeness.

The venymous bytynge of mad dogs ye styngynge of a snake / or adder / or ye
poysonynge of a ^oode / or of a spider / or any other like venymous be. It
is in two manners to have in cure. The one is / to take away the venymous matter
by the* he^cyon within / defenddynge the body from hurt / through the which
hurt the racyente may be in jeopardy of his life. The other manner is. the
venom without shall be taken away by the Surgean / and shall be caused to grow
flesh / and than healed / keep the hole of the woude some days opeer ye
begin to cure the wound. The knowledge of the bytynge of a venymous be.
ye may know by the compleynynge of the pacyent / for he shall have great payne
and brennynge in his body / whereby ye may know it is to him great harm and
greffe / for the venym or poysone desires none other but to overcome the
heart. And to such venymous bytynges or styngynges it behoned you to take good
heed. And if so be that the parson in the beginning feel not the token / it
will afterward apere as peradventure a month after / a year aftor. vii. years
after so may it be. For I have scene a child byte of a mad dog / ye woude was
healed and a year after ye same woude began the rot / and ye child was mad
and dyed thereof. Wherefore if there come any parson to you dyten of any be
that is not venymous / and no token on them ap^ie ye need to do none other
thing than you do to another cure. The cure of bytynge of all venymous beestes
/ Galienus in tertio terapen. saith / when that ye payne comes of a styngynge
or bytynge of a be / you shall take away the payne / and also the venom /
by boxynge / or lettynge out of wyn de / or brennynge with a hot Iron / or with
a warm bath / and this makes loose the hole substance of the wound / or lay
there to some dry thing hot to take a way the beny^e / Therefore comaundeth
Lanfrancus and other surgyons to set thereto a ventous and take away the
venymous blood or that evil blood shall be se^ed or brent with a hot Iron
or cauteries / that the common people breneth with a kaye of his church Upon such
a wound some layth a simple medicine to draw out the venom / ye which is
done with garlyke / and with on ^ons stamped with buter. Also as Guido saith
doth the common people for lack of surgyan in like wise / they take a hynne
plucks the feathers from her arse / and lays ye hens arse all quycke upon
ye woude / and the hen dies of the venom that comes out of ye woude. The
wound shall be open at the leest. xl. days. Than the inwardly cure behooves
more for the phesycy on tha for ye surgya / Ye shall know howe to take away
the venymous blode. In the beginning you shall not let out the blode of the
vain / because that ye venym should not be sprede through all ye mebres / and
also give them nothing laxatyue in the belly / that ye venym go not with in
thrugh all the members / therefore must be set ye ven to^e aforesaid / which
strongly pulls to him the venymous blode / after the third day it is good to
be let blode on the vain and so to cause the Melancholy with light medecynes /
as in dressynge Epitimy with gootes milk / and he must be in rest of his heart
/ Also he must take and ^ethe the heed and fete of a yielded sheep / and in the
broth thereof often times was^he his feet / And if it be so that the parson
may not beholen with the simple drynes / tha shall ye make him a composita.

A dry powder.
Make this composyta of licium / assa dulcis / bolus armenicus / terra
sigillata / abscinthiu / nigella / genciana / all these meddled together / so
take it in. Or take ye ashes of a crefysshe that is dried in an oven / take
thereof. iiii. parts / and frankesence. ii. parts / medied them to gyder make
thereof a powder / and take thereof every day. ii. dranes. with wine wherein is
sodden Bybergeyl which is called portulaca in latin and Few or herb of grace.
Or take. vi. parts of a sihes of a crefysshe / of Genciana iii. parts / Terra
sigillata one part / and take this medecynes as is aforesaid. If you in ye
beginning of his great need had not come / and the patient hath taken evil
sykenes / or ill accydentes of melancholy / by heuynes of dremes / wrath or
trowble / that he can give none answer ye nor nay / it is the token
ofmelancoly / which weketh ye nature / for that ye shall give the this
medecynes of Cantarides that drives out through the vryne the melancolyous
blode / yfit be possible. And the medicine ye must make after this manner. Take
Cantarides / that is great and old / and there of cut away the heeds foot
fatness and take thereof half anoute / lentes cleansed / saffran / spicanardi /
clowes / synamon / pep{per} / of each a drane. drive in powder / and meddled
with few water / and thereof make a trocysce / and of the trocysce ye shall give
him the wayght of. vii. barley corns / so often till he pysse blood / tha he
shall be in health / and after the (...) the (...) (...) shall first be healed.
I^wyse doth to ye (...) de that is by^ ^le / or any other (...) ny^us be /

is used for vi. causes / T^ is in the narowe woude which (...) must be made
wide / and take out (...) of the ground / ly^ (...) (...) ^s a hol^ wound
there as (...) matter ^ed to draw it out. The other (...) is for to make in ye
holowe wound / for as lunge as ye matter lies in the wound there will no
flesh grow in the wound / but it will always rote more and more. The. iii.
manner is in the wounds that is altered by the air / or by his one nature that
is come to ^oftyng with the tents and so cleansed. The. iiii. manner is to the
wounds that the one gothe to the other / and the one is cleansed through ye
other. The. v. manner is in holding the open a sore unto the time that the
natur be cleansed. The. vi. manner is of an eating wound / that the (...)
sha^owke the wate^ of ye wound / cast out the ^yll flesh rosideabout. The.
vii. manner is in the wounds by the bones / that the matter shall come the
better out of it. Therefore were ye that the tents be made in divers manners.
for the tents that is vsede for the clensynge of the wounds / they are (...)
of fair shauynges of white lynnen cloths and some be made to hold the lyppes
open of the wound with fine small ^owe / or small pieces of fine ly^ / or of
fine cotton as Rasys died (...) (...) of silver / or of ty^e / (...) as (...)
(...) ye nose thrylles for to take the air / or to put into the woude that the
matter of him self may go out. Some he made for tomake narow woudes wyder / and
that is made of the rote of gencian^ of a sponge / as I have learned in the. xv.
chaptre. The clothes of lynne laid dry in the wounds / ^nd sometimes laid to
stepe in (...) as the surgyon thinks best. And as the wound is cleansed of
the matter / and the wound is almost hole It is needful to lay (...) a
drawing plaster which ^eth flesh heleth / list wise doth the wounds
plaster / as I shall learn in Anthydodario. If ye woude be changed by much
matter casting / yt ye woude have changed his course in an ^^us / which is an
old (...) / As soon as ye have cleansed ye same woude ye must cause ye flesh
to grow / for it is called^ woude coposita or vlcus / they behooves all times
a mudificatiuu / incarnati^u / thereto consol idatiuu. A symplecuttynge woude yt
is not changed by the air / and bids in his cople^yon / the woude needs no
more but the helynge of the wound. The manner to cause ye flesh to grow in
the woude after the stoppynge of the blode / that ye be ^re of ye imp^ cleanse
the woude of the gre^ ^atter with a mudificatiuum as here after stondeth in the
chaptre of ye mudificaty^s / tha wasshe ye woude with reed wy^ / after ye lay
upon the woude ye drynes yt causes flesh to grow / as herafter I shall learn
you. The h^lp we woude or ye woude in the synewes / ye shall heel it like as of
the in every chaptre shows. And as ye woude is full of flesh / so cause
therevpo ye sky^e to grow. And to make ye skin shall find in ye (...) of ye
cosolidati^e.

The manner of byndyng of fresshe wounds is in three (...) / as Any. saith / ye
first doth ye flesh grow / ye other dryuethout / ye third holds / the
byndynge for to do grow flesh is clou^ in two / ye heed of (...) badelayde
on ye vain against ye woude / bind ye end against ye uppermost (...) of
mebre / yt is from ye woude / that other end of the band on ye nether ^te of
ye mebre / so take both (...) ends / bind it backward to ye wooded place /
ye time of ye bade taking of is when ye pa^yet may no lodger suffer it. With
this bynding ye lyppes of ye woude were boude together / takes a way the
swelling / the harde byndynge which drives out sh^ be used to ye hole deep
woude yt with in is (...) ten for to drive ye matter out / yt no other matter
shall come to ye place / this do with ye bade yt on ye one end is clove / begin
first to bind on ye nether ^te of ye mebre bind it with ye hardest / so forth
upward unto ye vpper^te of ye mebre / Like as when any {per}son is wooded in ye
leg / so bind ye leg bynethe upward above ye knee to ye belly / let the
bade be slytte at ye kne to have ye kne at large / and that he may bow it / If
the wound be on ye left side there comes out of evil vnclene blode / so it is
against the mylte / and if it be on ye right side / it is against the liver /
there comes allmoyst nes to the members. The band that ye drynes hold / is
vsedon the plate there as no hyndynge may be / like as a heed / neck or belly
/ or as swellynge and dyslocacyon. This band shall be with many ends / and
begin the bind upon the sore place on both sides. And this band shall
betaken of without payne / if it cleue by the matter / ye shall sup it with
wine till it be lose Galienus saith / it is used / and that the hades should be
made of good old lynne cloth that is soft / smote / and clean / broad and
lunge after the bygnes of the members / for the byndynge of a shoulder / the
band must be. vi. fyngers broad. The bade of a thygh of a leg must be. v.
fyngers broad. The band for an arm must be. iij. fyngers broad / and the
band for a finger must be one finger broad / and the length of the band
shall be as it is need by the dyscrecyo of surgeon. The manner of lyunen clothe or
plumacioles it is profytable to bind together ye parts that be lose / for to
fortyfye yt hotenes on that membre / to take away the heuynes of the hand. Ye
may make it of fine tow / or of hemp / or of flax that is well hecclede. and
some makes it of wolle / and now they make it of dowble lynnen cloth or with a
sponge / and of them shall be laid ii. or. iij. as the surgyan thinks best.

This before written sometime is laid on the wound dry / sometime with the white
of an egg / sometime with wine / and some time with oxcicrata / sometime with
oil or with other moystnes / and this is in. iij. manners. The one is
thrysquare / yt praises Auicenna / and they lay it on every side of the lyppes
of the wound / and upon ye woude / it causes the flesh to grow / and the
woude to come to gyder. The second is roude / is laid upon ye other to hold
the natural hete. The third is fouresquare and they be laid for hurtynge of
the band.

How that the wounded {per}soon ought to dressed and ruled in mete / in drink.
c. Ca. xxv.
IN the rulynge of ye (...) ^son / I will follow ye ^yge of walls Auicena /
Galien{is} / Lacfracus (...) / other masters saith. It is not good to give ye
pacyent at ye first wine after yt he is wooded in the heed / or in any other
place there as many synewe is / much blode / for no thing gothe so soon thrugh
ye mebres and also ye brains as ye wine doth / makes much vapores /
therefore it is sometime to ye hole parsone hurtynge. The some {per}sons that is
hot / moist that hath much blode / is wooded in the heed or synewes / he must
for bear wine till he be hole. Unto ye a cold {per}son ye shall give wine that
is tepered after. iij. or. iiij. days / when ye be sure of the mebre yt there
come no ymposh^ me nor swelling / his drink shall be barley water / or water
wherein is sod crommes of breed / or cold water in ye somer or with the. x.
{per}te of ye wine of a pom garnet / or with the. vi. part of vergyous. The
parson yt is hot dry of coplexcyo / he shall not ete flesh / milk / eggs /
nor no men that hastily changes / the pacyent shall be content with barley water
/ or ^oten pap^ or with milk of almons / ^he that hath a woude in ye heed /
thereof speaks Lafranc{is} / ye shall give none other than of almons / no fruit
that is wyndy makes vapores / as hasyll nottes / or other nottes the which is
hurtynge to the heed / also he mayete lettu^e / cromes of breed sopped in water
therein doing suge^ / y^ he be so syke that he may not be without (...) shall
give him cheryns / small byr^ or yonge gootes flesh / or bear / with vergyous
/ or wine of pom garnet. This d^ shall he keep till the time he be sure frome
the swellynge or of impostumacyo / and yt is as the payne and the swellynge of
ye mebres gothe away / and as the wound gives naturally matter / or it is
heleth to the growing of the skin. And he must keep him from woman's
couersacyos. and as he is sure of the forsayde so may he ete drink measurably
of strong metes unto the time he come to his first estate / than he may drink
good wine / and ete good flessh as hens / capons / motton / and of all that
makes good blode / and that brings nature in. If the pacyent be weke of
conplexcyon / and hath by nature aneuyll stomach / it is need full at ye first
to give him flesh that is dressyd with good rotys or specery / as synamon /
gynger / and other like / but meetly. Beside all this ye shall give him in the
beginning. I drasarcka that is good of smelling / and. iij. days after the
wine If the wound be with broken bones / or the bone be broken with out wound
/ so shall you give him good metes that makes good strength in the bone
again / like as meal pap made of whet meal well sodden / and give him to
ete of bestes feetes / heeds / and eres / and other things wherewith the body
may be the stronger. Wherefore it is needful to the Surgean to know the
complexcyon / the strength / and the age of the pacyetes / and the use of the
loud / also ye time of the year.

Of the accydentes or fallynges of dyseases that comes to the wounds. ca
xxvi.
THe accydent of the wound is amended after the nature of ye too fallynges /
The accydences comenly coming to (...) wound it is painful / swenynge evil
complexcyon / Itchynge / para^ius / the cramp / febres / flawnas / and
chaungynge of the wound. The first ye shall know that ye woude shall never
cure unto the time the accydent be taken away / the accydes causes that it
heleth not / payne draws the matter unto ye wounded place for to make an
impostume / that is a swell with a manner of reednes / and for that we payne
must be drive away / ye which payne is comenly taken away with strykynge the
membre with warm oil / and if you put thereto yt white of an egg it is ye
(...) and if there be no great heete / do to ye oyl^ the yelke of an egg / and
that clemeth (...) wound. When the payne is great then it is needful to put
thereto a little. Optu or else the bark of mandragora / As Master wylhelmus
counsayleth. The. iiij. masters praises thereto to take ye ^oore of nyghtica
staped with hogs greece / but the master Theodoric{is} praises a plaster
made of ye leues of small malowes dressed stamped with small brannet do thereto
a little oil of roses it is the better / or make a plaster of the cromes of
white breed laid in milk one night / tha stape it do thereto oil of roses the
yelke of an egg / ye slyme of parsely sede / if it be need / do thereto a
little opium. But I have in such accydece used in plasters / sethyng malowe
leues / elder leues / aptu / sethe them i water stamped small and do thereto
rose leues oil of coses the third part made warm / and stryke it upon a
cloth / and so lay it warm on the woude. But in great payne I did thereto leues
of in squiamus sodden / as aforsayd / and a ^ewe leues of Nychtsca myxed
therewith because it repercuteth resolves. But i ye witer I toke dry roots of
pesedanu / and lynseede / malow leues / all this stamped in powder with a
little oil of roses sod / or with old bacon greece / but that is not so good /
which more desire to ripe tha to resolve / Therefore I have done thereto many
times a little walt root / or ambra in powder for to dry yt mebre / if there
come an impostume yt you cowed not restrynge / let it ripe cut it up and
cleanse it and cause the flesh to grow and heal it / As hereafter shall be
learned in the chapptre of the maturaty^e mudificatiue cosolidatiue. If there be
an evil compleccyon yt is hoot / it is to be known by the reednes and
bladders about the place / than make the place cold / but not with mandragora
or iusquiami / for that coleth not / but takes a way the feeling / therefore
they shall be used alone in payne / and to this colynge must ye have that that
coleth and dries with ease / as roses / plantayne / vnguetu albu / Secondum
Rasis / with camfere / other defensyue / defending that membre / like as I
shall learn you in Antithodario If the complexcyon be cold ye shall know it
by softenes / and if ye place be white colowred / make ye place warmd with wine
/ sodden therein ^se eere and camamell flowers and reed arthemesia / and
melilorum / or with vaguentum basilicon or f^s^um. If the complec^yon be dry
and moysty / it may be amended with his contrary. And if thereto comes the febres
/ the cramp and wekenes / than call thereto the phesycyon / And often times or
the phesycyon can come ye pacyent may dye / Therefore it is needful to write of
the same wekenes / for it is a way to the death / and it is called by some
masters ye little death / Therefore ye must comfort the pacyent / that the
feblenes or fayntnes come not to him / and to avoid ye people out of ye chamber
/ because they should not make the chambre root / nor to put the syke in fere
/ And it is wisdom when the feblenes comes on to / give the pacyent a cromme
of white breed deped in wine with rose water / and let him drink somewhat of the
wine. Therefore saith Galienus the wine is of nature somewhat hot gives
comfortynge / therefore give them that hath syncopin / or to the that is feeble
or in swownynge / spryncle Rose water / or cold water in his face / if there
be no rose water / than ye must pluck him by the nose / and by the eeres /
Cry load and call him by his name / give him a clap on ye cheke / and ye
shall do all other things that the phesycyon comaundeth you to do.

A clensynge water,
If the woude be sty^kynge vnclenly / take lycoryce powder of each an ounce /
and sethe it with a pynte of wine and do thereto vytryole a dragma and wasshe
the sore / for it heleth new or old woudes. Another for the fame / Sethe honey
and water together / and therewith wasshe the wound / and after that take
vnguentum apostolorum / or vnguentum egyptiacum that is stronger / and cleanses
very well /.

A salve.
as ye wey worms comes about ye woude. Than make a salve of greeks pyrche /
and with oil olyue / and there with stryke ye woude against the bytynge of the
wey worms that is about the woude / do thereto a little quycke silver in
bernysshe / and meddle there with white lead / and thereof make a salve / and
stryke therewith the wound. Also as a wound is eten round about / so stamp
together Sauiana and reed coolys which is called in latin bleta rubea / and
meddle it with vynegre / than press that sap out / and mydle therewith white
led / salve ye wound roude about with that same / and is ye must cut the
wound open again / that he suffer great payne / than take groude worms in a
pan / and thereto do oil of roses let it warm softly / and strain it / do
thereto gentle reed roses / beenne flower / and Rosyn well poudred till it be
thycke as like a falue / and when you will occupy it make it warm and lay it on
the wound / and it will take away ye payne. If there come any worms in ye
woude / take wormmoyd or absitiu in latin {per}syclouere / or folia
{per}sica{rum} / and saint James herb / all together sodden in wine / lay ^ton
the wound / and it shall help them.

Of the general woudes i the heed. Ca. xxvij.
THe heed is sometimes wounded with cuttynge / and sotyme with pusshynge cotusye
/ this appears both sotyme without wound or without brekynge of ye brain
payne / and sotyme with brekynge of it / and the brekynge is sotyme thrughe
going / and sotyme not / and these be sotymes small / and sotymes great / and
of this some be clean / and some with accydetis of payne and impostumacyon /
and hurtynge of the panycles. The tokens of fracture or renc of the brain
pan is taken in sundery manner / First of hye falling / or with a great
stroke. The second is as ye contusye or woude is very great. The iij. is for
the payne that he suffers often times / he lays his hand on the place / and
with your finger you shall know the thynnes of the skin the departing of
the bone / and as he blows or kepeth his breath inward / the shows ye
moystnes coming out thrughe ye rent / and departing of the bone. The. iiij.
is / of the accydente coming in the same time as a Pasy fallyge / or swymmynge
in the heed / or in forsenes of speaking / or in parbrakynge. The. v. token is
/ as ink or masticke is strykyng upon the departing of ye bone / and if there
abide any blackenes in the departing / or any drynes upon ye pla^ of the wound
when it is anointed / this (...) me is a true token of a rent or departing
The tokens of the cuttynge of the panycle is of sondry manners. First of the
payne knowing / for incontynente foloweh the swymmynge of the heed or falling
/ that is Uertigo or Scotoma in lattyn. The second token is / the colour of
the face / or even / for as the face is reed and full of small pymples / and his
even sem^ reed with darnes. The. iij. is / as the blood go^he out of his
nosethrylles / through the mouth / and through the eeres. The. iiij. is / as
his speech faylleth having no understanding / shaking with the axes / or
perbrakynge or may not sleep / nor make his water.

The token of the woundynge of the brain may be known by sundry manners.
First as gothe great cloddes out of ye wou de and no matter. The second is /
as his understanding is from them / and when the wound is on the foreheed /
and as the wound is in the hynderparte of the heed so loses he his memory /
and that the pacyent thereto have great fere and ygnoraunce. The token of
coming of an impostume is to know by sundry manners. First / as ye panycles is
blown hyer than the woude / and seems ceed / and moves not. The second / as
ye even is reed swollen / seems as they would fall out. The. iii. is the axes
withcomyng of heet. The. iiii. as ye might is altered in spasina / cramp / axes
/ and in madness. The sentence The brekynge Crane or braynpane is very peryllous
the cuttynge of the brain / the corrupcyo woudyng of his panycles yt is deedly
as ypocras saith / but as the woude is very small. Therefore is the evil
accydentes and tofallynges peryllous and deedly / as he abides not departs /
like as axes / shaking / cramp / swymmynge / or swellynge of ye eyes /
darkness and reednes of the even. In the fracture or woundynge of the heed must
be taken heed for the peril and a^entes the space of. C. days. as ye master
^og^ri^ saith. And sum other masters says. xlvi. days / than is the last
term out of ye sharpe sykenes. And as the. iiii. masters saith / it shall be.
xv. days. for than is the term out of the sharpe sykenes. If the blacknes of
the panycle called Dura matter may not be clesed with honey / it is a toke of
death / as Paul{is} saith And the fracture crauei or braynpane in ye full of
the moan / it is great peril and Jeo. perdy if the pacyent shall escape of ye
death. as Rogerius saith. In the consolydacye or helynge of the braynpanne / it
is good yt shows reed flesh. In the wound of the heed is good small
swellynge / and good dysgestynge of the matter. And if the swellynge be great
and gothe away hastily with* out a reasonable cause / that is very ill.

The masters dyscordeth in this cure. Some masters they work in al he dwou
des with vncoueryng and cuttynge the bone / for cause of ye evil matter that
within craneum or braynpanne is gadereth / may softly be cleansed and dried.
Sum other masters as Ancelmus of Gene / and some of Padua / and all yt France
masters / and the Engglys masters / they work with flesh growing and
consolydatyfe or helynge with their plasters / drynkes / and good wine / and
with byndynge. and they say / if the matter may be taken out wtout^ taking of
ye bones with medesynes or drynes / it is the best that may be done. The
odoricus causes the flesh to grow in the wound with drink / wine with
tow. Henric{is} heleth the wound without drink with his plasters. and both
these masters unclose lift up the old fracture as it is past. iiii. or. v.
days. And Lancfran cus works in all wounds making flesh with tents /
which he depeth in two parts of oil of roses / one part of honey. and doth
thereupon a modytycatyffe of barley meele and honey / or with rosyn and wax with
the heedpowder / except in two accydentes. The first as the bone presses.
the other as it prycked. for cause / some say the ye in ye working with the
instruments of iron follows often much peril hurtynge of the alteracyo of
ye air / wherewith comes the impostumacyo. In yt cure is needful to have
masters of sundry dyscrecyon. Therefore I write. ix. lernynges which Guydo
writes i his surgery. The first learning is / that the wound of the heed hath
much indyfference of the wounds of ye other menbres / the gentylnes of the
mary / and for the roundness of the brain can not be preserved with byndynge /
like the wounds of other mebres be. The second learning is / that to the
wound of the heed yt is great / it is nedfull to be let blood on ye vain /
and a purgacyon in the belly / at the leest ones a day going to the draught by
themself / or with some suppositoria / or with a glyst / or with some other
thing to avoid with sofnes / for to take out the evil humours thrughe the
way which may be ye less payne to him / and that the rennynge of the blood
may be stopped / and the accydente may be meded. The: iii. lernyng is that to
the woude of the heed ye shall shere of the here / and make it moysty with some
what water oil / As wylhelmus saith / ye must take heed that there come no
here nor water / nor oil to the wound / for yt will let the helynge / in the
beginning doth that ye matter and ye pains be lessed / and do in the wound
ye white of an egg / and after that beginning it cleanses the wound / and
makes the flesh to grow / as it may be said hereafter / The sides and the
wound round about shall be often times anointed withe the salve of Bolus or
with oil of Roses / to slake ye evil matters and payne / and that the
impostuma^yon come not thereto. The. iiii. learning is to take heed that the
wound take no cold / like as Ipocrates saith / the cold is evil to the
synewes / bones / mary / and al so pussheth and changes the air of the
pryncypall members / and therefore Wylhelmus gives counsel / that in the
winter as the wound shall be dressed / ye must have thereby a pan with
brennynge colles and candle light / and the wyndowes closed / after the
byndynge the heed must be covered with a coyfe made of a Rames skin. The. v.
learning is / if the woude have matter / in the winter ye shall dress the
wound but ones on the day / and in somer twyse a day / and the dressynge and
clesynge shall be with cotton or with soft lynt or lynnen cloth softly
without payne. The. vi. learning is / that ye shall lay on the tent a piece of a
soft sponge / that there with may suck / and keep the matter for fallynd down
on the brain. The. vii. learning is / that ye shall have a substancyall band
of a yard lunge or more / of. iiii. fyngers broad / and that you shall roll
together save. ii. handful of the end / therewith begin to bind after the
length of the heed / pulling to the contrary eere or the wound / and that
other party at the eere of the woude / not covering the eere / and led the
bound styffe about the eere / and let that band come downward to the first
byndynge / do it so often till the heed be well bound / after that manner the
masters of Bonony binds the. ij. ends under ye chin / they of Parys
sows in the midst of the foreheed / and if ye will cause the medicine to
hold alone upon the wound / than must ye make a band with many ends of a
great piece of lynne cloth of. iij. had full lunge / and of. ij. hand broad /
and cut that on every side. iij. fyngers broad / saving a hand breed in the
midst / and with the ends ye shall bind behind coming about the neck
under the chynne. The. viij. learning is / if there be any scale of bones left
/ than wasshe the sore with wine / and if there be none axes / give them this
capytall or heed powder of Pimpinella / Betonia / Gatiosilata / Ualeriana /
Osmuda / and take as much of Pilosella as you shall take of all the other
aforesaid

The. ix. learning is / that the pacyent shall be set and laid in ye
beginning upon that side that leest grieves him. And as ye wound gives matter
/ tha shall he lye on wounded place to make the matter the better avoid. This
is the before written. ix. lernynges / belonging to the wounds in the heed
Item. Of the wounds in the heed in the beginning till the be sure fro
impostumacyon / shall be mitigatyue soft nynge / like the mydlynge is of three
parts oil of rose / and one part honey / and ye old master in sexto
Terapentis takes there to oximel. And if there be no payne / so take. iij.
parts of honey / and one part oil of roses for to cleanse more better the
wound.

When the wound is sure from the impostumacyon / so must the medecyns and
drynes be dryenge without pryckynge / like the heed powder. that shall be made
thus after the leruynge of master Auicenna.

An heed powder.
Take ^ryos / Ilirica / Orobi farina / Mana que est thus minutu / Arsstologie /
Corticibus radicis papaueris. Maystet Brunus doth herto Mirra / Sarcocolla /
Saguinem draconis. Lancfrancus Whelmus also Myrtillos / nuces Cypressi.

Of the woudes in the heed which fortune by cuttynge without brekige of the
brain pane, Ca, xxviii,
IF the wound be simple without losing of ye substance / that shall be sowed
/ bound / and healed like another wound / if it be so that the wound lose his
substance / y^ shall cause the flesh to grow again with tents / powder /
sa^ues / and plasters / and heal it like another wound. The sowynge is not
only profytable to a simple wonnde of the heed / but also in many other great
woudes of ye heed and caused the departing wounds to by^ de to gyder / and
charge from the alteracyon of the air / which doth much harm to the
moundes. If it is a small wound cuttyuge / and gothe not through the be no /
ye shall sow / and cleanse it as is aforesaid. And if it be a greater cutting or
wo^ de in the upper part of the heed / it shall not be sowede / but on the side
/ and put therein oil of rofes taking away the payne. as the wound comes to
the synewy pannycle that covers ye brain pane. This oil also loses the
lose bonys therein hanging* that they may ye better be taken out. The^ oil of
roses also takes away ye sharpne^ as the pannycle within is cleansed with ho*
The oil of roses aforesaid rectyfyeth the wounds there in is payne / and
drives away the evil dysposy scion of them.

Of the woudes in the heed come by cuttynge and brekynge of the brain pan /
not thrughe pierced. Ca. xxix.
THis small woude many masters call it Runulam / and is cured like as the
before say de wound is / without brekynge of the brain pan / for in such a
wound comes not much matter / and because the course of the matter may not
come down in ye small cuttynge / is the wound gretter than it is in the side
of the heed / or in the upper part of ye heed. The wound in the side of the
heed is to be cured / like as ye first simple woube / but ye must put a weke or
a tent in the ne^ther part of the side wound / because if there be any
matter cleuynge within ye so^e / therewith may you cleanse it / and if ye wound
be in the vpperparte of the heed / ye shall not sow it / but you shall do the
cu re of Galienus in sexto Terapenti / as he wrytteth / The simple brekynge
coming to ye mydle of the. ij. tables craney / thereto it is needful to take
divers sheres / that is called narowe Rugines / they may not be a like great /
Therefore as the bone of ye pacyent is uncovered / so must ye first take the
most brodest sheres or Rugine / After that take the (...) sheres that is
narower / then after that take the shallest of all / and this shall you do at
all times in the midst of the. ij. tables. And if the payne desy re none other
/ so shall ye cure be hastily with drynes till it be brought to the end / this
wound may not be sowed in the midst of ye heed / because she may not cleanses
by herself / Therefore she must be dried with tents / and with other things
to suck out ye matter / or else there might abide corrupcyon in the midst of
the. ii. tables to the hurtynge of the bones.

Of a woude in the heed through cuttynge / with brekynge of Craney without
losing of substance to the inner most covering or superficion over the
brain through pierced Ca. xxx.
Sometime such a woude will have squyrles or sharpnes / some will not / and
they be even / and if the wound have squyrles that might prycke and hurt the
pannycle dura matter / they must be made even / and as the sharpnes is even made
with a lenticulare / and with other instruments / then is she healed in maneras
the woude spoken of in ye other chaptre.

Therefore saith Galienus / In the woude that comes to the pannycle / and is
alone own rupture or cuttynge without leasing / so shall you occupy the
aforesaid sheres / that must you do as the wound is in bregmate / that is in
the upper part of the heed And to the wound that is on the fyde of the heed /
Galienus desires no instrument / but sowynge and clensynge with tentys. Here
upon he saith he hath scene that bone Bregmatis / under that is the bone
tymporaus that is the slepynge bone / that hath a great clyffe / he touched it
not / but he cut lonely of that bone Bregmatis / and so healed the parsone /
that he lived after many a fair day. And if he had left that bone Bregmatis
therein styll / it should anon have corrupts that pannycle / or Minrinr / or
Miringa / or the fracture is fistened or porosed Galienus saith the cause of ye
cure where in is none evil matter / nor vnclene moist nes / there is no need to
cut of the bone / because that in the sleep of the heed descends no matter.
And if there any matter comes soit is in a good place for to cleanse. And the
aforesaid Galienus wrought in another parsone on the same manner / he was
aferede to touche the brain / because of the hardness of the slepynge bone.
Therefore he made none hole thinking that the brain should come out through it
/ and also because that through the side much explantacyon of the noble
synewes gooth out.

Of the wound of the heed with cotusyon and small brekige of the bray no pane.
Ca. xxxi.


If the fracture or brekynge to (...) ^rles (...) y^ ^ the lentyenlate / or
other instrumetes make it even / thereafter as the wound be dressed / ye shall
lay there upon soft sylke wet in honey and inoyle of roses / and with ye end of
the instrument ye shall put in the lynnen cloth between dura matter and the bone
of the brain pane in defending that thrugh remenynge the panycle be not hurt
of the bons / and put there upon soft tents that is a little wet in ye honey
and oil of roses / and than lay a piece of lynnen clothe thereon wet with that
same / for lettynge of the matter to come again / And yet you shall lay in the
wound of the flesh / other dry scrapynge of lynte / or a piece of a sponge /
there as the matter may drink in / and do there upon an heedplaster going
thrugh / and that the matter close not therein / and in the last lay tow wet
in hot wine pressed out / and there upon lay dry tow / and bind it sortely
that it may abide / and not to harde for hurtynge. And as the woude is well
cleansed ye shall take of the first clothe / and put upon the capytalle or heed
powder / to cause the flesh to grow in ye wound / as the flesh grows /
ye shall close the wound with Consolidatyffe and ^rizerynge powder.

Of the wound with cotusyo and without brekynge of the brain pan Ca. xxxij.


AUicena cou sails / that in such a woude ye matter shall be te{per} cutedor
rested / at ye beginning after ye common dressige / with ye white of an egg if ye
will do there to oil of roses / for it softeth and doth good / and thereafter
resolve the matter with salt wine / honey / and if there come matter let it
ripe / and open it like an other exiture.

Of the woudes of the heed with contusyon with little brekynge of the
braynepanne Ca xxxiij
IF the fracture be little if shall be cured like ye contusyon aforesaid (after
ye saying Galieni) The hole curacyon of this woude is yt it should be resolved
causynge not to come over great matter. And Auicenna saith in ye third Canon.
That it is need full to drive the payne away as shortly as it may be / and
preserve ye place of ye woude / that an inpostume come not / must be done with
euacuacyon / attractyffe to the contrary side with lettynge with sharpe
glystres / and with pillis cocis. Also lay in the beginning upon the place a
plaster comfortatyffe according to it

A consortatyffe plaster.
Make this plaster with water of Myrte / of Willow / of tasyll called Uirga
pasto ris. or of the oil of Mirte / of lylyes / of roses / of the powder
Rosary / Balaustiay / Cypressy / Calami / aromatici / Leucium / Camomell /
Mellilote / Boli armeni / aluminis / Mirre / Olibani / at{que} Citonij / meddled
with wine. and do in the drink Sticados with water and honey / and therewith is he
eased of the payne / as the master Auicena saith. And when the blode comes
out of the brain of the stroke / somust you give the pacyente to drink the
brains of roasted hens with water of Garnet. Theo doricus makes thereto a
plaster / cum baccis lauri / cunino / aniso / sale / thure / at{que} cribatura
furfuris / dressed with wine.

And ye may give for this fracture a good drink / for by nature of him self
with little help may be holpeu.

Of the cotusyo with a great fracture and brekynge of the brain pan. Ca.
xxxiiij.
IF the fracture be great / it is needful to go to the Surgery / and to ye
more making of the fracture / that proves Galienus i sexto / Auicenna in quar
to. Therefore it is needful in great contusyon to uncover it and to make greater
some part of the fracture / by cause the pannycle may be closed of the evil
matter. Thefore said Guido / ye shall not work after ye masters that saith
they will cure with their drynkes without surgery / and raysynge of the bones /
it is possible of the small contusyon but not in the great contusyon. Therefore
it is needful to go to the Surgery / of ye fracture of ye brain pane / ye
which Galienus saith with short words in sexto Terapetice / if ye woude be with
great cotusyo / ye brusynge must be cut out with a terrybell or peerser borynge
first about / after that use cuttynge knyues or tortelles in ye beginynge.
Therefore saith Guido. viii. lerrfyng is needful to this workynge / after that
he set that work and operation concordynge with Galieno / Haly abbate / Paulo /
and Auicena. The first learning is / that ye shall not work there as the most
sykenes is / for Galienus saith there as ye deeses is ye shall not work. The.
ij. learning is / that for all sayenges take heed for to speak of the peril
that ye pacyent be not in fere. The iii. learning is / yt ye in the workynge
take heed of the comyssures of the brain pane as ne'er as is possible that ye
pacyent should be in no fere of falling hurtynge of dura matter / as is said in
ye Anothomia. The iiij. learning is / take heed of the full moon / then is ye
brain more gretter comes unto the brain pane. The. v. learning is / that if
the braydynge be in ye nether {per}te of the wound it may the better be
cleansed. The. vi. learning is / that ye in the braydynge follow not the end os
the cleuynge / for Galienus saith it is enough taking of so much from the
bones that the matter may be clesedout. The. vii. learning is / if the bone
stand styffe that ye will take ^t / than put therein oil of roses / and
therewith the bone shall be losed / and than with out payne ye may take it out.
The. viij. is / that you haste with the work as fast as is possible / and
most in pressing pry king of the pannycle / for cause incontinet comes the
impostamcyon and evil accydent / and in the descendynge of the matter ^thyde
not till the seventh day in the somer (...) the fourth day in the winter /
for fere that in the pannycle should fall such presfynge / that the workinge
should be nought Of this workynge speaks Anicenna in quaito / that in the
first ye must se^ere the here from ye heed of the wofide / make. ij. cuttynges
therein cleuyng cross wise or / after thu{is} fie sterynge * as Lantfrae{is}
saith and the one cuttynge must be the clenynge of the wound / after that ye
must uncover all the ^nised bone wherein the hole shall be And as the blode
comes rennyng out there at / so must you fill the wound with clowtes / which
clowtes must be wet in water and vynegre / or in the white of an egg And if
there come no blode / ye shall fill the wound with fine lynnen cloth dry. And
after that ye shall do thereupon the lynte of lynnen depte in wine and in oil /
and bind it than to ye wound as thereto belongs And if there be none evil
accydent coming ye shall begin to heal the broken bone / but first can^e the
pacyent to fit as thereto beloweth / and after that stop his teres with wolle
/ or with cotton / so that he be not hurt with the clap of the stroke / And
lose the ^ande of the wound / and cause the clowte ^all out / then dry the
wound. Then take (...). men and let them hold with solte clothes the corners
of the wound / and if the bone be ^eble and have small holding / then depart
it with cutrynge knyues / and with the lenticulate / and if it be needful to
stryke with the hammer / do it shortly without lunge taryenge. If the bone be
strong / (...) ^e there through many holes with the tra^ pane till it be
departed (...) other bone And than as you will takeout ye bone (...) shall it
lift up with one eleuatory to ye tie me the one bone be departed from the other
and take it out with your finger / or with a little tongue / and there after
shall you make even ye sharpnes of the bones. And than shall you cure the
wound of the bone like as is aforesaid of the fracture with the loesynge of
the bones.

The mendementes of accedetes or evils falling. Ca. xxxv.
IF there come impostume to the wound / and happens most by the pressynge
of the bone / or of ye tents / byndynge / or by cold / or evil rule / tha
must you hastily list up and depart the cause / taking therfro ye matter with
lettynge blood of the veins and with other purgacyons softenynge the place
with hot oil of roses and with hoot water / wherein is soden hye malowes /
fenigreke / lynseed / camamyll / or with a plaster of popltre / or malowes /
And if there come any blackenes in the ^a nycle by the operation of the
medicine shall cleanse it with honey / and oil os (...) if the blackenes comes
by him self / comes toward the eyes with other evil tokens / then is there
no tryst of lyffe in the fyke pacyen^. For master Paulus saith The blackenes
(...) tokeneth the dystruccyon of natural he^e.

Of the dyntes of the brain pane like as a kettyll is dynted when they fall
upon a hardestone. Ca. xxxvi.
IF any come to you that is ^yten with aclu^be / or with a stone / or is fallen
^om some high place / yt the brain pan is broke that may you know by ye
^oken aforesaid. If the ^kyne and ye flesihe be hole then cut the skyune t^e
square / that ye may se the brekynge of the heed or brain pan Then take
white lynnen clothe and dere it in oil of roses / and meddle it with the yolke
of an egg. and if it be need to stop ye blood so do to the foresaid oil this
powder here after following.

A powder
Take Mumie / half an ounce. Boly arm (...) / Aluminis / zuccarini / of each a
dragma and thereof make a powder. And if it will not stop with this powder / set
ventoses or bo^es without flemynge on the back of the neck / and that
stops also the blood / then bind the wound. And when you dress them the
second time mark the nature of the pacyent / and of the wound / an if he be
strong or feeble / or if the fracture be crooked or right / hoked or roude. Then
stop his eeres sorheryng of the strokes / and tha lose out the crooked bones.
And take heed al ways of the seem of the heed or brain pan / and for the
pannycle that lies under ye brain pan. If the brain pan be dy^ ted in
without departing tha draw out that dynte with your instrument / and if it
will not come out / soften the same place ^o oil of roses / so that it may
come out without payne. If the one del of the bone fit under the other bone of
the brain pan / weken it with oil of roses / and then list the bone out
with one of the instruments standing in picture after this chaptre.

Mark pryncypally the wekenes / or feeble nes / of strength of the syke pacyent
/ if he be yonge or old / and what you will work on a day in a strong parson
/ that do in a feeble parson iii. ii. or. iii. days. and washed every day
with oil of roses meddled with rose honey / and with bolo armend. If the stroke
be on the place there as the heed and the brain pan is bound together / then
is the wound in peril to cut / for in that place the syne was / the brain
/ and the brain pan is bound to gyder / and that the wound changes often
times with payne / and that comes by the heuenes os ye brain / and it is the
causes of death. The wound in such a place is peryllous to heal / therefore
take not lightly upon you to take out bones / pryncypally with wekenge with
oil as is aforesaid. And when that you have taken out that bone then lay in ye
wound lynnen clothe depte. in the oil of roses meddled with rose honey / after
that the woude is great and small / and lay one clothe upon another till the
wound befull / after that lay upon the wound cotto depte in oil of roses /
and a little boly armeni / and therewith dress it / and lay thereupon a
coverture made of shepes skin / and bin de it fast thereupon. Or help them
thus When that you have shorn of the heer / tha dress the heed with oil of
roses warmed. The second day cut the skyn open / and fill the wound with
lynnen clothe depte in oy le of roses meddled with the yolke of eggs made warm
a little / and dress it therwt till the broken bones depart / and ever do
your dylygence and dress the heed often tie mes with defensysse unto ye time
the woude be hole. Than take he de that the pacyent may do his easement / that
he at the first be let blood on the vain. These before said things you must
take for all dyseas of the heed from the begynynge till you be sure that no
impostume come thereto / for if impostumacyon come thereto it is deedly.

Therefore ye shall know that this salve made of oil of roses and honey
cleanses all the impostumacyons of the brain / and if it be not driven away
therewith / than is ye wound deedly. And as the wound is cleanses / and the
panycle above to the bray no pan grows / than put the powd there in / for it
strength to ye brain / and makes the wound hole / gadereth therein fresshe
flesh / it is very good to lay thervpo a grene wounded plaster / or the
plaster of master Ancelmus of Genes.

A powder.
And the powder aforesaid is made thus. Take Olthan^ Cyperi / nucis Cypressy /
Myrtillorum / Myrre / of each an ounce. ^arina Orobi. ii. ounces. all this made
in powder / ye shall occopy it in this manner. Take a cloth and deep it in wine
/ wrynge than the wine somewhat out of the cloth than take the powder and
skatter it upon ye clothe / and lay it upon the wound.

Another manner to make powder.
Take Mumia / Dragantum / gommi Arabici / of each an ounce / sanguis Draco nis
/ farina Orobi / Myrtillorum / of each half an ounce / and hereof make a
powder for that is good in the somer / and the other aforesaid is good in
winter. And thereof ye may make also a salve with Rosy^ / wax / and oil / as
you make other salve / to know / to. xxiiij. ounces of oil / ye shall take
iiij. ounces of wax / vi. ounces of rosyn, meddle therewith over the fire. iij.
ounces. of that powder. And if you will have the flesh to grow put thereto
this powder of nucis Ciprssi / Gall / sarine Orobi / of each an ounce. sanguis
Draconis / Mastitis / of each half an ounce. and make thereof powd

Another manner of powder
Take Litargirum / Thutia of each an ounce / Thuris / Masticis / of each half
an ouce / Mumie / Mirtilloy / Gall / Nuris cipressi / Farina orobi / of each.
iii. dragmas and thereof make a powder / and if ye woude grow rank of flessche
then cleanse it with vnguentum apostolicum secudum Auecen nam / thereupon lay oil
of roses / white rose honey. If the brain be not broken / than you need no more
but dress ye heed with oil of roses and boly armeny / and lay upon the heed a
plaster made of new wax and myrtyll powder that brings strength to the
brain and defends the place that no moystnes nor swellynge come thereto /
also there is no better comfortynge to the heed / also if the brain pan be
broke or not / lay every day ye foresaid oil round about ye wooded place
unto the. x. day / and ye wyn la unto the. viii. day / and the pacyent may
drink no wine / but barley water or water of lettuse / or of gordes. If he
before syke give him to ete hens / chekens sodden with lettuse and with the sede
of goordes / all after as he is hoot of coplexyon / he be in a hoot country /
than he may drink strong wine or garnappell wine / and so rule the. vii. or
x. days / unto the time ye se ye be sure of ye impostumacyon / give him to ete
moist flesh and motton / for the moystnes of the flesh makes ye hardness of
the braynepan ye may give him roasted peers / patryces / small birds / he may
drink no wine therefore give him water to drink with ye cromes of breed /
pryncypally the parsone that is hot of coplexcyo / or be of hot coutre. All
these aforesaid things coforteth the maw. And if there be any parsone smitten
upon the heed with a clobbe or staff / or by reason of a fall / whereby ye
braynpan is bruised indented nothing parceyued in the pannycle that it is
towched / ye shall sheer of the here / take Aloepaticu / sanguis Draconis /
Myrra / Olybanu / reed Coral / of each like much / make in powder / meddle it
with ye white of an egg / and make a plaster thereof / lay it thereon till it be
hole. and if it be sore wooded do to him as I have learn you before. Thus have
I lifted up the braynpan of. ii. children / help them. The one was. iiij.
years of age and was fall from an hows. And ye other was. vi. years of age /
which was hurt with a stone upon his heed / in so much yt there might have ben
half an egg laid in the dynte of the brain pan / then died I shere of the
here / and because I cowlde not she re of the here in ye holownes / I laid
there upon a plaster of exicraciu. ii. straw breed thycke stricken upon a leather
/ and let it lye thereon / in few days was the brayn pan even as it was before
/ that was not only by the workynge of the plaster / but also by natural
heete and moystnes / why che heete and moystnes causes the chyldes heed to
grow greater / which will not happen so hastily in an old parsone.

Also if one be smitten with a staff or club / sword / or other weep / whereof
ye {per}son is swownynge / yt he hath so great payne yt he loses his wit /
that his heed is swol le / ye shall help them thus. First let him blood out of
ye heed vain upon ye hand on ye same side there as the most payne is / that
ye evil ylode may be taken out / or let him be let blood with ventynge or
boxynge about the neck behind / or behind the elbow. Tha make a plaster for
it / of malow leues of where bran / of each like much sode together with water
/ meddled with a little old greece of a gelded bore / make thereof a plaster / lay
it warm upon the heed three time a day / if it help him not hastily / it is
in doubt yt the braynpan is broke / therefore take heed to the tokes in ye.
xxvij. chaptre. of the fracture of the braynpan. Than cut the skyn open loke if
the braynpan be broke / if it be broke / work after ye. xxix. chaptre. Cleanse
the wound with vnguentu fuscum / or with vnguentu apostolicum un guentu fuscu of
each like much / or with rose honey / oil of roses / the yolke of eggs / of
each like much meddled together / thereof make a falue / then do flesh grow
in the woude with vnguentu aureu scdm Mesue. stryke the salve on the lynte lay it
over ye woude a grene wooded plaster / like as in the anthidotario I shall set.

^Herbe. vi. capytall instruments of each other must be three mance of sorts /
great / small / mydle syse. First there ben trappanes to make small holes for
lyftynge up ye bones / there is of dyne^ ^haners. Galien^ makes ye Trappancs
like a pers^ shers on the end brother upward / because ye instrument in down
pressynge / fall not upon dura matter. as here shows in pych^e.



Also the masters of Parys makes their Trappanes in the manner here following
in figure.



They of Bonony makes after another manner their instrument like a sphere.



There is. ii manners of separatory es or de partynge instruments for to depart
one hole from the other. the first is Gallicana like as here stands in
figure



The other makes the of Bonony as her stands in figure.



Of that end maybe made anclenatoriu / or a lyftynge instrument.

The third be there eleuatoria for the departing bone to lift up / as here
shows



There is an instrument called ^ug^ makes the cuttynge wyder. like he^e.



There be lentirulares / is an instrument most praises of Galieno / makes even
the sharpnes of the bones which be departed / is made like a penneknyffe
without lenticle / as here is figured.



The. vi. is the hamer to stryke the lenticulare / which must be made of led /
for to be heavy small / according to this figure



Of the woudes in the face. ca. xxxvij.
With this instrument ye shall lift up again the broken brain pan / all
alter as the one part of the brain pan is be sen up ward / and the other
part downward And ye press or vyse wherewith the brain pan shall be boren
must be very sharpe.



The foresaid instrument is good to work on the side of the heed / or behind
on the back of the heed.

This instrument is for in work upon the heed / when the brain pan is beten
in / for to lift it up again.



THe wounds of the face shall ye set to gydder without sowyn ge / after this
manner. Je shall take masticke / and dragons blood / and make it in powd / and
meddle them with the white of an egg till it be as thycke as honey / and therein
deep. ii. clothes the length of every side of ye wound / and lay on every
side of the woude a clowte and let it dry / the sow the clothes together / and
lay upon the seem this after following powder.

(...) powder.
Take dragons blood / ye lyme of egg shells / and white frankesence / lay
over it tow depte in the white of an egg meddled with the same powder / tha^e
heal it like another woude with plasters / salve / powder / or with ^awme. If
it be in a flesshely place and is not possible to beholpen after this manner
aforesaid / than ye must sow it with a round nedell and a small thread / if
the wound be dry / it must be sowed with a square nedell. And if the wound be
shot with an arow / and ye arow heed / or pellet of a go^e be in the body / do
as the foresaid chan^re shewith of the drawing out of ye pellettes. If it may
not be / so put in ye woude oil of roses / and lay on the wound the yolke of
eggs meddled with oil of roses / and use it till the nature prepare the way
of his coming out. And it hath^en often (...) that a parson hath borne pryuely
a pellet in his body a lunge season / and yet by ye course of nature hath come
out by himself And over all take heed that the wound in face be not frounced.

Of the woudes in the eyes. Ca: xxxviij.
THe wounds that happens in the eyes or the ^acou^ is great peril / because
of swellynge in the sight / and also it is ^yghe the brain / and also I have
often times scene of so small a wound coming hath stopped the sight / but not
all only the wound of the even / but also the wound about the even often
times it causes the fight to fail / if any moystnes be touched than follows
after the dystructyon of the even / yet have I known the contrary / For I have
scene child that on an evening by myse fortune of his fadet was stricken with a
sherpe aglet of a point in his eye / which aglet stack in the eye styll /
and afterward was taken out / and within xiiij. days after the white of ye
apple of the eye cone out / a spoon full / than was I set to the child / and
(...) put always in the even this water hereafter following / Fenyll water /
Rose water Poley water / Eusrasie water / Few water / of each half an ounce /
and of ye white of eggs. v. dragmas / and meddled them together / and dressed
the child there with all and recovered the sight again / In like wise a child
of. viii. years of age was hurt with a shaft in ye sterre of his eye / that
therein was fene a great web / thrughe yt which stroke he was blind / and I
died help the child with the same water that he had his sight. In like wise
speaks Galyenus of a child that he saw hurt with a sharpe iron in his eye
in so much ye watery moystries came out of the apple of ye eye it was healed
also / which cure is seldom scene. Jesu hath a another manner of cure / to came
the matter to come to the eye and if there come no blood out of the even / then
put Tuthiam a little Camfere unto the foresaid water. And if there have any
blood gone out / then may it be cured with Sedengi which hath the virtue so to
do / lay upon the eye where it is swollen the white of an egg / but let it
not lye lunge thereon / for it will take away the sight. For I have scene a man
of. xxx. years of age smitten with a stone upon the side of ye nose thrughe
which stroke the eye was greatly swollen / there was set a simple harbour to
take that cure in hand / and so lunge he let a plaster lye thereon that ye man
lost his sight and was blind ever after. Benemirus praises sore in this
behalf the white of eggs ground in a mortar as in manner of a faiue / and in
this substancye so made is great virtue given by the might of god.

Also if any person be wounded thrughe the upper lyd or nether lyd of the eye
that it hang down / then shall ye with subtylte sow up the sore with a
crooked nedell and a sylke thread waxed that the eye may swell the less / lay a
plaster made with the white of an egg meddle therewith a little dragon blood
with frankincense and loke that the plaster touche not the eye / and ye shall
make it as hole as the other eye / or also to balsam and that it come not in
the eye: and drop in the eye always the foresaid water for the defending of
that. Also if there come any thing in the eye yt grieves him / as small stones
or cha^e / or by (...) / to drive away the payne ye shall (...) in ye eye
woman's milk or fair s^te water for that cleanses out that ye (...) therein /
and if that help not / turn ye eye lydde and take a sylke cloth and therewith
cleanse it on^ / or with a small roll made of cotton / and if it hold fast in
the eye / draw it out with a small roll of rosell drop therein woman's milk of
a wenches^ turn the eye lydde then take ye little white stone of a swalowe
and put it in the eye it will run about the eye / and cleanse it / and if it
be the fylynge of ^ron take up the lyd of the eye and hold before it a stone
called Magnete and that will draw it out. Also if there be any passon (...)
with an arowe or with any other wepen in ye eye wherein is gre^yll. Nevertheless
go^ forth a^ ma^t of ways with the faiue of oil of roses so lunge as none
inpos^ macyon nor swellynge comes thereto / after that mark howe deep the
arowe he^ is in. Then work after the chapytre of the drawing out of the
arowe. And when ye arowe is out fill the wound with oil of roses meddled with
the yolke of eggs some what warm / and cleanse the wound with rose h^ny /
barley meele / and meele of fen creke / and then make flesh in the wound
and heal it with a grene wounded plaster^ or with a moist plaster. There
stands in Antithodorie / that if the arowe heed abide therein / ye (...) work
after the chapitre of the heed / and if the wound have need to be made wide /
work after the chapytre of narowe wounds and make it with a year of a sponge
/ if the wound be great (...)ghe / work after the chapytre of drawing out of
a row heeds / or let it abide within till ye time it come out by the own
nature. For wylhelm{is} saith yt he hath scene apson bear in his face an arow
heed an hole year loge / which came out by his own nature / than the woude was
cured in such manner as is aforesaid of ye wound in ye face / Also if there
any parson be hurt in ye eye with a nedel / or with a thorne / work as I have
said before of ye defesinu to noynte about the ^yen / heal it with this colerion
following. Take Boli armeni. ii. ouces / Thutia / sanguis Draconis /

comes in the even from ye woude after shesus saying take thereto the milk of a

arow howe depeit is gone in / for ye pacyent may come lightly to chaugyng in

that token is his even reed / therefore it is peryllous to take such a wound
in hand. If you will do it ^rough great desire or other causys / tha tell his
fryendes all the tokens and conditions / that ye will not take him in hand but

Of the wound of the neck ca. xli.
AS the synewes and bades in the neck is wounded the wound is so deep (...)
chynge the mary / it is deed lie. The likeness of nucha yt is the mary of ye
backbone / it is in like the sykenes of the wayne. And come the woude not to ye
mary / all is it curable / for all that it is in great peril / for the
woundynge of the synewes which his beginning takes on the side of ^cha.
Therefore is said / as the wound is deep to ye reuersyue synewes so shall he
always be force of speaking. Come the woude to ye synewes by the ecre / than
the pacyente shall ^ And the wound in the great veins is vetyeuyll / for
cause ye g^te rynnynge out of the blood hastily departs the spryte of lyf.
The woude of Merry there as the mete gothe through / and the throut there as the

this is for the woudes which come in the length. If the woude be thward and
the synewes and bounds is wounded so set the synewes together / and sow it deep
in the cuttynge of the woude / and thervpo lay the powder aforesaid of the
eggs shells / and than there vpolay the groude worms staped and meddled as it
is before said in the. xiiii. chaptre. If the great veins be wooded it is in
doubt if the blood may be stop or not / if the wound shall be held or not
/ if that {per}soon shall dye or not but stop the blood with sowynge of the
vain so it may best be done. than make thereupon a plaster of this epythimia /
that Galienus set in quinto Therapentis. and take Frakensence one part / Aloes
half a part and make it to gyder in powder / meddle it with the white of an
egg in ye thycknes of honey / therein deep white here of hatys / lay it upon
the wound of the vain. or take this after following reed powder.

A powder.
This powder is made after the lernyng of Rogerius of Colofonie. iij. ouces /
Conso^ nor / lapis Ematicis / Masticis / saguis Draconis / Olyha^ / of each
half an ouce. all this make in small powder / and ^pyt it as is aforesaid. And
if it with that will not be stopped the pull ye vain out dress it as I have
said in the. xv. chaptre, of the stoppynge of the blood. If ye woude is behind
through the bone that ye back mary be wooded / it is very ill. therefore take
not to cure such a wound. If ye be desired to such a workynge / sh^ tell the
friends that it is a deedly woude / Nevertheless do your best. And in the
beginning put therein warm oil of roses / say thereupon oil of roses medlyd
with the yolke of an egg / so it less the payne / and as it begin to matter /
so shall it be clensyd make flesh with this plaster / as wylhelmus lacirancus
wrythyth and Guido saith ye same

A plaster.
Take rose honey vi. ouces / barley meell one ouce / torpetyne ware / rosyll of
each ii. ouces frankincense / mastyk of ^ myrra / sercocolle / mumye / of each
half a dragma. o^tu masticis. iii. dragma / of this make a salve / stryke it
on a clothe / and say it on ye ^ucha or back mary / it shall be better ^ ye
master or surgya think it un^ / but it is not ipossible to ye nature as she
may be helped with the strength of ye good medysyne clensynge. If the woude be
lunge / the bone wooded / and any pieces be cut of / so need you it to take out
/ if it be possible / than sow ye woude like as I have showed before / and
cleanse it heel it like an other woude / if the botton of the back bone is cut
through / or ye back bone by the neck / so as he has lost his meuynge / so
it is in {per}ill to help him. If it be not lost / help him with the
strength and clensynge of the rose honey / torpentyne / fenigreke meel / and
thereof make a plaster / and lay it on the woude / and about the woude shall ye
stryke defesuru / heal it like an other woude / If the wound be through the
throat goll / it is great peril / because i^. veins is in it / the which
veins comes to the loungis / and to the heart. As they be woudyd that is in
great peril and dedly / hereof wrytheth wilhelnius de saliceto / that he saw a
great lord was shotten in one of ye aforsayd veins by the throwte goll / there
went out one drop of blood / in cotynent the lord dyed / and the place of the
wound was black / he rattylde so sore till he dyed / thereby understood
wilhelm{is} that the blood ran to ye louges / to ye heart stoppynge his brethe
/ wilhelm{is} mind was to leet him blood on both his armies / but the time
was to short for him / therefore it is good in such a woude the pacyent to be
let blood / Also he saw a knight that was hurt in ye neck with a lunge
knyffe that the throwte goll was woudyd / he fill down lay styll / and
wilhelmus thought he had be dede / because he felyd no wind come from him /
and he halpe him that he came to life / Also he saw a presoner in the town of
Tremode / which of dis{per}acyon cut his one throwte / that his meet came out
again through the wound and his brethe / than bound he again the parts of
the wound well fast together / and laid there upon this powder.

Take dragantum / sanguis draconis / gumy arabici / of each like much in
powder / with this defensyffe powder / and plumacyoles or small kussyus of
clouthes or of roywe / and with the byndynge thereto at lenkth / he was helyd in
a month. Is the woude in this {per}tys aforsayd / with a shot of an arowe or
stytche with a dagger / and the arowe in the wound / then take it out softly
as is aforsayd in the xvi. chaptre. If the arowe be taken out / bleded sore /
then stope it as I have said in the xiiii. chaptre. And bled it but little / or
is there no payne the heed th^ with (...) ^nto (...) (...) wound upon yt ye may

meddled with the yolke of tyges / and (...) therewith (...) woude open unto the
time yt matter comeout. The clese it like another wound / and heal it with a
grene wooded plaster / or with bawme. Some time the wound is shoten through the
neck towched the throwte goll called hysophagus / and trachea / but the
synewes and veins be not towched / then need none other cure than the cure of
another wound.

Of the wound i the schulders or between the schulder Ca. xlij.
IN this places to be wooded it is very {per}yllous / for the synewes which
come frome the brain / therefore it is dedly after the woude is deep or not
deep. Mark al so if the wound is in the length or overthwart. And is the
wound wide then sow it / and let in the nedermost end a hool open where
through the matter may avoid out / yt the woude may be clese / and lay upon
the seem this powder folowinge.

A powder.
Take dragos blood / gum of arabie / and dragantum and make it in powder. If
the woude be not depethe heal it with ye grene wooded plaster / or with bawme
like another wound. If the wound be deep you be feared for the payne of the
synewes / thene lay first in the woude oil of roses meddled with yolke of
eggs. Thereafter lay on every day a clensynge plaster. as I have wry then in
the a for said last chaptre / and is made o^rofe honey / barley meel / sometime
with turpetyne / myrra / sarcocole. about the woude stryke a defensyffe / made
of bolo armeno / oil of roses and with a little venegre. And as the wound is
well clensyd / then do flesh grow. and thereafter heal yt like another
wound. If ye wound be shot and that the pelleth or arowe heed is in it / then
make the wound greater / take out ye pelleth or arowe heed as I have said in
ye xvi. chaptre. when ye arow heed or pelleth is pulledout / then put in the
wound oil of roses meddled with the yolke of eggs / and all times stryke the
wound about with ye defensyffe as is aforesaid / and the next day cleanse the
wound. If in the wound growed corrupt flesh / then cleanse it with un
guentu apostolicu scdm Auicenna. And it is well cleseth / then heal it. And all
time hold the rule with lettynge of blood / to the chambre going / and with
mete and drink / and with myxed wine / after the dysposycyon and after the
coplexcyon of the wooded parsone.

Of the wound of the sholds and uppermost part of the arm above theelbow. ca.
xliij
THis woude is in sondry manners. sometime is the shoulder wounded above
ouerthward sometime in the length. sometime the arm above ye elbow is wounded
out th^ are sometime in ye length. sometime is ye woude small and through the
skyne / and some is a great wound through the skyne and flesh. sometime ye
synewes is wooded / sometime ye veins / sometime arteries / sometime the muscls /
sometime the bones / or the hole pipe therewith. And this happenyth / sometime
with a sword / sometime with a dagger / sometime with shot. Al this woudes must
you know to bind in sondry manners because it is a membre that is much
occupied / and needful to the body / and to al occupacyons of crafts.
Therefore remember well howe you shall bind such a wound like as it nedyth.
If any be wounded ouertwhart in ye arm / tha it is fere that (...) lunge
muscles or lacertes is wounded and the synewes that comes from the heart in
the arm / and it is to fear that the hand of the same arm shall have no more
power and that membre shall lose his meuynge / if the arm be hole or not. The
losing of his meuynge comes sometime by the woudynge of arteries veins there
as ye blood may not be stoppyd to the will of the surgean. If any be wounded
with an instrument that stiched and falls upon the synewes or boudes by the
muskly flesh there is to fere for coming of the cramp / and thereafter the
death. As the payne comes in the wooded place / than goth it forth through the
hole place upward in the bran / and so brings the synewes and boudes to
putre faccyon with ye evil matter And there falls often times great payne in
the woudes. iij. finger broad benethe the shoulder /. iij. finger broad above
benethe the elbow there as the lunge muscles is / and there the synewes be bare
/ of ye which aforesaid payne comes ye cramp / and through the cramp
comes the death. As the wound is of length in the uppermost arm that stodeth
on the shoulder / such a wound is not peryllous. If any be hewn through the
shoulder to the dysmebrynge of the arm and ye arm hangs / it is needful to
be well sowed / because the arm is great and heavy / than lay thereupon tow
deped in ye (...) of eggs / therein mydled with a little of the powder made of
gum of arabie / dragantum / dragons blood / thau bind and heal it like
another woude / and bind an harde kusshyn under the arm. Or make him a
croutche there with to lift up ye arm so hye as it is possible. Is the woude
over twhart that the synewes and other veins is wooded / than shall it be
sowed / and the payne be taken away / as I have saydin ye. xiiij. chaptre. If
ye said veins be sore blodynge / than work with the stoppynge of the blode /
and with sowynge of the synewes as I have learned in the. xv. chaptre. And ye
pacyent shall be defendyd from the payne yt the pacyent may rest the better /
and altyme stryke about the woude with the defensyuum of bolo armeno / olium
rosarn / and venegre / and lay on the seem that powder of frankesence / dragos
blood / lyme of egg shells / and white of an egg / with plumacyoles / like
as it is aforesaid of ye other wounds. And hath the wound but little bloded /
so let him blood on the veins / or with ventoses or boxces / after the pacyent
is strong / and defend the wound with ye desensyuu / and hold him to the
draugthgoynge / that to ye woude come not impostumacyo nor swellynge (...) I
have (...) before. If the synewes or muscles be he^ through / then sow it with
a wax dread oil of roses / that thereto come no payne / after bind and clese
it with mudificatyffe that bel^nthe to the synewes.

A mudificatyffe.
Take myrra / sarcocolle / turpentyn / honey of roses / but this mundificatyffe
shall not be laid in the wound unto the time yt you be sure that no
impostumacion come thereto Therefore take the rule of bloodietynge / (...) with all
things as is aforesaid. In thi^ place for shyftynge sowynge of the ^wes will
not slake lightly ye payne / whereby the uppermost mebre is the febler / ^che
synewes was used to serve him / than it is needful the stytchynge or poynture
to hold open / and fill the hole woude with oil of roses / and yolke of eggs /
of ye same lay on the wound. If in this place to the woude come a hot
impostume / then do as I have learned in the chaptre of the ruling. And if there
come blodynge with the todoynge of the oil and the yolke of the eggs for
takige away the payne / like wise if ye will stanch the blood with drynes
whereof comes ye payne / and if you lay therein ye oil and the yolke of eggs
that cause the bloodynge. For all that ye must stauche ye blood and take the
payne away / therefore it were good that the end of the vain with hot yro be
feared / as I have learn you in yt. xv. chaptre. and the Iron shall not towche
the lyppes of the woude. And tha lay shortly there on the oil of roses and ye
yolke of eggs for to take awayethe payne. If any parsone is wounded above the
elbow through the bone / the sow it / and keep the sowynge with this
afterfolowynge powder.

A powder.
(...) of egg shells / dragons blood why^e frankincense all made in powder /
and^owe depedin the white of an egg as another wound. Than shall you ye arm
spl^nt^ to the wound so less as yeinaye / that she may have ease that the
wound take no heet / that there come non impostume nor swellynge. To the bones
which were brokenor cutteth through / Idede make a holowe pipe of wood / in the
length of a spa^e and a half lunge. and cloven in the length in twain
lymynge the one side together with a clowte / and ye other side open like a
lantern / and therein I laid ye arm with byndynge about / and in the pipe I
made an hole against the woude / that the arm or leg may be in surte / and
I left the pipe thereon so lunge till the time I toke of the bound /
nevertheless I dressyd the woude every day as there to belogth. And I dede more
profit with the pipe than I dede with ye splynttes. Somtymeleft I ye pipe
cou^red within with askyne / therouer a lynnen clothe / for to occupy the
lesser boudes / for the multitude of baundes comes ready hootnes and
impostumacyon / there again I occupy all time that desensyffe / and on the
contrary side I let blood and keep him with good rule / as is aforesaid. If
the wound be shot / then pull it outlyke as I have learned you in ye chaptre of
pulling out of the arowe heed. there after cleanse the wound / defend it from
payne as it nedyth. If an impostumacyon comes to such a wound / it is great
yeopardy / or deedly / nevertheless help him in this manner. his meet shall be
pap of sterche sodden with barley water / or with lettuse water / or make him a
cawdel of almondes / give hi wine of garnat apples / or agros medlyd with
water. If he may not do his easement then make him a purgacyon. If he be syke
and feeble / or hath lunge lay be^ then give him yonge chyckens to eet dressyd
with the aforesaid erbes. Then cleanse the woude / and heal it with the grene
wooded plasteror Jewes plaster.

A plaster for to make ripe an impostumacyon.
Take the root of lunge malowes the ryne of the root / and make it clean /
and cut it in little pecys sodden staped to ye wayght of an ouce half an ouce.
fenigfeke meell / lynsede meell / ofeche. vi. ounces. dyll sede / camomyll

together on the fere and make thereof a salve / and lay it warm upon ye
impostume / If he may not suffer the plaster / than take oil of roses / boly
armeni / venegre / a little opium thebaicum / semen Jusquiami / this small beten
/ and lay there upon till the payne be gone. then make it ripe / and then
cleanse it / and do flesh grow / and heal it.

Of the woude i the elbow, ca, xliiij
IN the wounds in the elbow about the elbow is great Jeopardy / for ye great
vayues synewes that be therein / for the blode is ill to staunce / not only the
stoppynge of blode / but also to defend ye wound frome the payne / or
swelling / or impostume / and a part of the cramp / for nyghe being of the
muscles / which be (...). (...) fyngers is above and b^the the ^bow / and also
for the bo^rs (...) the ^teyngys / and the vaynys that is within ye elbo (...)
they bring in much moystnes that is in the place closyd / for that can not be
so clesyd perfectly as it nedyth / and through such hoot^es of ye matter / the
feeling be lost Therefore take heed to stop ye blood of such a wound / and
defend the arm upward downward / for to coming of moystnes that makyth a
postomacyon / and swellynge. If than the woude be wide lunge / it shall be
sowyd as I before have said / and thee upon that powder of lyme of eggs shellys.
If the veins be woudyd so shall you bind it like as in the xiiii. chaptre is
said / and do it in likewise if there were payne / and o^er the byndynge shall be
laid a clothe iiij. do^b^e depte in warm wine / therein is soden the e^be of
mowseere / reed moder wort / or a^them^sia rubia / and a little cosalida mayor
/ and in this a lunge boude depte / th^rwith bind the arm and than lay ye
armr on a board / and that board must be so lunge as from the elbow to the
hand / and as he wylbe walking so shall the arm hage with the board in a
fouwel berynge on the neck / and bind the arm every time on height / that
the arm may be the quicker / and the pacyent may not much goonor stood /
because through such bangynge of the arm shulde come much blood thereof the
arm shulde swell. Therefore command him to abide styll / to this wound is
nothing better / tha to hold ye rule of ye woude in the jointure / as hyer
after ye shall ler (...). If in ye elbow be an arow or the arow heed / tha
follow ye. xvij. chaptre / if he will not goo out af your pleasur / tha put
thereto rose oil / make ye woude wide Inowgh whereby ye may have out ye arow
heed / tha fulfil the wo^de with ^ led with the yolke of eggs / or (...) the
whyt of eggs. and then cleanse the wound with a mundifica^nd / as I shall ^me
you here after in Antithodario. As ye be sure of the impostumac^on or swellynge
/ than do flesh to grow if it is of need / and than heal the wound with ye
grene ^ded plaster or Jewes plaster / or with ^awine.

Of the Woudes in the joints shulders elbows / hyppis / knees / and of the
glyttynge water. Ca. xlv.
When such a wound comes to you / if it be in the shulders / elbow / hyppys
hands / fyngers / knees / anclowes / and toes / and you fear for the
superflue moystnes or accydetes that may come there to. Than at the first ye
must mark if the paciet be full of fles^he and superflue moystnes / or full of
blode. Than ye must mark if the woude be great or small / deep or not or hew
/ or stytcheth with a dagger / or with a sword / or with shot / or ye stytchyng be
open or closyd. And ye must mark if the wound hath bleded much or little.
Ilso ye must mark if the wound is in a place there as the synewes / veins /
arteries / or muscles be. And also ye must mark if the wound is in ye length
/ or ouertwhart / or in a joint or membre that is much occupied / as the
elbow / or knees / to the which joint comes the most greets payne of the
great moystnes that there be sound of the nature. Also ye must mark or ye
pacyet is obedyent or not / and if ye must take heed of him or not / and out of
this points ye must take ye cure of this sykenes / the cure is to be done in
iiij. manners / The first through good rule of meet and drink / and of slepynge
and waking and of good rest / whereby the nature may be strength for to put
away all such sykenes. The second is / through taking away ye moystnes and
the blood / that must be done with purgacyos glitter lettynge of blood / or
with setting with boxces / and going to the draught / and ye contrary deele
rubbing or byndyng. The iij. is with dryuynge backward / restryngynge ye curse
of the blood / moystnes / to strength the mebre. The iiij. is with ye
consumynge of ye matter. And this is to be done with soft making of the
wound / of the helynge of the veins / or synewes or the mebre / through such
defedynge slaked the su{per}flue moystnes. Af any body be woudyd in a joint or
nyghe by a joint / that you fere that the glyttynge water shulde come out / If
than the pacyent be yo ge / and full of blood and full of flesh of moystnes
/ than ye must preserve him of much eethynge drinking / and let him eete no
fles^he nor eggs nor of no slymynge fysshe / nor meet made with spicery / let
him drink no wine / but he shall be content with pap of otes / or barley / or rise

may eete small birds / of yonge gootes / of all this a little / If he be syke
/ give him yonge chekes / but a little / his drink shall be barley water / or a
little Agros meddled with water / thereof he shall drink but little two times in a
day if he can do it / he shall wake on the day for that he may sleep the
better in the night / he shall the membre bynethe the wound lay hyer than the
wound / werby he may ye better rest / and if that he may not well sleep /
than stryke on the place under the eere / and on the betynge vain / and the
hands and on the nose thrylles with this salve.

A salve.
Take vnguentu populeu half an ouce / olei madragore one dragma / opei
thebaici halta dragma / Corticis madragore one scrupyll / croci / cassie ligne
/ of each half a scrupyll / cere. modicu aceri quod sufficit. fiat vnguentum
secondu artein. The other shall ye mark if he have course vnclene blood /
than meddle his drink with burrage water / with water of fumus terre / with
^nscute water / or side water growing in the flexce / If he has much blood
/ and ye woudyd vain has blooded a little / than let him blood on ye other
side that ye b^ de may be takyn from the other wo^ membre / and would the
pa^y^t ^o (...) let / than set him nevertheless (...) (...) boxys without
flemynge / if the (...) may not be set than in a bathe than ^ube bind on the
other side / as I shall say in the next chaptre Item ye shall also take heed
that he every day gothe to the draught onys a day at leest / and if he (...)
(...) of himself / so make it him with suppositories.

If the body be full of materies and of heet / than pure it with purgacy on
made by the pottykaryr / that the body may be puryfyed / and that the moystnes
of the wound be alteryd through another way.

A purgacyon.
And that shall be given him with sycore water / and with borage water / fenicle
water / the aforsayd reecpte is made all thus. Take Cassie fistule elect
nouiter extract. vi. ouces. Dyaprimis solute. iiij. ouces. Syrupi violati /
misces in forma liquida. or give him this purgacyon that is a little stroger for
coming to sooner to ye laxacyon.

A purgacyon.
Take Diacolycon. iij. ounces. elect de sue co rosarum. ii. ounces. and misce.
If he be syke or feeble / and so stopped / that you dar not give him ye
purgacyo / or that he will take not the purgacyon / tha make this glitter.

A Glitter.
Take ye erbe of Violet / herbam Mercuxialis / ^. malowe or pappyl / hye
Malowe / Beta romana / of each half an hadefull. water. vi. poude. this letbe
sod to gyder till ye third part be consumed. than take of it. xii. ounces.
and do thereto Honey of vyolettes half an ouce. Oil. iij. ouces. small rubbyd
salt. ii. ounces.

The third. defend the mebre for ye toronynge blood and moystnes coming to
the wound / and strength the membre that it may res^ynge and enforcyd
backewart ye moystnes. And this shall be done with re{per}cussyues and defensynes
with saluynge in the morning and in the evening / as often as ye dress the
wound. And in the beginning of your dressynge that vpperparte of ye wooded
membre roundaboute almoost iij. palm in the length / above and benethe the
woude. iiij. twhartfyngers broad from the woude. upon the wound and roundabout
shall be laid warm things as I shall say. And that defensyffe ye shall have
every time by you / for cause without that defensyuum may not good surgean be /
which all lernydmen of this conning occupied in all causys for all other
defensyues restrinynge the moystnes and other ill accidetes

An excellent Defensyffe
Take oil of Roses. iiij. ouces. Boli arm ni. ii. ounces. Terre sigillate /
venegre / of each an ounce. ^amfer a dragma. Nyghtschawe / howsleke of each an
handful / there out stamp and press the sap / an with all this same make a
salve / occupy it as is aforesaid / and as I have learned.

The fourth. Ye shall on the wound and about the wound lay things softynge
ye wound / and to brenge it to matter / and to take away the payne of the
veins. The veins to heal and to dress withtentes it is in two manners. the
one is better than ye other. The one is with warm and moyste making of the
wound. the other is with cold and dryenge and consumynge of the moystnes. but
all the doctors occupy ye first with the warming / al be it also that the
doctors whryten not of this sykenes / but alone of the discrasya / impostume /
cut tynge / and stytchynge in the synewes / veins / arteries / as I have
learned you. And this happened more in small wounds tha in great wounds / and
pryncypally in the wounds that be stytchyth / and for that ye small wounds
hath not bleded / and ye blode comes to the wound and may not out wherefore
the synewes / veins arteryes / comes to the more payne / not only because of
the blode / but also of the smalnes of the wound that the medesyne may not
come in it for the ^akynge of ye payne of the wooded veins. Therefore it were
very good to cut greater the small wounds that ye drynes may come in it. And it
is also my counsel / and I have found in it much prolyte.

One anoyntyng.
Take Oil of roses. one ounce. small rubbyd salt. half an ounce. and dry
ground worms in powder. a dragma and a half this well hot mydled to gyder /
and therein deep cotton / and lay that upon the wound so warm as he may
suffer it. and over the cotton lay a four dowble old lynne clowte depeth in
warm wine of the best that ye can get to the waygthe of. ii. pound a half
/ therein is sodden these erbes / mowscere with the yelowe flowers or Auricula
muris in latyu / herba Candela stondynge in herbario / Arthemisia / Beta romana
/ of each an handful / and deep therein the bound / byndynge therewith the
mebre / and keep ye rule which often I have learned you.

Will you help ye patient well and hastly / than he must suffer the wound
greater to be cut / and than do as I have aforesaid in ye xvi. chaptre. If he
will not suffer it / than work with the medecynes aforsayd till he be hole. If
ye have made the woude wyder or is it wide Inowgh of himself / tha put therein
warm oil of roses / therein is sod the lunge ground worms / and it
strensed again through a clothe. And there over ye shall lay cotton deped in
this afterfolowynge recepte and anoyntemente made thus.

A Recepte.
Take ground worms not dried and grafartysses / which is found under the
old moysty stones / of each an ounce / this stamp to gyder meddled with. ii.
ounces oil of roses made of lynseedoyle / that shall ye make as hot as he
may suffer it. There over lay plumacyoles or small cusshyns made of tow or
lynnen clothe and than bind it. If the wound be great / wide / and deep that
there any veins or synewes be wounded / tha shall you sow it as I have learned
you in the. xii. chaptre. and put in the woude oil of roses sodden with the
ground worms mydled with the yolke of eggs / and there over lay the recepte
aforsayde of the gra^artysses.. and do thereto an ounce turpentyne / and bind
it in all manners as I right now have learned you. This. iij. byndynges shall you
do. viii. or x. days lunge till ye be sure of the impostu macyon / swellynge /
and of other ill accidetes / that shall ye know by ye ronnynge out of the matter
/ by the dysposycyon of that wounded membre / and hold al times the (...)
aforsayd / of etyng / drinking / slepyn ^nd to do his easament by him self /
or purgacyon And than heal the wound like another wound shall be helyd.

The other manner
When that glydtynge water ronnyth out ye must dry and stop the moystnes.
and wasshe the wound with mannys water / Or put the ground worms in a glass
and stop it well / and wind that glass round about in thowgh / and set it in
an ove with other breed / / and with that water that comes of the ground
worms ye shall wasshe the wound / and thereto is better ye water that is
found between the shulders of an oxce. And as the woude is washed put therein
this powder herafter following.

A powder.
Take Bolus armeni / rede Myrre / white Frakecense / Mastick / Dragos blod /
Greeks pyche / of each like much / and this all together make in powder.

A plaster.
And then make this recepte / Take bolo armeni / an ouce. reed alom half an
ouce. and white of eggs as much as is Inowgh thycke as honey / and stryke it
like a plaster and lay it therouer. Or take this recepte here after following.

A salve.
Take bolus armenus an ouce and a half. reed alom an ouce. stuf meel of a mile
half an ouc. wheete meel a dragma. and white of eggs so much as is Inowgh /
and thy^ke as honey / and keep the rule as it is before said. It happens
sometime yt the woude is helyd / and the seuerynge or glydtyng water laid about
ye joints / and ye joint waxed great as a manys heed / and the skyn abides
hole as another skin / and these moystnes must be consumed in this manner.

A purgacyon.
First with the purgacyo of pillule hermodactuly / or with pyllule fetidis. The
second lay thereupon without that dries consumes / lay it plasterwyse over the
joint at evening and morning / it must well be bound with a lunge rollynge
bawd. shall be made in this manner.

A plaster.
Take Oil of olyue. xxiiij. ouces. Draga tu / Mastick / Gomi arabici / of
each. ij. ou. Boli armeni. iiij. ouces. roots of ambra / or consolide maioris
/ all together stamped pure and fine / do thereto white of eggs well betyn /
then occupy it as is before said. If ye will / do thereto Licium / Accricia
Alumen zuccarinum / ofeche half an ouce.

Of the woudes between the elbow and the handys. Ca. xlvi.
THis wound is not so great peril as is above the elbow / for all that the
lunge muscles is there. iij. twhart fyngers down ward ye elbow there ye
synewes stryngys be bare / that oftentimes makyth great payne / through the
cramp comet the death / this happynyth more in the woude above the elbow. Of
the woude benethe the elbow is small with out leasing of the substance / than
shall the wound be bound after that xij. chaptre. If the woude be length ye
arm or over twhart that it must be sowyd / than work and bind it after the.
xiiij. chaptre. In like wise do to the wound that is stytched. If the arm be
through cut / than shall you sow it like as another wound / shall be laid in
one pipe / or in splenttys / and in a touwell hagyd / as it is said in the.
xliiij. chaptre / and if the pacyent be not with a pipe bound / but with
splentes / than lay ye arm on a board / and between the board and the arm
with a kusshyn fylde with hey / in the winter fylde it with fedders / the hey
is for colynge / the fedders for warmnes / the pacyet shall hold in his hand
a roude ball / or a round stafe upon the board stondynge upright If the woude
be in such a membre / there as many veins come together / pryncypally ye pulse
or betynge vain / than take heed if the vain hath much blood or not / and
hath she not bled Inowghe / than do after the. xv. chaptre. Bleed the wound so
much that you can not so ^ it / than bind the arm above the wound as I you
have learned in the. xiii. chaptre. that blood shall you stanch after the
learning w^e. xv. chaptre. And than shall ye vnbynde the baunde from it / and
lay the arm so h^e that ye wound hangs not / and that the arm lay hyer
than the elbow.

A very good experimente to stanch blood.
If the wound will not leave his bledynge / then take heed of this learning.
For I Jeron was called to one that was wounded above the wrest of the hand /
and the seruaunt of a harbour hath so wen it. I asked the pacyet if he had
blede much or not he said nay / then I let the wound to be bounden to the
next day / and than ye woude bleded again. ye. iij. day, I vnboude ye
wound / than cam the blode sharply out / than bound I the wound hastly
again / but the blood ran out nevertheless / than I bound on the vain a
blood stone / as it is lernyd in the. xv. chaptre. The one part of the blood
stone dede I be thyn in powder and that meddle I with the white of the eggs and
tow therein I depte / and I boude it on the wound / and therewith was the vain
stauchyd that there no drop of blood ^am out / and than laid I the arm on a
board / and shortly cam that blood in the arm so plentefull that the arm of
himself lift up. Than laid I my hand on the arm to hold it stedly / forall
that it lift up under my hand. Than bawd I the other arm above the hand that
the hand was blew / and after that the blode cam in the arm that not was
hurt / and tha the wooded arm lay styll on the board / and when I saw that
the byndynge shulde hurt the hole h^ than I lose a little the bo^de and so
len I the handesom days bounden not to ^as^. And as I ye wooded arm vnbode
for to dress than I bound the other hand for the time the harder and for
cause the wound was staunched. viiij. days. I left the hole hand vnbonde /
and I should dress ye woude / and anon bledeth ye woude again / than bound
I again the hole arm very harde / therewith was ye woude stoppyth: Therefore
take heed when ye se such^ a wound than bind the contrary part as I have
lernyd you in ye. xv. chap.

Another experymentall lernyng for to stanch the blood.
Also was I called to a yonge man which was stytched through his leg above
his knee / to the which was called another master before / which thereto dede
a good staunchynge of blode / nevertheless the wound bleded styll / and I
desire not to come there / for cause of ye master / but I mark that the
pacyent became febler and fain tha I set the aforsayde stone / and in the
mean time dread I stamp small netyll And I cause the other master to vnbynde
the woude / anon cam ronnyng out of ye woudyd vain a finger thick blood. Tha
I laid on the vain in the wound ye blood stone and that powder of the same
blood stone mydled with the white of eggs / and ye powder thus mydled laid I
round about the bloodstone / and tha I bound there upon on the wound the
stamped small netylles and than I bound it with a rollynge boude that there cam
not out one dropell of blode. All be it so that a master laid the afor said
bloodestone on a woundid vain / nevertheless it will not stop nor stauche
ye blode / like wise as it hath happens me. And shor^ly I clean and shruped
the stone and th^ I laid it on the wound and tha he showed his power as thereto
belongthe. Therefore it is good to have ye stone in powde th^ to lay the upon ye
woude veins.

Of the wound of the hand and the fyngers. Ca. xlvij.
THese wounds be not so deedly as the woude in the elbow Nevertheless thereto
comes often times impostumacyon and swellynge / therefore take heed if it needed
to be sowed the wound / tha work after the. xiij. chaptre. and bind it like
another wound. If the wound is with shot / than take out the pellet like as
it showed before in the. xvi. chaptre. If the wound hath bled but little /
Than let him blood as is said in the. xv. chaptre. If there be great payne of
the wound / and the payne will not slake then make this after following
remedy.

This powder is made of white frankesence / dragons blode / and meddle of this
powder a little in the whyt of an egg and deep therein tow and lay it on the
wound. If a parsone is the arm or the hand cut of / and there is any pecys of

woude fast that the blood be staunchyd.

When the finger is cut through / than sow it clenely / and bind it like
another wound. And ye shall lay the finger in a pipe of elder tree / and than
heal it as I before have learned you.

Of the wound in the breast, Ca, xlviij.
OF the wounds in the breast howe they happened / speaks Gwido ye meruaylyd
him that he hath food whr yten so little of Galieno / Haly abbate / and Aniceu
na / of ye members that be holden / and much is whryten of the mebres which
holden / and in these happened the wounds in sondry manners / and therefore ye
must have also sodry cures / thereafter as they be. It is sometime done with a
sword / or with a dagger / or with a shot / or with a sphere through ronnyng.
Sotyme is wou did the vttermoost skin and the flesh. sometime in the holnes
of the breast. sometime through ye body. Sometime is wooded the members within the
body / like as the heart / / the longues / and dyafragma / that is the panicle
that departs the heart from the other members. And sometime is not towched ye
membrys within / tha it is but a simple woude. And this is needful to be
known of this particyon to the surgean / that he may the better do her cure.
And because that the old doctors in this cure accordyth not / therefore I
shall whryten some what for to know the manner of the wounds er ye take it in
charge.

The first is. If any be wounded in the breast with a sword or other like
wepen / it is lightly to known if the wound within be cut through or not / for
the greatness of the wound. But is it with a dagger or arow it is ill to know if
it goth through or no^ Therefore it is needful to have to^es fo^ to know the
same. And that token that the wound gothe through the breest / or in the
holnes of the breast is / as the wind comes out the wound / princypaly when
the nose and the mouth is stops / than shall you hage a little feder on a
thread a fore ye woude / is the woude through than shall meue the feder. The
token that the heart is wounded / is the blacknes of ye blode / and that the
members without be cold / the superfluyte of the sweyt / of swommynge / or
Sincopis minuta. The place of such a wound is under the lift pap / and
that is not good such a woude to take in hand therefore it is a cause for to
refuse it / for it is a deedly cure. The tokens that the longue is wounded that
ye blood coming there out is rede and shomynge / and the pacyente is hoot and
kowckyth / and is pale an ye place of the wound is on the right / And as
Galienus said / when much bloo^yth through the mouth without payne / that is a
token that the veins be hurt / The token ye the diafragma is woudyd / that he
cannot hale his wind to him / strongly cowghed with blood slymy spattyll /
that the pacyent hath great payne in his fyde / the place of this wound is by
the small rybbys / if ^herto comythyll accedete / ^han it is dedly / and if the
blood rya in ye belly / than it will corrupt for need and rot / and the
token of this is heuynes of the side / and of ye small rybbys / stynkynge
spatyll with much cowghe / the pacyent has therewith the axcis / and Jamer
said also / the wind that comes out of ye woude / and the mouth styncketh so
sore yt it may not be suffryd / yt clowte stynckyth of the blood that comes
from ye woude / and the woude that gothe through ye back / is in more peril
than ye other / for the veins / synowes / throat / and stryngis of the heart /
and that is fastenyth to the back / and the wound of the mary is also sore
peryllous / and the wound of the back bone that is not deep / that is not
peryllous / and the wound that towched not the back bone / is not so
peryllons. If the wound be small without leasing of the substance / and that
comes not to noneyll accidence / yt shall be dressed with tow depped in the white
of an egg / therein mydle a letyll drogos blood with frankesence / lyme of
egg shell les / and on the. iij. day shall the wound be dressed again / and
than heal it with a gre^ woundyd plaster / or with the Jewys plaster / or with
bawme / but will you occupy the bawme / so must you occupy it at ye
beginning to the ending without dressing of the white of an egg doing
thereto / and also defend the wound from hete and swellynge with that
de^ensi^um.

A Defensyffe.
Take role armeno / oil of roses / and a letyll venegre. If the wound be
great yt it must be sowed / than sow it and bind it so as I have learned you
before / and ye shall heal it like another wound with the grene woundyd plaster
/ or with the Jewys plaster / or with the bawme. If the wound be so great and
deep stytcheth or shotten / that it gothe in the hole of the body / of such a
wound said Rogerius / Brunus / Wylhelmus de Saleceto / Lancfrancus / that it
shall not be bouden / for cause ye blood shol de not abide within / such a
woude shall be kept up with tents / depeth with oil of roles / and with
salve / and stryke about with defenstuum / and when ye be sure of ye ill
accidence / than shall ye cleanse the wound with this.

A clensynge.
Take Frankesence / Myrra / Farina lupinorum / of each an ounce / straynyd rose
honey vi. ounces. camomyll flowers. ij. ounces wine one poude / and a half /
all this together mydled / and this in the wound s^owttyd / for to cleanse the
wound / and take heed that ye spowtte no more in the woude than he may suff^e
/ and than roll the pacyont on a table roundabout / and turn him upon the
wound / that the clensynge may comeout again / if he may that suffer no more
/ so do in ye woude again ye tetes / clese it with this plaster. Take rose honey
/ frakencense / myrra / sarcocolle / or take an other plaster.

A plaster.
Take strained rose honey turpentyne vi. ouces. barley meell / as much as it
needed / tha shall ye woude be clean with this plaster / with this plaster / with
the aforsayd spowtynge / that takyth away ye ill matter / and this is the
counsel of ye aforsayd masters / because if ye matter should abide in ye
woude / it would cometo ye heart / and to al other gentle mebrys within ye body
/ it would be the death of the pacyent. Theodoricus Henricus said that the
wound should be closyd. and if it is of need yt the pacyent is ^eble / tha^
shall yegyue him strengthyng confortynge to the nature / and if the wound be
not hastily closen / ye natural het ^holde through the wound come out / and
the cold air would go in / which air destroys the wound / but Guido
makyth concorde between the aforsayd masters / and said that the substance of
the things that comes in the wound of the breast / as well it is in the first
part / as in the other part And to all the woudes of ye breast belongth ^woo
curis / one win / another without / this woudes is to be known by ye for said
^okes. As you know by the aforsayd tokens / that there is no membre within
wooded / or that no matter comes therein / the wound shall ye heal without
tents / and with plasters salve incarnati^u / with plu macyoles deppeth in wine
/ with byndynge that seldom be changed / if ye be called to a woudyd {per}son /
that ye ^ere ye woude has bleded inward / that shall ye know by ye ratlynge
of the pacyet / hath he bleded a little / that ye blood rynnynge is done / than
command you ye pacyent to stupe on ye woude / that he may meue him that the
blode may come out / and as that is done / so let ye wound be tentyd with
medsynes or drynes that drawith outward / as turpentyne / or honey that is
better that drawyth outward / and dries / and clensyth. And bind him with
plumacyoles of tow / but not to styffe / in this same day let him blood / In
ye. iij. day glitter the wound with the soden wine / as I shall say here after /
than turn the pacyent on the woude / and there in do reasonable tentys / and
that it let not ye out coming of ye engeled blood or matter / and the tentys
shall be bound with a loge thread / because that the tent ^all not in the
ho^nes of the breast / for the pacyent should suffer much harm. If there be the
rynnynge of the blood / than ye shall not stop it / but if it rynnyd to much
/ than it is needful to stop it / yt the pacyent leese not his might. As that
blood is stopped / and the other side is let blood on the vain / and the wound
is glystert with wine / than ha^e you with the tents / and plastets that the
blood may melt / and consume / and ta^ge away the payne / as is these hera^.

A salve.
Take Farina ordei. xij. ounces. Farin^ ^enigreci. viij. ounces. Florum ^an.
oun^ Ab^inthei / Calamenti / and rubb^ d^anne / of each. iiij. ounces / This is
the best experiment drawing out the blood of the groude of the body. As any
^lede inwa^de through the wound / than take of the under crust of a lofe / as
hoot as it comith out of an oven / and lay the crom of the breed upon the
wound / as hoot as he may ^uffer it. And ye pacyent shall be laid upon ye
side on ye woude / this do as often as he may suffer it / till there in is no
more blood / and tha shall be give him medsyns to ^ele him

A medsyne.
Take bolus armenus / terra sigillata / with water therein is soden roses /
sumach / ballaustie / granorum myrtillorum / masticis / sytrinorum / or ye
shall give him medsyns consolidatyues / as terra sigillata / bolus arminus / of
each ii. ouces. Mumie iij. ounces. Sumach Sytrinoru / Sorboru / ^osolida
ma^oris / et medie of each an handful / sethe this in rain water / or in
water therein iron is quensyd in. Gothe the woude through to the inward members
/ and they is woundyd / than may ye yuge the wound dedly / nevertheless / doth
the best / for the nature is sometime stronger than ye wene. Therefore shall ye
take heed where ye wound goothe in / or touchyd / And is the woude in the heart
/ than receyuyth the woude of ye heart no helynge / because there is some veins
by the heart / as they is woudyd / tha comes the haestely death / and that
blood destroyed ye natural hette / Or is ye woude in ye logues / it may not
be well heelyd / but with great suttylte of an experient surgyan / and the wound
comes comenly to corrupcyon and rottynge / for the matter may not be clensyd /
than with cowhynge / for the cowhynge makes the woude wyder / also it is need
that the wounded members be in rest / for the longues is altymes meurnge / the
longue hath also a sharp suttyll blood / that not alone destroys the ill
flesh / but corodyth and consumyth the good flesh / (As Galienns said) The
medsyns that should heal the longues that can not come to the longues / than
through the lunge way of the maw and the liver / and there leesyth the helynge
his might / therefore ye longues may not well be helyd / therefore the pacyent
gettyth Empeti^i / that is that he matter spatyd / thereafter is he Ptisic{is}
and dyed.

As Diafragma is woundyd / he may not be well curyd / because it is altyme
meuynge / it is in the service of the heart / geuyng wind / therefore is her
workynge needly to the breeth / than is that also hurt / As ye parties within
be woundyd / there the senewes / muscles / flesh tokyth her beginning / of ye
which woudige takyth ye heart lightly great harm If ye woude goth to ye inward
mebres / and is ye aforsayde tokes in the longues not great / and is the woude
outwart small / than must ye make ye woude a little greater / that ye may do
therein the medsyns / drynes / and syccatyffes made of this alterfolowynge
powder.

A syccatyffe powder.
Take Dragantum / Mastike / Olybanu / Gumi arabici / Fenigreci / of each like
much. And his meet shall be of Bran water midled with penidium. And command
the pacyent to be styll and to rest without meuynge. If the wound is in
Dyafragma and the accydentes little / than ordre him such meet drink that
drives away ye cowhe. Also put in the woude a small tent depped in oil of
roses and meddled with ye yolk of eggs / like ye cure of other wouds If the
woude is inward there ye synewes hath his beginning / than it is good to give
ye pacyet to lyck or to suck cleuyng medsyns as Dyaspermata / that is most
used to cofortynge of ye breast / or Dyacodion / or Dyasymphicon / And that
yeshall lay about on ye wound / it shall be Embrationes with wine / or with
dryenge plasters and with oil. in the somer with oil of roses. And in the
wyntter with oleum Nardinu and plasters made of Calcantum / as it stood in
primo cathagenorum named ^yapalma. If the longues / or if the inward members is
not helyd in. iiij. days. so^ it not well to be helped. Nevertheless help him
with a good rule / and let the pacyente lay on the wound / and bind the woude
(...) the blode and the matter altymes may come out. And if the pacyet may not
suffer to lay all times on the wound / than may ye torn him on the other
side / but most part on the wound.

Item the comune medsyns or drynes to all innermoost members / shall be taken
the medsyns they most makyth softness swetnes. and that takyth away that is
most contrary to the wound / as herafter standyd. Take Erugo eris /
Pomphiligos / Lytargirum / Cerusa. Al is that these aforesaid medsyn makyth
fast and hole the members without. Nevertheless they opened the innermoost
members.



Therefore ye masters of this conning should take and give the pacyet some
medsyns couenyently to the cicatrices inwardly / these medsyns must he
swellowe through the throwte with out chowyug and there to ye must take things
yt is sower slymy / as Ypoquistidos Ealaustie / Gall / Psydie / Terra
sygillata / Sumach / Rose / these must be colyd with other stoppynge colyges / as
Maloru citonioru / or ^ube extremitatu / or Myrti / or with sharpe ^oyne there with
mydled Diadragantu. ^yll ye have a good clesyng / tha dohyma wassyng sode with
honey of ye best / for in all such medsyns is honey. If ye know by the tokens
aforsayd that in ye throughgoyng wound the matter is fall downward with in. tha
tarry not lunge to pull out ye matter. Wylhelm. cousayled it / and said also
that the wound shall be made greater / that the matter and the blood may well
come out of ye woude tentynge with a tent deppeth in oil of roses / and the
tent shall be broad without the woude / because it shulde not fall in / and it
shall be boude with a thread / that if it were fall in / that it may be pull out
again. And Rogerius comaundeth therefore yt the pacyent shall be tournyd on his
bake / that the matter of the wound may come out. Jamerus comaundyd that a
glystere shall be put i ye breast with a reasonable quantite of wine / And turn
th^ cyet with his ba^on a table rounda^ out / and than let ye wine com out
again. And if it come again as clear as it was spowteth therein and comes
there out not so much as there was spowteth in / than let of your (...)
owtynge and heal the wound. But Albucasis comaundith that you shall hold op^
the woude layng therein old tow / that the matter and other sup^ue moystnes
gothe out. command that the pacyent may belayd on the woude / for the matter
which there is gadereth may run out. And Albucasis saith / as there is past.
iij. or. iiij. days the time of the wound / and that the pacyente hath no
shaking of the heart / nor cramp nor streyghtnes in the breast / and that his
condition and disposycyon of him is good Than shall ye know that the wound is
in a good case / and yt the nature is strong / than less your tents / and
the cure. Yt ye mark that the pacyent may not suffer such medesynes or drynes
/ than less your tent and lay on the wound one mundificatiuu plaster made in
this manner.

A plaster.
Take strained Rose honey. xxiii^. ouces. Myrre / Frankesence / Sarcocolle / of
each an ouce / faryna Fenigreci / farina Ordei / of each a like much that it
be Inowghe to make as thycke as honey. and do thereto aly teil turpentyn that is
very good. After ye couseyile of Guydo give him to drink De torye / Castorie /
Nepida / Eariophyiata / Pipineile / Piloselle / the tops of Nemp Reedcowles /
Athasis or Tanacetu / Lycorys / of each. v. dragma. and sethe this with honey wine
/ give him hereof to drink a goblet full at every morning. And can ye not
perceive the thorough going of the wound with tetes depped in oil of roses /
nor with no other things / nor the pacyent may not suffer we sihynge nor out
pulling of the matter / and the pacyet hath heuynes and vpblowynge in the side
/ and other tokens / that is a knowledge that ye matter is gadered up Dyafragma.
Is than the pacyent strong and well content / than cousay led Wilhelmus / that
ye make a new wou de with a zesour in the neder part of the sy de of the
pacyet against the back bone between the. iii. and. v. rybbe. or between ye
iii. and. iiii. rybbes. for the Dyafragma is bowen with the rybbes and with the
back bone to the. iii. and. iiii. rybbe. and the bowynge might leave the out
coming of the matter / than would the Snrgean thyncke he hadnot cut deep
Enough / therefore it is the better to cut between the. iiii. and. v. rybbes.
And as ye cuttynge is done / thane lay therein a tent depped in warm oil of
roses unto the ground till the matter com me. and in the time of ye dressynge
/ dress ye wound shortly / that the air entre not in to the inwardly members
/ for that the out blowynge do not harm / And as the matter begin to apyre /
than shall you cleanse the innermoost place thorough the new won de with this
washing hereafter.

A clensynge.
Take wine wherein sodden is Camomylle Faryna lupinorum / Rose honey: al to gyder
mydlyd / taking so much as it is Inowgh and than strain it: and thereof spowte
one pond in the wound. Than shall you the patient roll roudabout and than
turn him again on the wound / that the wine and the clensynge may come out
again / than put the^ a tent depped in rose honey: Than lay thereupon that
mundificatiuum or the grene wounded plaster therein is much rosyll. and let the
old woude be closyd shortly. Auicenna saith. As ye thyncke be to much matter
in Pleuresy that not is clensyd in. xl. days. or les / that doth the parsone
fall in ptisym and to outdryeng of the naturally moystnes. Therefore it nedyd
to such a woude to occupy a cauterye with a hoot Iron / wherewith ye may
through bore the breast to the place there the matter abyded in / that the
matter may be dried that the matter may be driven out by little and by little /
wasshe it with honey water yt the matter may come out to the vtermoost membre /
and as the wound is pure clensyd / than go to the helynge If thereto comes an
impostume / than shall yon cut open a rybbe on another place of the side / as
I have learned you / and it shall be on the same side there the matter is / and
than let the mattter out / that shulde be not of need were the wound before
defendyd from the swellynge / as I have learned you. Take also heed as ye let
the matter goo out that ye make the pacyent not febler / therewith he should
less much of his might. And if the spryte of life is lesyd / than follows
often times the death. Therefore take good heed to him yt ye him the tent
intymes put in / depped in oil of roses midled with rose honey for better clesyng
of ye wooded place. And also cleanse the wound about with vnguetum apostolicum
/ which salve clensyd all wounds. Thereafter wasshe the wound with this after
following myxture.

Take wine therein es sod Myrre / and ye shells or ga^nat apples / and wasshe
there with every day the wound. And heal it with the grene wounded plaster:
and with this powder herafter following.

Take Masticke: Myrra: Frankincense: Sarcocolle: Dragons blood: of each like
much: made and driven in powder / and than with ye wine wasshe the wound and
straw therein that powder / and lay there over the plaster / and plumacioles.
bind it with a baunde deppeth in the wine: and heal it. Some manner of the
byndynge of the wounds in the breast makyth ye flesh: and sam holdyth alone
the medsyns. The first byndynge which makyth flesh must be broad and lunge:
and therewith begin the byndynge on the contrary side: and bind the. ii. ^es
crossewyse on the woude: and wind about with the band so often as it nedyth:
and sow the ends of the band on that first part far from the same woude
And Henricus said Thereto shall be knot two small cords / the one going on
the shoulder: and the other under the arm.

Rogerius for the medsyns to hold makes a broad bade with holys and with one
end and that other end cut: that ye shoulder may go through the hole of the
end of the band wind the breast roudabout / com again there you began. and with
that cutteth end bide him the shoulder. If it may be done without cuttynge / and
omwyndynge the breast / tha shall ye byndyng be to lighter / as he saith / For
to come no impostume vnd the arm so is the breast boude with a cuttynge band /
with the one end es boude roudabout ye breast coming under the other hole of
ye arm / and with the other end bind about over ye shoulder / comy again on ye
first side / is theraft bound vnd ye other hole of ye arm.

Of the wound in the maw molste / or pyt of the heart. Ca. xlix.
THe woude throughgoynge ye maw. is very peryst. As the maw wounded that
shall ye know by ye outcomynge of ye meet. and is ye place of ye woude before
/ than it is dedely. Is the woude of the maw not great / it is in a flesshly
place / than may it be helyd with one good sir gean. Is there any wound by the
maw or in ye pit of the heart through the skyne flesh / tha shall ye heal
it after ye. xii. chap. Is ye woude great and wide / or stryke with a sword /
than shall ye the wound sow / bind / and heal after the. xiii. chaptre.

Is the wound in the holl of the body with out hurtynge of ye maw / or onyother
mebee / than shall the wound be tent yd with oil of roses / and rose honey /
and ye yolke of eggs / till it begin togyue matter / and than cleanse it with
the plaster in ye chaptre of the breast / thereafter shall you do grown flesh
with vnguentum fuscum / or vngue tum aureum scdm Mosue / which salve I shall
set in Anthydorario / Orye shall c^cse the woude with this after following water.

A ciensynge water.
Take wine therein is sod mirre / and shell lyso of garnat apples / there in
straw it with the powder that stand in the asoresayde chaptre / and thereon lay
a grene wounded plaster / so lunge till it be hole. Is the wound in the maw
in his substance / and it gothe through than is the wound deedly. Is the woude
not great like as of a dag ge^ or another sharpe thing / than shall it be made
a little greater / tha sow it again which a thresquarnydyll / with awaxyd sylken
thread / pryncypally as ye wound is in the fles^hy part. If the wound be in
the vppermoost part there ^ynewes be / than is the sowynge for nought / and
upon the sowynge shall you lay this powder.

A powder.
Make it of white ^anckensence / mastic(...) (...). agantum / Gommi ara^ci / of
each a dragma / dragons blood / Mumie / of each half a dragma. and after shall
ye sow the wound without / and leave the thread hanging without the wound
there the maw is sowyd / as when that ye lose within the seem so may you it
pull out again / and on the seem without ye may say this powder here after
following.

A powder.
Take dragons blood ^ franckensence / lyme of egg shellys / drive it in
powder. than heal these wounds without and within like other wounds. and also
with wound drink / as I shall learn in Anthitodario. For all yt Lans^acus
saith that ye wound without shall not be cured. The wound within shall first
be cured / but that is not good / but the woude yt is with out may be changyd
through the cold of the air / and that should be the letting of helynge of
the wound within. And as the woude within is not helyd shortly / tha will it
never heal. Therefore must you apply hastily to the helynge of this wound.

And is the wound with shot / than pull out the arowe as I have learn you /
and fill the woude withoyle orroses / mydled with the yolke of eggs. Defend.
the wound with defenlyffe / The other day shall ye lay on one plaster
mundificatiuu / as lunge till the wound be well clensyd. And after shall ye
was^he the wound w wine in like wise as is in the aforesaid chaptre.

If the woude ve cut with a sword / and is great / than sow it / and on the
some lay this powder / of dragons blode / lyme of egg shells / white
franekensence.

A powder.
Item. ^ilhe^m^ made this powder of dragons blode / dragantum / gomme of araby
of each like much / for this helyd ye woude to gyderr. Thervpo lay tow
deppydin ye white of an egg mydled with a little of ye aforesaid powder. And
after cleanse ye woude with oil ofroses / and with rose honny. and wasshe it
with sod wine / like as it stoned in the Chaptre of the wound in the breast.
And yfther to come any ipostSpan^acio than straw therein this aforesaid powder
and lay thereon ye grene wooded plaster till the woude be well hole. Hold all
times ye rule of meet an drink / and lettynge blood / and doing well his
easement / as is aforesaid in the chap. of ye woudes in ye Joynte.

Of the wound in the belly. Ca. l.
Some time is the wound in the belly before / and some time be hynde / And the
wound ye es besore through the web or fleme there the boweles lay in. that
one is called Myrach and that other is a thynne panycle / and is called Syfac /
and lies within Myrach / and kepyth in him the guttys / on the hinder part is
the. v. spondeles of the run / the flesh there under. Also is there wounds
within / as in the many fold / in the guts / and in the maw / and in the
run / and in the moder (or matrix) and in the bladder / The wounds in the
belly is sometime that gothe not out / and sometime gothe there out that fleme
callydzirbus / and the guts / or other like. And the wounds happenyth
sometime with a sword / and sometime with a lance / and sometime with an arow /
and sometime with other instrumetys / that slyt chid o^ttyth. Some woundys be
great some small cut with a dagger / some twhart / some cleuyd in length. Some
little / some great / some wide / and some narowe. And this poynttys must ye
know^r ye begin to cure the woude. And herafter following be the tokens of
the wound / whereby ye shall know what membrys there be wonnded without or
within the body. The token of ye woude in ye belly going not through it is
known by the sight / and by ye pronfe / as that there comes not out. The token
of the woude of a strtche ye is going within / that is be known as yt proof
gooth deppe in ward / as zirbus / or ye guts / or any other goth^t. The
token that zirbus hath been lunge out / as it is chaugyd / that is as his
substance is black and stynkynge. That token that the guts is woundyd /
that is as the dyrte gothe out / And if the great guts / or small guts be
woundyd / is known through the place of ye woude. above the navel is the
small guts / under the navel is ye great guts. The token that ye maw is
woudyd I have said in ye fore wrytyn chaptre. The token (...) the liver is
woundyd / is to know in ye ^ coming of the blood / and the wound is in the
right side The token yt the mylt is woundyd / that is the out coming of
stynkynge / and is in the left side. The token that the renes be woundyd / is
known by out coming of watery blood. Galienus said that the wound and
sowynge is more peryllous in the myddys of the belly / than in the sides. The
wound that gothe not through shall be helyd / with the grene woudyd plaster or
bawme / like an other wound / as is learned in the. xii. and. xiii. chaptre. In
like wise shall be cured ye through going woude within / as there no lymmys be
woudyd / than alone yt the woude gothe thrugh Myrach / and Sysa^ / this woude
is cured in the same manner afor said / it must have another sowynge. The
sowynge of the belly^ is in m^my manners / And Galienus commanded the sowynge all
thus. In the first threst the nedyll in the one lip of the wound / and to
wche with ye nedyl Syfac / and af^e^ that trest the nedyll through Myrach and
knet it on the wound. And in the second stytche / let ye nedyll godin
through the one lip / through that hole Myrach Syfac / and that shall be knet
without / and goo so forth till yt be all sown / Galienus said another sowynge
/ and Albucasis folo^ with the sowynge / and it is more commonly lighter. The
sowynge is in this manner / ye shall sow the border of ye lyppys together and to
every stytche a knot / as much as it nedyd. Albucasis set the manner with
the nedyl and sowynge / as is aforsayd / but let the nedyll stytche in it /
and wind the thryd about the nedyll / as is aforsayd in ye xiij. chaptre.
Lanfrancus Henricus said another manner / that ye shall ^iytche with a nedyll
the thryde without in the lypre or ye wound / and stytche it through Myrach /
Syfac / and so as ye stytche may be ordered right / thereafter sow the other
part of the lip outward again / cut of the endys of the thread / and let
it belong Inowgh / and after that sow in such manner / and let between ye
stytchis a space of atwhart finger / and as that is done / make one knot of
the. iiij. stytchys / and so goo for the in the sowynge of the whole wound /
and through the sowynge of Syfac / that hath no flesihe / be cured with the
help of Myrach / and with the woude outwardly / and the bands of ye breast may
we occupy to this woundys of the belly / there no lymmys be woudyd / nor comes
out: When the guts is woudyd over twhart / or is in pecis / tha it is dedly /
if it be length woundyd / it may be helped. If that the woude / of ye belly is
not great Inowgh / than shall ye make it greater / as I shall show you
herafter / than shall you take out pro{per}lie the guts / and sow it there
after as it is needful / with a skynners nedyll / Jamericus / Theodoricus /
Rogerius lay elder pypes in the guts / under the seem / yt ye seem rot not.
Wilhelmus some other / lay therein a part of a crier of a throat goll of a be
/ as the. iiij. masters saith / But Lanfrancus Guide they think it not be
prof* table / for that nature is inclined to outdrawynge strange things / and
thus yt help not therefore it was laid / and it is better that the guts be
sowyd / as a fore is said / and that it be clensyd of the vnclenes / and that
powder shall hastily be laid on ye seem / and is made in this manner*

A powder.
Take Mastick / Dragantum / Gommi arabice / of each anounce. Dragons blode /
Mumie / of each halfanounce. than shall ye the guts put inagayne / as I shall
learn you / and after that shall ye sow ye utter skin / and also that fleme /
there ye guts lies in / and in the uttermost seem / lay that powder in
delendynge of the same. And master Milhelmus de saliceto saw a knyghthur
tinge him self with a knife in his belly yt the gutttys run out / and the
guttys was wounded in the length. And to the same was fette Ottobanus of Papia
/ the which gave him ill conforte saying yt he must dye / for cause he would
put in again the guttys / and they ware so grreatly swollen that they might
not come magayn. Than cam the friends of the pacyent prayng him to come to the
wounded parsone. And as Wylhelmus saw the pacyent / than he co^ maunded to
brenge warm wine / for the time was to short for to seed water with Camomylle
/ and Anyse. And with the wy no he wasshyd the guttys there ye dyrte cam out /
than sowed he ye guttys to gyder again / and he laid on the seem the
aforesaid powder. And tha he would put in again ye guttys / and they was so
sore swolle yt they cowed natbe hadelyd / for the woude was to narowe / than he
cut the woude greater with a sharys / and put the gutttys therein again / and
he sowed the fleme / and also ye skin. and than he helyd the knight that he
lyfde many years after / hath chylderne by his wife. Comes the Liver out of ye
wound / is deppe woundyd in his substance than lysed she his workynge /
therefore it is dedly / for the wounds may not be helyd for the superfluyte of
the blood / why the is the foudament and matter of the life But is she not
wounded in any part that belongyth to her / than put in again the liver the
woude shall be curyd like another wound. Is the liver alytell wounded and not
sore / tha shall it behelyd of a good Surgean like another wound. And it must
becured hastly er it chaugyd / while it is fresshe. If the Mylte be wounded /
ye must well search in what {per}te of here substance she is wounded / And is
there apyce cut of / than fulfil the other place of ye hole mylt. but not as
ye port be cut over ^whart / as ye wound of ye mylte is hard and thereof
comes the water spring (or ydropisys) / and ever feblenes of ye maw. And
hangs the mylte out / than put it in again / And as zyrbus gothe out that is
ye fleme / and is that corrupted / tha bind or knot that there is corrupt /
as Galyenus saith / an cut it of after the knottynge unto the neder part of
the belly / and ye shall leave out of the belly the end of ye knottynge that
the thread of the sowyng of the guttys may be pluck out again as the woude is
clensyd. As ye seem is made in zyrbus / tha put in to the belly that same
zyrbus again and sow the wound in the belly shortly. let it not open till the
inner wound be hole also Jamerius Rogerius Lanfracus commaundyd. and the cause
is this. There is no thing that doth so much hurt the inner ^imes or members
as doth the towchynge of the vttermoost air / of the which air it chaungyth
/ and gettyth ill accydentes of pain / and hardness of the guts / thereafter
they may get the cramp / and after to dye In the wounds in the guttys
prasyth some masters the glitter of strong black coloured warm wine / and
prycypally as ye guts hath many hooles. And all his meets to the. viii.
days shall be thynne. for it comes not to rottyng / but to helynge to gyder.
And herto the. iiij. masters praysyd afterfolowinge. Lay wheet bran an how re
and than take it out again / and do there to this drynes.

A Powder.
Take flower of sterche / Dragantum (...) miarabici / Dragons blood:
Consolidama ior or Ambra: the here of an hare / and give him twyse or thryse at
every day. Is the pacyent feeble than give him the soppys of sap therein is
sod chykes / if there be said in Dragantum. Gommi arabici: it were very good /
and water therein is sodden Frakencense: Masticke / and this pray seth Wilhelmus
and Rogerius. If there be any parsone stytcheth or woundyd there his guts come
out / and they be not hastly puti^ again that they be vnclene / swelling and
chaungynge by the air / than shall ye take warm water therein is sodden
Camomylle flowers / Ameis. or take warm wine which hath no befulle ryppe / as
Lanfrancus said / therein shall ye wet a sponge and than warm the guttys
therewith / salve ye gut les with rose oil / put the guttys again in to the
belly. Theodoric^ cuttyth open a pyg / or another be in ye midst in tweyn
laid it as warm on the guttys so often yt the guts may lessyd of the
swelling / that it may come in again. If ye guts be fallen on ye ground yt it
be foul / tha lay it in warm gootys milk / cleanse it therein / than put it
again in to ye belly. Be the guttys swollen and the wound be small yt the
guttys will not in again / than commanded Galie. Milhelm^ / Lanfrac^ / more
other / yt the woude in the belly shall be cut so great that the guttys may be
put in again.

To this cuttynge is couenyent yt instrument called Samgatoria crokydlyke a
syckyl / before on the crokynge sharpe / but not sharp on the point /
Albucasys set it in a pycture as here standed.



The pacyent shall lay on his back hye against the woude / and the surgean
shall wisely cut ye woude yt the other guts com not out / than put in again
the guttys yt is out. And ye Surgean must have a good servant which shall take
heed of the guttys without with his hand softly / than take ye wound in the
midst cut the woude wyder / put therein again the guttys / than sow it as is
aforsayd. Thereafter defend ye seem the wound (as Galyen{is} said) with
Formacis that is called sanguinolentis / yt in other members ye woude makyd
fast / like as doth the powder yt holds the seem / the plumacioles with wine
/ and the plaster with other drynes that makyth flesh. Co myth there payne of
the cutting or sowyng as it happens oft times (as Auice. said in his. iij.
Canon of the cure ofydropisis) yt of ye cuttynge comes payne and pryckyng
Therefore it is good to put therein oil of dyll or camomyl / upon the place of the
cutting lay ye plaster made of lynseed / hye malowe seed / femgreke / of each
like much. And some other masters as Henricus for takyn ge away the payne
swellynge / they sethe wine with salt therein / and so much bran that it be
thycke / they puts in a bag and laid thereupon as hot as the pacyence may
suffer. Sometimes is done thereto the aforsayd oil / do it so often till the
payne be gone. The matter that is let in the belly and can not come through
the seem ye need it not to fere greatly / for the moysines can not be much /
they members hath not much blood as Wilhelmus saith / the nature resoluyth and
cosumyth the moystnes sendyth to the flanckys / and there it be enryd like
another ipostume in ye same place.

Of the wound in the bladder / and in the kydney. Ca. li.
WEre a woude in ye parts which hold / as ye skyn flesihe / it shall be
helydly ke a woude in ye xii.. xiii. chaptre. But ye woude in theumer lymmes yt
be holden / as in the kydneys and bladder / and ye moder or matrix of a woman.
This be mebres needful to every body / this hath no other cure than the wound
in the belly. That token yt the bladder is wounded yt is the outcomynge of the
vryne through ye place in pectine. That token yt the moder or matrix is woundyd
/ it shall be known through the place under ye nauyll through the outcomynge
of the blood / and cure the woude like another woude with sowynge princypally
when the woude is by ye neck of the matrix for there is ye more flesh / there
for the woude is the better to make fast.

The woude in the kydney may not be he lyd / for it is feded with the watery
blood that the helynge belettyd / and also it is altyme in meuynge / and it is
ye way where through the vryne comes. The woude in ye bladder can not be helyd
/ for it is a synewy part without flesh / is altyme meuynge / to receive the
vryne and to give out again / But the woude yt there is in the neck of the
bladder there it hath flesh and blood / that may be helyd with a truwe cure /
like as it be scene as the stone there be cut out. which stone is grown frome
lunge times in the body of a man.

When the woude is in the hole of ye bladder there as no flesh nor blood is
that the vryne comethout / that is deedly. For all ye sow the bladder / and
lay upon the seem this plaster solowynge.

A Salve.
Take Rose honey. xxiiij. ounces. Frakencese / Mastyck / Dragantum / of each.
ii. ouces* made in powder / and meddled with the rose honey. and lay about the
wound that defensyffe / heal it. And ye pacyet shall take heed for much
drinking till he be hole. As ye be called to such patients that is woudyd in
such a place / than say to their friends that such a wound is deedly. and
promise the pacyent always his health.

And first comaude the pacyent to be confessed as one that shall dye / ereuer
his power fail / and his wit change. and there after shall you work for his
health / for the nature doth often fail that the surgean thinks impossible
to help it / pryncypally as nature gets help with a good work.
Nevertheless ye shall not believe no good token that often happens to the
pacyente. For Ipocras sath / that ye shall not tryst in the pacyente that
mends hastly without cause / also ye shall notfere an evil token without
cause / for this dysceyueth often. And ye shall think always that the patient
shall dye / or else he is all healed.

This cure ye may take in hand in your land / or in your country there as
ye are known. But in strange lands take ye none such in hand / or other
woudes that is in peril.

Of woundesi^ the iarde or coddes Ca. lij.
THe wounds in this place is ferefull for her subtle composicyon / conyngly
workynge / nevertheless if ye yard of the man be wounded in length or euerth
wart / if the wound be not great it shall be cured with ye sowynge / powder /
lettynge blood an ye vain / and with good paysyon as another wound. And if
the wound be overthwart clean cut of / than is ye wound most in peril / by
the reasen of many synewes veins / therefore sometime ye pacyent dies or ye
blood be stopped

For easynge of the payne in such a woude. Take warm oil of roses and
anoynte therewith from the vpperparte of the yard under the nauyll / and about
Periconiam that is between the foundament his preuyte / brenne the wound
roundabout with a brennynge iron / with that ye blood may be stopped / and to
take away the crape which comes often of the payne. And thervpo you may lay
also ye stone aforesaid in ye. xv. chaptre. and also the stone made in powder
and there among meddle Dragons blood / white Frankincense / and Aloepaticum / of
each like much mydled with the white of eggs stricken on a clothe / or
plumacyole yt in ye midst hath a hole as great as a strawbery / and the
plumaciole laid thereon that the hole may come evenly to the pipe of the yard
that the vryne may com through / and over it shall you do your byndynge / and
behind roundabout ye shall lay the defensyuum And ye shall give the pacyent
every morning / noone / and evening the medycynable woude drink that I shall
set in Antidothario. The wounds in the coddes destroyed ye coddes / and takes
lightly away the generatyon all is ye parson not in no peril of death. And the
cure of this is like the cure of a common wound.

Of the wound between the hyppes / and the nether part of the back. Ca. liij
IN this woude is no great peril / but if it be very great / yt the skyn
flesh / and the synewes be hurt / yt the same synewes be schronke so shall ye
man halt. If ye wound be cut with a knife sword or oterlyke weep. If the
woude be small / it shall be boude after ye. xij. chap. If the woude be great yt
it must be sow / than sow bind it after the. xij. chaptre. shall be healed as
another woude with ye grene wounded plaster / or bawm / as it is aforsayd. If ye
woude be stryke with a dagger / ye shall tent it with a comely tete depte in oil
of roses warm / and with ye yolke of eggs and so put it therein as far as ye
may with the foresaydoyle / unto the time the woude begin to give matter / then
cleanse it and he le it as another woude. Je may ask me wherefore I have learned
to put so much rose oil in the woude / and that I have forbydden the rose
oil in the. xij. and. xiij. chapt. Thervpo answer I / that ye should be the
surer faster in your working / that there to the lesser com the ill accydentes
of ye hot impostumacyo. It is more profytable such evil accydet to defend /
tha ye ill accydet to draw away / for the nature of ye oil by ye warmnes
getynge of the fire / is swettynge / softenynge / opening / pryncypally in the
narow and shoten woudes / for a stycke or a woude come to matter than comes
seldom there to evil accydent. Therefore I comaude you to do thereto a little of
the yolke of an egg / for the woude to get a little cle singe / yt the matter
sooner should come. And al times is very good to make such an oil of roses of
vnrype grene oil olyue / for the ^ose oil such oil olyue have in them alytel
bytynge with styptica. Also ye ripe oil olyue is good to make ripe ye i'll accident
/ ye myddell ripe oil doth avoid ye matter / ye vnrype grene oil is good for
ye cosolidatiuu and for helynge together the wound.

If ye woude be made by ye shot of an arowe in this part of the body / than
draw it out take as I have said in ye. xvij. chapytre. Or supple the wound
withoyle of roses and there with shall it be tentyd for to come out / and lay
about the place a defensiuum than shall it be cleansed with this salve.

And after yt heal it with a grene wounded plaster / and the salve shall be
made of rose honey. xij. ounces / fenigreke meele / lyusede meele of each. iiij.
ounces / oil of camomell barley meele of each. ij. ounces / lay this thereon /
for it takes away the payne / and cleseth the place / his drink shall be made
with barley water sodden with parseley rotes / let him take heed of blood
lettynge / and to ye drawght going for it is needful to these wounds / and
command them to be quiet for there is no better thing for a wounded parsone /
and often comes of a little woude great harm because yt he takes no heed of
such a woude / therefore take heed in such a cause.

Of the wound in the thyghe. Ca. liiij.
THe wounds in the thyghe or in ye thyckenes of the leg above the knee it is
dredful for the muscles that be there / and they be often deedly. Guido saith /
there is but little dyfferece between these wounds and ye wounds in ye arms
but a lonely the wound of the thyghe is often deedly / and yt comes of evil
accedent / if the woude be small / she shall be boude after ye. xij. chapytre /
If ye wound be great yt it must be sowed / it shall be sowed after ye. xiij.
chapytre / upon ye seem shall be laid the powder of dragons blood / white
frankencence / ye lyme of egg shells / and leave one end of ye wound open yt
there thrugh^ the woundemay be cleansed. The first day lay in ye wound ye yolke
of an egg / with rose oil / for to cleanse it / and always do about the
wound defensiuu till it be well cleansed / than cause ye flesh to grow / and
heal it with ye grene wounded plaster / and at the beginning also ye may heal
it with halsom. If the wound be so deep that ye muscle be wounded / so we the
muscle with a waxentrede / and after the skyn And if the wound bleed to much
yeshal stop it as I have learned you in the. xv. chapytre / lay on ye seem
this powder / white franken feuce / ye lyme of egg shells / and dragons blood
/ and lay about the wound that defesiuum / and in the wound the yolke of an
egg meddled with oil of roses / yfye be sure there comes no impostumacion /
than lay thereon first mundificatinum / or the grene wounded plaster / if the
wound be deep narowe / and bledeth sore / stop the blood as I have learned
you / and let blood out (...) vain there against / and lay oner it tha^
fensiu^m. Je shall know also yt ye shal^ never take tents for holding ye
wounds open there as the woude is full of waynes or ^scly flesh / for in
such a wound comes great harm of the tents / therefore is put in the wound
oil of roses before the tents / for surenes that there shall no evil accedet
come there to / therefore shall ye woude be clesed and healed as is aforesaid /
And if ye wound have not bleed much / the shall the pacyent be let blood on
the vain / and rule him with etynge and drinking and to the drawght going /
as you may se in ye chaptre of the rulynge.

Of the wound in the knee. Ca. lv.
SOre dredfull and deedly is ye wound in the kne / for ye great synewes that
is therein / for the knees hath the most great bands Corda^ / and Neruo{rum} /
they be in the ^thermore part / there the moystnes hastily comes downward /
therefore all these woudes ben daugerous / for Au^c^nna saith that the wound on
the knee by the shynne is evil / because that to the wound comes evil
accydent / thereof s^e shall seldon be sure* and these wounds have little
difference of the wounds of ye arms / hands / of feet / but lonely this
wound in this place is dredfull / pryncypally if the be. iij. fyngers from the
knee / for the goodness of ye place / so come there any accedent that the good
surgean can not better it / As it is often scene / that the pacyent dies of a
little wound / and also he must earnestly take heed of the hinder part for ye
ij. synewes that comes from the heed thrughe the back and behind thrughe the
legs to the sooles of the feet. I have scene many evil accedentes coming of
such small wounds there is little set by or take, heed to / and ye mys^e
fortune is fallen to me and other ^o / therefore it is needful to take (...)
for this wound / and to follow after ye xlv. chapytre / yt speaks of all
such wounds of ye joints the plain matter / pryncypally of that glytynge
water / and take good heed to the learning of ye same chapytre / forget
nothing to do after ye rewle of ye same chapytre / pryncypally yt the pacyent
keep him styll / that the wooded lyth mebre be in rest as little as the wound
is / of the woude be small ye more charge is in it / therefore folowethe same
learning till ye wound come to his dysgestyon and gyuynge out of the matter /
till ye be sure of all accedente / nevertheless tryst it not / but go forth
follow the good cure / till that ye full wound be hole. If the wound be shot
with an arowe supple out ye arowe with warm oil as is before said / and the same
oil shall do as much good in the ^ounde as if ye tents were put in / an y^
shall strength ye said wound with defensinu / and ye shall let the pacyent
blood out of ye vain / and to do his easement / and as ye be sure yt there
come no ^stume thereto / so shall you cleanse the wound with vnguentu
apostolorum secund^m Auicenam thereafter shall you cure it with a grene wound
plaster / also take heed if there be any bones departed from other tha depart
it hole / tha sow the upper part of ye wound together / and leave the nether
part open that the wound may be clese thrughe every day / ye first day lay in
the wound the yolke of anegge meddled with oil of roses / ye next day ye
shall cleanse the wound / after that cause ye flesh to grow / and heal it
like another woude.

Of the wound in the shynne, Ca. lvi.
IN ye shynnes is many synewes yt comes down from the brain therefore in the
wound of ye shynne is great peril / not lonely for the synewes but for ye
muscles that is iij. fyngers byneth ye kne thrugh which many {per}sons hath
great ha^e by.

If there come but little blood out of the wound / let him blood on the vayue
on the contrary part. let him hold the rule in going to stole / as I have
saith in the. xlv. chaptre. he shall drink mydled wine.

If the wound bleed sore / floppe it as is said in the. xv. chaptre. then
cleanse ye woude / if it be need sow it and lay on ye seem the powder aforesaid
/ heal it as another wound / whereof many times es aforsayd.

Of wounds in the ankle. Ca. lvii.
IN the ankle is the woude peryllous / for it is set to gyder with small bones
/ Therefore as the ankle is wounded / it may not be set to gyder in his right
coposycyon as he was before. And also the ankle is fastenned with many synewes
/ and as they be wounded it is harde to help. If it be wooded with an arowe /
ye shall anoynte the place with oil of roses / draw out ye arowe and put in
the wound the aforsayd oil. And as ye be sure of the wound / then ye shall
cleanse it / and after ye shall heal it with a grene wooded plaster. the pacyent
shall hold the rule of lettynge blood / and of the stole going / as I have
said before: If ye pacyent be very syke or feeble / give him of a sodden chycken
/ and give them also meddled wine. And if ye woude be gretely cut unto the bone
/ cleanse it withinwarde / and then so we the woudeto gyder again. And if the
synewes be cut / sow them to gyder and afterward the skin / and lay on the
seem this powder of Dragons blood / Dragantum / Gomiarabici / of each like
much and in the mouth of the woude put oil of roses mydled with rose honey.
This do. iij. or. iiij. days. and lay about the wound a defensyuu. And
afterward cleanse the woude / and heal it with a grene wounded plaster like
another wound.

Of the woudes of the feet / or among the toes. Ca. lviii.
THe wound in this place must ye know if it be shot with an arowe / stycked /
or cutteth / if it be ouertwhart or a length / and if the arowe go through or
not. And if ye arow be in ye foot draw it out as I have learned you in the.
xvi. chapytre / if you fere there sold come payne thereto by the reason that
there be many veins in the foot / fill ye woude with warm oyl^ roses / and so
you may draw it out softly and lay in the mowth of ye wound oil of roses
meddled with rose honey / and about the wound this defensiuum / of oil of roses
/ boly armeny / with a little vynegre / and as you be sure of anguysshe cleanse
the wound and heal it with the grene wounded plaster or with Jeuys plaster /
If the cut wound bleed sore / than stop ye bledynge as I have learned you in
the chapytre of the wounds stoppynge / than sow it and bind it as I have
said in ye. xiij. chapytre / and lay upon ye wound ye powder of whyt
frankincense dragons blood / the lyme of egg shells / about the wound lay
the defensyu^ aforesaid / then cleanse ye woude / and heal it like another
woude. Also lay the foot hye keep it meetly warm so yt the moystnes come
nottherin. And keep the pacyent in rule of meet dryuke / of going to ye
draught as I have learned you. Also you shall know yt the synewes comes from the
brain. and yfthe foot be cut ye must be the more dylygent and dredefull to
take it in cure.

Dfall manner of fractures brekynge of bones in general and howe they shall be
ryghted and healed. Ca. lix.
OF the woudes yt hap neth in ye soft mebres I have said / as of the skyne /
flesh / veins synewes / unto ye bone So shall I write of ye harder del / or
parts of ye body. And of all yt is cut with a sword / yt the flesh the bone
be through cut / that is called a woude with the fracture or brekyng. if ye bone
be hurt with no cuttynge instrument / but with a clobbe / or staff / stone / or
falling / or cast / or by him self / or by another / it is called a fracture
or brekynge of ye bones. Sotyme ye by no breketh ouertwharte yt in the fracture
with the brekynge is no small pieces of the bone / yt comenly is called a fracture.
sometime ye bone is beten hurt / is uneven broke with splenters yt one piece or
many pieces depteth from other / yt is called frustralis / or ye bone broken with
pieces. Sometime it is not broke ouertwhart / nor with pieces / but it is rent in
length / then it is called Apertura or rent. The token of ye fracture or
brekynge / if it be in breed or in length / It is known well enough by the
sight by vnderstadynge / as haly abbas Lafra. saith / can ye not se ye fracture
/ ye shall know thrugh selynge with your hade on ye bone (as Rasis Auice. saith)
The payne of the bone as it is tow chid / the feblenes thereof is a token of the
fracture. And as there is in ye fracture splentes or pieces / then ye shall feel
by the pieces about ye fracture it will prycke in ye flesh the pacyent feleth
the pryckynge over the place of the fracture / most when you tow che it with
your hand. The fracture or rynyng that comes in the length of ye bone is
worser to be known than the fracture yt comes ouertwharte ye bone / but it is
known for ye membre is greater and thycker / that the patient with ye membre
may not labour as he hath done before times. That bone yt is ouertwhart broken
in. ii. pieces yt is more peryllous to bind and to hold / than is the bone
that is broken or rent in ye length. Therefore as such a fracture is healed it
is altymes vneue and crooked / pryncy pally as the fracture is in a bone yt
stands alone with none other standing there by / lie ke as the formest bone in
the arm / and in ye shynnes. The fracture by the joints it is the heuyest the
worst to bind / And yt can not well be bounden for there comes often times
great payne in the meuynge / hardneth the fracture with payne and mar ring of
the flesh / And if it have much moystnes it is evil / because he can not
be* help for the time ye fayntnes must be first amended. The fracture with a
wound has a sondry cure / ye must make holes in the band / through the
which it may be healed where as need is. When any frac ture is lunge unbound
it is dredfull and ye worse. And if the fracture ware harde / than is it the
worse to set to gyder / and there fore it is needful to have a great strong
byndyge / and the great strong byndynge is peryllous sor coming onyhete
cramp (as Auicenna saith)

To know in what time the bones may be healed / that is to know. The braynnan
may be healed in. xl. days. The bone of the nose is healed in. xiiii. days. The
rybbes in xx. days. and so forth it shall be said hereafter. But the age of a
man takes away such comely time of helynge. Jamericus Auicenna / and haly
abbas saith / what is the cause that the time is lunge or ye bones be healed to
gyder / It comes often times yt the bones be oft times dressed / and moystned
with warm water / and with often tie mes meuynge / and that there is to little
sly my blood / and through strayte byndynge it beletteth the membre to fed /
hyndreth him of his helynge. And it is said that the swellynge of the membre
would great pain after ye byndynge / slakes the swellynge after the time of the
setting again of the bones that is a good token.

Item Galienus and Auicenna saith to this fracture is. iiii. divers manners of
helynge and byndynge / The first the broken bone to be made even / The other
set together again ye bone that is made even. The iii. is the byndynge with the
hole / The. iiii. to amend ye ill accidete. And in ye first I will give you
that which is nedful to this work / first se that all thing be ready to the
setting in again. The other learning is to have a comely place / a comely
seruaunt. The. iii. is the white of an egg / so much as it is Enough / oil
of roses / and depte therein a cloth / after the gretnes of ye mebre. The. iiii.
three bands lunge and broad after the mebre. The. v. is tow that is soft and
well heccled / depte in acicrata wroge out again (As Ra. ^sayleth) The. vi.
spletes yt beeue smote / made of box or harde wood or of horne / or of iron /
or of leather after the mebre three fyngers broad over ye fracture / and more if
need be / as albucaiis saith / that it touche thought for hurts the joints in
the midst thycker then in ye ends / and thereof shall be laid as many as need
is / that may goo aborte ye mebre covered with clothes washed in the white of
an egg.

The. vii. if it be need ye shall have pypes with small cords to hynde so
much as needs after the length of the membre / ye spletes shall be boun de
with the cords with the pypes / and bind it reasonably / after draw thorough
the pypes small styckes so that ye pypes t^e not / that ye dyndynge lose not.
The. viii. that ye have suspenioriu or canabulu therein ye mebre right and
surely is be set The. ix. ye bed there as ye pacyent lies yt it be need / it
must have a hole wherthrugh he may do his draught and therefore he shall have a
corde hanging above the bed / where with he may turn self. The other learning
is of ye maky^ even with. ii. servants / where of the one shall hold draw
the mebre at one end. and the other servant shall hold, draw at the other
end upright that it break not / and if they may not draw it alike with their
hands / the broken mebre stretch out / ye shall take a gyrdell made therefore
/ or any other thing (As Ipocras said) but it were very good to have a vice
made therefore / that the bone might be preserved till the mebre be bonnde / and
the fashion of this same vice stands here in pycture



The. iii. learning that the holdynger of ye membre which is with byndynge and
ga derynge together / it shall be done softly with out any payne. Galienus saith
/ they that bind / shall chose the best manner that there to belongs that the
lesser payne may be / for not hynge mars so sooue the membre (...) the
payne doth coming of the strayte vyndynge / and unreasonable handelynde /
Therefore mark well (that Guydo saith) And in like wise I also have scene many
me bres that hath been evil gnyded with esti omena rottynge / Thereof Rasys
gives warning to the surgean for the byndynge that is lose bound it holds
not the bone / and the harde byndynge brings payne / and lets food to
come to the members / and the byndynge up must be as the pacyet may suffer
withease (as Rasys saith).

Ipocras comaundeth to take. iii. bands. And the first band going upward
from the fracture which lets the coming down of the matter. The other
band is from the same place going downward and that thresteth the matter
out / and these two bands kepeth to gyder the broken bone / and defends
that none impostuma cyon come thereto / but that is not ynowe / for ye third
band must be put thereto / whi che is bound for the keep the plumacyoles to
close it withal. Galienus comaundeth to take Acerotum / wherefore now is take
oil of roses. Also Rasys counsayleth that the fracture at the first
beginning shall not be boude to fast till the. vii. day. And on the. vii.
day. it shall be bound meetly strayte / and in the first and the last end
bind it not to fast for fere of impostumacyon. The. iiii. learning is that in
the be gynnyng shall be laid good even splentes or other things in their
stead / not for to strain ye membre / but lonely for to keep it unto the
seventh day end / for fear that ^o impostnmacyon come thereto / than shall
yo^ay thereon good strong splentes / that ye membre may be hold fast / and at
ye first time I take the good splentes / and bind them some what lose / that
no swellynge nor impostumacyon come thereto / And also do so to the last till it
be well strengthed / and be not hasty to take of the splentes (as Aup cenna
saith in his book of Sargery.

The. v. lernyng and doctrine is of the tie me of chaugynge or byndynge / or
dressing The chaungynge shall not be done before the. x. xv. or. xx. day /
pryncypally as ye byndynge is dressyd with the oil aforesaid / And if the
fracture be not well and right set / or any strong accydente comes therein
the sooner it must be dressed. And if ye dres se the byndynge with the powder
as I shall learn you / so leave the byndynge thereon ye. ix. or. x. day. and lunge
abiding in (...) a byndynge wichout chaungyng it is euy^ (as Rasys saith) But
if ye were in fear yt it is not well and right set / tha may ye change the
byndynge in. vii. days. and sometime sooner. and ye shall sometime change ye
byndyng. in. x. days. for cause than is yet there not come the porus. and is
than there any uneven than make it even yt it not pryc kyth nor stytchyd in the
fracture.

If payne / or impostumacyon / or other ill accydentes comes thereto / than may
ye change it at the. iii. day. But in other cau sys shall it not be changed
nor losyd up be fore the. vii. day. but if ye matter must be clensyd than ye
may the sooner change the byndynge and dressynge of the same.

The. vi. doctrine and learning is this ^itacyons of the porus / it grow that
the^ ^day / and when it is come ye shall strength him with meet and drink /
and Galienus saith the body f^de with meet where in is great moystnes / thereof
comes not only good / but also (...) my moystnes / thereof and therout comes
that couglutu (...) that is he ling to gyder (as A uicena saith like asrys
rap where / sodden heeds / feetes of beestes / and refrain wine. He shall
be ware him for all things that bren neth the blood / as strong wine /
garlyke / onyons / mustatde / and well smelling spices. And Rasys saith / in
the beginning shall he change his rulynge / in drinking no wine / and in
going to chambre / and in lettynge blood / and there with shall be lets the
impostumacyon. and as he is sure of the impostume than may he return again to
his old rule. In the first return again to the making even of the bones
with drawing out the membre straight / and ^y^e up the bone that is pressed
down / threste down ye other bone that stands on hight and do it without
payne / unto the time the bones be knyt together in his right place. The other
learning is to be done with a good byndynge as many master saith / and some bind
the fracture even with out splentes unto the fyfthe or syxte day / some lays
with plu macyoles of clowtes (as master Petrus) some of tow (as Theodoric^) and
they bind there upon the splentes / and these both doth h^me / for the
plumacyoles should be somany that there should be no fast byndynge and in a
slyppe might the membre be hurt And Euydo follows after ye said lernyng And
at the first do that ye payne may be put away and keeping also the membre. The
second in keeping that the porus or coglutinatiuum grows about the fracture.

The third / that in keeping the membre shall be stretched brought again in his
old workynge. Also there is. iiii. manners for to heal bind this fracture. The
first as the fracture is ouert wharte / and if there be no small pieces of bones
to take out / than shall the fracture and wounded membre be stretch dout and
hold by your servants and to set right the broke bones and do after the rule
as I shall learn you / if there be any small ^eces departed fro the bone ye
stycke in the flesh and is hanging on the bone set them in their first place
and bind them well together / make the small bones in the muscles payne and
cause them to follow the impostumacyon / than it is need to cut the flesh on
that place and take out the lose bones and than to make ye mebre hole as I
shall learn you / if the flesh be bruised with the fracture of the bone / then
shall the bone be bound with oil of roses and shall lay on the powder of
myrtylle beryes / and over the oil and powder yeshallay a cloth depte in the
white of eggs oil of roses bind it softly / If ye fracture be without payne
/ and without small pieces of bones is well streyghtened / so shall you bind it
with a lunge broad band after ye dretnes of ye membre without being lunge of
doyng And your seruaunt must hold the membre while ye clowtes be laid between
(as Galienus is wont to do* the clowtes may not be to cowrse for yt lets
the good byndyng and the same clowtes should be depte in the white of eggs
meddled in oil of roses / and begin to bind up ye fracture with the ban^e going
up and down / and let ye band go enough on the hole part / and upon the
fracture bind even without pain / and upon ye band shall be laid. ii.
dowble (...) depte and wrong out again / and shall cover the hole membre and
that the ends of ye splentes hurt not the membre / sow then the clothe about
and thereupon lay the splentes made of wood or of ledder then bind it with pypes
/ then shall the pacyent be laid in a still place where he may have rest / and
if it be needful ye shall let ye pacyent blood the other day / and give him a
laxatyue in the first days / and the byndynge shall not be chanuged in. x. or.
xv. days / without were any evil accydent coming thereto / or that the
fracture be not set well to gyder as is before said / and after the. iii. and.
iiii. day ye fracture shall be dressed / and bound as it was before. And if
the time be hot there come a swellynge / or impostumacyo or any other / ye
shall occupy the oil aforesaid / and if he be sure of the evil accedent than
shall ye make this powder / whereof I have often scene great profit come.

A powder.
Take bol^ armen^ / ambra or walderote / of each. iiii. ounces / small barlye
meal. vi. ounces / meddled all to gyder. And I was wont to do thereto walstone.
iii. ounces / they be brought out of Zwytselonde / or ex ^uincia Heluetiarum.



Nota I have (...) her de a surge an made his booste to heal in. viii. days a
parsoue that has broken his leg or arm. And this to prove a dogs leg
was broken / than meddled he this powder afor said with ye white of an egg /
and laid it on te dogs leg and splented it / and as ye. viii. days were
past / than toke he the splentes of / and the dogs leg was hole. Terfore
this is my counsel to take this store for this cure. that powder has such
nature / if there come any swellynge to the bone at the first time so gothe the
swellynge shortly away with the said powder. The other manner is that after
the. xii. or. xv. days as porus begynue to come / that is to know when the
payne is gone / and there come none impostumacyon / and ye membre is of good
colour / than shall ye take of the band / and wasshe the membre in warm water
lay thervpo a clothe stricken / and bind it with all the bands and splentes a
foresaid / and bind it some what faster. The fracture shall be salved and dressed
the. vii. or. ix. day. or more unto the time that the bone be well bound with
that porus that is well know by me uynge and by the vnswellynge. The. iii.
manner is that the membre shall be washed all three days with good wine wherein
is sodden roses / wormode or abscintium in (...) tyne / oken wood / and bound
with (...) dept in ye same wine and pressyd out (...) and bound with. iii. or.
iiii. splentes / (...) shall the membre be brought by little and little to his
old workynge / and at the last shall the membre be made soft with Dyal the a
/ or oxcicrocium. The fourth manner is when the accydente is coming / like if
there were payne or impostumacyon / and if the payne or impostumacyon be great /
that take away or it be boude with the lunge band that there to belongs. And if
it were well bound after his belonging / and there com an impostumacyo or an
unreasonable payne / there with is the surgean compelled ye mebre to open and to
vnbynde / and to amend the accydent / and to help the nature. And that membre
shall bestyll vnboundetyll ye time the accydent and payne be take away Therefore
must ye take away the payne (as (...) saith) with the saluyng of warm oil of
roses. Or (as Guido saith) with wolle depte in oil of roses / venegre / and
laid there over. And if there com scabs or itchynge / than lose ye byndynge /
and make ye bone moist with warm water wherein is sod a little salt that
membre there with embroced and drop with the water from above on the membre Or
salve the membre with un guentum album / or populeum as is before saith. When
all the accydentes is taken away tha turn again to the byndyng of the
membre. If there be a wound where in be small pieces of bones they must be take
out / and heal the woude as I have said in the chaptre of broken bones. And
after goo to the helynge as is before said. As the matter comes out / make an
hole in the band / where through the wound may be cleansed.

Of the brekyng of the nose, Ca, lx,
MAnytymes is the bone of ye nose broke / sometime beten flat / to which
brekynge as thereto betimes is take heed it may behol pen at his first proporcyo
but as it not be done betimes / it will be so every more styll. There fore it is
needful for the wound of ye nose shortly to be taken heed to / and to be set
in his stead. Therefore right it anon / for if it become harde / that doth the
pacyent great payne as it shall beryghted again. And ye must right the nose
after this manner.

Take your fore finger of your lift hand or your little finger and put it in
his nose / and with your right hand threst up ye fracture / and lift up with
your forefynger the nose and set the bone in again in his right place / when ye
have made it even / ye shall make a wtyeke of wax and meddle therein a little
powder of mastick / and dragos blode made in small powder / and this wyeke must
be made like a candle and put it in ye nose. Wylhelm^ placentin^ makes an
harde wyeke or tent of tow depte in oil ofroses / cast thereon this powder
made thus.

A Powder.
Take Bolus armenus. ii. ounces. Myrtil lorum. iiii. ounces. Dragons blood /
Dragantum / Gommy arabici / of each half an ounce. and take clowtes and
plumacioles depte in whyt of eggs / the powder strawed thereupon / and lay it
properly after ye form of ye nose / as I have learned you in the chaptre of
the wound in the face. I^ ye cannot put the finger in ye nose / then make a
tent of wood covered with old lynns clothe depte in oil of roses and put it
in to the nose / and therewith threst upward in to ye nose / and with your
other hand threst downward unto ye time ye bone be brought in to his right
place again / than dress it with the white of an egg / and with that powder
as is before said / and about ye place stryke that defensyffe of bolo armeno
and oil of coses / and a little vynagre mydled with ye say of uyghtshawd or of
solatru in latyne. and do this every day. And when ye shall dress this nose /
first let him blood on the hand / or with boxces on the shoulder or with
ga^ssynge / and with drawght going / with supposytoria or clysters / and yt
shall lighten the pacyent sore. And as you dress him the second time renew
ye tent with oil of roses and with the aforesaid powder / And upon the nose
lay the foresaid powder of dragantu mydled with the white of an egg and dress
the nose therwyth at the. iii. or. iiii. day. And if the fracture or brekynge
of ye nose is sore wooded / sow the skin together as I have said in the
chaptre of the wound of the nose. And lay the powder upon ye wound / and heal
it as in the chaptre a foresaid. dress the woude every day twyse / and rule
him with meet and drink / pryncypally he shall drink reed wine mydled with
water.

Of the brekynge fracture of the brayn pan I have said in the chatre of the
wounds in the heed.

Of the brekynge of the Jawbone tethes. Ca, lxi,
AS the chekebone is broken / ye shall take your finger of ye lift hand and
set it under ye mowthe of the pacyent / set ye cheke bone even right to gyder
with your right hand you shall know when they stand even / that is as the syke
tethes stand even like ye other hole tethes. Then take a sylke thread. v. or.
vi. dobble well waxed / or take a copper wire yt has ^en ^eneled in the fire
/ and or it be cold through braid the tethes together in like wise as the
picture shows.



And after that take powder as hereafter follows meddled with ye white of an
egg / and stryke it upon a clothe like a plaster bind it as is aforesaid in
the chaptre of ye wound in the chekebone. Or lay plu^oles with dowble fold
lynnen clothe / and thervpo lay sklentes made of ledder. Than shall you bind
it with one band / be^nynge behind the neck and coming on ye cheke / and
again under the eeres behind ye heed / and so bind it about the foreheed and
if it be needful wind it often about in the same manner till ye band be made
fast And the powder is made thus.

A Powder.
Take Mumie / Masticke / Boli armeni / Dragantum / Gomi arabici / of each a
^ce. and made of these a powder / and ^ly let them blood / or bore them
garssy^ between his shoulders. And hold the rule of his drawght going with
supposytorye every day / stryke about the fracture every day the defensyuum,
and his mete shall be bear breed / or wortes / or thyn pap / till he be
strong / shall drink barley water / and after that reed wine. And ye time of
helynge is. xx. days (as Auicenna / and Albucasys saith) If there be any woude
to be sowed / and the teeth to be set together ye must do in all manner as I have
said in the chaptre of the wound of the cheke, and the band so bound that
doth no harm to the teeth. And he must every day take (...) to the wound.
And every third day (...) must take heed to the tethes / to ye band.

Of the brekyng of the neck and back bone. Ca. lxij.
PAulus (...) Haly ^bas saith / In the spondyles or back bone commeth^
fracture or brekynge / but of strong strokes are fore bruised: that is deedly /
therefore (...) following after ye evil tokenyng and accydent and hurtynge of
nucha or mary of ye backebone yt comes from ye brain down (...) through the
backebone / for the brain may not suffer. Therefore saith Paulus Haly abbas
Albucasys / what accydente or payne comes to nucha and to the synewes / that
brengeth paralisis of the hands as it is in the vppermoost part of ye
spodyles. But if the payne be in the nether spondyles so comes the paralisys
in ye foot (as Albucasys saith) As ye se the pacyente may not g^ to the
drawght nor pysse as he would / it is deedly (as Albuca. saith) therefore ye
shall not take that in cure. If there be no such accydente than take it in cure
take away the impostumacyon and payne. Ye shall salve the hole back without the
fracture. And ye shall let them blood shortly on the hand ne'er the thombe /
afterward set with your hand the bones and knots of the backebone as well as
ye can / and on the frature lay this plaster following.

A Plaster.
Take Cyser meet / or Beenemeele / or mylstoffe meele. xij. ounces. Mastyck /
Dragatum / Gomi arabici / of each. ii. ouces. Mumie / Boly armeni / of each an
ounce. putt them to gyder and make it like a plaster / after that salve the
fracture round about with defensyuu without vynegre / dress him every third
day. And the pacyent shall lye on his one side / or on his belly / rule him
going to the draught. If there be a wound wide with with a great fracture it
is deedly nevertheless s^we it. And if there be any bones de{per}ted / de{per}te
them hole. And lay on the seem this powder following.

Of the brekyng of the forked bone / and shoulder. Ca. lxiij.
THe fracture or brekynge of ye forked bone is sometime iwarde and sometime
outward sometime even / nevertheless it is broken / The fracture that stands
inward and even / it is easy to be dressed downward / as ye one bone goes
inward / and the other outward / that is harde to set in again. And is there
(...) no ^wed inward so that you lift ye (...) up on hight / and search (...)
one bone upon the / so make them (...) / th^ (...) you dress him with this
following.

A plaster.
Take the white of eggs (...) meal / barley meal / bolus (...) (...) in that
powder / and mydle them together / like plaster / and lay it there under in a
sylte / and ye shalt kept it like as there to belongs / or with plumacioles
depte in ye white of eggs / and as he is well bound and bestowed / so shall ye
make him an harde coshyn or (...) (...) of clowtes / and bind him under the
arm as high as it may be / and hang the arm in a towel on his neck. And
let ye byndyng lyetyl ye. iij. or v. day / tha to ye. viij. day v. or. vi.
weke lunge / tha dress him every day / at ye last lay thereupon an (...). If
the fracture be threst in / than it is needful that your servant hold up ye

in his stead with your hand after that bind him as. I have ^ryde / or with
plumacioles of tow or clowte depte in the white of anegge strawed thereupon
this powder following.

A Powder.
Take Boliarmeni. ii. ouces. Mumie. Masticke. Oragantum. Gumi arabici. of each
an ounce. than take the clothe depte in the white of an egg straweth with the
powder aforesaid. Than (...) a leather in form of the bone / and bind the
done to gyder with the for said dept clothe / or plumacyoles / leather / and
powder / and let the byndynge lye on. iii. days. Than let him blood on ye
hand / and rule him in his going to the stole. and stryke about the woude
that defensiuu as is aforesaid. He shall drink barley water / and ete such me

that you may l^ke to the wound at every day whyt out hurtynge of the bone
that is set in again / (...) fere of departing out again. And lay (...) the
wound the fore said powder. And the bones that thus is set again / must every
iij. day be dressed ones / and the woude every days. and afterward lay in the
wound rose honey with this fore named powder to ^se the wound / and as it is

Of the brekyng of the shoulder. Ca. lxiiij.
IF the shoulder be broken ye shall set your seruaunt to hold the pacyent /
tha shall you with your one hand take the fracture / with the other hand
hold the shoulder / bone / and draw ye bones to gyder that they may come even
/ and lay upon the fracture the plaster the which I have learned you before.
And about the place lay the defensiuu / over the plaster of. iiij. fold lynnen
clothe / lay over that a little fine tow and than splentes made of leather of
willow wood in the gretnes after the shoulder bone / and over the splentes tow
dept / and bind them well / and ordre them in going to the drawght / dress
them at every. iij. days ones / as ye bones be well fastens salve them with
dyalthea / or with a falue that I shall hereafter write in the chaptre of the
brekynge of the rybbes. And ye time of fastenynge of that shoulder bone is. xx.
days (as Albucasis saith)

Of the brekyng of the bone above the elbow. Ca. lxv.
THe hygheste pipe of the arm is called Adiutoriu / it is sometime broke
ouertwhart / sometime a length / and (...) me nyghe by the joint / and that is
evil to heal. Therefore I will give you the learning and manner how ye shall
every fracture and brekynge handell and help. The first ye shall have. ij.
servants. ye one shall hold the pacyent above the arm next the shoulder.
and the other by the harde and on the elbow / and bid him draw it out by
little and little / and hold the patient so fast that he styre not his arms.
After that take with both your hands ye upper most pipe nyghe by the elbow
an (...) it softly on all sides till that ye here the bone craks. and that ye
se the howynge of the arm even. And when ye know the fracture / first ye
shall take the powder in the. (...)* chaptre. yt is made of walstone / wall^ /
or ambra in latin* c and the white of eggs / bades / splentes / pypes / nedles
/ oil of roses / and all that is needful. And when you have all your ger ready
/ and if the upper part of the arm be broken / set him in a chair. And if it
he in the leg / lay ye pacyent on a plain table / and one of your seruautes
to hold him over his belly / ye other servant to hold by the shoulder / and
the third to hold by the arm under ye elbow and bid him hold fast till ye
command him to pull. Then take that powder aforesaid in the. lix. chaptre, so
much till ye have enough / and mydle it with white of eggs and do thereto alume
as great as a wallnotte / and styre it well to gyder like pap Then take. ji.
fold of lynnen clothe and let it be so broad that it may come above under ye
fracture a quarter broad that is together half a yard / and after that the
pacyet be great or little / and that same cloth shall be a yard lunge in ye
manner as I have written of the brodnes. The clothe must be well stricken on the
one side with the salve / and laid on a bank. And ye must have a roll bound
of. ii. fadume lunge / a finger broad / and that must be rolled up / be stryke
a yard lunge with the forenamed things / lay it by the other salved band. And
after that ye shall take good splentes thynne as I have before write they must
be boude with small cords above / in the midst / also benethe / and as ye will
lace a dowbled of some mannys / so shall ye lace the ^len^es that the cords
may come without on the splentes / and let the splentes lye also next the
cloth / ye shall have also. iij. strong pypes of goose legs / or of elder
pypes / and ^pype boude with a strong small corde an^ stycke goth troughe the
pypes / and as all this is ready / than command ye other servant that holds
the arm by the elbow or leg hand or foot / that he properly styfly ^l /
and in the pulling set the bone even again and upon the other / and take heed
that ye knee / or elbow / hade / or foot stand up right / and you with your
flat hade over the fracture stryke so that ye about nor under feel none uneven
place / then shall ye loke if ye arm or leg be a straw breed longer then the
hole arm or leg is / if not it is right / I have scene a good master yt /
bound a pacyent thinking that ye broken leg was longer than the hole leg
/ he bound him so / when he had laid him in his bed the leg was weary short
/ then he asked me how that might be / I said / you have not laid ye pacyet
even hye enough with his hyppes which hath dysceyued you / therefore take he de
when ye bind them lay them lunge on the board and stretch them out / and when
he is so laid / then shall you se if the shynnes be crooked or not / and when you
have all things well marked / and all your ger is ready by you / so bydyoure
servants that they at all times hold fast / beware of shaking as it is
possible / then after that do about the bone the strykynge cloth / and lay it
even without wrymplyng after that take the roll band / and the last the small
cords with the pypes / as soon as that is done / than turn ye vppermoost
pipe and threst that stycke thorough / then turn the other pipe / after ye
third pipe ye shall know that the myddell pipe over ye fracture must
stronglyste be turned / for to^ ye ye vtermoost pipe harde / and the
myddelmoost not harde for so should ye blood run under the byndynge and make
the soon ^an impostumacyo swellynge / therefore ye myddelmoost pipe shall first
be bound. Will ye know if it be right bound about the fracture or not /
ask the pacyent if he have any payne in the bone or styckynge in the fracture
/ If he say than that he hath none / thinks he should thereon well go / and
that ye^ the broken leg longer then the hole leg / that is a sure token
that the byndynge is very good / and if ye shynne of ye leg be crooked like
abowe and even when ye have stricken over with your hand and so fullfyll the
crokednes with the pluma cyoles or with a fylte that ye splentes may lye even
on / and ye arms or legs shall (...) a (...) pipe so as I have learned in the
(...) chapytre / and take heed that the arm (...) that he may not loke in his
hand / ye leg that he may se the innerparte of the (...)* Take heed therefore
in the byndynge / for I have scene thereof much harm But the old masters as
(...) (...) (...) francus saith. If any arm be broken that shall ye know
thus. Lay your one hand on the fracture your other hand under ye fracture /
your seruaunt shall hold the pacyent by the arm and by the elbow / tha shall
ye the arm properly meue as I have said before. And than yt may know why there
it be broken or not / and if it be broken lay thereon shortly this plaster
following.

A plaster.
Take Mylstuffe meele / or Cycer meele / or Been meele or Barley meele. xij.
diuices. Masticis / Draganti Go^ arabici / of each. i^. ounc. (...) / (...) of
each one ounce. i^ is ^dled together with the white (...) / another of made a
plaster / stryke it upon a lynnen clothe a^ have learned before and that number
shall be stretched bound with splentes / with cords / with pypes in all manner
as I have showed you. (...) take heed that ye bind not the membre to fast for
thereof comes great harm / and the membre lost. And with out taking good heed
the pacyent is like to lose his ly^. Also it is good to stryke the defensiuum
to defend the membre from all ill accydent that thereto might come.

A def^nsiuum
This defensiuum shall be made of Oil of roses / Boloarme no / Uynegre /
nightshed sap or liquor solatri in latin / or sap of hou^eke / And let the
pacyeent s^tely on the vain blood, and that he hold his go^ynge to the
drawght. and he must also been his arm in a towel about his neck. and he
may be healed in. xiiij. days. And if there be any broken bone in the wounds ye
must take heed thereto. Or if there be ^bones departed into that shall you so one
take out as I have learned you in the chaptre of ye wound in the arms. And
some Surgean weans that the pacyent should dye when ye mary comethout of the
bone / that is not so A good cause why / for as ye flesh grows so grows
the mary. And after that ye sow the wound / and (...) thereto every day as In
the. xiiij. chaptre have said. And you shall or deyne them it that ye splentes
couere not the wound / and upon this wound ye shall straw every day this
powder.

A Powder.
Take Mastyke / (...) ye of araby of each. ij. ounces / Mumie / dragons blood

pipe (As auicenna saith / and Alb^ also) if they be both broke it is ye worse
yt which ye may know by the feeling. if ye bones be broken then it cracked /
is it only bowed then it cracked not. And if both ye pypes be broken / so
must you have; ij. serpents yt one shall hold the pacyet by ye elbow and the
other by the hand and let the forehande strange downward to the groude / and
as it shall be drestyd it shall not living town. but do as I have showed before.
Or ye begin ye must have all your ger ready that is needful as I have
aforesaid. And as all is ready / take the pacyent before you / and command
your (...) to (...) him as is aforesaid / and set the bone with your hand
softly together in ye best manner that ye can / and do not the patient to much
payne in the setting in of the bones / because ye through such payne al the
moystnes dy^edeth in to the arm / and so might thereof come much harm /
whereby he should be in peril of death And when ye have set the arm together
after your best manner / take a loge broad bade depte in oil of roses and
threst out again and bind ye arm therewith / and defend ye arm from
moystnes and impostumacyon / and take away the great payne. and after yt dress
him as I have aforesaid. The yonge parsone that can not take heed to him self
dress him with that powder and the whyt of eggs as I have aforesaid If the
one pipe is hole and the other is broke / work therein as they were both broke
so as I have aforesaid / then alone ye need not to have so many splentes. And
when ye have them well dressed let them take heed of blood lettynge / and to the
draught going. And after yt the arm shall be salved with the defenssuu that
ye be sure of the sw^rynge and of ye impostumacyon / and bring the arm in a
towel about his neck and make a board lay thereon a co^yn taht the arm may
thee on rest. If there be a wound with ye fracture ^ake heed that ye bone fit
again And if there be any bones departed take it soon out / and then (...)
your spletes thereafter / and bind it well / so that ye may se ye woude / and if
it be need sow ye wound / and let the one end be open wherthrough it may be
cleansed. And lay on the seem ye foresaid powder / and the foresaid
mundificatiuum plaster that I in the chaptre before have learned / and do
therabout the defensiuu / and heal it as you heal another wound / as I have
learned in the next chaptre. And so let rule them of mete and drink / going
to the draught / as is aforesaid.

Of the brekyng of the fyngers / or Joyntes. Ca. lxvij.
IN the hand there is. iiij. bones. In every finger iij. bones. for their
final nes and strength they a seldom broken. And if it happen yt they break /
take heed that ye set them together after the best manner yt you can. Albucasis
saith that ye shall stretch the heed upon the table / and threst it in again /
and ye shall lay thereupon the plaster aforesaid in ye. lxv. chaptre. and in
this brekinge is no need to lay thereon clothes with oil of roses / but lonely
the plasters or the powder of walstone / as I have said in the. lix. chapytre
mydled with the white of an egg / lay the plaster on both sides of ye hand /
and thervpo lay splentes and tow after the length and breed of the hand /
afterward bind ye hade well after ye best manner / on ye hade tow / or an eve
board yt the. iiij syngers be together / and ye palm of the hand / and the
fyngers shall be filled with tow or with some other thing / bind ye hand so
(...) splentes may come to the half arm without and within / and when that is
done salve ye arm about with ye elbow with the defenciuum as is aforesaid /
then hang the arm in a towel or a cloth about his neck / if the fyngers be
broken / make ye splentes so lunge as the fyngers and more yt it may come in ye
midst of the hand / and bind with ye plaster as I have learned you in the
chapytre of the vppermoost pipe of ye arm / these bones shall be dressed every.
iiij. day ones / and at every time shall y^ salut it with desenciuum / and let
him hold the rule of going to the draught / And if ye fracture be with a
wound / then dress the wound every day / lay there upon a cloth depte in
oil of roses and lay therein ye powder of mumie / dragos blod like as I have
learned in ye. lxv. chapytre / and lay therouer the same plaster in the chapytre
aforesaid / and I was wont to take elder pypes / and lay the finger therein /
and it is very good yt ye bind the hole finger with ye woude fyngers / and so
gets the wounded fyngers quyckenes with the hole finger.

Of the broke bones in the breast. Ca. lxviij
THe breast is set together of. vij. bones and they be fastened with vij. rybbes /
therefore take heed in what place the bone is broken / lay your hand thereon feel
if it be broken / if it crake it is broke / and if not be broke but so (...)
bowed in / the^ take heed if he perbrake blood / for and if he perbrake blood /
it (...) evil token that there is some veins broken And if not but is otherwise
broken / th^ take your hand and threst upon the (...) place that the bone come
in again. Or (...) upon the fracture a great (...) or bore^ out pryckyng (...)
pulls out the bone again. And that so done sayther^ this plaster / which
has the strength to ca^ wed bones to come out again.

A Plaster.
Take Cy^ meal / or been meel. xij. ounces Draganti / (...) arabici / of (...)
ounces. Bolo arm^. iiij. ouces. make these together in (...) powder mydled with
the white of eggs / and thereof make a plaster and laid thereon / and dress
them it every iij. days ones. And as ye have boude them first let them be let
blood out of the (...) of the liver on the hand between the small finger and
the golden finger, and salve th^ place with defensiuu therein is no vynegre /
for the vynegre is cold / and the bones therein is subtle / and let the vynegre
(...) and hold the pacyent going to the drawghte, and make the place strong
in this salve.

A Salve.
Take Masticke / ^ankensence / of each (...) ounce / (...) BOlus (...) / of
each. (...) ounces. (...). (...) ounces / wa^e ij. ounces. (...) iiij. ounces.
Oil of olyue. xij. ouces, (...) the ware and roiyll with the oil by the fire /
and than strain it and ye other substance made in powder (...) therein / and
meddle them well together / and salve the place every day (...). And rule him with
mete and drink / as I have learned before.

Of the brekyng of the rybbes. Ca. lxix.
E shall know that there is xij. rybbes. vij. lunge. v. short / and the short
rybbes break not nyghe by the back / ye other. vij. rybbes break in many
places / and they be sotime crooked bowed inward and is not broke / sometime
outward also / and sometime ye fracture is deedly by loge endurynge of payne /
and sotyme it is not deedly and shortly healed / this ye may know hereafter
written / the first ye must with your hade feel the broke place / and if there
be any crackynge then is it broke / if there benone evil accidence to se it is
good to help / and as they bow inward so be they evil to help / And if the
rybbes be far sonken in / that the mebres be sore wounded inward it is
deedly / or el les lunge sykenes / and that may be know by the short brethe /
and by blood spyttynge coghynge with the stytche and payne in the side / thereof
often comes great payne to the rybbes / and to help the foresaid rybbes is
evil to do bring to pass / comely as they break the will depart or be
bowynge the one part inward / and the other outward / that inward is evil to
bring again to his place / and some parsones saith yt the pacyent should ete
such meets which should cause him to swell to fill him full of wind by yt
which ye rybbe should be drive again in to his right place / some saith to set
on them ventoses or boxes whereby ye rybbe should come outward / but it is to
doubt yt by that workynge of the bentoses or bores should come more harm.
Therefore dy^ death the old doctors in this cure. And ^ly abbas / Albuca.
Auicena / and (...) other have given many a cure to thyse. Auice. Albucasys /
they take thereto only / wol^ / oil powder / and bands. Rogerius brengeth it
in again to his place with cleuynge plasters cha^ed against the fire / or in
bathes and after that he makes ye rybbe fast. And Brunus makes that it comes
outward eve / and he lays thereon a plaster with splentes as thereto belongs /
and that part that is bowed inward he makes moist. Auice. occupied woll / oil
/ to a small inbowyng but and if it be great he pulls it outward Milhelmus de
Salice to makes eve with his hands / and with the white of an egg and meele
/ and with things laid thereon plaster wise. Lancfrancus did as Roger but he
commanded that the pacyent shall be helped with koughynge and nesynge to threft
the rybbe out. Guydo doth as Brunus / as the fracture comes outward / and
after yt he lays a plaster thereupon with the whyt of an egg with meele and
other conglutinatiuum / with flocks / or with tow / and splent^ it with a
piece of harde leather / binds the place ^ast with a lunge band / and at ye
last he softens the fracture with ^yalthea / or with oxicrato. But if the
fracture gothe inward / do as Rogerius and Lafranc{is} did. and if it be
needful tha he opens the fracture / or set thereupon a ventose or a box.
Thereafter he laid upon yt side on the fourth or fyfte day the white of an
egg / and oil of roses with tow for to drive away the payne and ipostumacyon
/ tha he boude it with a light byndynge / but reasonably to hold the medicine.
Then may ye rule the fracture with a plaster of been meel and honey / and the
raster soft it with Dyalthea / or with Occ^rato. Or lay thereupon this plaster
when ye have made it again even.

A Plaster.
Take Cycer meele / or Mylstoffe meele / or Been meele. xii. ounces. Masticke
/ Dragantum / Gummi arabici / Mumie / Boli armeni / of each anouce. powdered and
mydled with the white of eggs / and so lay it thereon / and salve it
roundaboute with the desensinu / then bind it and let it lye so. iii. days.
and let him blood on the hand / and rule him in going to the draught. and
cause him to lye hye / or upon his belly. And when ye have fastens all the
rybbes / salve them with this salve in the stead of Dyalthea and occicrato.

A Salve.
Take Rosell. vi. ounces. Uaxe. ij. ouces. Bdellii / Apoponati / of each an
ounce. Mastick / Frankincense / of each. ii. ouces. Dragons blood. Mumie of
each an ouce. Oil olyue. xvi. ounces. weke the Bdellium and thereafter in the
oil also / and do therein the other things made in powder / and mydle it so
together / and therewith salve every day the place of the fracture. for this
salve drives away the payne / and takes away all hardness. yt more over in ye
beginning how the ventoses or boringe more draws / the more moystnes sends
the nature thereto.

Therefore ye must regard if the pacyent be full of flesh moystnes so let him
blood on the other side against the fracture on the vain Basilica. and
thereafter on the same side of the fracture. But if ye pacyet be len work
after the learning of Rogerius / Jamericus / and Lafranc{is} / and anoynte your
hand with Turpetyn / or with melted pytche or with other clyuynge things / and
it shall be done in a bath / or by a fire / and lay it on the part yt is bowed
inward / and ye other hand on the part that stands outward for to threste
it downward / and with pulling of the adiutorium or arm pipe of ye body /
with koughynge / or holding in the wind. and quickly pull your hand upward
as often as the koughe / and holding of wind comes / for it pulls out ye
rybbes. But if it may not be so / and that ye pacyent be leave / or yt ye be in
fere / than ye shall follow the workynge of Auicenna. with setting the
ventoses or boxes. and as the rybbes be brought again in to their right places
/ so shall you bind it with tow depte with ye white of an egg meddled with meele /
or with the plaster of Mumie as I have learned. And when ye have thus wrought ye
payne swag not away nor ye rybbe will not come out again / and ye cough and
payne / and the stytche increases / the blood lettynge is done / and the
accedece comes thereto / so must ye cut on the rybbe / and vncouere the flesh
fro ye rybbe / take it away with your instrument / and ye shall lift upward the
rybbe again / for to compelle the coming of the accidence / afterward ye
shall heal it like another wound / to hold the rule of one pleutericus till
the axes and evil accidence be done.

Of the brekyng of the hyppes. Ca. lxx.
THis bone is broken sometime by strokes / sometime by falling / and sometime
cloven / and sometime bowed inward This fracture is known by feeling with your
hand in the strykynge over / if ye find any vneue. If the bone cleue / lay
thervpo this plaster. Been meal dragantum / mastycke. c. as I have before said
/ lay thereon plumacioles of tow or of lynen cloth and with spletes / and bind
it with a band about the body / and than so we it as often as it goth about /
at every sowynge set on a splente / and so let it lye. v. days / but not so
lunge if it happen that the pacyent be come syke or any evil accidence come to
him / Je shall let him blood between the little synger the gold finger / and
hold the rule of going to the draught so yt he abide thyn in his belly / and
if ye know by the foresaid token that the bone is broke it is need that ye
bone be threst downward and set again upright with ye help of your seruautes /
and that so done / lay thereupon the foresaid plaster and plumacyoles / and the
splentes shall be so great yt the bone may be touered withal / Over the
splentes lay other splentes / and depte tow threst out again / and the lay
over yt your byndynge with your best manner / and salve with that defesiuum /
and let the byndynge lye till ye iii. or. iiii. day be past. Je shall let him
blood prycke on his back / rule him with mete drink as I have often said to you
before.

Of the brekyng of pypes about the kne. Ca. lxxj.
AS ye know by the feeling of ye bone whether it be broken with a woude / or
without a wound If it be broken without a wound / so is it needful to make
all your ger ready yt thereto belongs / as I have learned you in the. lix.
chapytre / then shall ye set the bone together again / as I have learned you in
ye. lxv. chapytre / in the brekynge of the arms and of ye legs / and as the
bone is well set together / then shall you deep ye clothe in oil of roses / and
wind it well about the leg or take the powder of walstone so as I have
learned so shull you take the oil the plaster made of been meal / as I have
often learned you / with the white of an egg stryke on a cloth and lay over ye
bades splentes small cords pypes / as I have plainly learned you in ye lxv.
chapytre of the brekynge of the arms about the elbow / your bands and
spletes shall be so ordained and to close the bone / hole it to gyder / and
take heed yt ye the bone bind not to styffe / whereby thereto may come no
swelling nor other harm for that is to be feared / for they be daedly tokens /
now as all things is well done / so shall ye ye pacyent command to lye down
/ and he shall not meue. Also ye old masters dyscordeth howe the pacyent
shall lye / Rogerius / Al bucasys / and wylhelmus / lay them in an eve place or
bed / wyndeth his leg softly with clothes and tow^ / and some other masters /
as master Peter / he hath. ii. lunge splentes to the end of ye foot that is
woude with lynne clothe and binds thervpo. iii. or. iiii. bands / Auicenna /
Brunus / and Rogerius / splenteth with. ii. lunge spletes bound to the foot /
But Lancfrancus and the yonge masters lay the leg along / all the masters
menynge is that the broke leg shall be laid eve to rest without ouy hurtynge
that it shall not be moved / and the pacyent shall not move on no side / and
also thereof spreketh Rogerius to ye work master that he shall keep straight
the membre and save his health / and also of a more surety Romanus lays ye
pacyent on a small bed / under the which bed is an hole thrugh the which he
may do his water / and easement without lyftynge of him self / and he must be
bound to. iii. or. iiii. places of ye bedstede and ye hole foot must be
bound to the stock that ye pacyent may not draw it up to him and Guy do
binds him with lunge splentes / and lays on him awayght binds to his
foot a plomet of lead / and as al this is ordained and done / so shall he
hold and rule as I have said in ye. lix. chapytre with blod lettynge / draught
going / and with eating and drinking / ye shall dress him diligently. iiii.
v. or. vi. days together / with out he be very syke / and at every dressynge / ye
shall loke well on the leg how it is dys^osed / and if it be not set upright
/ take head give him his right form / therefore take ye heed in ye first
begynynge / for if it should stoned lunge / it ware harde to make it up right /
is there one wound great / then se if there be any bone de{per}ted that take
away / and sow the wound / and on ye seem straw that powder that belonght
thereto / as in the xiii chaptre is said / and as ye the membre has set up
right well together / than take wode splentes after the degre of the woude that
the splentes towche not the woude / when ye bind the leg / and also that ye
may every day se to the wound / and on the woude lay the aforsayd powder yt be
laid upon the seem and upon that powder lay ye mundificatiuum plaster.

A Plaster.
Take rose honey streynyd. xii. ouces. Barley meele / Mylstuf meele / or other
like. xii. ounces / of this powder that lies on the some. take. ii. ounces.
and meddle this together and as the wound with this plaster is cleansed / than
heal it with the grene woundyd plaster / and with powder of Cypressenottes /
Mumie / Frankesence / Gall apple / of each ii. ounces. and on the seem lay the
powder of Dragons blood / Dragatum / Gomy of Arabice / of each like much / and
all this mydle together.

Of the brekyng of the knee shyue or whirl bone. Ca. lxxij.
When the knee shyue is broken / then set it again ^p right with your hand in
the best manner as it can be than lay thervp ye plaster made of Barley meele / or
Been meele / and Dragons blood c. (...) ye shall not lay there on the clothe
dept in rose oil / and as the plaster is laid thereon / than stryke there about
the Defensiuu / and thereafter lay upon it Plumacioles of tow / and thereafter
splentes / and the rover bind it well with ye band and sow the band with whyt
thread / and let him blood on ye hand / between the little finger and the
gold finger / rule him in going to draught / and with meet and drink / as is
a foresaid.

An instrument to make a crooked knee right.



Of the brekyng of the shynne. Ca. lxxiij.
IN the shynne be. ii. bones sometime they be broke both / sometime brekyth the
great pipe / sometime the little pipe. As the great pipe is broken / then is
ye fracture behind. If the small pipe is broken / tha the fracture is before
on the shynne / but the great is more peryllous tha the small. And as they
both be broken that is most peryl Then it is needly to have al your ger ready
by you that thereto belongs or serves.

Than must ye have. ii. servants / the one to hold the knee / and the other
the fete. command to pull in al manner / and to be ready as I have learned you in
the. ixv chaptre. of the brekynge of the arms. feeling with your hand if it
stand upright / and loke if the broken leg is a little longer than the hole
leg. In like wise loke if the hole leg is crooked or not. And bind it than
will, a clothe depte in oil of roses / or with ye powder of waltstone / with
ye baundes and spletes. And the splentes must be longer in the brekynge of the
leg than in the brekynge of the arm. and with the small cords / pypes. Je
shall ask the pacyent as it stands in the same chaptre / yt ye may know if
it be right bound or not. And take he de that ye bind him not to styfe /
whereby the pacyent might come in great harm / payne and fere. And should him
bring in paralisys / and the pacyent might also by the harde byndyng lyse that
membre. And defend the place with the defensyuum. and beware you of the harde
byndynge. And let him blood on the hand / and hold him in ye rule in his
drawght going. And ye shall dress him in. iij. or. iiii. days onys. If that
leg be broken with a wound / than loke if there any bones be beparted / they
shall be taken out. And fere you not if ye mary goth therout. Sow the wound /
than make vpryggt the bone again / set it to gyder and make splentes / but
do so that ye may se to the woude at every day. To these brekynge of the
leg be sondry manners of spletes. Je shall make a hole form after ye gretenes
and length of the leg / there as the iegge shall be laid in with ye byndynge
This woude is sore deedly / but fere not so much the fracture as the wound.
It is needful to defend the wound from the impostumcyo with the defensyuum /
and mundificatiuu / that no great moystnes nor swerynge come thereto / for the
pacyent might thereof dye.

Therefore it is nedely to loke thereto at every day onys / and tha if irnedyth
the bone shall be ryghtyd without payne. And upon the seem straw the powder of
the sowynge Than heal the wound / like the woude with the brekynge of the arm /
or in the shoulder rule the pacyent in etynge and drinking as I have often
aforesaid.

Of the bone brekynge in the calfe of the leg. Ca. lxxiiij
SEldom is broken the bone of the calfe / for it is an harde bone / and is
defendyd with the strings synewes (as Guy do saith) but Wylhelm{is} said If it
happens that the bone of the calfe be broken / that shall be kowen with
feeling. And that bone breketh sometime with strokes / sometime with falling /
than help him thus.

A Plaster.
Take been meel / or Cycermeel / or mylstuf meel. xii. ounces. mastick /
Dragantu / Gomi arabici / of each. ij. ounces. Bolus arm nus. i. ounce. all
this made in small powder than mydle it with the whyt of eggs / and lay it on
the fracture / and therouer the spletes with tow. and therouer the band / and
sow it with a thread at each wyndynge of the band. And the band shall go roude
about the hole foot / round about the half leg and salve the foot with the
defensiuum / and rule him as is aforesaid.

Of the brekyng of the bone abowe upon the foot. Ca. lxxv.
AS raseta that is the bone of ye foot is broke it is harde to heal like
Auicena wrythet / and thereto comet oftetymes i'll accedes. ye breking (as
albucasis said) shall be helped thus / set the foot of the pacyent on the
groude / and lay ye bone right as it best may be done / tha splente him with a
broad splent after ye sole of the foot / and lay on the fracture the foresaid
plaster made of that powder meddled with the white of an egg / over the plaster
lay splentes with tow / dept in the white of an egg / than shall ye set the
foot on a soole of wood / and about the foot stryke that defesiuum / than
bind the foot pull therouer a sho of fy^t / let him blood / Is the woude with
a fracture tha bind him every day onys or dress him / and lay on the wound
this plaster.

A plaster.
Take Mastyck / Dragantum / Gommy of Arabyci of each. ii. ounces / Mumye /
Bolus Armenus / of each one ouce / This powder meddled with rose honey / make
thereof a plaster / there with the wound shall be cleansed / there after heal the
woude with a grene wooded plaster / and over the plaster lay a clothe dept in
warm rose oil / or in warm wine / for the warm wine doth strong / the
flesh growing as over the powder be laid the plaster / his meet and drink
shall be as is a foresaid / ye joints of ye toes shall be ryghted again like as
the Joyntes of the fyngers. As Haly wrythed.

Of the bowing of the bonys without brekynge. Ca. lxxvi.
THe bowynge of ye bonys happens sometime with falling sometime with strokes.
or with cuttynge without brekynge as the bowynge on the cheke than cirest it
outward with your hand fyngers / as I have lernyd in the chaptre of the
brekynge of the rybbes. in ye. lxix. chap. and the other hand shall be salved
with turpentyn / or pytche / and lay it without on ye cheke bone. and with the
other hand^ ^rest it softly from within outward / and take away with hast
your salved hand fro his cheke. In like wise do in the bowynge of ye rybbes.
but in the bones of the shyne or arm must ye have a good byndynge / strong
splentes / that with the thressyng of the byndyng may be ryghteth the bone again.
and the bone in the arm or leg shall be stretchyth out by little and little.
but that mebre shall first be batheth in water therein is sodden Camomyll /
Pappyll / hye malowe Fenygreke / Lynseed. And than salve it with oil of Lylyes /
or Capons grese / or Duckys grese. And it is often proved / and it helps
much / as upon the bowynge be laid a piece of an Olyphantes teeth / for ye
yuore bone pullyth to him the bowyd bone / and therewith the bone gets his
right form.

Of the dyslocacyon or dysmenbrynge of every joint in general. Ca. lxxvij


AUicenna saith / the dyssocacie or dysmembryng is an outgoyng of ye bone out
his right place there it was set in before. And the setting of the bone is in.
iiij. manners. that also Lanfranc. Wilhelm{is} / and other masters saith. The
one is after the manner of a saw with the tethes set in to gyder and so closing /
as be the. vi. bones of the braynpan. The other. as ye one bone in the other
standed and is there in set / as the tethes in the cheek. The. iij. is one
hanging or lenynge bone on another bone as the. vii. bones of the breast. The.
iiij. manner. the one bone is joined with another / bound to gyder with the
synewes / where through the meuynge of the body comes. This gaderyng of ye
bones is called a joint or mebre. In this last manner is done ye very
dyslocacye / but in the other it is not be done / but there happenyth a
dysmembrynge This dysmebringe is in iiij. manners. forward / behyndeward /
inward / outward Also is some simple / some with a fracture / payne and
impostumacyon / and some with hardness. After this dyuersyte be divers cures. And
the dysmembryng happens sometime without / as with falling / smytyng or with
unreasonable pulling. Some dysmebrynge is inward^ / as the ^ymy humours in the
joint be holden. The token of the dismembrynge of the joints is known by ye
hyghnes / or holnes on the other part. The dysmembrynge with a wound / payne
/ or impostumacyon is heavy and peryllous / so ye mebre bids sometime crooked
without tournynge again in his right form (as Galien{is} wrythet in quarto
Therapentice) The old and harde dismembering is for (...) heavy and shantely to
help / and ye must t^ membre set in again with good manner / (...) with the
lest payne as hastily as it may be done Some dysmembringe is lyghtely to set in
again / as the joint of the hands. Some dysmembrynge is heavy to set in again /
as the elbow / the foot / and the fyngers.

Some is between both / as the shoulder and hyppes. The incomynge of the membre
is known by hearing of the crakynge in ye incomynge of the bones and as ye se
that it is come in his right place in the other bone The come cure of all
dysmembrynge in the joints is in. iiij. manners. beside the lerninge that I
have given you in the chaptre of the come brekynge in the bonys. The first
manner / is the setting in again ye joint. The ^de is fast making of the
membre that there is setin again. The. iii. is defending of the payne and
impostumacyon. The. iiij. is mendynge of the ill accydetes. The first is done
in. iij. manners. The first. that ye have all thing ready by you yt is needful
to you as I have learned you in ye lix. chaptre. of all fractures in the bouys
in come or ye begin ye membre to setin again The other / that ye ye membre not
bathe nor wasshe in warm water (as Auicen. saith) that no impostumacyo come
thereto / nor let tynge to setin the membre again. Lancfracus and Wylhelmus de
saliceto saith / that some the dysmembryng as it is fresshe / than they lay that
membre in warm water a loge time / and than they setin ye mebre again and this
shall ye not do. but is the dysmembrynge some days past / than may ye bathe the
joint in warm water therein is sodden Papple / Camomylle / Hye malowe /
fenygreke / and than shall it be setin again.

The. ii. manner is done in. ii. manners. The first. as the setting in of the
joint is small and light / than is Enough to lay thereon a clothe depte in oil
of roses / and there with salved the joint / and over the clothe tow dept in
white of eggs. than bind it with a band that thereto belongs. The other. is
ye membre great and strong / and the set tynge in is heavy / and ye fere the
going out of the joint again / than ye must you provide better / therefore
anoynte the joint / and lay thereupon this plaster following.

A plaster.
Take Mylstur meell. vi. parts. Dragos blood / Frankesence / Masticke /
Satcocol le / of each one part / all this made in po^d and meddled with the
white of eggs / and stryke it upon a clothe / lay it on ye joint and
plumacioles oft^w or clothes. If it be needful than splente it with leather /
bind it with a band of lynnen clothe after the greatness of the membre / and
bind it stetly that it meile not in no side / that the band hold it fast /
but take heed thereto that ye fast byndynge make not ill accidence. The iii.
manner. is the bloody uyng and laxatyre if it be need / and a good diela in the
beginning to the time till the pain and imposin macyon is driven away / than
shall ye dieta be stronger / as I have aforesay deu^ the lix. chap. and that
thereto come no yl^ accidete / than shall the first byndynge be styll un to the.
x. day. And some other leave it to the v. or. vii. day. and in the end shall
th^ bre be made strong with sedynge or (...) singe of roses / and worwood /
and with a Chyreclothe / or with oxcierato / ye mebre shall be brought again in
his first stregthe and workynge. The. iiij. manner is. as there is evil
accidetes / payne / or i^ol^u macion / that it may be driven away or the
dislocacie be set in again / for much handelynge it is to fere coming thereto
ye cramp or other accydentes / and it shall be done with woll depte in warm water
/ and lynseede oil / than it be brought to his first nature (as Albucasis
saith) Is the dyslocacyon with a wound / than shall ye shortly it set in
again / and cure ye wound / and if it ^e dyth sow the wound / and there
shall be let on the wound a hole open for clensyng out the matter. Is the
dyslocacie with a fracture / than dress first the dyslocacie and tha the
fracture / is it possible. If it be not possible do the contrary. Is the
dismembrynge out / is there hardness / than must ye bathe it as is aforesaid. and
salve it (...) dial thea / and plaster it with dyaquilo magno / kemdewolle
deped in mustilaginibus / yt is the slyme of papple / lynseed / fenigreke /
roots of the papple sodden / and stamped with grese / and as the place is well
wekyd than pull the membre inagayn / and bind it as I have said before.

Of the dyslocacie of the Jawbone. Ca. lxxviij.
OF this dismembryng of the Jawbone is in. ii. manners. The one / as it gothe
forward out of the joint / than bids the mouth open. The other. as it is
behind / than comes the upper most teeth over the undermost / tha ye can not
open the mouth. The tokes of this dislocacie without the common tokens is / that
the tethes come not like on the other. And if it not hastily is setin again /
it will be hard and brengeth axcys / payne / and ill acci^t and doth the
parsone dye within. x. days. (as Auice. and Haly abbas saith) As the
dislocacie happens behyndewarde / tha it shall thus be setin again. The
servant must hold the heed of the patient / than put your thombe in his mouth
well behind / your other fingers under the cheke / and threst (...) your
thombe downward / strongely pulling to you / lift up with your fyngers that
it may come in / thereafter salve it with dyaithea. Is the dislocacie before /
than lays Wylthelm? and Lanfrancus a strong band under the chyne which
may keep ye hole chyne / and a small stycke as deep in his mouth as it may be
done / than they pulls the ends of the band styfly upward / and hold the
knee on the pacyent. And the patient must lye high with the shulders (as
Jameric{is} saith) so shall it be brought in by the grace of god. Than lay
thereon this plaster following.

A Plaster.
Take Brenmeel. xii. ounces. Dragantum Gommi arabici / ^astick / Bolus armen^.
of each ij. ouces. this drive to gyder in powder / and mydle them with the
white of eggs / stryke it on a clothe / lay it the ron. Than wind it about
(...) abande / dress it every two days onys. And it is would to be made fast
in. xiij. days / or there about. Lay the pacyent on a styfe heed pyllow. He
shall ete soppys / pap / yt them need not to chaw If it hath be lunge time
out of the joint / is it become harde / than shall ye bathe it (...) warm
water / and oil / and with other coueniently things / as I have learned before
in ye next chapt. than shall it turn again in his place. Comes thereto any
ill accydent / tha help him as it nedith / against the payne shere of his
here. And salve the heed with warm oil of roses behind the eerys / and
behind in the neck / and under the arm of the patient.

Of the dysmenbrynge of the neck and rygbone. Ca. lxxix.
Sometime is the dysmebrynge of ye rydgbone outward / sometime inward / sometime
beside / and sometime in ye uttermost spodyles of ye rydgbone and it makes
Squinansie / that is with a bult before / sometimes is the dysmebrynge in the
vndermoost part / or spondyles / sometimes in that myddyl / than makes a bult
on ye bake / the token of ye dysmebrynge shall be known by the sight / and by
the feeling It is said that all this dysmebrynge of the spondyles / or backbone
/ is sore peryllous and ill to set in again for the synewes / and the back mary
/ or nucha / and most as the dyslocacie is inward / for it may not be
hadeleth / the dyslocacie of ye vppermoost spodyles that doth harm to
swellowe in the meet drink / the myddellest doth harm to the brethe / the
vndermoost doth harm to the draught going / all times ye dyslocacie is
dredefull in what place she is / the first spodyles of the neck is sore bound
with synewes / on the bones of ye heed / and therefore it is great peryl / and
between the last bone of the neck / yt is the. vii. the. viij. spodyles / it
is the first there the rybbes have his beginning / by twene them it is great
peril for ye meuyng of the neck / and therefore in the same. ii. places of the
spondyles or back bone thercometh sonner ye dyslocacye than in any other / and
his dyslocacye is sore peril. The dyslocacye that is in the vppermoost
spondyles that is cutting of ye neck / that causes ye death hastily of a man
for cause that ye inthrestynge bone stops the wind / and takes away his
life / as this dyslocacye is between ye. vij. and. viij spondyles / than is the
way stops of the meet and drink / and the way of the air is thouched / and
as the dyslocacye is under ye viij. spondyle / than leases the nether most
members his meuynge / for the stoppynge / and hurtynge of the synnewes and
nucha / whereof comes all time the meuynge and feeling / Therefore it is
needful shortly it tobe setin again / and as the bone in ye neck is out of
the joint / than hangs the heed forward / or behyndeward / and the pacyet
cannot speak / and them shall you help thus Je shall have a seruaunt to hold
the pacyet with one hand under the chyne / the other hand on the heed / and
let him hold fast / than set your hand on ye pacyent on his neck and command
the servant that he the heed hold up ward / ye shall with your hand threst
downward unto ye time till ye have set in again the bones of the pacyent / is
ye first spodyle out the joint / is it not shortly set in again tha shall he
dye / And in this manner following shall it be set in again (as Albuca. Haly abbas
/ Auicenna / Lancfrankcus saith) that heed shall wise pulls with ye hands /
and with one ^ bind / lay him a small styke in the mouth and threst him upward
by the chyne / or with the here / up by the eerys / the shoulder shall be threst
downward with the feet / and he shall be pulls in both places with good
provision / with cords or other instrumetes when the. vii. back bone or
spendyle is out ye joint of ye. viij. spodile tha tarry not long of ye
insettynge / and gothe ye dyslocacye inward / than kills the parsone shortly
/ he is seldom helped / nevertheless begyne the cure / and threst him the
shoulder down. ward / and pull the neck as is a fore said / Is ye dyslocacie
outward / that seldom happeth / that may be help with ye hand strongely to
threst downward as ye best can / with stretchynge of the neck / and with neder
threstynge the shoulder downward.

Is the dismembrynge benethe the. viij. spondyle and y^ it gothe sore inward
than it is deedly / and it shall never be hol^e / is it not hole ^ward / but
that it lonely threst the ^ucha / than the nethermost members lyseth his
meuynge. As the dislocacie is inward / than there byded at every time a bulte
how well it be cures / nevertheless theris a cure of the spondyles / whereof
grows a cro^ed back / and that shall be threstin with youchade in ye best manner
as it can be done or with a board that thereto is made. Whaye have ho^pe them /
than bind there upon this pla^ter here after following.

A Plaster.
Take Dyle o^ roses. iij. ous. Mumie Ma^tick Bolyarmen^ / Dragantum Myrt^llo

eggs in the manner that it be thynne / and depeth therein clothes and they lay
there upon / and there over lay. ii. splentes made with tow and depte in the
^ame. than bind him softly. There (...) ^ethym blood on the hand / and make
him going to the draught. and he shall ete ^ made with eggs with crommes of ^
de depte in barley water. And he shall dr^ke water wherein is sod Cheryses or
bac. y. And dress him at every. v. days ^ / the patient shall be laid upward
that the ^morynge may be threst down. And the time of his helynge is. xx.
days.

Of the dyslocacyon of therybbes. Ca. lxxx.
^S the rybbes be out the joint / than right it set it in with the hand lay
there over ye aforesaid plaster dep^e in (...) white of eg. wrynge it out again
/ but it shall first be dept in water wrynge it out. therouer bind. ii.
splentes not to last / So bind him. ix. days loge. all times lay thereon the

know that this Salve takyth away ye knoddys of the members / and makes even /
and set the bo^ys right.

Of the dyslocacie of the bonys of the shulders. Ca. lxxxi.
THis bone comes not hole out ye joint / but that bone de^a^teth somewhat out
his place (...) than shall ye help ye bone (...) your hand there over ye
a^orsayde plaster / And lay there ou^ small (...) shyns of five to we / and
thereafter splentes every day the desen ^ him blood going to the drawght and
rule him u^ mete and drink as is aforsayd. Is there a woude sow them / lay
thereon this powder of Mastick Dragos blood / Gomi arabici / Dragantu / of each.

Take^ose honey. xii. ouc. (...) meel / or barley meel / or mylst^ meele. iii^.
ouc. frakensence / aloes / of each an ouc. as the woude is clensyd / tha heal
it (...) the ^am^ powder. or with the gren^ wooded plaster. or (...) both. And
his mete drink shall be as I have said oftentimes before.

Of the dysmenbrynge of the shulders. Ca. lxxxij
AUicena set alone. ii. manners in this dismebrynge. Albucasis and other
masters saith that there be more in the should{er} / for it gothe out ye ^oxce
of ye shoulder in. iij. manners. The first / that the heed of ^habone of the
vppermoost arm separteth downward. The other comes foreward to the first
part. The. iij. in ye midst upward / but backward can it not come out the
shoulder bone. The first dysmebrynge is be know^ by ye sight ^elynge as th^r is
feled ye heed of the arm pipe vnd the hole of the arm / and upon the shoulder
is seen an holnes. The other dysmebrynge is know by the ^inge of the heed of
the arm^ype before ^ se an holnes Th^hyrde is in the midst vpwart / is to
kn^we / as the patient cannot retche out his ellebow from his body vnd ye arm
ye se an ^olnes / and on the shu^ an hyghnes.

The manner for to set it in again is this Is i^chylde (...) a ^ge parson^
that shulderbone is out of the toynte / than take it (...) your ^este han^ and
make a fist with your right hand / set it so v^ the holl of the arm upon ye ^
than lift ^ de with your fist like if it hang on any thing / than comes
the bone in his right place: The other manner is / as ye patient is old great
/ and ^ him not list up / than command ^to lye on his back / then shall ye
(...) roud bowl of tree / wind it about (...) clothes lay it under the holl
of his a^me on the out coming bone / than shall ye treed (...) your heel on
the roud bowl stefly downward / and take the patient (...) the hand and
p^llestefly downward / than comes the arm again in his ryghteplace. The.
iij. manner is. the patient shall be pulls (...) the arm over a staff / in ye
midst of the staff a bowl woude about (...) clothes / both the ends of the
staf shall be made fast hyer tha ye length of a man. And the paciet shall stade
upon a stole / than shall ye pull ye arm over the staf / tha shall ye also
push ye stole f^om under his sot / so shall the bone be (...) by ye grace of
god. The. iiij. manner is wa^ad der / in the same manner as you have done (...)
ye staf (as Haly abbas / A louca^ ^. Brun^ saith) But Roger^ please better that
Guydo saith (...) the foot / with ye ^ with ^he staf / not with the ladder. The
syfte ^aner is with the instrument as ^ death in picture / and in all manner as ^
by the same pycture. And the dismembr^ be setin also with retchynge and
pulling and with threstynge in with the hade or (...) a clothe (as Lank^
saith) And will it notbe setin again / for cause that it has the lunge ben
out of the joint / is bec^ harde / than shall ye wasshe it with warm water /
as is asoresayd / and make it soft brenge it in again. And as it is done than
pleases me Rogeri^ / ye which in the first iij. days dresses the paciet
with a ^ (...) clothe and tow depte in whyt or eggs Thereafter with ye plaster
of mylstufm^ele dragons blode. c. as I have said before. And ye shall lay under
the arm of the patient a bowl with clothes / or made of tow and byndehym
well fast with a band that is. v. fyngers broad / as loge as it nedyth.



Of the dysmenbrynge of the elbow. Ca. lxxxiij.
THis dislocatio of ye elbow as (Auicenna saith) is sometimes great / sometimes
small / Albuca. other masters saith yt it gothe sometimes forward out the joint
/ and sometime be hynde / The token of this dysmembrynge is heuynes in ye
meuynge / that it is not possible the pacyent to bring the hand to ye shoulder
/ The elbow comes heuely out ye joint is heuely to set in again / for thesene
was daynes. Of the setting in and cure saith Auicenna that it is i^. ii.
manners / the first with the any hand hold the shoulder / with ye other hand to
drive in it again that is out / with styff detynge behind on the elbow / with a
salved hand with oil / till it comes in again / Rogerius saith the manner of
bin dynge / Lanca^rcancus set the cure thereof with stretchynge with vphanggynge /
or with berynge or weight / if the dyslocacio gothe forward or behind ward /
but Guydo set it in with the knee as dyslocacie is forward. is dyslocacio it
afterward or behind so set he it in the hand (as Auicenna writes) the manner
of the insettynge with the knee or heel that shall be done in it that is
forward Je shall take a broad longhande about his arm / yt the. ii. end goo
behind let your seruaunt hold both ye ends in every hand one / and the
pacyent shall be bound on his foot / and shall be hold / and command the
pacyent to stretch out his arm / tha command the servant with the hand to
pull backward / than shall the master hastily the arm set foremarde to senn
the shoulder again. Tha threst in with the knee that there stand outward /
brenge the arm to the shoulder. As it is out behind / tha is good ye arm to
be bowed / ouertwart by a little lift up the arm / turn it somewhat (as Ja
meric{is} saith) In ye fastmakinge of this cur^ follow all things as I have
learned in the aforesaid chaptre / but the arm shall be berynge about the neck
/ by little and lytyl shall he be bound higher / till the hand come to the
shoulder / and every. iiii. day shall it be dresses onys. And at every time
shall be bowen the membre. And it is woute to be healed in. xv. days.

Of the dysmenbrynge of the hand or knot of the wrest. Ca. lxxxiiij.
THe bone of ye hand goth lightly out of the joint / is lightly to setin again
/ as it be (...) quykly. And as it bydeth^ time out of the joint / than com
thereto sometime an ipostumacion / and than it is with great payne heuynes to set
it in again. And this dismebrynge is most before or behind. the cure thereof
shall be done with stretching / pulling / and meuyng with downward thressynge.
But I take the lift hand of the paciet in my hand stetly by the knot / take
his myddell finger in my right hand. stretchynge and pulling the same finger
/ in the pulling threst I on the outcomyng theragaynst / with the finger under /
or with the thombe above / so it will lyghtely be setin. In the fast making is
none other cure tha I have learned you And Jameric{is} healed this in. xii.
days. Is there a woude / than bind him yt the woude may besene en every day.

Of the dysmenbynge of the fyngers. Ca. lxxxv.
THe dismembrynge of the fyngers that comes lightly and is lightly set in / if
he be brusyd than help him thus stretch ye finger as I have learned in the
next chapytre / lay thereon this plaster following.

A plaster.
Take been meell / orote meell. xii. ounces / mastyck / dragantum / gum of
Arabie of each an ounce / make thereof a soft plaster with the white of eggs /
and lay it thereon and bind it there about / and let it be boude unto ye.
iiij. day / and bind him again till he be hole.

Of the dsymenbrynge of the bonys of the hyppys. Ca. lxxxvi.
A^ice. saith as this dysmembrynge of ye hyppes is inward forward / than the
leg is longer than otherwise / and the pacyent steps up the hole fete /
and he may not bow forward / that heed of ye thyghe is gone inward in the
lyske / and in ye vterpt is holownes In ye dysmebryng afterward and outward
causes the leg be ye short / and the patient may not set his heel on the
ground / The cure thereof lerneth Albucasis / and is sore {pro}fytable to all
manners and ye shall the syke fast hold by ye shulders or he shall be bound
over the shulders on ye thyghe / with a band on a wyndas / and the other band a
bow ye knee on the same wyndas / than pull the membre out with the wind / with
the hade right it till it be set in / The first dysmembrynge wyche is inward
before shall the pacyent be puleth / with the foot or knee drive it in again
As the dysmembryng is outward and behind / so shall ye pacyent in like wise be
pull that the heyth with ye kne be threst inward and the holnes may come out /
and for this dysmembrynge lightly to set in again / so must ye have a table
longer than the pacyet and make on every end a wind / and in the midst under
the back and on ye belly shall the pacyent be bound on the wind with a lunge
towel / and with an other shall be bound on the knee / and wind about ye whole
pipe with the towel unto the foot / and shall be bound so on the other wind
and than shall ye wind with both the wyndas to gyder and set that bone of the
pacyent in again / and than the byndynge of this shall be like as it stand
before in that chapytre of dysmebrynge from the uppermost arm of the adiutorium
/ but it shall be bound faster.

Of the dysmenbrynge of the knee shynes. Ca. lxxxvij.
AS these dysmembrynge is done / than shall ye comaude the pacy^ to stand up
on both his feetes / hold him his place / and thereafter bind it with a
plaster of sycer meele of been meele like as I have learned you / and dress
him all. iiij. days onys / Is there a woude so do as I have before learned you /
with byndyng / with defensiuum / with blood letting / and with meet and drink c.

Of the dysmembrynge of the knees, Ca, lxxxviij.
AL so ye shall know that ye knees comes lightly out the mebre / and is
lightly to set in again / It goothe often times again in / so soon as ye
pacyent stepped on ye feet / If it goo not so in again / tha shall the surgean
have one servant / wiche shall pull the leg / in ye time that he pulls shall
ye set in again the kne Tha lay therouer a clothe dept in rose oil / and on
that clothe lay the plaster of Been meel / and Dragons blood / as I have said
often times before / There over shall ye bind with one lunge band / and thyn
plumacioles of tow dept in the white of eggs / like stands in the. lix:
chapytre / and there over bind / as is a ^rsayd / Is there a woude it shall be
bound that it may be seen every day / Also may ye the dyslocacyon and
dysmembryng of the knee and anclowe lightly set in again with a wind / like
the pycture here after following shows.

Here after foloweht an instrument in pycture for the knee or anclo we lightly
to set i^ again that is out of the joint



Of the dysmembrynge of the feet. Ca. lxxxix.
THe dysmenbryng of the feet is suddenly done / shortly setin again / and it
is heuely to make fast / for the many bonys yt the joint makyth / The token
thereof is the hyghnes of the but coming bone and the payne and leasing of the
meuynge / right this bonys set it in as even like as ye can / ye may not that
membre to much stretch / of such strong stretching should come so much
payne / that thereof should come an impostumacion / therefore ye shall the feet
softly stretch her and there turnynge / and with the other hand shall ye ye
heyghnes threstin again / till it may come in his right place / and as it is
made even / than wind roundabout the foot a clothe that well dept in warm
rose oil / that strength the veins and takyth away the payne. Over the
clothe lay the plaster of been meell and dragos blode / as is written in the
chaptre of the insettynge of ye leg. than salve the leg with that ^stuum as
there comes no impostumacio to / and over the plaster shall ye lay plumacyoles
of tow ^nd there over splynttes / the rafter shall ye bind the feet well / and
lay the foot hye / so that the leg may the better defend from the impostumacio
/ ye shall dres him. iiij. or. v days but ones / ye shall hold ye foot. xxx.
or. xl. days lunge in rest.

Of the dysmebringe of the bone on the feet. Ca. ^x
SEt this membre in again in his rygt place / than lay there over ye plaster /
of cycer meele or rye meel. xij. ouc. dragons blode / mastick / dragantum g^n^
ara^ / of each. ii. ouc. boly armeni / mumie / of each an osic. this mydle to
gyder with the white of eggs. tha bind him but not to fast. And salve the foot
with defensiuu / And salve him at last with dyalthea / there over one oxierociu.
Ite is there a shoulder. hyppe / leg / knee / or foot out of the joint is
become harde / for the lunge being out of the joint. And will you it letin
again tha take lynseed / dowys downgh / make it clean ^rom straw / chyppe /
(...) / see the it well with gotys me^ke in a pot / and stryke it on a cloth /
lay it on the membre / and it shall be so^te in. iiij. hours. than set wisely
the mebre again in his place with ^y of the instrumetes that best serves to
(...) membre as it stands in picture. of ^ ked leg after the xix. chaptre.
of ye ^ arm after the. xviij. chaptre. of the ^oked knee after. lxxij.
chaptre. and will the joint or membre abide to soft / than make a clote wet in
rynnynge water and wrapit about the joint or membre / it will make it ^ast
again.

Of the harde styf and crooked membrys how and in what manner they shall be cured
or / helpen / and ryghted. Ca. xci.
IT happens sometime that after ye helynge of a wooded joint or membre that it
abides crooked / styff / or hard / than shall ye the membre or joint bathe
saftmakyng with old oil / and with water yt is meetely warm like melke war
me that is first molkeu / and bathe the membre with a great sponge / and
thereafter shall ye bathe that membre with papple and hye mallowe roots. v. or.
vi. days / thereafter take any of ye a fore set conterfayte instrumetes / as
the instrument of a crooked arm stadynge after the. xviij. chap. or the
instrument of the crooked leg after the. xix. chap. standing. or the instrument
of the crooked knee stadynge after ye. lxxij. chaptre. of this istrumentes take
yt you serves best for ye mebre. And stretch therewith every day a little
Thereafter salve it with the salve following after this after written bathing /
and this bathing make thus / Ye shall seethe ye heed feetes of a gilded wedder
/ there with bathe the membre And if it not there with amede tha wet a clothe in
the same sop lay it about ye mebre bathe it there with / Or take a great sponge
wet in the same sop lay it warm there on. And so oft as ye the membre bathe
/ or lay thereon the clothe / or ye sponge / so often make a fire of saw
duystmeel thereby let dry ye arm or leg. as the mebre is dried / than salve
it by the fire of the saw meell with this salve of hogs grese / gray grese /
of each. viij. onc. kapos grese / ye mary of a calf / fresshe butter / oliu
nucis iuda ice / oliu sysamini / oil of sweet almons / ^i me of hye malowes /
slyme of lynseed / slyme of fenygreke. iiij. ouces. storacis calamite / bdellij
gumi / ysopi humide / of each anouc. the grese melt / it may not touche salt
/ as it is melted than do therein the oils and the slymes / and make thereof a
salve.

An other good safte making.
Sethe lynseed /. xij. figs. tha take sour dowgh /. ii. roasted oynonus.
musterdseed doves donge / barley meele / of each like much / that stamp al to
gyder in a mortar th^ do thereto a little oil olyue tha it shall be a plaster and
lay it there upon.

These plaster is also good to all swerynge and impostumacyon. And can he not
go to the draught in this fykenes / tha make this bathe of papple / water^res
or genacio in latyne / parydane / edera achorea / camomyll flowers / of each an
hadefull / this do al to gyder in a little lyne bag seethe it in water / in
ye water shall ye paciet him bache to the nauyll. so goth the swerynge away
through the draught going through the vryne. And if it goth so away / than
sees barley in water do therein a little honey and give it the patient to drink
/ than shall the place inwardely be clensyth.

Howe the cosumynge mebres ought to be helped and cured. Ca. xcii.
WIth a woollen clothe and with water of the styngynge nettylles shall ye first
(...) be ye membre or joint. (...). or. iiij. days / every day ii. or. iij.
times. The second ye shall set ventoses or boxes about the sore / and take
them of again / yt shall ye do. iii. or. iiij. days lunge without pryckynge.
The. iij. if he have in the joint great payne / than shall ye make him this
water. Take the liver / ye hart / and the longues of a black calffe there with
chap sage. ii handful / and mengle it with ye same c^es blood that it may be
moysty therewith / do it in a still a tory which is called alembicu and
dystylle water therout / therewith was she ye mebre every day. iij. or. iiij.
times yt shall help him. The. iiij. when ye have done this before said / than set
him in a bathe stew ^et on him the ventose or box / and garsse him / but set
the ventose no more upon and anoint ye garssynge all the membre with this salve
following.

A Salve.
Take aqua vite / (...) eu^or^ / long pepper made all in powder mydle them to
gyder that they be not to thycke / afterward lay this plaster on ye sore /
give him every day a fresshe plaster.

Another good plaster to the same.
Take creffysshes stamp they with ye shell les all the body / than stryke it on
a blew woollen clothe and lay it on the joint / where by the joint shall be come
full of blaynes / salve the joint with the before said salve / and this plaster
is shortly ^ole stynking / therefore ye must lay thereon in. i^. days onys a
fresshe plaster again.

Another proved experiment to the same.

out pulling of the blood the work masters hath wrought after ye counsel of
Hali abbas / the place shall be made strounge with a clothe depte in cold water
and lay thereon / but I was wounte to do in that water much salt and wta blew
