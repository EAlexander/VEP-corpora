the most conynge and famous master of phisyke / Master Iherom bruynswyke And
now newly Translate out of Duyche into English Natonly to the synguler help
and profit of the Surgyens / Phisycyens / and Pothecacyes / But also of all
manner of people / Parfytely and in dew time and ordre to learn to dystyll all
manner of Herbs / To the Profit / cure / and Remedy of all manner dysseases and
Infirmytees Apparent and not apparent. And ye shall understand that the waters
be better than the Herbs / as Auicenna restefyeth in his fourth Conon saying

The Prologue of Laurence andrew the Translatour^.
AFter divers sondry small volumes tryfeles of mytth p^tauce / Some newly
composed / some translated and of late finished / Now minded to exercise my
pene in matter to the redesom what more {pro}fytable / I have chosen among all
other the book of distyllacyon of waters / written by the thirty year labour
of master Iherom Beunswyke / to Translate into English. Not thinking
(though peradventure some in that part will take it) that my knowledge in
these two tongues is such that I of all other to this Translacion should be
most mete / but only being moved with natural love unto my contre / which
surely should want if I were able to perform^ it / no profytablebooke for lack
of a Translatoure / that is in an other language written. For me think where
the masters in all Science expert will take no such pains / it is not
dyscomedable for a man of more base lernyng to put to his helping hand. It
is na old saying / though power often doth fail / A willing heart is to be
accepted. The which onys well remembered. Spare not favourable redder to pursue
and revolve to thy synguler helthe / conforte / and learning / this book of
distyllacyon. Learn the high and marvelous virtue of herbs / know how
inestimable a preseruatyue to the health of man god hath provided growing every
day at our hand / use the effects with reverence / and give thanks to the
maker celestial. Behold how much it excedeth to use medicine of efycacye
natural by god ordained then wicked words or charms of efycacye unnatural
by the devil enuented. which if thou dost well mark / thou shalt have
occasyon to give the more louynges praise to our fauyour / by redynge this
book and knowlegyng his benyfites innumerable / To whose praise / and helthe of
all my crysten bretherne / I have taken upon me this simple translacyon / with
all humble reverence / ever ready to submit me to the correccion of the learned

Here fynyssheth the table of this present book. and here after follows the
first part of the same volume
Here begins the first part of this o^e / where in is comprehendyd the noble
science the true dystyllacyons of waters / and other divers things
arty^cyallys
The first chaptre shewyth what dystyllacyon is. Ca. i.
IN the first it is needful to be expressyd and showed what dystyllyng is for
it belogeth to all manner of people to understand and know the cause of that
thing that they begin or enterprise to work upon / to the entente that he
may have a perfyt knowledge of such works as he begins / how he may
brenge it to a good end.

Wherefore it is to be understand that dystyllyng is none other thing / but
only a puryfyeng of the gross from the subtle / the subtle frome the gross
/ each seperatly from other / to the entet that the corruptyble shall be made
incorruptyble / and to make the material inmateryall / the quycke spyryte to
be made morequycker / because it should the sooner pierce pass thrugh by the
virtue of his great goodness and strength that there in is sonke and hid for
the coceyuyng of his helthfull operation in the body of man / for Dystyllacyon
is an elemental thing / for thrugh the mouynge of the natural heuyns /
everyone must be naturally governed by the bodies above likewise the body of
man thrugh an expert master in medicine / and thrugh the waters that there ben
divided from the grossenes of the herbs each in his substance / that to be
conveyed to the place most needful for health comfort / like as here after more
diligently shall be declared.

Wherefore dystyllynge is found and ordeynened Ca. ii.
DYstyllynge is necessarily found and ordained for many manner of necessytees /
and specyally for the love of man him for to keep in health strength and to
bring the seek and weke body again to helthe / and to the intent that the
gross and corruptyble body may be again cleansed and puryfyed / for who so
ever takes herbs / rotes / or other substances and stamp them / the juice
there of strained and mynystred is not sightly which many one therefore doth
them abhor / because of the inconuenyent sight

Secondaryly with waters dystyllyd / all manner of confeccyons / syropys /
powders / electuaryes be myxced to the entet that they should be the more
syghtly doulcet to be ministered received used Also this dystyllynge is only
found for the common people that dwell far from medycynes physycyons / for
them that ben not able to paye for costly medyeynes / the which hath moved me
greatly this my little work to opene disclose for health of ma {pro}sperite of
mine eve cryste.

Thyrdely The dystyllynge is ordained / bycawse that when any medicine is
mynystred with her corpus or substance in the manner of electuaryes / cofeccyons
/ powders / or syropys / or any medycynes with etynge / or swalowynge down /
or drinking / or in what manner so ever it be / is Ieoperdus in the body /
bycawse of her substance / Of the which Auyce. wryreth in the beginyng of the
fourth Canon / where as he thrugh the learning of ypocras saith / that every
medicine that is used with her substacef^ebleth and makes aged and weke. For
the which ypocras / Mesue / Arnoldus de villa nova / and many other more have
found the noble science to separate the gross and erthy substa^nce from the
subtle thrugh this operation / that is named the handworke of dystyllacyon /
or bornynge thrughe the Alembyck or helm / and other instrumetes as here after
follows and to you shall be showed

In howe many manners may be dystylled Ca. iii.
IT is needful with short coclusyo to show the most expect como or
lyghtyst way of dystyllyng / to the intent that the redder or lerner should under
stand me without any murmuracyon or lunge rehersyng. Wherefore I have two
manners of ways wherein is coprehedyd in brefe the shortyst way of dystyllacion
The first is how it may be done in five manner of ways without any cost.

The second way with cost only of fire and that also in five manners

The first without cost / is done thrugh a threcorned fylte / named per filrri
distillacione The second manner of the first way is this. A glass filled upon
another glass turned with the bottom upward / well stopped / set or so hagyd in
the son / is named per solis distillacionem

The third of the first way is / A glass fyllyd well stoppyd wrought in dowgh
and so set in the oven when the breed is baking / is named {per} panis
distillacione

The fourth manner of the first way is / A glass the third part fyllyd /
well stoppyd / and buried in horse downge / is named / per fim^ equi
distillacionem.

The fyfte manner of the first way is A glass fyllyd well stoppyd buried in an
antehyll / named {per} formice distillacione.

The first manner of the second way is of the dystyllynge with fire / as
thus. A glass reasonably fyllyd and set in water / under it a fire made / there
upon an helm or Alebick set / named distillacio {per} balneu marie or
distillacio in duplovase

The second manner of the second way is / ye shall put to the same water that
the glass stands in / horse downge / tha shall it be named / distillacio per
ventrem equinum.

The third manner of the second way is / Set your glass in a capell where as
syfted ashes be in / named distillacio per Sineres. The fourth manner of the
second way is / ye shall put sand for ashes in the capell where as the glass
shall stand in / is called distillacio {per} arenam

The fyfte manner of the second way is / ye shall set boldly the glass upon the
fire / nothing betweyn the fire and it but only an iron grate or an iron
treuet / and is named distillacio per ignem.

Thus yr have the manners of the.ii. ways of dystyllacyons with cost with out
cost. How be it many more manners there be to dystylle / ways out of nombre
whereof the Alkemystes apart can testy fie / and is to them well beknowen.
pendynge in these fornamed ten manners of the which as now I will cesse for
shortenynge of the time / and bycawse as now it is no necessite here toreherse

What instrumentys be necessary or needful unto this work.
AFter the rehersals of the.ix. manners of the dystyllacyons aforesyad now it is
behooveful to know the instrumentis thereto belonging / the which as nyghe as
god will give me grace / in short conclusion I will to you declare them / as
far as it is possible / to the intent that the operation of dystyllacion may
be accomplysse / and openly showed in figures as here after follows. How be it
that the learned and expert masters of the science of Alkemye here of have a
knowledge / yet it is not open to all manner of people wherefore I shall make here
of as thus the first rehearsal.

Ye must have three cornerde white fyltes like fyltes of hats / clay / or
loom / bryke / baken and onbaken. After that iron gratys a square finger thycke
/ made round or square as this figure shows.

After that ye must have cappellys of white clay / such as the gold smythes
crowsybles is made of / some leded and some not leded / commonly half a yerde
wide and deep / or more or less as behoweth acordynge to the proprocyon of the
fornayse. And the cappellys be made af^ this manner in figures following.

A^er that ye must have coper kettyllis or coper capellys being in quantyte
half a yerde of wydenesse and depth with a pipe of coper being a quarter
half a yerde of length / and it shall stand within two finger breed of the
border or ege of the kettle as this figure shows / for to dystylle in balneo
mary. or in ventre equyno / as here after I shall to you more expressly
declare.

Than must ye have leden platys thrughe perssyd in the myddys / with four
round rings about it / great and small light and heavy. The myddelbare of.x.
pound weight. The small of. viii pound. The greets of all.xi. or.xii. pound
/ as this figure following shows. Also ye must have bordys as broad and lunge
as the cappell or fornays is / in such manner that the glass may stade in the
myddelmost hole / to the en^et that the glass do not fall one way or other
thrugh the heuynesse of the anhangynge of the ledys in the byndynge thereto when
you shall / dystylle in valnco mary.

After that ye must have helmys made of white clay / such as before is
specyfyed / they must be leded within without / or else they must be copper /
tynne / or led of the fascyon here after following.

Under that ye must have pannys acoedyng to the quantyte / made of
crowsibrlerth glased or leded without and within or else made of copper / tyn
/ or led / acordynge to your power. After that ye must have glassys / or
fyoles named Eyrcubyt of such fascyon as this figure shows And they must be
made of venys glass because they should the better withstand the hete of the
fire.

Also ye must have glasses or fyoles that ye may whelm each upon other / of
such fascyon as here is showed / for to dystylle therewith in the son as more
expressly in the.ix. chapytre shall apere.

Ye must have also cloaked glasses named retorte / and also glasses with two
arms named pellycane / fascyoned as this figure shows

After that ye must have blind helmettes of glass like a gored turned in to
an other glass without any pipe / named alembicu cerum. And glasses that be wide
above and beneth and narowe in the myddest named circulatoryu as here is
figured / for to putryfye dygeste theryn as here after more plainly is
expressed.

After that ye must have helmys of glass with lunge pypes / called alembyck or
alembicum as this pycture shewyth.

Ye must have glass named Fyoles with lunge neckis and narowe mouthys to
receive the water that comes frome the pipe of the alembyck of the fassyon of
the same following.

Ye must have also stone cannes / or crukys to keep the waters in after they be
dystyllyd.

The mould or form shall be as large and wide (...) thin as this picture is in
every conditions like great and small / within the black circle ^ is the
instrument to fassyon the stone in / which stones must dry by their own
acorde / ^ the oven should not ryue / nor cleue / with the hete of the fire /
when they be dreythey sha^ ^ynysshe the third part in length / breed / ^
thycknesse. The.vi. stones makes a roude lay (...) oven. The.v. stones and an
half makes a round lay to the wind hole of the fornase (...) as ye draw
out the ashes And other.v. stones and an half closes another round lay
(...) the hole where ye put the coals in / and thus make thefo^uase.



Howe that ye should make the stones / clay / or lutum that belongs to these
works. Ca. v.
BY the grace of almighty god unto you shall be declared the handy* work of
this here after following / the which ye be desirous for to accomplyssh for to
form or make your stone / that ye shall make your forneys of / it is of
necessyte that ye should have an instrument of iron or Nut tree / or Peer tree
wode of vii. inches thycke. Also ye must have good mean earth another to fat nor
to lean / well purifyed from all onclenes / and tempered with water. Also it
must be beten and trodden together / till it be remperate and of manner like wax
or doughe. The form must be threst in water or made wet laid in sand upon a
board / therein ye shall put of your foresaid clay. If there be to much / ye
shall stryke it of with a wet hand / than ye shall lift up your instrument by
the ears / knock upon it on an other board / than the stone shall fall out. And
the instrument is as the precedent pycture shows. And in this manner ye may
make as many as few stones as ye well / and set them in the air in a shadowy
place / or hye in your hows till they be dry. And ye may take pro sinders
small beat to powder the.viii. part thereof as much as clay / tha the stones
become as harde as iron in the fire. Or else bear your instrument to the tyle
maker and cawse him to make as many as ye need. when ye have your stones it is
needful to you to tempre your loom or clay for your fornayse in such manner
that he do not ryue nor cleue / not only your fornayse / but also the
instrumentys of copper / iron / glass or erthen / to be stricken or lute them
there with at all times requysyte.

First ye must have a tough puryfyed clay at the Potters well beknowen / tow
here / flocks / or horse tordes / beten with a little wade till every here be
loss frome another / than shall they be choppyd small / and tempered / with
the clay / so much that it bear the third part of the ^laye / and it is best
that ye tempere it with salt water / to the intent that the clay doth not
ryue with the fyce. Nor no manner capellys / pannys / or glassys / that be lutyd
therewith three or four times over / and so let it dry by him self. If you will
make a loom or clay to enoynte your glasses or fyoles ye must take pure clay
or loom / and put it in a tubbe or payle or other close vessel / and cast wine
upon it and myxce it with horse tordys / and with small shyuys or herdys of
flaxce / like thycke pap / and there with enoynte and over stryke your
glasses or fyoles / and let them so dry by themself in the shadow. If ye will
that no manner of stones shall ryue / rent not breast asonder thrugh the hete
of the fire / than tempere your loom with sty^ed water of nettels and enoynte
or wasshe therewith your stones. Also that no manner of lynen clothe burn with
the fire / that your glasses shall be luted with / when the one is whelmed on
the other / take your lynen clouthe and deep it well in salt water and than
let it dry by him self After that wet it in the white of an egg well beten /
let it dry again by him self. When you will lute any thyn what so ever it be
/ enoynt it well with ^e clay tempered as is before specyfyed ^ta a lutynge for
a glass that ryueth ^n the fire / take rede led and half ^noche vnsleked
lyme beten to pow^ and a little dust meal of the myllys ^pere all this together
with the whyof an egg / and make a lynen clout ^tte therein / and hold it a
little by the (...) till it be warm / and so ordered lay it the ryue of the
glass standing upon fire / ye must be ware that no manner old thing towche
yowr glass the / ^yle that yt is hate / for that whill make ^o rent and break
asonder.

Thus shall you make lutum sapientie: arnoldus de villa nova saith where ^th ye
shall lute all manner of glasses / the entete that the fire shall not {per}yche
there hurt yt. Take two parts of ^ll puryfyed loom or clay / and one par of
horse torde / clean gadered as before ^ayde. And to the intent that the clay
^ll be the stronger / and not rent nor ^ue. Than put there to the powder of ty^
stones / or else powder of vnsleked ^e / all this same with salt water / well
^yd together with your handys in a ^uer gf thynne dowghe / and so occu^ed.

Thus have I showed you divers ma^r and ways of lutynge and how to ordered. If
ye desire any more to kno^e thereof / ye may inquyre that of the al mists.

How ye shall make the common fornays that belongs to this work. Ca. v.
IN divers manners forms these fornayses be made / therefore by the help of
almighty god I shall show you the most common ready ways her to needful most
necessary / leave the other vnrehersed / because I will e^c^ewe the tedyousnes
of the reders and the lerners of the science / to the accoplyssynge of our
fornamed works my purpose is to show you two manner of ways / and every way
in divers manner of forms as / here after plainly to you shall be expressyd.
The ferst way of these fornayses or styllatoryes that be commonly used / ben
named rose garlands or helmettys. An other manner there is to be made fornayses
or styllatoryes having many manner of fascyons. The first is to be showed of
the fornayses that ben well beknowen among the potters made of earth leded or
glased / of fascyon like the figure here before / and it may be remeued frome
the one place to another.

How ye shall dystylle in sand / named dystyllacyo per arenam.
THis chapyter is ordered in every conditions like as the chapytre speaking of
the dystyllynge in the ashes save only the glasses need to be better as venys
glasses is there to best / and also the glasses must be stro^glyer suited / and
for the ashes / ye must take pure syfted sad / and as ye tell one two three
be the clock / so softly must your droppys fall and thus ye must order your
self if ye will have the true way of dystyllacyon for it is the highest degre in
heet of all dystyllacyons / wherefore take heed that ye make not to sharpe a
fire / for if ye do your warkers will brenne and stink and your glasses will
be. Also ye shall never dystyll your herbs so dry out of all moisture in
the ashes or the sand as ye may do in valneo mary / or in ventre equyno. For
in balneo mary or in ventre equino they can never be out stylle^ so dry that
they can bren / stink or (...) harm. But in ashes / and specyally (...)
sand / for therein at the end comoly the brenue / therefore take heed to the
enter^ that ye may the bettere optayne your purpose.

ANother fornayse ye may make after the fascyon of the great fyg^re with two
three or four hellmys / that (...) all hete with one fire / and in every helm a
sondry water dystyllyng / but that fornayse may not be remeuyd / wherefore ye
must take heed in what place ye (...) it in that there come no scathe thereof /
and that shall ye make in this manner / first make the herthe as lunge broad as
(...) will which shall be the sot or fondame^ of the fornayse where as the
ashes shall fall on / than lay two lays of sto^ in hight above it that it
may be holowe in the myddest above the holowe place ye shall lay round or
square iron barrys every bar a great enche of thyckenesse and they must be
laid an inch frome each other as before is figured / and about the gyrde
iron or iron barrys ye shall make up your forneys alwaye^ the longer the wyder
within of a fore^hey / and within it shall be eonynted with the loom or clay
tepered with salt water thereto prepared as is before said. On the vppermoost
part ye shall lay two strong iron bars.v^i. inches frome each other well
enoynted upon the forsayde bars shall be laid a great iron plate meetly
thycke with a hole in the myddest / for to caste the coals thorough under the
plate shall be made four wyn (...) holes / for to let the smoke out / dan the
^late shall be enoynted as the bars be (...) specyfyed well thycke / and
above (...) place the fornays shall be raised all (...) half a stone
thycknesse / and in the myddest of the fornays an hole shall be (...) even just
above the hole of the plate where the coals be cast thrughe. Upon the ^aydeplate
shall be left four broad pyt^ys acordynge to the quantyte of your (...). In
the which pyttys ye shall put or strew fine syfted ashes or sand of two
inches hye / in the which ye shall set your pannys of earth / coper / or
led but the leden pannys may not well abide by the fire without meltynge /
except ye make very small fire under it / upon such panis be set the
styllatories named helmettys / or rosegarlandys here before rehearsed and
figured. And to every smoke hole ye shall make a plogge or tap to govern
your fire with / great / or small as it is needful.

Here after follows of another manner or ro^nayse for dystyllacyons as here is
figured

When you will make a styllatory tha lay upon the herthe.v. stones in manner of
a ring / which fassyon of stone stands figured in the.v. chapytre the syxt
stone shall be divided in twain / than the mouth of the forneyse abides open /
than lay upon the next lay.vi. stones / cowched mason wise / than anoynte it
without and withi with such clay as before is spoken of / than lay the grate
or iron barrys over it / and lay again.vi. stones upon it / upon that / lay
again.vi. stones / upon these.vi. lay agyane five and a half / and tha abides
(...) hole open to put coals in / and se that it be always well luted or
enoynted as is before said, than lay again.vi. stones to close the mouth above
than have ye two holes / one for to draw out the ashes / the other to put in
the coals / than lay again.vi. stones well lutyd always / than lay upon it a
round ring like a tryuer / and that must be very well lutyd with the clay
before said. Upon the tryuet or iron ye shall set an erthen cappell as before
is said / and that well lutyd / than ye shall hyghen your for nayse so lunge
till he be as hye as the chapel in such manner that ye have four wynd holys
or smoke holys above / made Just to the Capell with.iiii. erthyn tappes / to
govern the fire / ye shall streme syfted ashes / or sand in the Capell /
therein set your glasses / the ashes or sand shall be four inches thycke
strewed.

If you desire to make a fornayse or styllatorye named Balneu Marie* than take
for the erthyn Cappell a coper Cappell / or kettyll with a copere pipe as
before is figured / that well lutyd, and set the pipe before over the fornayse
lest the water fortune to sethe as if it should run over / than shall it
run thrughe the pipe without hurting of the fornays*

In such coper kettyll / or cappell shall be none ashes not sand. for it
borneth lyghtely / but ye may put therein horse tordes / for to be stylled in
ventre equino.

Also there be other fornayses made with a loge hye pipe in the midst with
three or four cappels about / and there is a grate of yro vndreneth the lunge
pipe above the hole where as the ashes be drawn / hath holes severally under
every cappel having a sondry fornayse pendynge to the said lunge pipe. And
every cappel hath a smoke or wind hole / for to give thrugh it a several hete
to every cappell / and that to draw to his regystre And thus ye may hete your
cappellys / severally or all in general. the lunge pipe standing in the
myddest shall be filled with coals / and it shall be well cloysed above / that
none air come out / than the fire brenneth only upon the iron grate / ye may
make this pipe as hye and as lowe as it shall please you / and keep the fire
with stoppynge of the wind holys above and beneth, as need requires
with.xiii. or xiiii. tappys / and this fornayse is made as here is figured.

How ye shall ordir or prepare your instrumentys where as your waters shall be
dystylled also kept. Ca.vi.
AFter the preparacyon of your fornaises / it is needful to you and expedyent
to make and prepare your instrumentys and your vessellys to keep your water in
after that they be dystylled and so may ye well accomplysse this noble practyse
and former enterprise.

First when ye well dystylle in glasses set in ashes or sad / it is necessary
for you to ouerlute them more than half the part of the glass with the
fornamed some or clay / but they that be occupied in balneo mary need not to
be luted / and such glasses be named cucurbyte byte the best glass thereto
belogyng be made of hohemy glass or of the great rouude shynes of Venys glass.
And such curbytus ben not only made of glass but also of crusyble earth well
glasyd within / some be made of coper / led / or tynne. The tynnen be occupied
in balneo mary / and copperen ben often times luted and so set in the fire.
The copere be sometime occupied in balneo mary olso / Sometime they be set in
ashes or sand / and they must be luted more than the two other parts. When
ye will put any thing in glass or in any other instrumetis of what nature so
ever the substance be / wet your clouthe in your lutun or clay / and wind
your glasses therein twyes or thryes round about. And when ye will dystylle
oil or any such like / than ye must enoynte it with your forsayde lu^um two
inches thycke / yet it will s^antly hold. For the oil will often times perse
thrugh out / therefore ye must take heed to your lutum or clay / if you will
keep your waters well after the dystillacyons ye must take a stone Truke / But
if ye can not get such as ye desire / Than take an erthen canne and set it
in an oven when the breed is drawn / when it is thrugh warm / than put in it
mol: ten wax^e / and stere that round about that the wax may cleue to every
place than torn it with the bottom upward and puore out of the ware / than
enoynte the canne without with awollen clothe full of molten talowe / than set
it agaynea little withi the oven than the wax and the talowe soketh in to the
canne And when it is cold than put thy water therein and stop the mouth
thereof with a woden tap and with wax / and hang on the cruke in a small
bill the name of your water / and what time it is dystylled.

Now ye shall dystylle thrugh a fylte named per fultrum distillacio. Ca.viii.
FOr to dystyll al manner of sapoure or other watery moisturs thrughe a fylte /
as water / wine / or other liquor or sape / which ye will puryfy from all
trowblous and vnclere substauces / for ye can dystylle no manner of herd thiges
thrugh a fyllte / as herbs / ^otes / or ^uytes bycawse of he^ herdens,
wherefore ye must have.x. or.xii. fyltes pure and whyt / being thresquare / a
foot of length viii. inches of breed / and the sapoure or ^yquor shall be done
in an erthen pan well leded within / and the pan shall be set upon a hye
steyr or greses / which pan shall be somewhat lenyng wherein shall lay the
brodest end of the fylte / the smallest end shall hang in a glass / or in
another pan that shall stand upon the next steppe of the steyer down wardys
/ in the said vndermoste pane shall be a fylte laid as it was in the first always
the pane heluynge downwardys and the fylte with the smallest end hanging
downwardys in an other pane / so forth doyng with as many fyltes and as often
as ye will. When your fyltes be overladen stopped with the vnclenesse that
therein is sowked by the dystyllacyon / ye shall wash them in fair waters till
they be puryfyed of their vnclenes / than ye shall dry them again / and lay
them in the pane as they were before In this manes ye may dystylle.x. or.xii.
times in a day with on labour / till the substance be purely claryfyed frome
all vnclenes / And this is pryncypally good for the waters that be dystylled
with fire for to (...) them hate with of in the sane / and this is the first
manner to dystylle without fire.

How ye shall dystylle in the son named per solis distilacionem. Ca.ix.
THe second manner to dystyll with out fyes which may be done with out cost as
thus / ye shall take a glass that shall be almooste as wide above as beneth
named an vrynalle / or like this figure about The two parties of this glass
shall be filled with blossom of flowers / as roses / violettes / or other
blossoms / or such like / than shall ye make a small cross of woden styckes
and lay that upon the mouth of the glass tha make an other cross of small
styckes somewhat longer than the other that my be bent cross wise ever the
other straight within the glass to make them both sure than turn the mouth
of the glass down wardys upon the mouth of such and the glass / that the mouth
of it may be somewhat within the first glass / than lure them well together that
there come none air out / than hang the in the hotest of the son / the glass
with the flouts upward. Thus dystylleth your substance thrugh the hete of
the son out of the uppermost glass in to the vndermoste.

How ye shall dystyl in hot breed with man oven / named per panis
distillationem.
THus shall ye dystylle in an oven. Take a flat flacron or botell of glass /
put it full of roses or other flowers or pyssemer eggs / or any other blossom
/ than stop the glass fast with a woden stoppell / and cover the glass over
all / as if it were a lofe and put it in the oven / when ye put other breed
therein and draw it out again with that same breed when it is baken / and let
it cole by him self / and when the breed is cold tha break it softly of /
saving the glass frome brekynge than pull out the stoppell / and put it in
another such glass / and order it as the other glass was / so often till it be
enough. Ysit be not put than and clean enough ye may dystylle it perfiltrum
if ye will. And these two manners be very good to dystylle of flowers the waters
serving for the ^yen.

How ye shall dystylle in horse downge named perfimum equorum dystyllatio.
Capitulum xi.
TAke a glass like a gored named in latin cucume^ / on it a blind helm. Or
else take a glass that is small in the myddel / and great beenethe and also
above / named in latin circulatorium like as these glasses here be figured

Fill the third part of this glass with what manner of flowers that ye will and
stop that glass well with a wode stoppell and over lute it well / than put the
glass in warm horse downge / which horse douge must lay in a woden vessel
chyst wise well stopped and covered / and therein it must lay a month or
longer and also this horse downge must be renewed every forthenyght / after
that draw out the cap softly / than puryfye the cleryst of in another glass
named a pellyca which before is figured or in another / whereof there be tweyne
as here is figured the one in the other.

This glass or the pellycanste shall be well lutyd and also set in the horse
downge as before is said / Than this lycou^e or water will run up and down
frome the one glass in the other. Tha becomes it say / and of great operation.
Thus be also other costly waters rectyfyed / as autum potabile / aqua vite /
and other waters / for with the great ronnynge up and down in the pellicane it
is rectyfyed and amendyd / Thus ye have the fourth manner of dystyllacyon with
out fire.

How ye shall dystylle in a pyssme^ hyl named {per}formyce distillacionem.
Ca.xii.
THe fyft manner is thus. Fill a glass full of flowers / of what manner of flowers
ye will / and stoppyd in the manner before said / than bury it in a pyssemer
hill / that some call an antehyl where as many of them be fourtee days and
more as ye think that need requires Than take out the glass again. and pour
out the clerest above there of into another glass and hang it in the son /
or put it in a pellicane in horse downge to rectyfyed it as before is said /
tha it shall be pure and sayre In this manner is wine put in to a glass / and set
in a pysemer hill as before is said a month cotynuynge than it shall be pure
and fair / as if it were dystilled by Alembyke / and hath a godly taste and is
well smelling. In this manner is dystyled the dew of may Thus have ye the
fyfte manner of distillacyon without fire.

How ye shall dystyll in bolneo marie ^amed per balneum marie / o^ in (...)
Ca.xiii.
THe syxte manner of dystyllacyon is ordered in this manner. The glass shall be
set in warm water / which water shall be in a Copper kettle or copper
cappell with a pipe of copper / as I have show you before that the fornaise be
not wet if it fortuned to sethe and run over. And the dystyllacyon is ordered
thus. Take a glass named curcubyte / till the two parts of the same glass with
juice herbs / flours / leues / fruits or what so ever it be chopped small /
and set the glass upon a ring of led like as before is figured in the fourth
chapytre / made a bond of clothe three fyngers broad about the upper part of
the glass / About the same band make four small rings of clothe having
four bandys coming down to the four rings that be fast on the leden ring
and bind the fast each to the other as here is figured.

Than set the glass with the led in the water and standed upright / and is sure
from falling on the one side or the othe^ thrugh the weght of the led / than
set the Alembyek or glass and lute it well as before is specyfyed / in the
tyffe chapytre / Than make fire in your fornays to hete your water with / and
let it be no hoter than ye may suffer your finger in it / and have all time
warm water to fill your kettyl again / when the water by length of time is
wasted through the h^e of the fyde / for if a drop of cold water touche the
glass it will ryue and break a sonderye shall understand that when it drops
no more it is clean dystyllyd / Than ye must let the glass stand styll in it
for to cole / for yt ye drew the glass hot out of it / it would break
asonder. It is needful for you also to have a round board with a round hole
in the myddeste clefte asonder / for to lay always about the glass to the intent
that it may be the longer warm. Ye shall also understand that all manner of
watres that be dystylled in this manner keep the sovereign sent and odour of
the herbs that those waters be dystylled of wherefore they be gretely praised
that much bett tha the waters of the herbs flowers that be put i a glass / as
it is showed i the.xi. chapytre of that / that is buried in horse dounge. v
or.vi. weeks to be putryfyed / than the one with the other dystyllyd i balneo
marie as I showed you before

How you shall dystylle in the horse belly named dystyllatio per venteem equi i
latin. Ca.xiiii.
THe.vii. manner is thus to dystyl in the horse belly / ye shall set the glass
filled in the for named manner in Balneo Marie / as before is said but in the
wate^ ye shall put horse tordes / taking good bed that there be no straw nor
hay therein / and that the water be so thycke of the horse tordes as if it were
wortys. Ye must also take heed that ye put often times warm water in it / for
it is soon consumed wastyd away / and this is half a degre hoter than in
balneo marie / therefore ye may dystylle hardes substances in it than in balneo
marie

How ye shall dystylle in ashes / named Dystyllacyo per Sineris Ca.xv
Vhe.viii. manner is ye shall strew fine syfted ashes in a cappel. iiii ynchs
of thyckenes / than fill a glass the third part full with such substance as
ye will / and set it in the ashes / than fill the cappelle full of ashes till
the third part of the glass be covered / and the cappelle where as the ashes
be in shall be over the / for if it were of copper / thrughe the force and hete
of the fire it would melt. After that set the alembycke upon the glass and lute
it well upon it with lutum sapiencie as I have showed you before in the v.
chapitre Than make fire under it that it may drop treatably as if you would
tell the clock.i. ii. that tha there fall a drop / and so continue after the
same soft manner / for if it fall faster or quycker the fire is to great
therefore stop the wind holys above and benethe / tha it shall fall the softer
and brenne the less / and so it shall smell the less of the fire / When it
drops no more than let the glass stand a hole night a colynge or ever ye
move or styre it / or else it would break a sonder The glasses be also lutyd
to the third {per} as it is showed to you before in the.v. chap. by cause they
should break the less.

How ye shall dystyll in the sand / named distillacio per arenam ca.xvi.
THis part is ordered in every condition as the chapytre is ordered of the
ashes. as before is showed in the v. chapytre. c.

How ye shall frely by^ylle on the fyet with a wind ouyn / named distilacio
{per} ignem Cap.xvii.
THe tenth manner is this to dystyl so that there be nothing between the glas^
and the fyers^lyke as aqua fortis and other strong waters be dystylled. To
this dystyllacyon is necessary for you to have a treuet i the myddest of the
formys with the.iii. fete masoned in the wall of it / And the glass must be
made of venys shyue glass. That glass shall be on the out side well lutyd a great
inch of thycknesse. and after that ye shall fill the third part of your
glass / which shall be also well enoynted with such clay as before hath been
spoken of / Than shall ye enoynte your fornays in the same manner / And after
that ye shall set the alembyk on your glass and se that it be well luted / than
ye shall set a receptacle or viol so that the pipe of the alembycke hang
within it / and than it must be well lutyd therein

At the first to begin with / the space of.iii. hours ye must make hot fy^
and after that the longer the greater / and at the beginning ye shall stop
your wind holy / which shall be four in nobre above the grate or treuet
against the coals / where with ye may mynysshe or encresse your fire as ye list
to give it air / for it is no chyldes play nor game to dystyll strong waters
/ or aqua foctis / wherefore ye ought the best to take heed / but the most
part of all the glasses break asoder where as aqua fortis is dystylled in / for
in the end the helm becomes as red of the great hete as any rubey or ever the
spyrite from him departs. And let your glass stand colynge by him self, or
it be taken out

How ye shall dystylle in common styllatoryes / named Rosgarladys or helmets as
here is figured. Ca.xviii.
When ye will dystylle much waters in a common styllatorye / ye shall lay sand
under the pan of yt.iiii. inches of thycknes. There upon ye shall set your
pan of earth over ledyd or glasyd as the Potter makes / Or else of copper /
Round about the pan ye shall lay sand bestrike that above with clay / to
the intent that it be not lyghtely with handys remeued or leftyd up.

Than lay therein such things as ye will dystylle / and set the helm upon it.
Than make a lunge small lynen cloth wet in thynne clay tempeted as before is
said / with the same clothe ye shall stop your styllatorye between the
helmete and the pan / than set a glass before it that the pipe thereof may
hang in the glass / and lute it well that none air come out of the glass /
thus dystyll and mark thrugh the glass how the dropes fall therein / acordinge
to the same temper your fire / great or small as it behooves when ye se that it
dropped no more / than it is time to break it up again / and put other herbs
therein. When ye will have much water out of little herbys. Than lay the
herbys three inches thycke upon each other in the pan / flowers shall be
laid.vi. inches thycke / fruits.ii. inches thycke / for if it lay thycker
upon each other / than is the moystoure of the vndermoste herbs dyssolued or
ever it can be sublymed thrughe the uppermost / wherefore / when I will dystylle
costly herbs which ben not easy to get / as maioran / rosemare flowers / or
other such like. Than I think not my labour lost nor tedious to lay but a
little in at ones / for the labour and cost is dowble recompensyd ye shall
understand that all manner of waters which be dystylled in glasses be the
best Next unto them those which be dystylled in erthen vessels and be well
ledyd with erthen pannis under helmets above as the potters full well can make.
After tyne helmets above and leden pannes under / After that leden helmets and
pannys / as I have scene occupy in howsys of relygyon at Straesborowe in hye
Almayn / whereas they made their fire with wode / but it was very small for
scare of meltynge of their leden pan which stood upon syfted ashes an hand
full hye and not in sand / After that copper helmets ouertinne within / After
that brasone helmets but always the copperen helmets be to fear / and specyally
the brason helmets / for two manner of causes / the first is the water that in
them is dystylled comunly borneth and smells of the fire / and hath a reed
colour like wine that is dede in him self. The second cawse is. for the
copper and brass hath always a manner of a gout palsy pendynge unto him more
than any other metal which gives occasyon that every one should thereof
beware / as Christophorus de honestis testyfyeth super Antydotacio mesue,

How you shall dystylle in general each according to his nature. Ca.xix.
TO all manner of people that will occupy and use the act or science of
dystyllacyon it is right needful for them to know when they will dystylle
ought what manner of way is most conueniet therefore / to the entet that it less
not his strength goodness of cople^yo proptye but that it be the bet^ draw
brought i to the water as far as it is possible couenyet for it is not
possible that ^ ^nybody l^ynge sholbe bring all thi^es to purpose after his
mind will: ^ent only God that hath created heuyn earth / and all things that
is there in There fore it is to be regardyd that all ^aner of flowrys and
blossoms whereof is but little to get / and is very scarce / is most
convenient to be dystylled in Alembyk or Alembicum of glass in bal^e^ Marie /
and in none other vessel.

Also your flowers or blossoms that ye will dystylle / must be plucked when
they be fully ripe / but yet or they fall / or fade her colour / or than they
marde and de^resse / and they shall be laid soft and light in the glass / as I
rehearse to you be fore in the.xiii. chapytre in Balneo Marie / or in the.xiiii.
chapytre in Vetre equino / And when that water is clean dystylled / it is
rectyfyed after ward in the son / as to you more plainly shall be showed here
after in the.xxi. chapytre. But when ye will have the water more stroger and
better / tha ye must take the flowers that the water is dystylled of / and put
them in a glass named Circulatoriu^ as before is showed in the.xi. chapytre* And
cast upon them the same water dystylled of the same and self flowers / than
stop the glass again surely / and set it in pure horse donge a.xiiii. days
nyghtes or more. or in Balneo Marie.ii. or.iii. days and nyghtes. and let it
so dylgest in him self / Than put it again in the first glass / and dystylle
it ones again in Balneo Marie / and the oftener that ye so do the purer and
more nobler and excelenter it will be in strength and virtue.

If you will dystylle herbs they shall be gadered in season convenient or ever
the seues fade or change their natural colour. Also they shall not be gadered
when they be wet with rain / but when they be dry in sayre weder and clear /
as ^po^tas and Auycenna testyfyeth*

In the third part of this book I will show to you the time and season when all
the herbs should be dystylled that in this book shall be specyfyed. Ye shall
sttope the herbs an leues frome their stelys and stalkys / and chop them
small / and than ye shall chop the stelts and sta^kes by them self also / than
ye shall put them again together with their herbys or levies / and ye shall put it
tha in a glass or helmet / and so dystyll it in vetre equ^no / or i sinere / when
it is so distilled thrughe helmet or glass / than it shall be rectyfyed as I
shall show you here after in the.xxi. chapytre. Ye shall understand that to
dystyll herbs or flowers willing thereof to have the sent and odor of the
herbs or flowers that it is dystylled of / the distillacio thereof shall be
ordered in two or three manners of ways. The fy^s^ is ordered and dystylled in
ventre equino / or in balneo marie / so that the water be no hot but that you
may suffer your finger therein. Another manner / pour the water already dystylled
upon the said herbs again / or else putryfye it or it be dystylled as before
is showed you of the flowers in this present chapytre / The herbs and the
(...) may commonly suffer stronger fire than the flowers wherefore they may be
dystylled in vetre equino / which is half a degre hoter tha in balneo marie /
and ashes more hotes the sand ^est. When ye will distil any rotes they must be
gadred in the houdes days / or in diebus canicularibus / that is in the
canykeler days when the leues begin to fall. The rotes must be washed clean
/ and the water dried of again / and so chopped small and broken than put in a
pan / or in a glass / and so dystylle it thrugh an helm or glass / as before
is rehearsed. The fourth manner when ye will dystylle any superfluytees of
fowls or bestes / as eggs / blode / liver / longues / cowtorde / or any such
that is thycke of substance / ye shall chop them small and dystylle them in
ventre equino and not well stopped for else the water becomes stinkyng / but
if it do become stynkyng / ye shall it dystylle again in balneo marie / for
cowtorde water of the first dystyllacyon is seldom without stynche / but
melke or honey / may be stopped and at the first time well dystylled. The.v.
who so desires to distil water of flesh / he shall kill it be it best or
foul / or else worowe it that no blode issue frome him / after that and if it
have any fat or grese take it away than take the flesh chopped it small
dystylle it in ventre equino with soft fire / to the intent that the water do
not stink or smelle of the fire / for suddenly thereof comes a great stench /
wherefore all such waters may be.ii. dystylled for therewith it is greatly
amedyd. Also when ye will dystylle any fruits as plommes / peers / apples /
slone / meddlers / nuts and such like. They shall be gadered when they be
fully ripe / or ever they fall wax soft / and they shall be chopped small and
stamped than shall it be stylled in an helmer in the sand with so soft fire
that it do not borne / and than it shall be ^^tyfyed as I shall show to you in
the next chapytre following. Item ye shall understand that all manner of herbs
/ flou^res / fruits / or rotes / that ye will dystyl^ most conuenyently ought
to be gadered in the cressynge of the moan / when it is fair weder / acordynge
as the time requires / than they shall be sayre washed and well pycked form
all vnclenesse / and than shall they laid a dryenge a ^le day / and than it
shall be chopped and dystylled as before is specyfyed.

How ye shall dystylle make waters of dry herbs / flowers / and rotes / when
the grene can not be gotten. Ca.xx.
IT fortunes sometime that ye have no dystylled water / nor none can get in
no place when ye behove it thrughe forgetfulness of the time that is past when
they should be dystylled / or else thrughe great hete and drowghte by th^
which the herbs and flowers be been and wytherd or through great rain or
superfluyte of wettnes / thrugh the which the herbs and flowers be marde and
rotten / and also thr water there of dystylled shall have little strength or
none.

Therefore it is necessary to you for to know how ye shall dystylle waters of
dry herbys / flowers / or rotes / such as ye shall behove / how be it / it were
more profytable and better of the grene herbys if it were possible to get
them. But if it fortuned that ye should dystylle the dry herbs c. Ye shall
every year in the moneth^ of may before the son rysynge when it is fair
weder / and hath not ray^ed by night / ye shall take a fair white lynen clothe
sprede a broad / trailed or drawn over the gras in a fair less or gardyn where
as many fair herbs and flowers stand growing / The same less or gardyn
where as ye do this in / ought not to stand on a morysshe or watery ground /
nor in deep valleys / but upon hye groudes as ny as it is possible / and than
shall this clothe be wrounge out in a glass / and than do so again as oft till
ye have ynought This dew must be thryse dystyllyd in balneo Mary / and
rectyfyed as it here after shall be declared in the next chaptre following.
and so keep that water from year to year / than if ye list to dystylle within
the year any dry herbs / than take such herbs as is dried in the shadow as
much as ye will having his natural sent and odo^/and cast upon it three times
of the fornamede water of dew so much that at every time the herbs be
covered Tha put it in a glass and s^oppe it well / and so put it in horse
douge.ii. or.iii. days and nyghts After that dystylle it i balneo mary three
times steped / and at every time again dystylled / but Albucasis wrytyth i
libro Servitor that upon every poude of dry flowers or herbs shall be
powered.x. poude of common water and so dystyllyd in an helmet / the which is
not so good as the water before said / For I have rede of an old erperte
philosopher a doctor i medecin / that would that the may dew should be.ix.
times distilled i balneo marie that the herbs be gaderd i the somer i a dew
seaso / they shall be clean pycked the leues stryped from the stalkys or stelys /
laid in a shadowy place on dryeng so that they may keep their savour. Take as
much of these herbs as ye w^l and cast thereon three times as much as the for
named may dew / ix. times dystyllyd dystyll that three times over / as before
is specified / and that water is better than the water dystylled of grene
herbs / because that only the flegma of the grene herbs is dystylled. And
said that the may dew that hath ben.ix. times dystylled draws the might and
strength to him wards likewise as aqua vite / or other dystylled wine doth.
Therefore it were good that every water should be cast upon his own feces / that
is upon his own herbs where as it had ben stylled of / and is putryfyed and
again dystylled / but yet it ware much better / that ye should power that
water of such like herbs before dried and that so distyled and than as I have
written before it to be putryfyed in a circulatorium / or in a blind helmet /
named in latin alebicus cecus / which is before figured in the.ix. chapytre /
and so dystylled / it gets great goodness and stregnth.

How ye shall rectyfye your waters after they have ben dystyllyd. Ca.xxi.
NOw after the dystyllynge of the waters it is needful that they be rectyfyed
/ to the intent that the fire be drawn out of them / and the flegmatyke
nature and complexion be temperated / And also that they may the longer
continue without marrynge / which is often done thrughe the he^e of the son
/ when the waters be put in to a glass the two parts thereof fyllyd and well
stoppyd with ledder and that well surely bound / The third part of the
glass shall be set in fine sand and so in the son thr space of six weeks
in the canicula^e days / or after as the weder is temperate / for the same
becomes very hot for to rectyfye the waters from the superfluytees of their
moystures / likewise the waters of fyry nature that be dystylled of spices
first steped in aquavite a certain while / their superfluytes of colera is
nedfull to be tempered of the fire comple^cyo. For thrugh the great hete and
drowght / the complexyon of man is often marred and destroyed / be pendynge
thereto of some manner of gowres. such like waters be rectyfyed thus. The glass
shall be fast stopped as before is said and the two parts thereof shall be set
in wet or moist sand in a cellarx the space of a month or more / or less as
the water requires. Or else dig a hole in the ground of a moist cellar /
and set it more than the two parts therein / and so let it stand as before
said / for there with the fyry complexio is expressly mynysshed. Also it
fortunes often times when two manner of waters be myxed to gyder / that they
become troblous incontinent and white like milk / as when ye put old waters
in to new / therefore ye shall myxe in two or three pound of waters. vi.
or.viii. drops of good white wine vynegre / Than the trouble some of the
waters draws to the botton and becomes fair and clear.

How and where the dystylled waters owght to be kept. Ca. xxii
IT is necessary and profitable to know how and inwhat manner the dystylled
waters shall be kept to the intent that they may the longer abide in their
goodness / and be preserved frome their hynderaunces. First when the dystylled
waters be better dystylled as before is spececifyed / tha it is nedfull for you
to have stonen pots with small neckys or pure fyoles with small mouths well
washed / specyally with the powder of the herb named parytaria well my^ed
with the wat of it or ashes of the same herb so clesed as if they were new /
those vessels always well stopped with a woden stopell or else stoppels made of
the two parts of waxce / one part of rosell / torpentyn / and fine powder of
tyle stones of each one part and a half / all those myxed to gyder and molten
on the fire but they may not sethe / and when it is cold make thereof their
stoppelys / and above that ye shall bind ledder very just and close / to the
intent that the water keep his nature and strength / tha ye shall write about
the vessel the name of your water / and the time of his destyllacyon* Than
shall your vessel be it pot or glass be set in a cellar / to the inteut
that it do not frese / for when any dystylled waters been frozen they less
their might / strength / and changes nature / so that ye must pour them out
or cast them away Also when any water is set in a hot stew in the witer it
becomes rede / and his power and strength is mynysshed / therwr it shall be
set in a conuenyet place that is another to hot / to cold / nor to moist / to
the intent that it abide the longer in virtue strength withouten hynderaunce or
perysshynge.

Here after follows how loge ye may keep your dystylled waters and when they
must be poured or cast away. Capitulum..xxiii.
When the waters be dystylled / rectyfyed / stopped and kept in a couenyent
place / yet it is good and convenient to know and understand how lunge those
waters may continue in goodness / and when ye shall cast them away / how be it
that the book of Nicolao de Atomatibus shows that commonly every water ought
to be renewed ones i a year where with he means that they ca abide but one year
in their goodness / which can not be true / for it may not be nor is not of
necessyte for these causes following. First that the herbs / flowers / rotes
/ or fruit ben not yearly to be dystylled / as I have showed to you in the.ix.
chapytre before / in the begynnyuge of the.xxi. chapytre. The secunde when they
be well rectyfyed in the son. The third when they be well stop^bed and kept
in a conuenyet place. The fourth when they ben every year ones set in the
son the space of forty days or more. The fyfte if need require every year
ones ye shall streyne your water thrught a woollen sack that so the feces be
divided frome the pure water.

The syxte that the water be renewed toward the end of the year / as I shall
show you more expressly. The seventh the waters that be distilled continue
lodger than the waters that be brened / for the clear and subtle parts be
divided frome the gross superfluytes. for the dysserence between dystylled
waters and btened waters is this the one is ordered with fire / and the other
mother manners The.viii. all manner of waters that be dystylled of dry and hot
herbs continue longer than the waters that be dystylled of cold / moist / or
flymy herbs or rotes. The.ix. some waters Being a year old or above / do
alter or change their coplexyon with mynysshyng of their venymous cold or
hete. Therefore in breue se^ence. I shall show toyow how lunge the dystylled
waters may be kept as ne'er as god thereto will give me grace / for it is right
dyffycyll for any erthli creature to have thereof vnderstondyng / wherefore I
call to god for help / for the parfyt knowelege thereof is only in him / and
in none other without him / wherefore it is very necessary to you for to write
the time of their breuynges or dystyllacyons.

How lunge the waters may be kept in substance.
First every manner of water is to be kept a year / when it is b^ennyd /
dystylled / and kept as before is showed. But when the waters ben not close
truly stopped / than shall they be cast out be fore the year / likewise all
manner of water dystylled of be^es / of fowls or other worms that bears life
may scantely continue a year. Secodarely all manner of water dystilled of
flowers / as malow flowers / borage flowers / blew flower deluce / been flowers
/ blew viollettes may flowers named ^lium conuallium i latin / white lille
flowers water when they be diligently kept as be fore is specyfyed they
continue frome the one year to the other / If that they in the second year be
rectyfyed in the son or dystylled per fylttum or poured thrughe the woollen
sack as I have showed you before / they abide good unto the end of the second
year / but than they shall be cast out Rede rose water dureth unto the end of
the third year if it be well kepke / and every year rectyfyed / but in the
third year it is more comfortatyfe than colynge or styptyke / white rose water
may endure two year if it be well kept and rectyfyed / wild rose water
enoureth two year in great operation and virtue for to cole if it be well kept
but in the third year this colynge / is sore mynysshed / and is good for
comfortatyues wherefore it is not to be kept over the third year and it must ke
every year rectyfyed / as before is specyfyed. Also the water of Nenufar a
flower which is growing in the ryuers having a great round grene lefe / which
flowers be sometime yelowe / sometime white / and when the flowers fall the sede
of them is closed in a round botton like a small gored / or an vrynall / may
endere in his cold operation to the fourth year / the first year to be laid
without upon the dysseases / for it is half poison or venym thrughe his graet
coldness or stupefactyfe / the second year it may be used withn the body for to
cole In the third year his colynge is temperate / and in the end of the
third year it shall be cast out / but it must be well kept and rectyfyed as
before is specyfyed. Of the same nature be rede roses growing in the corn / so
is popy flower water.

Secodaryly al flowers water of hot herbs / as camomell flowers / centory
flowers / Archangell flowers / dyll flowers / yelow violettis / wild tasey
flowers / laueder flowers rosemary flowers mayocayn flowers / sage floweres
sayn^ Iohns wort flowers / all these waters may be kept unto the end of the
thyrd^ year / if they be duly tedyd rectyfyed as before is specified / but the
waters that (...) not so hot in their operation / they may be kept unto the
end of the second yer^ as: wild peruynke flowers / quices flowers / flores
tilii / peche flowers / slone flowers / whyt lylle flowers / all these water^
shall be cast out in the eude of the second^ year.

Of the water of leues
The third / all such waters that be dystylled of leues of trees / as of
byrche ^uas / wyld {per}uynke leues / beche leues / O^ leues / yuy leues asshen
leues / leues of a^nus / vine leues / leues of fusamus / leues of thamariscus /
sauen leues / every water of leues may be kept unto the beginning of the third
year / if they be truly dystylled rectyfyed / and well stopped set in a place
convenient.

Water of fruits or beryes.
The fourth al manner of waters distilled / as of holme beryes in latin viscus
wild brable beryes / grene benes / benis shales / great platayn sede /
strawberyes plomes or damsens / gordes / black and rede cherries / ducks meat
named ^enticula aque vel letigo in latin / grene wall nut^e shells /
capernoyles that somemen callth tod stoles / wild or tame apples wild peers.
And commonly all manner of waters dystylled of fruits may be kept a year or
more if they be well ordered as before is said.

Water of common hete
The.v. of the herbs that be not to hot not to moysty / nor very hot nor
very they / as Sorrel water. Endyue water / (...) steal water / Borage water /
Cress water / water of Prunella / water of barba hircyna / water of Arthemesia
/ water of cu^ or rubea / water of Centum morbia / water of Sratu celle or penny
wort / water of treyfels / water of apium dome sti^um / water of cokowpyntell
or aaron water of yacea or herba rauellata / water of our lady thystel / water
of synkfoyl fenel water / water of herb robert or herba toberti in latin /
yarowe water / water of grownde yuy / water of fumytorye water of Consolida
media / liver wort water / Chervell / water of cards / louage water
leuisticum in latin / water of rauda equina / water of lattis / liver wort
water / water of may de we / night shade water / persely water / parseneps
water / water of Dandelyo / Dandelyo stalk water / tansey water / water of
herba Pa^alisis / water of Saxifrage / water of Scabyous / Celandyn water water
of Cetum nodia / water of Mary goldes. These waters endure in virtue and
strength frome the be^ynnynge of the first year to the end of the second year
/ when they be kept as before is specyfyed.

Of colynge waters.
THe.vi. of waters of herbs / being very cold / as Mandrake hen qual /
procelayne / housleke / ducks meat copy herb / Crassula minor / hemloke
vellicuta in latin. These waters and such like may be kept from the first
year to the end of the third year / if they be ordered in all things as
before is specifyed but for the outward parts they ben in their cold
operation of great virtue and strength / for in the first year they be so cold
stupefactyfe / that they take away the feeling of man / In the second year
they be meetly temperate (...) their colynge therefore they shall not in the
first and second year be used with in the body and some shall never be used in
the body alone / but only to be laid without.

Of the hot and dry herbs of nature
THe seueth / the waters of herbs that be hot and dry of nature / as (...)
hound or marubium in latin / Scabworte or enula campana in latin Horse mynte
or mentastrum in latin Agrunonie pulegium / bastlicon / cardo benedicta /
Centorye / camomel / archagell / Dylle b^ennyng nettles / herba veronica /
gamandre / Tanacetum agreste hoppes / hertes tongue / mirica / ve^bena / Isope
/ lauendre / mayolayne / menta / apium / melyssa / saluia or sage / Aristologia
longa or smerwort / wild time or our lady bedstraw / wyldtreyfle / ruta or
the saint Iohns wort / rosmary / saponarya daysy or consolida minor in latin /
pypola / water of those herbs and such like may be kept to the end of the
third year. When they be ordered and kept as before plainly is showed

Of waters of moysty nature.
The.viii. waters of rotes which be gross / moysty and slimy of nature / as
borage rotes / perseneps rotes / rotes of cardo benedictus / fenell rotes /
persely rotes / rotes of hermodactilus / Radyce / rapes / walworte rotes /
rotes of white lylles / totes of sigsllum salamonis, the waters these rotes
such like may be kept fro the one year unto the other / when it is ordered as
before is specyfyed.

Of rotes waters that be hot of nature
The waters dystylled of rotes of hot and dry nature / be / as rotes of enula
capana / totes of angelica / rotes of pynpinell / rotes of blew flower deluse
/ rotes of valeriaen / rotes of nettles / rotes of yelow lylles / rotes of
spargus / rotes of asaca alba / or assa dulets / or such like / they may be
kept frome the beginning of the first year unto the end of the second year
/ if they be duly tendyd as before is rehersyd.

Of all such waters that be dystylled / of bestes / fowls / vermyn or wormys.
The.x. such waters as water of pies Ducks / greps blode / got bockis blode.
blode of an ass / yolks of eggs / white of eggs / antes or pysiner eggs /
frogs / hens / hennys mawes / capons / row creme cow dounge / calves
blode / flies / mannis dounge / ox blode / swynes blode / storkys snayls /
These waters such like may be kept / frome the one year to the other year /
if it be ordered and kept as before is said / but that may not be failed. honey
water may be kept.v. or syx years if it be every year ones rectyfyed in the
son.

NOw will I write to you with brefe sentence of all manner of waters in general /
as of herbs / rotes / flowers / sruytes / leues / other things before
rehearsed. How lunge these waters may be well kept to the intent that all
those that reduced this book may have the better vnderstadynge of such thing as
before is not rehearsed. Therefore ye shall understand that all manner of herbs
that be cold or moist / or slymy / or fat thycke substance may dure from the
one year to the other / except these that be cold in the.iiii degre they may
be kept longer as I shall show more plainly to you in the end of this chapytre
/ like wise all flowers that be fat / moist / and thycke of substauncs be
kept in the same manner. Also all blossoms that be thynne / substyll / dry / or
hot of substance may be kept from the beginning of the one year to the end
of the other year. But all waters of herbs that be hot of complexyon. the
inclynnyg to bytternes with dry thynne subtle steles leues dry flowers /
thyse may be kept from the first year / in to a part of the third year. Al
fat / slymy / moist cotes that be of a gross cold substance may be kept
from the beginning of the year almost to the end of that same year. All manner
of waters of cotes that be hot / dry / subtle / thynne of substance / may be
kept frome the first year in to the beginning of the third year. All waters
of bestes and such like / as before is spoke of / cold and moist of nature /
or gross fat of substance / may be kept well nyghe from the begynnyge of
the year unto the end / but waters of blode may continue a year full. All
waters of scuytes cold / moyste / and slymy / of substance myxed with sorenes
or sweetness / may be kept frome the one year in to the other. But all
waters of hot fruits of small thynne substance / inclynyng them unto a dry
and bitter complexyon / may be kept from the beginning of the one year unto
the end of the other. But all manner of herbs / flowers / rotes / sedys / ^
that be deyed of wet in wine and therewith dystylled / rectyfyed / close
stoppyd / and kept in a convenient place may continue.ir. or three times as
lunge or lodger. when ye kept your waters so loge that ye think that their
strength will perysshe than ye may renew them in this manner. In the next year
or they perysshe take of every ^e water of what nature so ever it be / the
third {per}te of as much herbs / rotes / flowers or fruits / that be fresshe
grene / stamped steped welked in balneo marie.iii. or.iiii. times well stopped
in a blind helmet that hath no pipe or ell^s in a glass named circulatorin as
here is figured / or in horse douge.iii. or four days.

After that dystylled well rectified in the son as I have showed to you before
than may it continue his hole time as it might do at his first dystyllacyon /
and this may be twice done and no more In the which I have found great virtue
/ But evil it is to know the fading of the waters and to know the dew time
when it shall be po^ed out cast away / except ye know the time when it was
dystylled. Never the less I shall show you a {per}te thereof / how it may be
done in v. (...) manners. First by the smell as these waters following / rose
water / water of myntes / melisse water / may flower water named lilium
conualium in latin camomell flower water / ysope water / lavender water /
rosemarye water / may^ lain water / fenel water / such like waters. If they be
distilled in balneo marie or with a soft cole fire than well stoppyd / so they
kept their sent / when ye mark expressly mynysshed fades op is holly gone
/ than ye ought to cast the out Secondarely / If the herbs have not sent nor
favour that the water is dystyllyd of / than ye shall take the water and hold
your fyole or glass of a great hight pour out a {per}te of that water / if it
spin ^e tha like a thread / it ought not to be occupied / but cast away / for
tha it hath no virtue. The third manner / ye shall let a drop of your
dystylled water upon the nails of your thombe / if it tonne not quickly of tha
cast it away. The fourth manner / when there drive fe^s in the botto of your
glass like clouds divided like flocks of snow cast it out for it is nought.
The.v. manner is when the water is of a reed colour smells ill / than cast it
out incontynete / or it were able to do more harm than good

Thus ends the first book of the dystyllacyon.
Here after follows the registre of the table of the second book of the
herbs / to find the waters against all manner of sekenesses and infytmytees.
Item this present table is dyuyded in.xxxi. {per}tes wherein ye shall find
remedies against al manner of dysseases or infyrmytees coming or failing unto
makynde frome the heed unto the fete.

THe first {per}te shows with what manner of waters the health of man is to be

THere ends the table the regystre of the same book
The prologue of this present book of dystyllacyon.
IN the name of the holy trynyte / the fader / the son / the holy goost* here
begins the book of these present operacyons / as of the virtue / strength /
goodness of the dystylled waters / or deyned against al manner of sekenesses and
dysseases compiled and gadered to gyder for the common people that have no
physycyons nor can get no medycynall substances for lack of money / that
they be not able to paye for it. All such to confort and supportacyon of their
infyrmytees / till that they may get an expert and learned physician / or
maystar in medycyn / to whom the sekenes or dysseases be well be known / also
the complexyons of the dysseased bodies / whether they come of hete / of
drowght / of moystour / or of coldness The which is far from the knowledge of
the onlerned people. Also if the people can get no physycyons nor medicyns /
yet I will show some manner of ways to be help thrughe the experience that I
have found by vsynge of the waters / which is another heavy nor shadefull to be
mynystred / for they have not the appendynge gowtes of laxatyfe medycyns or
reseptes / like wise the substances of there corpus be not mynistred in the
body / but only thrugh a lovely fair manner well pleasing to the pacyent / as I
have showed before in the.ii. chapytre of the first book / but much better it
were and more {pro}fytable to follow the learned medycynes or physycyos when they
may be got O good lord how oft have I scene an onlerned physycion mynystre
his medicines that knew nor dysseases nor yet the complexyo but ministered hete
to hete / thrugh the which the natural moistour was spent / and the body
dried away consumed or moystour to moystour / thrugh the which the body cotted
away / or cold / by the which the natural hete that should preserve the life
of man is hole my nyssed and brought to nought / for the holy prohphet Iob
saith that the life of man is plated for to dye a natural death with out any
payne / if he may attain his natural life unto the death / the which may so
well come to purpose / by an expert learned master or physician. Wherefore I
marvel for that any wise person of vnderstondynge / can find in his heart to
give himself to fowlyshly over into the handys of any such onlerned master /
that knows another begynynge / myddest / nor end of medicynes not complexyos.
Thus I counsel you and instantly require you / that ye cast not away
ignorately the pcyous yuwell of your naturallyfe / that almighty god had
created planted in you naturally to be kept with such graces as he thereto had
given you / therewith to be preserved.

/ therefore when it is written marubiu alone without more / thereby ye shall mark
the female / yet they be both good / for the male is mynystered unto the men /
and the female unto the women. And it must be dystylled with his substance /
as rote / steal and herb / chopped to gyder and dystylled in the end of the
may. A The same water drunken.ii. or.iii. days at morning at night / at each
time an ounce or an ounce and a half / helps the that have the cowghe B The
