Prohemye
Great thankynges lawed honour we merytoryously ben bound to yield and offer
unto wryters of hystoryes / which gretely have prouffyted our mortal lyf /
that show unto the reders and herers by the ensamples of things passyd / what
thing is to be desired / And what is to be eschewed / For those things which
our progenytours by the taste of bytternes and experiment of great Ieopardyes
have enseygned / admonested and informed us excluded fro such peryllys / to
know what is prouffytable to our lyf / and acceptable / and what is
vnprouffytable and to be refused / He is / and ever hath ben reputed the wisest
/ which by the experience of adverse fortune hath byholden and seen the noble
Cites / manners / and variaut conditions of the people of many diverse Regyons
/ For in him is presupposed the lore of wisdom and polycye / by the
experiment of Ieopardyes and peryllys which have grown of folly in diverse
parties and contrayes / yet he is more fortunate / and may be reputed as wise /
if he give attendance without tastynge of the storms of aduersyte that may
by the redyng of histories conteynyng diverse customs Conditions / laws /
Acts of sondry nations come unto the knowleche of and understanding of the
same wysedom and polycye / In which hystoryes so wreton in large and aourned
volumes / he sitting in his chambre or study / may rede / know and
understand the polytyke and noble acts of alle the world as of one Cite /
And the conflyctes / errors. Troubles / vexacions done in the said vnyuersal
world / In such wise as he had ben and seen them. in the propre places where
as they were done / For certain it is a greet beneurte unto a man that can be
reformed by other and strange men hurts and scathes / And by the same to
know / what is requysyte and prouffytable for his lyf / And eschew such
errors and Inconuenytys / by which other men have ben hurt and lost their
felycyte / Therefore the couseylles of Auncyent and white heeryd men / in whom
old age hath engendryd wisdom / ben gretely praised of younger men / And yet
hystoryes so much more excelle them / As the dyuturnyte or length of time
Includes moo ensamples of things and laudable acts. than thage of one man
may suffyse to see / Histories ought not only to be Judged most proffytable to
yonge men / which by the lecture / redyng understanding make them semblable
equale to men of greater age / and to old men / to whom lunge lyf hath
mynystred experymentes of diverse things / but also thystoryes able make right
pryuate men digne worthy to have the gouernauce of Em^yte^ ^ noble Royammes /
histories moeue and withdraw Emperors and kings fro vycious tyranny / Fro
vecordyous slouthe / unto triumph and victory in puissant batailles /
Histories also have moeued right noble knights to deserve eternal laud which
follows them for their victorious merytes / And cause them more valyantly to
entre in Ieopardyes of batayles for the defence and tuition of their country /
and publyke wele / hystorye also affrayeth cruel tyrauntys for dread of Infamy
and shame Infynyte / by cause of the detestable acts of such cruel personnes
ben oftymes plantyd and regystred in Cronykes unto their perpetuel obprobrye
and dyuulgacion of their Infamy / As thactes of new and such other / Truly
many of hye and couragyous men of great empryse / desyryng their fame to be
perpetuelly conseruyd by liberal monumentis / which ben the permanente
records of every vyrtuouse and noble Act / have builded and edified real and
noble Cites / And for the conseruacion of the wele publycke have mynystred and
established discrete and prouffytable laws / And thus the pryncipal laud /
and cause of delectable and amiable things / in which man felycyte
stondeth and rests ought and may well be attributed to hystoryes / which
word history may be descryued thus / History is a perpetuel conseruatryce of
thoos things / that have be done before this present time / and also a
cotydyan wytnesse of bienfayttes of malefaytes / great Acts / and tryumphal
vyctoryes of all manner peple. And also if the terryble feigned Fables of Poets
have much styred and moeued men to pity / and conseruynge of Justice / How
much more is to be supposed / that History assertryce of veryte / and as
moder of alle philosophy / moeuynge our manners to virtue / reforms and
reconcyleth ner hand alle thoos men / which thurgh the Infyrmyte of our
mortal nature hath led the most part of their lyf in Ocyosyte and
myspended their time passed right soon out of Remembrance / Of which lyf
and death is egal oblyuyon /

The fruits of virtue ben Inmortall / Specyally wh^nne they ben wrapped in the
benefyce of hystoryes /

Thenne it must follow / that it is most fair to men Mortalle to suffer
labours and payne / for glory and fame Inmortalle / Hercules when he lived
suffryd greet labours and peryllys wylfully putting him self in many terryble
and ferdful ieop^rdyes to obtain of all peple the benefaytes of Inmortal laud
renommee / We rede of other noble men / sum lords sum other of lower
astates reputed as gods in diverse regyons / the whose famous acts / and
excellent virtues only hystorye hath preseruyd fro perysshyng in eternal
memory / Other monymentes distributed in diverse changes / enduren but for a
short time or season / But the virtue of history dyffused spr^dd by the
vnyuersal world hath time / which consumes all oth^r things as
conseruatryce and kepar of her werke /

Ferthermore eloquence is so precious and noble / that al most no thing can
be founden more precious than it / By Eloquence the greeks ben preferryd in
contynu^l honour to fore the rude barbares / Orators and learned clerks in
like wise excelle vnl^rn^d and brutyssh peple / Sith this eloquence is such
that causes men emonge them self sum texcelle other / after the qualyte of
t^e virtue and eloquence by seyn to be of val^w / For sum we Jug to be good
men digne of laud / which show to us the way of virtue / and other have
taken another way for tenflamm^ more the courages of men by fables of poesye /
than to prouffy^e And by the laws and Institutes more to punysshe than to
tech So that of thyse things the vtylyte is myxt with harm / For sum
sothly techyth to lye / But history representynge the things like unto the
words / enbraceth al vtylyte prouff^ It shows honest / and makes vices
detestable / It enhaunce^h noble men and depresseth wicked men and fools /
Also things that history deseryueth by experience / much prouffyten unto a
ryghtful lif / Thenne sith history is so precious also prouffytable / I have
delivered to write two books notable / retenyng in them many noble histories
/ as the lives / miracles / passyons and death of diverse holy sayntes which
shall be comprysed by thayde and suffraunce of almighty god in one of them /
which is named legenda aurea / that is the golden legend / And that other
book is named polycronycon / in which book ben comprised briefly many
wonderful historyees / First the descripcion of the universal world / as w^l in
length as in breed with the diuisios of coutrees royames empyres / the noble
cites / hye moutayns famous ryuers / merueylles wondres / also the historial
^ctes woderful deeds sith the first making of heaven earth unto the beginning of
the regne of king edward the fourth / unto the year of our lord M / CCCClx. As
by thayde of almighty god shall follow al a lunge / after the composynge
gaderynge of dan Ranulph monk of chestre first auctour of this book / and
afterward englisshed by one Treuisa vycarye of barkley / which att request of
one Sir thomas lord barkley translated this said book / the bible bartylmew de
proprietatibus reru out of latin in to englyssh / And now at this time symply
emprynted set in form by me William Caxton and a little embelysshed fro
tholde making / and also have added such stories as I could find fro the end
that the said Ranulph finished his book which was the year of our
lord.M.CCClvij unto the year of the same MCCCClx / which ben an honderd three
year / which werke I have finysshed under the noble protection of my most dr^d
naturel and sovereign lord and most christen king / king Edward the fourth /
humbly beseeching his most noble grace to pardon me if any thing be said
therynne of Ignorauce / or other wise than it ought to be^ And also requyryng
al other to amend where as there is defaute / Wherein he or they may deserve
thank meryte / And I shall pray for them that so do / For I knowleche mine
Ignorance and also symplenes / And if there be thing that may please or
prouffite any man / I am glad that I have achieved it / And following this my
prohemye I shall set a table shortly towchyd of the most part of this book /
And where the said Auctor hath alle his werke in seven books / I have set
that which I have added to a^ter a part. and have marked it the last book /
and have made chapytres acordyng to the other werke / Of which accomplysshyng
/ I thank Almighty God To whom be given Honour / laud / and glory / in
secula seculorum Amen /

Sith the time that the great and high tour of babilone was bylded ^en have
spoken with diverse tongues / In such wise that diverse men be strange (...)
other and understood not others speech / Speech is not known but if it be
learned comyn lernyng of speech is by hering^ so always he that is deef is always
dombe for he may not here speech for to / learn / So men of fer countrees and
lands that have diverse speeches / yef neither of hem have learned others
langage / nether of hem wot what other means / though they mete and have great
need of information and of loor of talking and of speech be the need never so
great neither of hem vnderstondeth others speech no more than / gaglinge of
gees For Jangle that one never so fast that other is never the wiser though he
shrew him in stead of good morow^ This is a great meschyef. that folo^eth now
mankynde / But god of his mercy and grace hath ordained double remedy / One is
that sum ma lerneth and knows many diverse speeches / And so between strange
men of the which neither understands others speche^ Such a man may be mene
an^ tell either what other wole mene^ That ot^er remedy is that one langage
is learned. used. and known in many nations and lands. And so latin is learned
known and used specially on this half greece in alle the nations and lands of
Europe / Therefore clerks of her godnes and curtosye make and written their books
in latyn^ For her writing and books should be understand in diverse nations
and lands And so Ranulphus monk of C^estre wrote in latin his books. of
Cronykes that descryueth the world about in length and in bre^de / And makes
mention and mind of doings and deeds of meruaylles of wondres^ and rekeneth
the years to his last days / fro the first making of heaven and of earth And so
therinne is great and noble Information and loore to hem that can therinne rede
and understand Therefore I would have these books of Cronykes / translated out
of Latin in to English for the moo men should hem understand and have thereof
conyng Information and loore The Clerk These books of Cronykes ben written in
latin / And latin is used and vnderstanden on this half greece in alle the
nations and lands of Europa And comynly English. is not so wide vnderstonde
used no known And thenglysshe transl^cion should noman understand but Englyssh
men allon / Thenne how should the moo men vnderstonde the Cronykes though they
were translated out ^f latin that is so / wide used and known / in to
English that is not (...) known but of englyssh men allon The lord This
question and doubt is easy to assaylle For if these cronykes were translated
out of latin in to Englyssh / thenne by that so many the moo men should
understand hem / as vnderstonde English and no latin The clerk Ye cunne
speak rede and understand latin. thenne it needs not to have such an
englyssh translacion The lord. I deny this argument For though I can speak
rede and understand latyn^ there is much latin in these books of Cronykes
that I can not vnderstonde / nether thou without studyeng auisement and looking
of other books. Also though it were not needful for me / it is needful for
other men that vnderstonde no latin The clerk Men that vnderstonde no latin
may learn and understand The lord Not alle For sum may not for other manner
besynesse / Sum for eld Sum for defaute of wit Sum for defaute of
catell other of friends to find hem to scole / And sum for other diverse
defautes and lets The Clerk Hit needs not that alle such know the
Cronykes / The lord Speak not to straightly of thing that needs For straightly to
speak of thing that needs / only thing that is and may not faylle needs to
be. And so it needs that God be / for god is and may not faylle / And so for
to speak noman needs for to know the cronykes / ffor it might and may be that
noman hem knoweth^ Otherwise to speak of thing that nedeth^ somewhat needs for
to sustain or to have other things thereby / And so mete and drink needs for
keeping and susteynaunce of lyf. And so for to speak no man needs for to know
the cronykes^ But in the thyrdd manner to speak of thing that needs / alle
that is prouffytable needs / and so for to speak alle men need to know the
Cronykes Tle clerk Thenne they that understand no latin may axe and be
informed and y taught of hem that understand latin The lord^ Thou spekest
wonderly for the lewd man wot not what he should axe / and namely of loore of
deeds that come never in his mind ner wot of whom comynly he should axe / Also
not all men that vnderstade latin have such books teforme lewd men also some
connen not sum may not have while / so it needs to have an english
translacion The clerk The latin is both good and fair / therefore it needs not
to have an englyssh translacion The lord This reason is worthy to be plunged in
a pludde and led in powder of lewdness and of shame / It might well be that thou
make only in mirth and in game. The Clerk The reason must stand but it be
assoylled^ The lord A bleere eyed man but he were al blind of wytt might see
the Solucion of this reason / And though he were blind he might grope the
solucion / But if his feeling him faylled^ For if this reason were ought worth
/ by such manner arguing me might preue that the three score and ten
Interpreters and aquila Symachus Theodocion and Origenes were lewdly occupied
when they translated holy writ out of hebrewe in to grue also that saint
Iherome was lewdly occupied when he translated holy writ out of hebrewe in
to latin / For the Ebrewe is both good. and fair and y writ by Inspyracion
of the holy gost And alle these for her translacions ben hyely praised of al
holy chirche Thenne the forsayde lewd reason is worthy to be powdred^ leyed a
water and y soused Also holy writ in latin is boothe good and fair / And yet
for to make a sermon of holy writ al in latin to men that can English and
no latin / it were a lewd dede / for they be never the wiser / For the latin
but it be told hem in English what it is to mene / And it may not be^ told
in englyssh what the latin is to mene without translacion out of latin in to
English / Thenne it needs to have an english translacion / and for to keep
it in mind that it be not foryeten it* is better that such a translacion be
made and written. than said and not written / and so this foresaid lewd reason
should meue no^an that hath any wit to leave the making of English
translacion The Clerk A greeet del of these books stondeth much by holy
writ. by holy doctors and by philosophye^ thenne these books should not be
translated in to English The lord It is wonder that thou make so febel
arguments and hast goon so lunge to scole / Aristotles books and other books
also of logyk and of philosophy were translated out of grue in to latin /
Also att prayeng of king Charles Iohan Scot translated denys books out of
grue in to latin. and thene out of latin in to ffrensshe. thenne what hath
English trespaced that it might not be translated in to English Also king
Alurede that founded the vnyuersyte of Oxenford translated the best laws in to
English tongue / And a greet del of the Sawter out of latin in to English /
And caused wyrefrith bishop of wyrcetre to traslate saint gregoryes books.
the dialogues out of latin in to Saxons Also Cedmon of whythy was enspyred of
the holy goste and made wonder Poysyes in englisshe nyghe of alle the stories
of holy writ Also the holy man beda translated saint Iohns gospel out of
latin in to Englisshe Also thou wotest where the Apocalips is written in the
walls and roof of a chapel both in latin and in Frensshe Also the gospel and
prophecy and the right feith of holy chirche must be taught and prechd to
Englisshe men that conn no latin Thenne the gospel prophecy the right feith
of holy Chirche must be told hem in english / that is not don but by Englissh
tralsacon for such englissh prechyng is very traslacon / such englisshe
prechyng is good needful. thene englissh traslacion is good and needful. The
clerk / if a translacion were made that might be amended in any point / Sum
men it wold blame The lord / If men blame that is not worthy to be blamed /
thenne they ben to blame / Clerks know well ynowgh that no sinful man doth so
well that it no might do better. no make so good a translacion that he no
might be better^ Therefore Origenes made two translacions / And Ierome
translated thryes the sawter / I desire not translacion of these the best that
might be for that were an idle desire for any man that is now alive / But I
wold have a skylfull translacion that might be know and vnderstonden The Clerk
Whether is you lever have a translacion of these Cro^ykrs in Rhyme or in prose
The lord In prose For communly prose is moore clear than rhyme. more easy and
more plain to know and understand The Clerk Thenne god grance us grace
grathly to gynne / wit wisdom wisely to worche Might and mind of right
menynge to make. translacion trusty and true. Plesyng to the Trynyte three
persons and one god in mageste^ that ever was and ever shall be and made heaven
and earth and light for to shyne / And departed light and derknes. And callid
light day and derknes night / and so was made euetyde and morrow tide one day /
that had no morowtyde The second day he made the firmament between waters And
departed waters that were under the firmamente^ fro the wat^s that were above
the firmament: And called the firmament heaven / the third day he gadred watres
that ben under the firmament in to one place and made the earth vnheled^ and
named the gadryng of waters Sees and dry earth land / And made trees gras The
fourth day he made son and Moan and st^rres / and set hem in the
firmament of heuene there for to shyne and to be tokenes and signs to depart
times and years night and day The fyfthe day he^ made fowls and birds in
thayer and fish in the Water The sixth day he made beestes of the land and
man of the earth and put hem in paradys for he shulde wyrche and won therinne
/ But man brake gods hest and fylle in to sin and was put out of paradys
in to wo sorrow worthy to be dampned to the peyne of hell without any end /
But the holy Trynyte had mercy of man / And the fader sent the soon / And the
holy gost a light on a maid. And the soon toke fflesshe and blood of that
blysful maid and deyde on the Rode to save mankynde / and aroos the third day
glorious and blysful. and taught his disciplis / and ascended in to heaven when
it was time / And shall come att day of dome and deem quycke and dede / Thenne
alle tho that ben writon in the book of lyf shall wend with him in to the
bliss of heaven. and ben there in body and soul / and see and know his
godhede and manhede in Joy without any ende^

I pray you / who should know Emperors wonders of the Philosophers or else

Seneca in^ his Epistles had written his deeds / writing of Poets is more

Thenne specyall lords that knew mine entente / And had desire to know greet

leese up the eres after his Ryp men / He said noman shall wrath the^ ^ And to
his rypmen he said / If she will with you Ripe / forbede you her not / And
her for to leese or gleyne noman shall let. The Poet also Mantuanus Marro
Virgilius saith eth libro decimo / And Oracins as saith Hugucio Pisanus in
dininaciouibus suis Capitulo peruiso When Enemies despised Oracius and bare him
on honde that he had taken sum of Homeres versis^ and meddled among his and
called him a gader^ of old wrytynges^ He answered and said it were right

that noman blame me / though I fare as sonde and ashes. For though they be dim
and foul hem self. they cleanse other things and make shyne full bright. And
many other things that have not in hem self / yet yeuen to other. So says the
Poet Satiricus I fare as a whestone that makes iron sharpe and kene. Item
Gregorius in suo Pastorali saith / I have peynted a well fair man / And am my

of in his Omelye / that wit virtues and strength / that vncunnyng de nyeth /

ANd for as much as this Cronyke conteyneth berynges and deeds of many times /
therefore I clepe it Policronicon that is the Cronyke of many times / In the
which^ werk by the ensample of the first wercher that wrought alle his werkes
in six days and / rested in the seventh. For his doing is our doctrine. This
werke I depart and del in seven books / The first book descryueth places
contreyes and lands and alle the wide world The other six books by the nombre
of the six ages that conteyneth beryng and deeds from the beginning of the
world unto our time Netheles in the first book of this werke as who descryueth
general comyn and special / mappa mudi is portrayed and peynted therinne^
which is the cloth that the shappe of the wide world is painted Inn Thenne in
his chyef parties the world is deled And for this story is travailed by cause
of brytayne every prouynce and land is descryued until we come to brytayne
last of alle as most special And therein ben contained fyften chapytres
needful to the knouleche of the Ilonde of Brytayne as though it were an
Inbryngynge to gretter knowleche in other books that follows / that who that
may not come to fulle knowleche of the full storye may by such forledynge have
liking to leave shrewdnes and sin The second book auentureth for to tell
beryng and deeds with destripcion of the lass world And for the ages of the
world be not al euene and of beryng and of deeds and eueery book is even and
conteynth like Therefore the second book conteyneth the berynge and deeds of
the four ages fro the making of our formest fader to thebrennyng of the
temple of the Iewes. The thyrdde book from the transmygracion of the pepole to
the coming of Criste / The fourth fro Criste to the coming of the saxones /
The fyfthe from the Saxones to the danes / The sixth from the danes to the
Normans / The seventh from the Normans to our time that is under the regne of
king Edward the thyrdde after the conquest / And so by the prophecy of ysaye
this great story is departed in seven stremes so that both hosed and shooed
gods peple may pass thereby

TO hem that wole have full knowleche of historyes^ it needs eygthe things to
know descrypcions of places / states of things / distynction of times after
following of kingdoms / dyuersyte of living / passing of ages / Manner of doyng
in alle these very acountyng of years. The first of these shall be remembryd in
the first book^ And the other in the other books shall be openly wreton /
Touching the second take heed of two estates / One fro the beginning of the
world to Criste^ and that is called the state of mysgoyng. The second state fro
Criste to the worlds end. And that is named the state of grace and of mercy /
For the thyrdde take heed of three times / One to fore the law wreton^ the
second in the time of law wreton^ And the thyrdde under the new law of
Criste of which law is under grace and mercy / ffor the fourth take heed
that sometime there were four pryncipal Kingdoms / that is to wet of the
assyryens / Perces / Greeks and Romayns / Netheles touching the course of the
world and the process of holy writ the first Kingdom was under our
forfaders fro Adam to Moyses. The second fro moyses to saul. The thyrdde under
kings fro Saul to Zorobabel / The fourth under Bisshoppes fro Zorobabel to
Criste / For the fyfthe take heed of five manners of living / The first was in
the first age under the law of kind comyn to alle men. the second in the
second age was the living of mysbyleuyd men / when mawmetrye began in Nynus
time king of Nynyue. the thyrdde in the thyrdde age under the law wreton /
when circusicon law departed the children of israel fro laws and mysbyleued
men / The fourth living of Christen men bigan under Criste. when bileue and
grace of Sacrament halowed her self. The fyfte living of Sarasyns began under
macho mete as it shall be said in the fyfte book / and after the time of
heraclius the emperor openly showed / ffor the sixthe take heed of sex ages /
One is fro Adam to No. The second fro No to Abraham / The thyrdde fro
Abrahain to Dauid / The fourth fro dauid to the transmygracion that was when
Israhel was brought in to thraldom of Babilone / The fyfthe fro the
transmygracion to Crist. The sixthe fro Crist to the worlds end / And here
take heed that ages of the world ben not delid by evenness of years / but by
merueylles that byfelle in her beginning / as the first age began fro the
beginning of the world / The second from Noes flood / The thyrdde fro the
Circumsicion. The fourth fro the beginning of kings / the fyfte from the
transmygracion^ The sixthe fro thyncarnacion of Crist / For the seventh take
heed of seven persones^ whose deeds ben wreton in storyes^ that is to were King
in his Royamme / Knight in bataylle / Jug in plee. bishop in Clergye lauful
men in the peple / Husbonde in hows. Relygyous man in the chirche. Of the
which spryngeth out seven famous doings. Buyldyng of Cytees^ Victory of
enemies Making of lawes^ Correction of trespass / help of the comyn prouffyt^
Governing of meyne and of household / Getyng of blifful mede^ In the which
blazes and shines rewarding of good men and punysshyng of evil men / For the
eyghte / take heed of echt diverse manner of acountyng of years / Three the
Iewes use. three the Greeks / One the Romayns / And the Christen men ove / ffor
the Iewes in tretys^ and covenants have a year vsual^ And begins in
Ianyuer^ In devotion and sacryfyce they have a year lawful and begins in
marche / Also they have a year of apperyng that they use in Calculyng and in
Cronyke / And begins in May when they passed out of Egypt. Also the
greeks in three manner wise acount^n their years First for Joy of the victory
they acounte her years fro the taking of Troye. Afterward they acounte her by
olympiades that ben the times of their Ioustes and tournementes / But after
that they regned they acounted their yere^ by her regnyng in this manner Anno
Regni Grecorum quinto vel tercio tali vel tali sicut patet in libro Machabeorum
/ when the Romayns waxed in her flowers they acounted her years fro the
buyldyng of the Cite ab vrbe condita^ But Christen men fro the Incarnacion of
Criste acouten her years / But when me comes to that place men must take heed
/ that the Calculyng of denys that englond and F^aunce folowen hath lass by
xxij year than the calculyng of Iherome that follows the Gospel / willelmus
Malmesburyensis bbro.4^ de pont saith that marianus scotus. and the monk

score / / xvj. looked bysyly in books acounted and fond that dyonisyus exiguus
acordeth not with the gospel in acountyng of yeres^ ffor this Scot marianus
acouted alle the years from the beginning of the world and put to xxii year
that lacked of denys acountes. And wrote a great cronyke and an huge / the
which book Robert bishop of herforde deflored. and that for it is that the
comyn Cronikes that foloweden denys failed al daye^ ffor I^erome in
translatyng the cronyke of Eusebij say^h that years lack between Cristes
passion and vaspasianus tyme^ And also.xij. years lack about decius cezars
time as it is showed in the / vj^ age / This error bifalleth for days and
months were vnrekened that kings regned over full years. Also days and
months that voided between two kings were forgoten. wherefore in this book I
shall mark as I may how and what years such defawtes fylle / So that I shall
hyghte the margyns by the hedes of the histories sum wych double and sum
with treble rows of years. ffrom Abraham to the cite y buyld^ I set to

De prouyncijs orbis / Et primo de Paradiso. Capitulum decimum
FOr the knowleche of erthly paradyse / three points must be known / wherefore
three questions must be axed^ the first question axes if any such place is on
earth / The second axes whytherward^ and where is paradyse in earth. the
third axes what country and place is paradyse in erthe^ ffor the first four
manner witnessis we have that paradyse is in earth / ffyrst stories that likened
Sodome er it were ouertourned to paradyse^ The second witness is of hem that
assayed^ wrote and said that they had seen that place / The thyrdde wytnes /
ben the four Ryuers that rennen out of paradise. ffor the heed of thylke
ryuers ben not founden in see no in ffresshe water ner in land that men dwell
Inn though Kings of Egypt and many other travailed well oft and sought there
after. Therefore Ysid ^xiij. eth^ saith that Iherom toke heed that other
vnderstondyng byhoueth of the Ryuers of paradyse than Auctours written. Also
Basilius in exam^ron / ysid eth libro xiiij. and Iosephus libro primo sayen
that waters falling of the highest hylle of paradyse maken a great pond / and
out of that pond / as it were a well the four Ryuers spryngen / Petrus
capitulo 14 / Of the which four Ryuers the first is physon / And is to menyng
full wexynge of plente / That River physon passes in to Inde and draws with
him golden grauel^ Phison hath another name^ and is called ganges of a King of
Inde. which was named Gangarius. But Ganges is to say. Felawship and
Company. For it receives t^n great Ryuers that rennen thereto / The second is
called / Gyon and Nylus also. And goth about Ethiopia and Egypt The thyrdde
is Tygris / And as Iosephus saith dyglath also that is to say sharpe. ffor it
is swyfte as Tygris which is a right swyft beeste. And Tygris passes toward
Assyria that land / Ysidorus libro tercis decimo^ The most certain Auctour
Salustius saith that there comes a well out of Cerannes the hills of Armenye
and spryngeth out of the foot of the hylle that is called Cancasus. And that
well is the heed of tweyne Ryuers^ of Tygris of Eufrates. the which two
Ryuers sometime ben^ departed a sonder and sometime medlid to gyders. and of^e
time they ben swolowed in to the earth / And after spryngen up again. And lunge
after goon about. Mesopotonya that land / and dounward in to the reed Se^e.
R. And though men rede in books that Nylus comes out of Paradyse / Yet sum
men affermen and say that Nylus spryngeth in the west side of the land of
Ethiopia not fe^ fro the hylle that is named Athlas / And gooth about Ethiopia
and dounward by Egypt / Seche the proprete of Nylus in the Chapytre Egiptus^
The fourth witness and proof that such a place is in Earth that is called
Paradyse^ is old Fame and lunge durynge^ ffor men shall bileue old fame that is
not withseyde^ But Fame of Paradyse hath endured without gaynsayeng six
thousand year and more. For fro the beginning of the world unto our days it
hath endured. And Fame that is falls endures not so lunge. ffor it falls out
of mind or is dispreuyd by Sothnes known / Of the second question that Axes
in which side of the world and in what place paradyse should be^ Though that
short wytted men and lytil of assay say that paradyse is lunge sayllyng out
of the earth that men dwell Inn^^ And also departed from the earth. and is as
high as the moan / it is not to be bileued^ ffor nature and reason both
withsaye it / ffor if paradys were departed atwynne fro the earth that men
dwell Inne^ no water no ever might bear such a burden / also the fuyer
occupies alle the myddel space between thayer the moan / thenne paradyse is
not there^ ffor thenne nothing might live therinne / also if paradyse were so
hyghe^ sometime it should take a way the light and make eclipse of the moan. but
of such an eclipse herd we never Also if paradyse were so high departed a
sonder from every land earth. how shulde the four Ryuers that spryngen out of
paradyse pass by the air and the wide see and come in to lands that men
dwell Inn / And if men say that paradyse is so high that in one place it
contynueth to the earth that men dwell June / Thenne the earth is enlong not
round al about as wise men descryuen hit^ but that may not stonde^ For it is
know by experience and assay that in every eclipse of the moan the earth
makes a round shield / Therefore the earth with alle his parties must needs be
rounde^ And so wise men conclude that paradyse is in the vttermest ends of the
eest. and that it is a great country of the earth no lass than Inde or Egypt
/ and a large place and couenable for al mankynde to dwell Inne^ if mankynde
had not synned. Of the thyrdde that axes of paradyse what manner place it should
be. ysid saith / libro 14 / ca / 3o. / that this name paradis y turned out of
grue in to latin is as much to say as an orchard but paradise in hebrew is
called ede that is to say lykynge^ The which tweyne y put to gyder makes an
Orchard of liking.R. no wonder^ ffor in that place is all thing that acordeth
to lyf^ Ysid libro quarto decimo / There is helthe for the ever is attemperat
neither to hot no to cold so that nothing that lives may they therinne.
that withnessith Enok and hely that yet ben there a lyue^ Iohannes damascenus

saith that the water of the great flood comes not in paradyse Though sum men
say that paradyse is high as the moan / that is not soth in words and in
dede but that speech is saved by an excusation of speaking that is called
yperbolyca / So that they that speken would mene that paradyse in height
passes alle other lands / Treuisa / So we praise an erthly man Iordan or
Iohan^ and say that he was the best man that ever was. and yet he was never so
good as criste^ So in words that / subtle men well dyuyne the menyng is true
good / but alas as ysidorus saith libro nono. capitulo primo Our way to
paradyse is fast stopped by cause of the sin of our forn fader / hit is
closed al about with a brennyng wall so that the brennyng thereof arecheth to
heaven. as sum men would wene paradyse is closed with that wall to hold out
mankynde / angels stonden / on that wall to keep well paradys that none evil

De palacijs Rome
THere were many palayces ryal and noble y build in Rome in worship of
Emperors and of other noble men also Among the which the grettest and most
palace of alle was in the myddel of the cite in toke of one principalite of all
the world wide / Also the palace of pees^ therein Romulus died do set his own
image of gold and said / hit shall never fall till a maid bear a child / And
that image fylle when Criste was born / Dioclisians palace hath pylers as high
an a stone caste / and so great about that an c men al a year worchyng should
vnneth hew one of thylk pylers. Also there was a palace of sixty emperours^
yet stondeth a part thereof. that al Rome may not destroy / De templis There as
pantheon the temple of all mawmetrye was is now a chirche of alle halowen And
by cause our lady is after Criste is chyef and holiest of alle mankynde / that
chirche hath the name of our lady. and is called sancta maria rotunda that is
the round chirche of our lady. And hath in breed the space of / ij / C^lx^
foot / Fast by that temple is an Arch of Marble. And that is the Arch of
Augustus Cesars victories and great deeds / In that Arch ben alle his great
Acts descryued There is also Scipions Arche^ he overcome hauibal. Att saint
steven in piscina was the temple olouitreum that was made of crystal of gold.
there was Astronomye y graven and y peynted with sterres and signs of heuene
saint sebastian destroyed that temple^ Also the capitol was arrayed with glass
and with gold as it were the myrour of alle the world about / There the
consuls senators governed and rewlid alle the world as much as was in her
power / And there was Iupyters temple. And in that temple was Iupyters image of
fyn gold syttyng in a trone. R Here takehedr that only three temples were in
Rome that had flamynes. that were bisshops to serve / falls gods and mametrye
and highte flamynes as it were filamynes of filo that is a thread that they
bond about her heed. when they might not in the holy day suffer on her
pylyons and her caps for hete / In Iupyters temple served fflamen dialis that
is the day bisshop^ For Iupyter was cleped diespyter / that is the fader of the
day. Also in Mars temple was flamen Marcialis / that is mars bishop And in
Romulus temple was Flamen quyrinalis that is quirinus bisshop^ For Romulus was
called quyrinus also De domibus In rome was an hows y made well nyghe al of gold
lefette ^ with precious stones / Men said that / that hows was worth well nygh
the thyrdde part of of al the world / In that hows every lond and prouynce had
an image y set by Necromancy. Eueryche of thylke images bare his own lands
name wreton an on his breast. And a cokerbelle of silver honged about his
neck. So that if any lond rebelled or aroose ayenst Rome / Anon the Image of
that land torn his back toward the image of Rome and the belle about his
neck should ring / And the preestes that kept that hows / eueryche by his
course. warned the princes of that doing / there was also an horsman of bras on
high on the coppe of that house and meued also with a sphere in his hond^ and
turned the point of his sphere toward that lond that wold so arryse^ And so
the Romayns might lightly come upon their enemies vnware In that hows also was
a fire that no man might quench. And men axed of the crafts man that made it^
how lunge it should endure^ And he answered and fayde hit should endure for
evermore unto. that a maid had born a child / the same night that Criste was
born that^ hows fylle down. and the fire was quenchyd that same night and time
Also beaneus appollo that man closed a confeccion of brymston and of blak salt
in a vessel of brass. and set it a fire with a candel that he had halewed in
his manere^ and made there a bath with bathing places that al way were hoot /
There was also in an hows an image of iron. and was named Bellefrontes image /
which weighed fifteen M pound with his horse that he sat on And hinge in the air
with no post no piler bynethe under set / no hold with cheyne above but
adamant stones that were in the vawte and in^ the Arches about drowhe even
the iron eueryche to his side so that the iron image might not dounward no
upward no toward neither side but hinge always even a mydde / De Artificijs.
There is a^ place in Rome in Eraclea and is called theatrum^ that is a place to
stoned or sit Inn / for to loke well about / there in is wonderly graven
cabans and dens. diverse outgoynges benches and sedges al aboute^ and is whole
and sound al on marbel stone^ this werk is set vppn vj crabs y hew of hard

another man / But alle that he saith be herd al about / Fast by Augustus
Cezars palace is awalle made of brent tile / And stretches dounward out of
the high hills by the yate port asmaria. that wall is made upon great Arches
and huge that wall stretches a days Journey from Rome in a great conduit vpan
that wall the watres and stremes of the wells of the montaynes rennen in to
Rome^ And thenne it is departed in dyuse conduytes pipes of bras. so ran
sometime in to every palace of Rome / For the water of tiber is hoolsom and good
for horse / And vnhelsome and evil for men / therefore the old Romayns made
fresshe water come out of four parts of the cite by weyes craftily made /
thereof men might take al that they wold while the comings of rome were in her
flowers. By that wall is the bath. that bianeus made of the which bath was
spoken to fore. In Albisterio a place that hight mutatorium Cezaris were made
white stoles for emperors / Also there was a candelstyk made of a stone that
higthe Albeston. when it was ones yteyned and set a fire and y set without
there could noman quench it with no craft that men could deuyse / R In this
manner it might be that the geant pallas about the year of our lord a thousand
and fourty^ that yer was found in Rome a geants body buried hool and sound /
the space of his woude was four foot lunge and an half^ The length of his
body passed the heygthe of the walls. at his heed was y found a lantern
brennyng always that noman could quench with blast no with water no with other
craft / unto the time that there was made a lytil whole under the light /
bynethe that the air might entre. Men seyen that Turnus slowghe this geant
Pallas when eneas fought for lauina that was Eneas wyf. This / geantes
epytaphium is this the wrytyng of mind of him that lay there was this Pallas
euanders soon lies here^ him turnus the knight with his sphere slowhe in his
manner De statuis et signis There was at Rome a bulle^ of bras in the shap of
Iupiter overcast and shape to men that looked thereon. That bull seemed lowhyng
and startelyng^ There was also the image of venns al naked in the same manner as
venus shewde her self to that man Paris sometime of troye / and was so craftily
made that in the mouth and lips that were as white as any snow seemed fresshe
blood and new. there is also at Rome a wonder copped pyler and is Romulus
Piler. that pyler pylgryms and palmers that fast can^ lye call hit saint
Peters corn hupple and sayen that when nero the emperor had rauisshed it hit
torn in to an hylle of stone. as great as it was byfore of corn / Emonge
alle pilers Iulius cezars pyler is most wonderful / and hath in heyghte two
honderd and fyfty foot. In the coppe thereof in a round thing of bras ben Iulius
cezars bones and ashes / Of that pyler and arch ben verses y. made that ben
thus to menynge and namely of the ouermest stone / if the stone is one. tell
what craft brought him upon. And if they be many stones. tell where they
ioynen at ones^ This arch and pyler is y founded and set upon four lyons /
pylgryms full of lesynges / call this arch and pyler saint Peters nelde and
lye and say that thylk man is clean of sin that may crepe under that stone^
there ben also in Rome two great horses of marbel stone / For in Tiberius time
two yonge philosophers praxitellus Fibia / come to Rome and yeden al naked. And
when the emperor axed him why and wherefore they went so naked / they answered.
and said. For we have forsaken al thing. And for al thing is to us naked and
bare and openly known. ye sir Emperor and alle that thou spekest in counseyl
and pryuete we know att best / Treuisa the first point of this doyng and
answer teaches that who that forsakes / al thing forsakes his clothes^ And
so it follows that they that ben well clothed and goth about and beggeth and
gadreth money corn and catel of other men forsakes not al thing R The emperor
assayed and fond soth al that they said. and at her owen prayer / made in
mind of hem two great horses of marbel^ there is another sign and token
byfore the popes palace an horse of bras and a man sitting thereon And holds
this righthonde as though he spake to the peple and holds his bridle in his
lift honde and hath a cucko between his horse here's. And a seek dwerf under his
feet Pylgrymes clepen that man. Theodoricus And the comyns call him
Constantinus / But Clerks of^ the court call him Marcus and quintus cursius
also^ this sign stood sometime to fore in piters awlter^ In the Capitoyl upon
the four pilers of bras / but saint gregory threw down horse man set him to
fore the popes palace / They that call him marcus tell this reason skylle There
was a dwarf of the kynred of mesenis his craft was Nygromancie when he had
subdued kings that dwelled nygh him and made him subgette to him. Thenne he
went to Rome to war with the Romaynes / And with his crafte^ he bynam the
romayns power* might for to smite. biseged hem long time y closed within the
cite / This dwerf went every day tofore the soune rising in to the field for
to do his craft: when the romayns had espied that manner doyng of the dwarf
they spak to marcus a noble knight bihighte him lordship of the Cite. a
Memorial in mind for evermore if be would deffende^ hem save the Cite / thene
Marcus made an hool thurgh the wall longer it were day for to abide his craft
to cache this dwerf^ And when it was time the cucko sang and warned him / of
the day Thenne marcus raised to. by cause he myghtnot hit the dwerf with
wepen he caught him with his honde / and bare him in to the cite / And for
dread lest he should help him self with his craft if he might speak. he
threw him under the horse feet / And the horse alto trade him / And herfore that
/ image was made in remembrance of this dede / They that call that image and
sign quintus cursius tell this skylle and reason / there was sometime in the
myddel of Rome a great clyfte or whole in the earth out of that hool come
smook brymstone slew many men^ thenne Quintus cursius toke counseyl of phebus
and armed hym^ and entered in to the hool^ thenne anon fleygh a cuckou out of
the hool^ thenne the earth closed to gyder and so the hool was stopped. Another
sign is colloseus image that is called also the image of the son or of Rome
/ There is great wonder how it might be yoten or arered / the image is so great
the length thereof is six score foot and six. this image was sometime in the
ybond herodius fyften foot heygher than the heyghest place in rome. this image
bare in his right honde a sphere al round y shape as the world^ And in his lift
hond a swerd that bytokeneth might of batayll^ in token that it is lass
maystrye to win to conquer than it is to keep and to save that / that is
conquered and won. this image was of bras but it was so ryally ouergylt that
it shone in derknes and yaf great bemes of light^ Also it meued about with the
son in such a manner that always his face was toward the son. Alle the
Romayns that come thereby worshipped that image in token of subjection of
thraldom Saint gregory destroyed that image with fire ffor he might not
destroy it with strength / Of that image is only y left the heed and the
right hond holding the sphere / that is the Roundenes the likeness of the world.
For of al that image left nomore vnbrente that heed and that honde ben now to
fore the popes palace upon / ij / pylers of marble^ woderly by craft of milting
that bras was y yoten / that the here seems soft to a man sight. and the
mouth as though it were speaking Polier / ^bro secundo / For to highte the
noblete of this Cite the Romayns made a woman's image in bras^ ^hat image h^ld
in (...) honde a sphere the shape of the wide world / And when t^e image was
full made him seemed that the legs were to feeble for to bear such an image.
hit was so great and so huge. But the crafts man that hit made answered and
said / the legs shall dure always and ^ere the image at the best and never
fayll unto a maid bear a child / but the legs failed and the image fylle
down when Criste was born / Fast by vaspasianus palais is a stone that is

hasty and her bodies passen the comyn stature of other men But it is fouden by
assay that as the gally ben more hasty than strong in the first refe or

ben like alps in gretenes of body so they be somewhat like to the snow that

by gyleful wiles of wymmen / And English men seyn that gurmundus wan Irlond
and made thylke dyches / and make no mention of Turgesius / And yrysshe men
speak of Turgesius / And know not of gurmundus. therefore is to wet that
gurmundus had won britain and dwelled therinne / And sent Turgesius with

was Capytayn and leder of that viage and journey and seen emonge them therefore

vncouerd the well wold rise and drown al the land: so it happed that a woman
went to that well for to fetch water And hied her fast to her child that
wept in the cradbe and left the well vncouerd / than the well sprang so
fast that it drowned the woman and her child and made al the country a lake

HCre Graldus makes mind that as men of this nation ben more angry than other
men and more hasty for to take wretch while they ben alive. So seyntes and
halowes of this land ben more wrecheful than sayn^es of other lands / Clerks
of this land ben chaste and sayen many prayers and don great abstynence a day
and drynketh al night. So that it is acounted for a miracle / that lecherye
regneth not there as wine regneth^ And they that ben evil of them ben worst of
all other / so good men among them though they be but few ben good att best
/ Prelates of that country ben full slow in correction of trespaas and besym
contemplation and not in prechyng of gods worde^ Therefore it is that alle the
sayntes of that lond. ben confessors no martyr emonge them and no wonder. For
alle the prelates of this land ben chosen out of abbayes in to the clerg^e /
And don as monks sholde^ what Clerks and prelates shulde do is to them
vnknowen^ therefore when it was put ayenste the bishop of Cassil how it might be
that so many sayntes ben in Irlond never a martyr among hem alle sith that the
men ben so shreud and so angry / and the prelates so recheles and slow in
correction of trespaas / the bishop answered frowardly ynowgh and said our men
ben shrewd and angry ynowgh to hem self. but to gods seruautes they ^eye
never honde / but do to hem great reverence and worship^ But English men come
in to this land that can make martres and were wont to use that craft / R The
bishop said so by cause that king harry the second was tho new come in to
Irlond fresshly after the marterdom of saint thomas of Counterbury / Gir^ in
this lond in wales and in scotland ben belles and staves with crooked heeds and
other such things for relyquyes in great reverence worship / So that men of
this land dreden more for to swear upon any of thylke belles gold staves than
upon the gospel^ The chyef of all such relyquyes is y hold Ihesus staf^ that

De wallia
Now this book takes on honde
Wales to fore englond
So take I my tales /
And wend in to wales /
To that noble blood
Of priamus blood
Knowleche for to win.
Of great Iupiters kin
For to have in mind
Dardanus kind
In thyse four titles I fond
To tell thestate of that land
Cause of the man I shall tell
And then preyse the lond well
Then I shall write with my pene
Alle the manners of the men
Thenne I shall fond
To tell merueilles of the land
Of the name how it is named wales
Wales now is called wallia
And sometime it heet cambria
For camber brutes soon
Was prince there did won
Thenne wallia was to mene /
For gwalaes the queen
King ebrancus child
was wedded thither mild
And of that lord gwalon
withdraws of the soun
And put to / l^ i^ a
And thou shalt find wallia /
And though this land
Be much less than englond
As good glebe is one as other
In the daughter as in the moder
Of the commodytees of the lond of wales
Though that lond be luyte.
It is full of corn of fruit
And hath great plente ywys
Of flesh eke of fysshe
Of beestes tame wild
Of horse sheep oxen mild
Good land for alle seeds /
For corn gras herbs yt spredes
There ben wodes medes /
Herbs flowers there spredes
There ben rivers wells
Valeys also hills
Valeys bring forth flood
And hills metals good
Cool grows under land
And gras above att honde
There lyme is copious
And slattes for hows.
Honey milk white /
There is deynte not lyte
Of braket methe and ale
Is great plente in that vale
And all that needs to the live
That land brings forth ryue.
But of great riches to be draw
And close many in short saw
Hit is a corner small
As though god first of al

To be selere of al heal
Wales is deled by /
A water that heet twy /
Northwales from the southe /
Twy delith in places full couth.
The southe heet demecia
And the other venedocia /
The first shots arowes beres.
that other deleth al with spears.
In wales how it be
Were sometime courts three
At carmarthyn was that one
And that other was in moan
The third was in powysy
In pengwern yt now is shrousbury
There were bisshops seven
And now ben four euen^
Under saxons al att honde
Sometime under pinces of yt lad
Of manner rites of the walssmen
The manner living of yt londe^

In mete drink clothing
And many other doyng /
They be clothed wonder well
In a shirt in a mantel
A crisp breche well fain
Both in wind in rain.
In this clothing they be bold
Though the weder be right cold
Without sheets always
Evermore in this array
They goo fight pleye leap
Stoned sit lye sleep
Without surcot goun cote kirtell.
Without iope tabard cloc or bell /
without lace chaplet yt her laps
Without hod hat or cappes^
Thus araid goon ye segges
And always with bare legs
They keep none other going /
Though they mete with ye king
With arowes short spears
They fight with them yt he deres
They fight better if they neden
When they go tha when they ride
In stead of castle tour
They take wode mareis for so /
When they see it is to do cour /
In fighting they wol be a go^
Gildas says they ben varyable
In pees not stable
If men axe why it be
It is wonder for to see
Though men put out of land
To put out other wold fond
But al for nout at this stoned
For al many wodes be at grode
And upon the see among
Ben castles builded strong
The men may dure lunge un ete
And love well comune mete
They can ete ben mury /
Without great cury.
They ete breed cold hoot
Of barley of ote
Broad cakes round thynne
As well seems so great kin
Selde they ete breed of wheet
And selde they done ones ete
They have gruel to potage
And lekes kind to companage /
Also butter milk chese
Y shape enlong corner wese
Such messes they ete snel
And that makes he drink well
Methe ale that hath might
Thereon they spend day night
Ever the redder is the wyn.
They hold it the more fyn
When they drink att ale
They tell many a lewd tale
or when drink is an hodling
They ben full of Jangling /
Att mete and after eke
Her solace is salt and leke
The husbond in his wise
Tells that a great prise /
to yeue a caudron with gruele
To hem that sat on his meal
He deleth his mete at meal
And yeueth every man his del.
And alle the ouerpluse
He kepeth to his own use /
Therefore they have woo
And mishaps also
They ete hoot samon always /
All though phisik say nay
Her howses ben lowe with al
And made of yerdes small
Not as in citres nyhe /
But fer a sonder not to hihe
When al is eten at home /
Then to her neighbours will they

And then torn home a ye. rome
The lyf is idle that they leads
In brening sleping such deeds
Walsshmen use with her myght^
to wesshe their ghestes fret a nyt
If he wessh her feet al somme^
Then they know yt they be well
They live so esily in a rowte
That selde they bear purse about
At her breche out home come
They hong their money comb /
It is wonder they be so hende
And hate crak att nether ende^
And without any core^
Make their wardroppe att door
They have in great mangery /
harp tabor and pipe for mistralcie
They bear corps with sorrow gret^
and blow load horns of gheet
They praise fast troyan blode
For thereof come al her broad /
Neyh kin they will be
Though they passen an ^C / degre /
above other me they will he dit
worship prestes with her myt
As angels of heaven right

Oft giled was this brood
And yerned battle al for wode
For merlins {pro}phecie almyt
And oft for sortelegye.
Best in manners of britons.
For company of saxons
Ben torn to better right
That is known as clear as light
they tille gardins field dounes
And draw hem to god tounes
They ride armed as wole god
And goo y hosed y shood
And sat fair at her meal
And sleep in beds fair fele^
So they seem now in mind
More englissh than walssh kind
If men axe why they now do so
More than they woonte to do /
They lyuen in more pees
Because of their riches
For their catel should slake
If they used oft wrake
Dread of loss of her good
Make them now stylle of mode
Al in one it is brought
Have nothing dread nought /
The poet says a saw of preef /
the fotema sings to fore ye thef /
And is bolder on the way /

the first king of britons builded and edified this cite of London the first
cite of Britain in remembrance of the Cite of Troye that was destroyed And
calls it troyeneweth and trinouantum that is new troye Afterward king lord

that Normans called it Loudres and is named in latin Londonia / Rudhudibras
king leyles soon was the viij king of brytons He bylded Caunterbury the chyef

not the hot bathes no Iulius cezar died such. a dede / though Bladud bilded
and made the Cite But it acordeth better to kendly reason that the water runs
in the earth by veins of brymstone / and sulphure^ And so is kendely made

there ben hoot bathes that wasshe^h of tetres soores and skabbis Treuisa Though

that alcliud was a right strong cite as beda saith. that cite stondeth fast by

AFter that places and countrees be rekened and descryued of the world wide.
the ordre of the tale of the storye axes that beryng deeds of the world be
also descriued^ But every thing is for somewhat. and that is more^ Treuisa /
Here this auctoryte of the philosophre is to mene. that al thing that is
reasonable and kyndly ordained for another thing / as a mene for to come thereto
and for to save / It is ordeynyng for better thing and more noble than is that
thing that is so ordeynyng. therefore / eeryng^ and sowyng and dongyng of land^
is ordained for to have good corn / And good corn is better than al the other
deel Also medicine is ordained for heel / and heal is better than the medicine
/ Also mete and drink and other things be ordained for the lyf / And the lyf
is better and more noble than the mete and drink. and al other things that be
so ordained for the lyf R Than sith that the more world is made for the lass
as holy write says / The more shall serve the lasse^ and now the more world is
descryued in our foresawes in the first book. than is it skilful somdele to
descryue the lass world also. from the beginning of his forne dedes^ that it
might be know what manner thing it is. and how great / that is so little / and
doth so greet deeds. in the more world that is so great so huge / And also
the worcher and the maker of al things that hath with him shaply reasons of al
manner things. when he had made the more world than he made the lass / And
thaugh he made him lord of the great world. yet he prynted on him the likeness
of the great world for a man and the world be like in three things / In length
and breed in kyndly disposition and virtues worchyng

And first though the length of a man body that is from the soole of the
foot to the top of the heede^ be such six as the breed that is from the one
side of the ribs to the other side and ten so much as the depnesse that is
from the rigge to the womb Netheles Plenius libro / vij / ca / 18 / seith that
as much space as is bitwene cinct. that is the point that is in the firmament
even ayenste him in the other side of the earth so much is out of the eest in
to the west and so it is in the body of a man that as much as is from the
soole of the foot to the top of the heed / so much is between his twey
longest fyngres ends and he stretch out his arms and hands a brood Also
Plenius the right capo 17. Says that the stature the mesure of a child when he
is three year old is even half his mesure and his stature that he shall have when
he is of age. if he live so lo^g / the second as we see in the world so we see
in a man / that (...) members the parties helps and stands eueryche other
in ste^e and bynemeth his woo^ For the over lymmes governs a^d yeueth. the
neither lymmes bears and serves / the middle receives and deleth about the
other lymmes / And in the either world if a limb is out of his own place and
entered to another place / than in his own / anon is great distourbaunce made
as when the air is enclosed within the earth / than therth quakes / when
within the clouds than is greet thondryng Also in the body of a man when the
lymmes be writhed out of her own places / or if the humours be apayrede. than
is ache sekenesse and sorrow Also when the lymmes be well arrayed and as they
shulde be in shappe colour and hew manner quantite gretenesse and smallness
meuyng and place than hath the man good pees and quyete and is in good heal and
rest The contrary falls and the lymmes be evil and not ryghtly arrayed /
Therefore Plato yafe his dome said such ordenaunces disposition and shap as a
man hath in his kyndly members and lymmes^ such kyndly manners deeds he
foloweth^ also as it is in the parties of the great world that they be so
ordained. and y set that the highest of the neither kind touche the lowest
of the high kynde^ As oystres and shelfysshe that be as it were lowest in
beestes kind passes / but litil the perfection of lyf of trees and herbs.
For they may not meeue hem but as c^lpes of the See waggeth with the water else
they cleuen to the earth / and may neither see no here / taste no smelle but
only feel / when they be towched And the last of the earth touchethe lowest
of the water^ And the over most of the water touches the lowest of the ever
and so upward by degrees anon to the ouermost heaven Also the highest in bodyly
kind that may be cleped skylfully man body kyndly parfytly disposed
arecheth to the lowest of the next ouerkynde that is man soul that holds
the lowest degree of spyrytes and of goostes that have knowledge and
vnderstandyng^ And therefore it is cleped Oryson as it were the next narche in
kind between bodyly and goostly thynges^ By the soul me gooth up from the
lowest kind by degrees of knowleche and of conning anon to the ouermost
knowleche and understanding And when the soul is all cleene without erthly
liking it recheth otherwhyle to holy spirits that be nothing bodily also man
hath somewhat comyn with things that be parties of the great world ffor gregory
in an Omely saith that a man hath being with stones living with trees / herbs
/ feeling with beestes knowledge understanding with angelis. Also in means body
seems earth in flesh boones / water in blood in other humours / ever in the
lunges: fire in the heart: is called homo in latin antropos in grue. is as it
were a tree torn vpso dou hath an heed with here as it were a root hath arms
thyes as it were bows Touching the third likeness that is virtuous worchynge
we see as gregory saith in an Omelye of the aduent that the world was att
beginning thryuyng strong for to bring forth childer as it were in youth / was
full of heel so fressh grene by great riches it was fat / but now it is abated
with eld as it were driven toward the death with oft many diseases: So in a
man youth the body is thryuyng the breast is strong the nolle is bold /
the arms be full / But in his eld the stature bows croketh stonpeth a down
/ the bold nolle abates the breast is driven oft with many sighs soore^ the
breath shorteth in al the body might and strength abates And though there were
none other sekenesse in old men for the more del ^le is sekenesse Also as we
see that in the more world be two contrary moeuynges / One is kyndely^ by the
which the plants and nether welkens meoue out of the west in to the est.
That other is violet by the which they be y rauesshed ayeinwarde with the
moeuynge of the ouermooste welken or firmament out of the Eeste in to the
west So it fares in a man that the flesh coueyteth ayenste the spyryte ^
and the spyryte ayenst the flesh

For the nether knowleches and wits fight ayenste the reason And yet a man
hath comyn worchyng and suffering like to many other parties of the more world
For he is slow and heavy as the earth / and fleteth away as the water and
withdraws suddenly as the ever / and heteth as the ffyre* changes as the
moan / Fyghteth and sleeth as mars / covets as Marcurius: goth out of kind
as Iupiter / And is cruel as Saturnus Also plenius libro septimo^ capitulo
tricio Says that as the utter parties of the greet world wellith and spryngeth
full of miracles wonders meruaylles as in Inde / Ethiopia blew men lond and in
Affryca So in mankynd kind hath slyly craftily made woderful werkes mirth /
for first in a manes face there ben t^n lymes other few moo. there is so great
diursyte that among many thousand men vnnethe is one found in face like to
another. In affryca be many that have wi^chyng tongues so that things that they
preyse they shende slay with her praisynges / so that trees that they preysen
waxen dry childer they So in triuallis in Iliricis be men that slay with her
sight what they behold and loke on lunge namely and they be grieved / and wroth
while they loke so and bihold^ and these have in either eye twey blacks Also
among us varro saith kind hath y gendred brought forth venym in sum men
even so that none evil is found. that there nys somewhat lyche y found in
mankynde. So sum parties of a man body be forbyson and bodyng of wondres
so pirrus king of Epyrothes had a great too in his right foot / the touching of
that too was a good medicine ayenst venym / And that too might not be brent
with the other bodye^ when the other parties of his body was brent So
Auctours tell also Pli{us} li 7 ca^e 7 says that sum men be geten and born

/ that when the other del of the body was brent that boon might not brenne

boor in Archadia. The ^xij^ the beryng and holding up of heaven while Athlas the
geant rest him when he was weary

But in the thyrten dede he did on a corsette of dianier and dyed Here take
heed that these twelve deeds that be acompted to hercules sowneth the story as
it is told so doth the second of the lyon and the elleuenth of the boor /
owther it perteneth only to covering of thewes / and than the tale is a fable^
but the menynge is full of truth and of sothnesse / So the thyrdde of the
Arpyes and the fourth of taking and the rauesshynge of the golden apples /
Owther it tokeneth and sowneth the storye y meddled with a fable / so doth all
his other deeds of these twelve. Also here take heed / It seems that it is not
all one hercules that these twelve deeds be ascrybed to For saint Augustyne de
ciuitate dei li. octodecimo capitulo quarto decimo Says that it was another
hercules that these deeds be aretted vnto^ another hercules that overcome
antheus the geant in wrastlynge / And also Boecius in fine quarti libri de
consolacione tells that same of Antheus among the twelve deeds of hercules /
Also saint Augustyne vbi supra eciam capitulo 19 / Says that there were many
hercules And also sampson for his wonder strength / was acounted hercules. And
Frigius dares in his book of the battle of Troye says that Iason that wan the
golden flees at Colchos had a surname and was callid Hercules Therefore ouidius
meth terciodecimo saith Menia under fur^ and the Troyans under hercules / And
Ouidius octauo meth arretteth the sleyng of the boor of Archadia to meleandrus^
And also septimo meth he ascribeth the chasing of the Arpyes to Boreas sons
that heighten Zoas and Calaius^ therefore many wise men tellen that hercules is
the surname of noble men and stalworth that passes other men greetely in
boldness and in strength. and so it seems alle by kyndly menynge of that
name for hercules is said of heroes / that is a man and of cleos that is blis as
though hercules were to menyng a blysful man and glorious

IN Aioths time namely in greece fables were founden and me says that Isopus
found first fables for highte and enhance kyndly sothnesse^ for the pryuyte
of kind should not be despised / therefore kind of things and by divers manner
of doyng he feigned names and worchyng of gods Alcyn in mith And so he feigned
that after the flood men come of stones and of trees / but that was feigned for
the manner of dwelling of men in the old time / for sum went about as they
were beestes Augustinus libro octodecimo capitulo decimo tercio After Iosues
death unto the battle of Troye fables were feigned in grecia As that vlcanus in
great hete and brennyng of lechery with minerua gate Eruconius foted as a dragon
that is a fable and a poets feynyng and saw / But the soth meaning is that
in the Cite Athene was a temple of vlcanus and of minerua in that temple was a
child found byclypped about with a dragon / that bitokened that the child
shield be grete^ and for the child was found in her both temple / therefore
the child was cleped her both son / Also Tritholomus that was born of Fleing
addres in to nedy lands att hest of Cerreres / brought them whet it is a
fable^ Also of mynotaurus that a beest^ closed in laborintus ded^lus hows / And
when men went in to that hows they were so begyled that they couth not come
out / Also of centaurs that were meddled of mankynde and of horse kind / Also
of Cerberus the hound of hell that had three heeds / Also of Frix^s and his
sister Elle that were borne of a whether by the eyre and flewen as foul* Also
of gorgon the strumpet that she was heered with addres and turned in to stones
men that bihelde her Also of Bellerefront that he was born of a fleing horse
with fethres and wings / his horse was called pegasus / Also of Amphion that he
pleased stones and drowe hem to him with swetnesse of his harping / Also of
dedalus the carpenter and his son ycarius that made hem wings of feathers and

Ysidorus libro vndecimo / Also gereon the geant king of spayn that was slain
of hercules and was descryued in three lykenesses and shappes / It is a fable /
ffor there were three brethren so well acordyng to gedres that it seemed that
they had one soul / one wytt and one will Also the stropettes Gorgons
heered as serpents had one eye and torn in to stones men that bihelde them
it is a fable / But there were three sistres al of one fayrenesse. men that
bihelde them they made hem as styll and as stydfaste as stones / Also the three
syrenes / that were half maidens half fowls and hadden wings and talentes as
hawks. and one of hem sang that other pyped and t^e third harped / and drowe
to hem ward Shipman that sailed in the see in to ship wrake it is a fable /
But there were three hoores that brought men that used hem in to meschyef and
therefore me saith that they brought hem in to shipbruche^ Also that me feyneth
that Scilla was a woman byclypped about with heeds of houdes and with great
berkyng of hounds that is said / for the wawes of that see / Siculus that
flasshith and wasshith upon that rok that is called Scilla makes such manner
noise men that sailleth thereby be so aferd that they wene that the wawes berk
that wasshen on that rokke / So they fen that the serpent ydra with nyne
heedes^ and if one heed were smitten of / than grew up three for one / The sooth
tale is that ydra was sometime a place that wonderly and perilously cast up
water. and if oo water were stopped the water brake-vp in many places and weyes
Hercules saw that and destroyed the swolowe and closed alle the weyes /
therefore me feyneth that he destroyed ydra the serpent. {per}sid libro primo

they be sothe in dede but feigned in speaking Poets brought in fables for three
skylles^ for liking (...) (...) of talking and of fair speaking. such be the
fables of plantus and of Terencius / and fables that be commonly told. Also for
helthe and enhauncyng of kind so me says that vlcanus halts for the fire is
never even vlcanus is feigned god of fire So Chymera is feigned a beeste of three
manner shappe^ and kinds bitokeneth the ages of mankynde The first youth of a
man is cruel as a lyon The second age of manhood is sharp of sight as a goot /
owther stynketh by lechery as a goot* The thyrdde age is ^lde and bows as a
dragon wastes always and so the fable of ypocentaurus that was feigned meddled af
horse kind and of mankynde bitokeneth the swyft passing of man lyf / Also
fables be feigned for derke fair and mystyal speaking of thewes. As when me
speaks. and feyneth that things that can no reason speak to hem self that by
the tale that is feigned the soth betokenynge be remeoued to that that is sothly
don in dede^ So Orace speaks of the mouse and of the wessylle / And ysopus and
auenet of the Fox and of the wolf and in libro Iudicum of the trees of lybanus
and so speaks demostenes of wolves and hounds feigned for the delyueraunce of

Says that sum fables be feigned by cause of lykyng^ such be of menandre and
Terencius / and such long^th not to philosophres And sum fables be feigned by
cause / of prouffyt in excitinge comfort / in the which fables the matier that
me speaks of owther the ordre of telling of the thing that is feigned is
feynyngly told that is to understand / do falls is told by another falls / So it
fares in esopus fabbes in anians fables also / and these fables be not
pertynent no long not to philosophres Also sometime a soth saw is told by a
feigned tale and such were the feynynges of Esiodus and of Orpheus when they
spak of diverse deeds of kind of gods and such a tale is no fable but a
tale like a fable And if such a tale is told by likeness of foul thing and
harlottry than it lengeth not to philosophres neither to dyuynes / but such as
be told by likeness of fayrenesse of honest perteyneth to philosophres / So
plato feigned that a knight that was called Er / aroos from death to live and
told many things of the everlasting lyf of man soul R And Boece feigned
that philosophy appeared to him in the likeness of amayde / In this manner may

changes in thought in meting of dreams by diverse manner things and takes
the likeness of bodies with a wonder swyftnesse though no body be presente^ when
the wits of the body be absent and let of their worchynge and the image
and likeness that is in thought in fantasy is as it were emprynted in the

AFter this Alysaunder toke the clothing and the dyademe of the king of pers
as thaugh he wold pass in to the manner and usage of macedonia And for it should
not seem that all one he trespassed in that doyng^ he. bade his friends also
use lunge clothes of gold / Also he deled the times and stempnes of the nyghtes
among company of strompettes and put to noble mete drink lest fasting
destroyed lechery he highted his meels with divers plays and had no mind
that great Rychesse is lost by such manner doyng and not get no won.
Therefore men began to have indygnacion of him for he forsook the usage and the
manners of his forfaders / He let knights wed women that were taken
prysonners / for they should take and suffer more easily the trauaylle of
chivalry and think the lass of their own country / he held that macedonia
should be strenger / if young knights come after old faders and used deeds of
knights with in the bounds of their own birth / And should be the more stal
worth afterward if they pyght her tents as it were in her own cradels / Also
Alysaunder ordained fedyng for childre^ hers^ and armour for the yonglynges
hire wages for the faders / if the faders dyed the sons should receive the
wages of the faders and so her childhode should be as it were knyghthode
cheualrye / than when the parties were chased Alysaunder way cruel among his
own men and hated most if any of his men with said him of any manner dede^
There he slough one permenion an old man that was next the king and permenyons
son phil^ta also / for they told him that he ouertourned and destroyed the
manners and the usages of the country and of his fornfaders Than Alysaunder
dread lest tidings of that dede should come in to macedonia. he made it as he
wold send sum of his friends in to macedonia to. tell there tidings of the
vyctoryes and of the great deeds that he had do and bade that men should write
lettres al that wold tidings send and made the messagers bring him the
lettres pryuately for he wold know al men will that wold lettres send
owther for he wold reward hem that were true owther send hem that were falls
in to far lands Pol^ Alysander was oft drunken and than he was cruel among
his meyny / And so it happed on a time that he yaue dome ayenst one the
grettest of his palace that his heed should of / And he appeled anon right^ But
for me used to appel from the lass to the more. the tyrant that was wine
drunk torn in to more wodenesse and said from whom and to whom appellyst
thou / I appelle said he from Alysaunder the drunk to alysaunder the sober /

Alisandre slough him for that great preysyng but afterward when the kings
wodenesse was cessed he bithought him of the person / that was slain of the
cause of his death and of the fest time and made so great sorrow that he
desired to dye. the teeres brake out of his even and he wept full soore Than he
biclypped the dede corps and gropeth the wounds and drew out the shaft and

a pyt and an hand with hym^ But one lysimachus a gentleman and a noble made him
drink venym for remedy of his sorrow Than Alysaunder was wroth for that dede
and put this lysimachus to a lyon to be eten but he wrapped a cloth about his
hand and put in to the lyons mouth / when the lyon resed and rased of the tong

Solinus After this Alisander cam to the hills of caspy there the childer of
boundage of the ten lygnages of Israel were closed and prayed for license to
Alisander to goo out of that closing / And when Alysaunder had understand
that they were closed there for her sin / and that it was prophesied of hem
that they should not goo thens / Alisaunder closed them^ faster stopped her out
going with stones and glue and he saw that man wit was not suffisaunt to
do that dede and prayed god of Israel that he wold fulfylle that werk. and
dede than the coppes of the hills went and closed to gender / and so the

Alysaunder proffered to dindymus gold silver clothes breed and oil And dindimus

Auctoryte of holy Chirche. and certain essaye of calcalers 3 But as saint
Austyne saith above / Ayenst reason no sobre man demeth no Christen man demeth
ayenste holy writ / no possible man demeth ayenst holy chirche Also here
take heed that saint Austyn saith that criste lay in the heart of the earth
three days and three nyghtes / but not all fulle and whole three days and three
nyghtes / For Criste lay in his graue^ but forty hours / So that he lay in
his grave in the last end of the first day for to acounte the first day of
four and twenty hours with the night that was to the ffrydaye that criste deyd
inn. And crist lay in his grave holy all the second day and in the first
party of the thyrdde day And so saint austyn saith that yche of these three
days had his night So that the night passed a fore the day / thereby it
seems that the master of the stories should not be folewyde / there he saith
that the night that was bitwene the saturday and the sunday of the resurection
was come both to the saturday and also to the sunday Lucas and beda Than
marie aroos after that she had conceived and come in to Zacharyes cite four
mile out of Jerusalem and was there three months and served her cosyn
elyzabeth till that she had a child. And than mary went ayene in to her own
hows in to nazareth Lucas Than wold not her spouse Ioseph take her sekerly to

that he should take her without dread Lucas / That time come out a maundement

ioseph went out of nazareth in to bethlehem that was his cite with his wife

warning of the Angel that warned ioseph in his sleep he fled in to egypt
with his moder And Ioseph was there six year unto herodes death Herodes cast for
to slay alle the children by cause of crist. for he wold be seker of him among

Than to the seueth day before apryll that was the friday in the which criste
was conceived to the night of the sunday in which crist was borne / were to
honderd days three score and sixtene the which nombre of days makes nyne
months of the moan and six days / So that every month be of thyrtty days
as men acounted in old time These nyne months and six days ben assigned to
women that goth with child as yet were ten months though not all women goo
with child to this sixte day / As yet was sothe of saint Iohan baptist and of
saint mary that had one day lass than crist in the moder womb R And for of
the coming to gyders of years of criste and of kings the begynnyngys and the
ends ben vncerteyn and full oft fall great doutes in acountynge of years. And
also of the years of our lord / what year he was baptysed^ what year crist
suffered death Auctors speken dyuersly / therefore for to put away al manner dout
take heed by bedas loore libro de temporibus. that the Romaynes byfore numa
pompilius time bygan the year in marche as the hebrewes don But from numaes
time that put two months to the year Ianyuere and feueryere / the Romaynes
bygynne the year in the beginning of Ianyuere / Holy chirche in the west lands
folowith them in the comyn calendar and in the year that is most used

But the greeks that brought up olimpias begynnen the year from the shortest

the night ben like long / for that time the world was first made But the
Egypcians bygynnen the year from heruest Men of the eeste lands as Arabes and

when the tethenges ben brought in to the temple in the beginning of october
when the day and the night ben y like lunge in heruest time as yet seems
^zechielis vision theer he speaks of the fourth month and the fyfthe day of

is said that diverse men have diverse beginning of years and yet over that
comes diverse years by some hap that there falls and begins in diverse
times of the year that we most use as yet is of years of kingis that begynnen
to regne in diverse time of the year that we most use yet we acounte the years
of our lord in twey manner wise / other by his birth or by his age. And also
while crist was born in the end of the year that we use by the son / he had
of the first year of his birth but seven days from the natyuy^e to years day
But the first year of his age of twelve months by his course from the five and
twenty day of december to the same day twelve months is fulfilled the second
year of his birth And so in the first year of his age he fulfilled almost two
year of his birth / And the second year of his birth is the first year of his

son be nygh four and thyrtty year an half and the years of his age nyghe three
and thyrtty year an half and he was baptised in his / xxx / year of age and the
xxxj year of his birth for to acounte that year with the last party that was

three year and an half by the Gospel of saint Iohan^ And so crist suffered death
in the xxxiij year of his age and in the xxxiiij year of his birth R Than in
the two and forty year of Octauianus in the which year crist was born bygan in
marche and ends in marche Therefore that year bygan in the thirdde year of
Olimpias nyne score and fourten ends in the fourth year of the same olimpias
in the month of marche And fo^ the wisdom of our lord ordained his birth
there the greeks begynnen the year with the olimpias / therefore the years of
our lord bygynne and end with ^he Olimpias But the years of kings and of
Emperors begin and end certainly but right selde^ therefore it is hard to
acounte them with olimpias owther with years of our lord for they begin oft
in one year of the olimpias and end in another Than the kingdom of Augustus
is acounted in march And crist begins his first year of his birth in the
end of augustus two forty year / than the xlij year of Augustus bigynneth in
the first year of the age of criste and the xliij year of Augustus in the
second of the age of crist and is xliiij year in the thyrdde and so forth

heed that the first was herodes Ascolemta / And had that name of the cite
Ascalon for he fulbylte that cite. And in this herodes time Criste was born and
the children were s^ayne The second hete herodes Antipas and was the first

of the year of grace sixty and one / But the seventy say that from Adam to the
xv year of tiberius ^ere five thousand two honderd and xxv Bu^ the hebrewes
tellen five thousand. therefore sum men wol mene that that year began the
sixth thousand for than the circumsicion seesid and cristendom bygan Other
begin from thincarnacion of crist Also that year Iohan began to preche and
baptise and baptised crist the sixth day of Ianeuere the day of the showing of
our lord / And that day twelve month he torn water in to wyn Petrus Therefore
in old books that day is called the day of shewynges in the plurel nombre for
that day fill many diverse shewynges and had diverse names for in the same day
in diverse years were do three great shewinges the first hete epyphania and is a
name made of epy that is a booue phanos that is showing a^t were a showing

made of theos that is god and phanos that is showing as it were showing made
of god in baptising of crist by a douue^ The thyrdde hete bethphania and that
is made of bethe that is house and of phanos that is showing as it were a
showing made in an hows by tornyng of water in to wine R And some men men that
that day two year was the miracle do of the five loves and two fish and
heete fagephania that name is made of fagyn that is ete and phanos that is
showing / for that miracle was do in fedynge of men Also that second year as
Luke and Ierom saith Crist bygan the thyrtty year of age so says the gospel
Iesus was beginning as it were xxx year Crisostimus marianus / And comyn
meenyng of holy chirche. Eusebius in historia ecclesiastica / Means that than
crist byga his one and thyrtty year hool and as much as was from the natiuite
to the passion time / than crist* the monday next after his baptym was lad
in to wilderness by the spyryt / and bygan his fasting and fastyd forty
days And ended his fasting in a frydaye the xv day of feuyre / that day he
ouercam the devil that temptid him / in the which day the devil had overcome
and supplanted Adam the first man Than the next ester after as true loore
tells he drofe and chacid sellers and byers out of the temple / In the same
year after he called and chees his disciples Andreu Petyr Philip Nathanael The
next year after he torn water in to wine in a xij day And after that beda
tellyth Crist and his disciples baptised in the Iewery / And the next ester
after Iohan was enprysonned Also in a holy feeste crist healed in a saturday
one that had the palsy eight and thyrtty year And after that in the same year
he went up in the hill there he chees the twelve Apostles and sent them for to

In the beginning of holy chirche were but three patriarchs as it were in stead
of Abraham. Ysaac and Iacob. One was at antiochia in asia Another was in
Allexandria in Affryca / And the thyrdde was at Rome in europa / these three
peter halowed. by his own sittynge / In tweyne th^rof he was Bishop him self
/ But his disciple marcus held the thyrdde at Al^ndria in Peters name / After
(...) the synodus nycena had yeuen that pryuelege to the Bishop of Rome that
he should be above al other bisshops as them perour is above all kynges^ And
that he should be called pope as the chyef fader / And the right of the
patriarch was torn to constantinople as it were to the second Rome The oth^r
se^s of patriarchs were chaunged^ the see of antiochia to Jerusalem And the see
of Alexandria to Aqu^ia And it is supposed that the cause thereof was for wicked
christen men should be take in to the lond of mysbyleuyd men. and so it should
follow that they should less the holy places Eusebius in historia ecclesiastica
libro decimo Constantynus died to god almyghtyes p^estes great reverence and
worshipe Therefore when the bisshops were assembled in the Synod of nycena by
commandment of constantyn and by counseylle of siluestre for to declare the
faith of holy chirche Many of hem playned each upon other and put up bills to
the emperor for he should do hem right The emperor saw that holy chirche for the
which the bisshoppis were come might lightly be l^tte by such plaints strif
Therefore he set^e hem a certain day after the sinode and counseil for to make
an end of al thylke causes and playntes^ But he brent privily alle thylke
bills of hem that made plaints said God hath ordained you as it were gods
to be your own I^gges. Therefore I hold that it were vnsittynge that we that
should be deemed of you should deem you that ben gods But in holy chirche among
you self trete ye of your errors defawtes so that no thing be known outward
that is v^semely to your holynes And if ye will needs strive Abide ye the dome
of god almighty as the psalme saith / God stood in the sinagoga of gods
Certainly if I saw^ any of your ordre sin with a woman. I would couere him
with my^ mantel by cause that for none men should have occasion to speak evil
of your relygyon Therefore brethren trete ye more of the faith of holy chirche /
for therfo^ ye ben come

be coupled to the time of crystes passion: the second for we should in the end
of our fasting ^esseyue crystes body in clean lyf The thyrdde for our lord
should find us fasting Hyderto Eusebius and pamphilius written the storye

About that time lived machamet the falls prophet duke and leder of Sarasyns
and of turkes^ his story is brought in this manner / But steven of caunterbury
and girald of cambria helpen much in this matter. Sometime while thempyre of
rome was in great might and strength. Crystendome was nyghe wydder and more
than thempyre of Rome was in great might is no wonder. for crystendom was so
encreced that it contained Europa and many prouynces of Asia and well nygh al
affryca within his merkes and bounds. Att last by d^scorde stryf of crysten
men between hem self / It was do that that Agarenes wax strong / the agarenes
have three names and ben called agarenes Ismalytes and saracenes / of her empire
prophesied methodius the martyr and said that crysten relygyon should ^aue
little without thendes of Europa Also after that error of Sarasyns had
infect al affryca. hit defouled also a great del of spain And but gods
grace and mercy had helped / it would have infect and shente al ffraunce with
spain Thenne after the great gregoryes time the empire of Rome that stretched
sometime from th^ccean of brytayne unto the ends of perse was so destroyed
with tyrauntrye and civil batailles that it was not of power to defend it
self ayenst enemies / thenne the cruel paynim host of pierce bygan to occupy
many prouynces of the lordship of Rome and of men of crysten feith in the est
lands / Thenne as th^ great fly follows the trace of the malshawe. so after
oth^r woo comes pestylence of the ismalytes that was more grievous and
destroyed neygh the crysten men that were left in the eest lands by ledyng of
the prince machomete in heraclius themperours time Thenne in the fifth bonefas
time while heraclius regnede about the year of our lord six honderd and
twenty. machamete the falls prophet and witche begyled the ysmalytes and
agarenes in this manner. a famous clerk was att court of Rome and might not
speed att his will and p^ssed the see and pleased many men and had hem at his
assent / Among the which he promised machomete that he wold make him prince
of h^s peple if he would do as he said / thenne this clerk fed up a douue
and made him fe^che his mete in machome^s ere. for there he put the co^ne that
the douue should ete / And of that same the douue wold oft fed him self
thenne in a day this clerk gadred the peple to gender and promised them that he
wold make him their prince whom the holy goost wold show in likeness of a douue
and let anon his douue flee. And the douue as he was wont sate upon
machomets sholderes and put his bylle in machamets ere / And therefore machamet
was chosen prince and leder of the peple. This that is said is the comyn tale^
but what now follows is more allowed and approu^d^ A monk that hete sergius
was put out of the company of monks that he was among for he was fall in to
nestorius errour^ he cam in to Arabia and put him self to machomete and
informed him though it be radde that this sergius was archedeken of Antiochia
or patriarch of Ierusalem^ thenne machomet faderles and moderles was in his
emes keeping in his childhode and worshipped maumetrye somewhat of time with his
country men of Arabia / and he yaue him self specially to worshipe venus / And
therefore it is that yet the saraseyns holden the friday holy as the Iewes don
the saturday and we the sunday After that machomet come to age and was sharpe
of wit and went. in to many lands by cause of marchandyse and was oft in
company of Iewes and of crysten men and learned the maners^ usages and custommes
of both the laws of crysten men and of the iewes / And couth both wytchecraft
and nygromancy / and was a wonder fell man and fer casting and had noble
faconde and fair speech / th^nne he come to the lady of the prouynte Corozonia
/ the lady hete cadygan / And with sum spices that he brought with
wytchecraft and fair words he made the lady so mad and so nyse that she
worshipped him as the grettest prophet of god almyghty^ or as it were messias
that the Iewes abyden / and she desired him to husbond / It is the usage of
that prouynce to be ruled also by women Thenne he wedded the wedewe that was
queen and so he was made lord of that prouynce / thenne he drew to him the
Arabes and occupied the est empire unto Allexandria ayenst heraclius the emperor
/ Thenne he toke the manner of speaking of true prophets as though god had
spoke in him spake in this manner in his books that he made / Our lord spak to
his prophet and said. for so the books that he feigned gylefully should be
byleuyd as though they were made by auctoryte of god almighty

Thenne not only his own men but also men of fer lands fylle to him and bowed
to him in every side. he had great liking to have gretter lordship And as it
were for to bring men in to good manner living and as it were by commandment
of god almighty he assoylled the nations that dwelled nygh him and died by
craft and by gyle that he might not do by deeds of Arms Therefore when Egypt
Libia arabia and Siria were subgett by cause he wold seem the more holy^ he
drew the peple that were subget to his falls law and made hem to forsake the
usages and laws of their fornfaders / And he forbad the paynems maumetrye
and he granted circumsicion to the Iewes as they had vsed^ and feigned of his
own self sum new laws and alleged wytnes of either testament The sarasyns
call that law his law yet unto this time And he bade the sarasyns circumcide
hem as the Iewes don / and forbad hem that would follow him etyng of swynyssh
flessh / And machomet wold tell the cause why he forbade them the swynyssh
flessh and said that swyne come of camels dirt after noes flood and therefore
clean men should eschew it as mete that is vnclene. And as it were to acorde
with Crysten men in the manner of crystnynge / he ordained oft washing of
lymmes in water as it were for clensing of sins And for to bring the people
that was so begyled the faster to snarle / what he knew that was most
playsanut to man liking he ordained that for law / And so he ordained that
a man should have as many wives and concubynes as he might sustene with his
catel / Also that a man might have wives of his oun kindred unto the nombre of
four. and that a man might four sithes forsake his wyf and take her again /
also that he might have as many concubynes as he would of wymmen / that were
bought prisoners^ And also that he might sell hem but if he had brought any of
hem with childe- And ordained hem to use sobrenes of mete and drink / and
forbad him drinking of wyn / but it were in certain solemn days in the
yere^ And for he would somdele varye fro the Iewes that worshipped god westward
/ and fro crysten men that worshipped god eestward / he taught his peple to
worshipe god south ward with oft knelynges^ for in the south is plente of
light / he ordained hem to worshipe the goddess venus and to hold the day
thereof solemn and ^ holy. that is friday / he bade worshipe one almighty god
creator and maker of alle things and said that moyses and Iohan were
Prophets and that Cryst was gretter and grettest of all prophets that he was
born of the maid marie by virtue of god without man seed as he saith in
his book that hete Alkaron. netheles he meddled sum falls saws with soth
saws / And said that criste was afterward born up to heaven and not slayne^
For he saith that Iudas the traitor sought cryste in a den and changed in
to the likeness of cryst / so he was take nailed to the cross in stead of crist
Also he bade that the men of his law should every year if they might goo in to
gods hows that is in matha for to bid her beds / when they were come
thither they should ben clothed in one manner clothing / they should throw out
stones thurgh hooles of the walles^ as it were for to stone the devil / said
that Abraham made that hows for his childeren ismaelytes / for they should
there bid their beds / Also by machomets law ^e that were take with a woman
in spousebreche should be stoned to death / if he dede fornicacion with a sengle
woman he should have four score lasshes / A thief the first time and the
second time should be beete^ the thyrdde time he should less his hondes / and
the fou^th time he should less his feet / And he says that who that holds al
this and other heestes of his law god almighty promised him paradys / the
orchard of plesyre liking. there is no distemprure no payne that is any manner
of gryef but al manner of welthe and of liking / there is liking mete for to
ete and clothes to were and maidens tembrace fair shall serve them there / the
Angels ben so great and so huge that from that one eye to that other is the
space of a day iourneye^ to them that hold no keep not his lawe^ he promises
hem fire payne of hell without end / And also in his book that is called
alcoranum he praises alle the faders of tholde testament. specially moyses and
Iohan the baptist^ Cryste and machomete Also there he praises alle that that
believe in god and do rightwysenes / but it is not there red what is the right
feith. no what men ben of right believe. no what men ben of mysbyleue Also there
is wreton that five books come fro heaven for the information of mankynde / the
sawter / moyses books / the books of prophets and machometes Alcaron / In
that Alcoron it is wreton that god almighty would rule and led mankynde in to
the way of sauacion^ and after abraham he yaue to the childeren of Israel a
law by which law they should know God and worshipe him / But for they told
not of his law god gaf the gospel to other men / And also they mysused the
law / And the Arabes that cam of Abraham by ysmael were mo men and gretter
peple than the Iewes that come of Abraham. by Isaac. And the Arabes that were
left were left without law / therefore out of the consistorye of gods
rightwysenes come a decree that a prophet of her own peple should be sent to
the ysmaelytes with a law / the which prophet and law the sarasyns should
follow as the Iewes followed moyses^ and crysten men Cryst And therefore the
Sarasyns hold them self better than Iewes and Crysten men for they hold holy
their law / And Iewes Crysten men oft trespacen ayenst their own law / For
to bring this about / machomet norysshed and fed a fair camel in a pryue
place / so that the camel had no mete but of his own honde / And machomet
waited his time and hinge that cursed book Alcaron about the camels neck. in
that book were the foresaid laws wreton And machomet let go the foresaid camel
in to the feldes with the book about to fore day light / Thenne the camel as
it was no wonder bygan to leap and to start and made great joy for he was at
large and fled every man and wold come nyghe no man honde-Speche of this
wonder sprang once in feldes and towns and the peple gadred thither out of
every side. But when machomete was come the be saw him a fer that yaf him
alweye mete ran to him anon right^ bowed to him and lykked his hondes as he was
taught. thenne the peple cried and said in this dede is showed the holynes of
gods prophet / And they prayed him that he would undo the book with his
holy hondes / and when the book was opened / Lo saith machomet Here is your
law not wreton with man ink but with angels hondes and sent fro heaven for
to be bolden ever without any. end In the book ye ben taught how ye shall
worshipe god / how greet mede ye shall hope to resseyue of him for keeping of
this law / The day that this was don in is every year made solemn and holy
/ and is called the fest of the camel / and they fast a month to fore that
feste in this manner Every day of that month fro the first light of the day
when men may know bitwene white blac unto the going dou of the son / they
fast ete not no drink / no delen with their wives / but ben alwey in her
prayers but after the going down of the son unto the dawynge again they
ete drink and lye by their wives / but seek men and feeble ben not holden so
for to fast. This machomet displesyd oft his wyf for he had the falling
evil / and in that evil he fill oft to the ground / But he plesyd her and
other that had r^sseyued his law in this manner and said that he fill to ground
for the words of seint mychel tharchangel that spak with him so oft For a
flesshliman he said may not suffer an angels words but if he fall / he hated
wyn dronkenes as Rybawdrye / and harlottrye / by cause of heete of the country
he would have it spared^ But in a night he was drunk and fylle down in the
streete^ And there swyn ete him which he reputed vnclene beestes Therefore they
that hold his laws spare wyn and swynes flessh In the first point it seems
that they follow the Iewes / In the second point it seems that they follow
the philosophy of their master Also after the death of machomet that cursed
sect encreced so fast that it caused so mighty men of pierce to draw to that
cursed law of the Arabes Also that sect hath infect unto this time al
africa and a great del of spain as gernarde. And tharchebisshop turpinus
tellith that machometes image of latone that he made with his own hondes /
stondeth in the See stronde and hath his face toward the south. In that image
machometus by wytchecraft closed a legyon of fendes. A cryste man that comes
there is lightly perysshed. But a sarasyn goth alwey whole and sound / A bird
that comes there dies anon The image holds a mace in his right honde And
that mace shall first fallen when a king shall be born in gallia that shall
renew al spain with crysten laws / And when the mace shall fall / thene the
sarasyns shall flee and leave their tresorye / The famous norye of this cursed
sect Saladinus duc of turks the strong hamer of crysten men about the year
of our lord enleuen honderd four score and ten he herd that crysten men used
many messes of mete at one meal and said that christen men were not worthy to
have the holy land Also he was fell and slyhe for to praise his own secte^
and to blame and despise our law. and that is known by this ensample On a
time were two white monks brought to fore him that thieves of turks had take.
And he knew by her strange clothing that they were philosophres and crysten
men. And he axyd by one that knew both langages of hem what they were and of
what condition and profession and they said that they were monks and had don
their profession to saint Benettes rule. Thenne he axyd besyly many points of
that rule. And specially among other. he axed if they should by her rule ete
flessh or drink wyn / Thenne answered they and said that they had at al time
somewhat of wyn for to drink. but flessh should they none ete / but it were for
sekenes or great need / thene the tyrant bad that they should have more large
keeping and have two young fair wymmen to serve hem / and bad that they should
ete flessh and drink water / And so they ete flesh drunk water^ and toke
ensample by saint Iob / and made covenant with their even that they wold not
think of fylthe and of sin and were alwey besy in their prayers / Thenne
Saladynus was waar thereof and toke from hem the flesh and the water and bad
hem serve with fysshe and wyn / And he bad so do to that intent that Salamon
moeueth and saith / yeue ye wyn to hem that ben in great sorrow that they may
drink and foryete their sorrow and her need / When he had thus done he caste
to beguile by symplenes these two monks / For he wold if they might there
bysette challenge and blame upon the Relygion / thenne the Monks drunk wyn
wax merry glad forgot what they should have in mind and fylle to and lay by
the wommen Thennne on the morrow when the wyn was defyed^ they thought on
their trespaas and began for to weep full soore. the tyrant saw hem weep and
said why be ye more soory than ye were wont to be. For we have sinned
grievously said they and were overcome with wyn^ Thenne he said / while ye ete
flesh and drank water ye held forth your purpose redyly ynowgh / But when
ye were overcome with wyn without flessh ye brake your rule and your purpose /
Therefore it is known that Benett the Auctour of your rule was vnwyse for to
forbede you etyng of flesh that distourbled not a man wit granted you
to drink wyn that roteth up the strength of reason as ye have assayed now by
new assay / Thenne he that made our law machomet that forbad us wine that
distourbeth man wit grouted us the use of flessh was wiser than your
Benet^ But what be your remedies and clensyng of this sin now that ye have
broken your rule and your purpose. Penance said they and satisfaction by
ordenaunce of our ^elder fader / Thenne said he mow ye not be cleansed among
us / Goo ye to your own and be cleansed in your own manner wise / and so he
let hem go This man was full of old pestylence of sleyght and wiles / And what
the wyly shrew / might not have saueour in^ he began to despise / For he would
blame the holy man saint Benet / Of the which saint Benet the great gregory
saith that he wrote the Rule of monks full of wit and of wisdom / and open
and clear in words. For it was a wise dede to withdraw fro hem that go to
holy chyualrye. liking of metes that withdraws the soul from holynes of
deeds and of thoughts / by thappostles lore he granted hem a little what of
wyn for to strength somewhat the feblenesse of the flessh granted hem but
little. for it should not grieve the sharpnes of the soul

vnneth the first part byfore his death / when he come to age and would stable
his heart and his thought in gods heestes / the lechery of his flessh grieved
him and let him of^e time / therefore to put away temptation of flesshely

might the more frely serve god almighty / At gods ordenaunce he had many year

When harold was set up in the kingdom and thought not on the covenants
that were made between him and wylliam / he held him self dyscharged of the
oath. for wylliams daughter that he had spoused was dede within age of wedlok /
And also for wylliam was occupied with werres in Ilandes that were nyghe him /
But william warned him of covenant broken / and meddled menaces with prayers /
Harold said that a nice folly covenant should not be holden / and namly the
byhest of other men kingdom without comune assent of all the Senators /
There a lewd oath should be broke namely sith it was compellyd to be sworn for
need in a needful time / In the mean time wylliam arrayed al that needed for the
journey and gate the assent of the lords of his land / and purchaced favour
of Alysaunder the pope with a baner that was to him sent / these were the
causes why duc william axed and challenged Englonde ayenst harald / the death of

and cruelte of his enemies / the other lords were glad hereof and put her
answer and her words upon this wylliams mouth / and as he wold say / when he

him there out for to have wind / Anon liking wind filled the seyles / than
duc william cam toward Englond after mychelmasse day / and landed at hastynge
in a place called Peuenesey / In his going out of his ship / he slode with
his one foot and styked in the sand / and the knight that was next cried to
him anon / and said / now Sir Earl / thou hold Englonde / thou shalt right
newly be king / than he charged that they should take no prays said that he
must spare things that should be his own / he left so fyften days / harald
cam from the werre of the norganes / and herd tidings hereof / and hied well

led hem about his tents and pauylons and fed hem ryally and sent hem to
Harold again / than they told to harold tidings / and said that al that were
in duc williams host / were preestes for they had both the chekes and both
the lyppes shaven / Englysshmen used that time the heer of her ouerlyppes

knights / Than said gurth heralds youngest brother / why wolt thou vnwar fight

thou that art sworn to him withdraw the for a time let us that be not sworn

popes legate come in to englond / made a counseyll by thasset of the king /
stygandus was deposed set a down / prayed besyly the king of his grace / the
king excused him self with fair words as he couth well enough / said that he

there he was y bore / But there come great tempest and drofe him in to Scotland
/ By occasion thereof it was that malcolyn king of Scotland wed edgars sister

soory for her coming that he deyde for sorrow the / xj / day of September / The
eight day thereafter the normans that kept castles dread / lest the houses of
the subarbes should help the danes to fylle the dyches / therefore they set hem
a fire / but the light aroos to hye / and brent the cite of york / with the
mynster of saint peter / But er the fire were done cam the strength of the
danes and slough by assent of the cyteseyns more than three thousand normans /
Than king wylliam was wroth and destroyed so that prouynce that for great
honger men ete horses flessh / houdes flessh / cattes flessh / and man

without tylyer wonyer / out take only saint Ioones lond of beuley. for there
fill a wretch upon one of the kings knights for his horse neck was to broke his
face torn bacword / Also that time was brent saint bedas abbay that was in
girmu upon the brynk of the river wyre / That year malcolyn destroyed so
northuberlond that he slew all the old me feeble / made the strong boonde for
reverence / so that vnneth any was hows in scotlande without an english
boonde man other woman / king william by counsel of some me made search all
the abbayes of englond toke al the money in to his own tresour / W / d / p /
li / 1 / Soon there after in the vtas of ester was made a counseyll at
wynchestre by ass^nt of the second pope alysander / there were twey cardinals
present / In that counseyll stygandus tharchebisshop was degraded for three
skylles / first by cause he had holden wrongfully the bisshopriche of wynchestre
and the Archebisshopriche of Caunterbury while Robert the Archbishop was a
live / and used the pal that was there left without leave of the court of Rome
/ For he had received the pal of pope benette that was acursyd of the chirche
of Rome / And though stygandus sought besyly friendship of the king the king
excused him self sweetly as he well couth by the popes commandment and
caste stygandus in to bonds at wynchestre to his lives end / and yaue him
every day a little what of enchetes / to live by / Stygandus was kyndely so hard
that he would take right nought of his own / and swore by at halowen that he
had not a penny / but that oath was preued vntrewe by a little key that hinge
about his neck / when he was deed / For by that key was found great riches
in many places under earth / Also in that counseyll were set down many
bisshops and abbotes / namely by procuring of king wylliam for he wold bring
in normans in their stead / Sum men trowyd that he did so for he wold be the
more seker of the kingdom / Also in that counseyl saint wulstan bishop of

that he should so do without any preiudyce of his chirch / he said so more for
lewdness of wit than of rebelnes / pride of heart / as he that was a new man
begyled by flateryng words / knew not the custom and usages of englond And
lanfrank declared and preued reasonably / that his axynge was reasonable and

the challenge of the prymate of Dorobernia that is caunterbury / and of
subjection that shulde lunge to him of three Bisshopryches / of Lyncolne / of
wyrcetre and of lychefeld

And said that the Sees of Caunterbury and of york were far atwene / and
that another of him by Gregoryes constitution shulde be subgette to other / but
that the one of he^ is more worthy than the other / for he is of elder^ time /
Thenne lamfrank declared skylfully that that constitution of gregory makes no
mention of Caunterbury / but of york of london Than the pope demede that that
cause shulde be termyned to fore the king and the Bisshops in englond / And
though lanfrank held thomas y bound by the professyon that thomas had made
byfore him byforehonde / yet him was lever trauayll for his successors than
let that challenge abide to him to strive therefore afterward / This year the
year of our lord a thousand three score and twelve at wyndsore byfore king
wylliam the clergye that cause was treated / there Bedas story was shewde and
thereby it was showed that from the first Austyns time / to Bedas last time
about an honderd year and forty / the Archebisshopryche of Caunterbury had
prymacye over alle the land of Brytayne / and of Irlonde also / And also that
he had hold cousayls fast by york / cleped thereto the bisshops of york and
made bisshops and punysshed sum bisshops of york for her trespaas / and set
down many / and put hem out of the dygnyte / Herto were rehearsed pryueleges
that were granted upon this manner of doing / Ayenst al this thomas aleyde the
pystle in the which pope Gregory deemed that the chirches of york and of london
should be even peers and neither subget to other / Than lamfrank answered and
said I am not bishop of london nowther the question is not meoued of the
chirche of london / Thenne thomas that had many fauctours and much folk /
gadred with him answered and said that Gregory had granted to Austyn al one to
have under him all the bisshops of englond and that the bisshops of london and
of york should be good friends / and love well either other / and he that were
first ordained should be first worshipped / and though Austyn had changed the
Archebisshops see from london in to kente yef gregory would that Austyns
successors should be above the bisshops of york / he would lightly have set
in his epystle such manner words / I grant to the Austyn and to thyn
successors / But for he wold not that it should stretch to austyns successors
/ therefore he made no mention of his successors / Lanfrank answered herto
said / if that auctoryte was granted to Austyn alone and not to his
successors it was a simple yefte that the pope yaue Austyn that was pryue with
him / and namely while Austyn ordained no Archbishop of york while he was a
live / and also there was no bishop at york / that should be ordained by austyn
/ Also pryuelege of popes confermeth this dygnyte to Austyns successors of
caunterbury / and deemed that it is skyle and right that alle the chirches of
Englonde should take loore of living of that place for of the well of that
place they had the leeme of believe / But for thou say that gregory might
if he would have confermed with a word to austyns successors that he had
granted to saint Austyn / That is soth but that doth no preiudyce to the see
of Caunterbury / For when cryst said to peter / I shall yeue to the the keys
of the kingdom of heuene / he might also have said / if he wold I grant the
same power to thy success^urs / And though he said not so yet he bynymeth
Peters successors nothing of reverence / another of autoryte / But they had
lawfully the dispensation of offyce of holy chirche / what makes that but the
virtue of god that spryngeth by Cryst of peter in to his successors / Also if
thou kanst know between falls and soth^ what hath strength in al / hath
strength in the party / and what strength in the more / hath strength in
the lass / The chirche of Rome is as it were al of alle chirches and other
chirches both as it were parties thereof / And as for to take heed in one manner
wise / man is the kind of his syngulers / but in every syngler man is the
kind of al mankynde / So for to take heed in sum manner wise the chirche
and the see of Rome is as it were the kind and conteyneth al in comparison to
other chirches / and yet in every chirche regneth the full holiness of Crysten
feith / The chirche of Rome is grettest of al chirches / what hath strength in
that chirche shall have strength in lass chirches / So that in every chirche
the power of the first shall spring in to al his successors / but ought be
namely and specially out take / Therefore as Criste said to al the Bisshops of
Rome that he said to peter / So Gregory said to alle Austyns successors /
what he said to Austyn / Hereof follows that as Caunterbury is subget to Rome
for he takes the feith of Rome So shall york be subgette to Caunterbury / that
sent thither prechours to preche hem the feith / But for thou say that
Gregory wold that austyn should have his see at london. hit may not stoned /
who would trow that so noble a disciple as Austyn was would wythstonde / nd
do ayenst his mistress will / that was so noble a maystre and do ayenste
holy decrees / But though it were so that Austyn as thou say passed from
london / what is that to me that am not bishop of london / therefore yef this
stryf is ceesed and pees made for a time / yef thou desyrest to plede / I shall
not be from the dome / but I shall defend mine offyce / and my right / By these
reasons thomas was overcome and granted gladly that the yonder brynke of
humber should be the beginning of his dyocesy / Also it was deemed that there
afterward in things that longs to worship of god and to the feith of holy
chirche the archbishop of york should he subget to the Archbishop of
Caunterbury / So that if tharchebisshop of Caunterbury would make a counseyl
in any place of englond the Archbishop of york shulde be there at with the
bisshops of his prouynce and he shall be obedyente to his lawful heestes / If
the Archbishop of Caunterbury is deed / the Archbishop of york shall come
to Caunterbury with bisshops of the foresaid chirche / and sacre the primate
that is chosen / And if tharchebisshop of york is dede his successor shall come
co the archbishop of Caunterbury where he wol assygne in englonde and be
sacred of him / And he shall make him an other with profession and obedyence /
Than lanfranck hopped for joy and toke al this wreton for that new doyng
should not slyde out of mind and his successors should be begyled of the
knowleche thereof / but he bare him so that he lost nought that another passed
in speaking / For it is hated a man to make him self curious in his own
praysynge / Than lanfranck sent a pystle to pope alysaunder that contained al
this doyng with the profession of thomas the Archbishop of york / This year
king wylliam went in to Scotland with a great nauey and an host of horsemen
/ And made king malcolyn subget / and king malcolyn bycame his lyege man /
and swore him hommage and feute Sygebertus bishop of magounce went to saint
Iames a pylgremage / but in his coming again he was made monk of cluny / than
shipmen would have bought his Bisshopryche / he saw that / and went again to
his bisshopriche as his abbot bad him

This year Edgar Adelynge went to king wylliam in to normandy and was acord
with him

also he fed the monks of that place with simple mete drink suffryd them not to

despised the smokyng and schyllyng speech of mysbyleuyd men And of al thabbayes
of normandy he chose becco^ and was y capped by the pouert relygyo of that
place / there he was monk under abbot herlewing / was a man that couth do no
great werkes to get his lyuelode therewith / therefore he held open scole of
art to releue the nedy place by freedom of his scolers / the loos of his

what was rightful that is that he should fall down to the feet of saint peters
vyker / when he had do so / the pope by cause of him restored his felawes

and solace of shame / he advanced namely the place of monks and of clerkis /
he brought manly a^en possessions that were alyened / Sharpnes of wit and
dunstas favour comforted him oft / for as oft as he was thoughtful for such
doings and abode with the sentence / Saint dunsta wold come to lanfrank when
he was a sleep / and warn him of al the sleyghte of his aduersaryes / and
tech the weyes how he should escape / Also in a time lanfrank was seek and him
s^med that dunstan warstled with him and delyuerd him of his sekenesse and made
him al whole / And as it is take out of saint Dunstans lyf / lanfrank was so
mild and so fair of speech in hearing of shryfte that when the shryfte were
do he wold kiss their hondes that were y shryue to him / and say these have
made me holy this day / Also in his time the monks of Caunterbury as well
nyghe al other monks in englond were not vnlyk to seculer men save that they
left not their chastyte / but they used haukynge / and hunting and playeng at
does and great drynkers also / So that thou would wene that they were
consuls rather than monks for they had so many servants of so great array
/ lanfrank suffryd their outrage a space of time / but he feared hit away with
the staf of couenable sternesse / The wise master of souls knew and wit well
the customme is the second from kind / And he knew also that sudden
chaungyng of manner thewes grieves thoughts wits / there for otherwhiles
emonge he put away somewhat of such manner doyngis with fair speech and soft
/ and whet the ruyde souls to good with the whestone of virtues / So that
they forsook the branches of shrewdness and evil manners of living and
desired the kind course of virtues and of thewys by their own good will /
therefore yet they have the holy man in mind and greet devotion to god and
fair speech to ghestes and charity among them self / this lanfrank let never
ma go fro him ^lenge or sorry / if he saw any man discomforted he would besyly
axe and wit the cause and yeue comfort and medicyn / he would frely profre
penyes to yonge childeren / he ordained to monks what them needed in every
side / so that they should not lack of what that them needed / out of rule they
should not blenche / that time sprage envy among bisshops that wold put out
mokes of their places / bring in seculer clerks / auctor of that doyng was
walk linus bishop of winchestre a good man in other deeds / though he were
bade in that doing brought thereto by couseyl of bacbitres Also he had coutid
king willia to the same entet / but lafrak herd thereof destroyed the castes of
the mighty me as who destroys attercops nestes / so they that come afterward
should not be hardy to begin that doyng no none other like / he made that pope
alisander forbode it by his wrytyng / he restored thabbay of rochestre fro the
nobre of four clerks to the nobre of fifty mokes that had enough to live by.
his wit is y wit that he translated gundulphus monk of cadony to the
bisshoprych of rochestre as I trow by the election of god / For this
gundulphus learned holy writ of lanfrank at cadony while his master toke
heed to other things he and his felawe walter with the third held on honde
the book of the gospels / said now essaye we be turnynge of the leues which

The third felaw fond I not what hard word that grieved him soore / and though
I have herd it / I foryete it gladly for it is a gentil heart to make no game
and scorn of other men woo / thenne they made joy of that hap / and
lanfrank axyd what they had of murthe / when he knew how it stood / he told
them without doubt that gundulphus should be a bishop and walter an abbot /
and that the thyrdde should torn to the sliding of the world / as it fylle
afterward / the soth was preued / for gudulphus was bishop of Rochester /
walter abbot of euesham / the third passed in vein / when lanfrank acorded not

chirche should not be halowed in Remygius time / This Remygius seemed nygh a
wonder forbodyng for his body was so little / but he overcome kind and showed

Wulstan Bishop of wyrcetre deyde the eyghtenth day of January / Willelmus de

byloued friend Robert bishop of he^ford in the town of Cryklade and chargyd
him that he should array for his beryeng / and efte the thyrtenth day thereafter
he appeared to ^ym warned that he should amend him of the neglygence of him s^lf
and of his also / And said that he should not lunge in his chayr sit / And
soon thereafter Robert deyde / Also this wulstan wol^de suffer no man when
he was deed to take of him his ring that he had first when he was sacred
bishop / he had oft sa^de while he was a live that he would never leave that
ring / Also he said oft to egnlysshmen / It is gods chastysynge that ye
suffer / Englysshmen answered him and said that the normas were worse than ever
were englysshmen / god almighty quod he vsith well the wykkednesse of hem in you
and by hem that be unworthy he takyth wretch of hem that have trespaced and a
gilt

So god by his good will the fend by his evil will tormentyth evil men in
hell and is tormented with them also / Ensample may be yeuen / thou art wroth
and smytest a man with a staf / of the brekyng of the staf thou rechest but
little / Willelmus de pontificibus likro quarto / Wulstan was borne in warwyk
shyre. and learned lettrure and offyce of holy chirche in the abbey osburgh /
Att last he was made priest and songe a lunge mass / and heeled him paid
with only the offrynge of crysten men / and he was holden a clean maid / he
died no outrage in drink / Flessh / he ete sometime / but he f^rsoke etynge of
flessh / by cause of this hap / In a day when he should goo for to plede /
him seemed that he should first singe his mass / and than toke sum mete to
releue with his need / Thenne a goose was leyd to the fire / he smelled the
roasted flessh / while he was at mass and was let of his devotion by the
smell of the flessh and so he strof long time might not torn away his thought
at this will / therefore he swore on the holy sacrament that he had on hond /
that he would never ete such manner mete after that time / and said his mass
and ete and went forth to the ple as he must / Att last his devotion
encreaced and he avowed chastyte / and forsook the world by ensample of his
forfaders that had avowed chastyte before his death time / and in the abbay of
wyrcetre there his fader had served bifore that time / he was made monk /
there he went upward by al the offyces of the house / He was ever besy in
fasting waking and in beds / he was wot to lay his heed on a form of the
chirche / there he bad his beedes and slept there / he lay byfore the
alter in a night / in his beds / and there cam a fend in a man likeness
/ and warstled with him / whether he wold or no. and cast him thryes to the
ground / therefore he had afterward great penance in an evil that is called
yleos and grieves fast by the reins / the fend cam to him in a servants
likeness of the court. as oft as wulstan saw that seruaunt afterward he
wexyd al pale for dread / he would not light down from his horse for no
brekyng of brydges / but he would ride surely enough upon the high brinkes of
the bridge^ though it were right strayte / Att last when the forsayde aldredus
was translated to the bisshoprych of york wulstan was chosen Bishop of
wyrcetre specially by the procuring of aldredus that hoped to blind his
rebberye by the symplenesse of wulstan / but he had more help of virtue than
of lettrure / and defended manly the right of his chirche / But he was not so
lewd of lettrure as he was holden / for he couth what him needed for to kunne /
out take fables of poets / and wyly and Sly Sylogismes / that he would not on
cas / vouch sauf for to learn / wulstan would not assent to his own election
/ Thenne one wulsius an holy man had be forty year closed / blamed him
sharply for he wold not assent / Also he was warned of god that he should
assent to the election / In his consecracion were two legates of the court of
Rome / and though he made profession to Stygandus the Archbishop / he toke
his consecracion and his sacring of aldredus the Archbishop of york / but for
to avoid chalenges that might fall afterward / Aldredus made protestacion
that he chalengyd no right of subjection in wulsta after that time / though he
had be his monk byfore that time / Than wulstan was made bishop and spared
both mete and drink in his halle alle the hours after mete / as the usage was
of englisshmen / he wold sit by him and frote his palms and feyne to drink
as his time come and comforted him that would drink / but he did that more for
usage of the countraye / than for any liking that he had therynne / and he
left not of the boost of the normans but he had knights about him where he
wold wed He said his mass every day and the sauter also / and memories and
minds of famous sayntes departed a seuene by the seuene hours of the day / As
oft as he was at wyrcetre he would sing the hye mass / and said that he
would not leave that offyce for to resygne the bisshopriche / he wold be at
collacio of monks / made the general confession with other / and yaue the
beneson / and goo in to his chambre / when he rode on his horse he wold say his
sawter / and beneson that englissh men makyth on the cup. he spared it not
att kings board / if need droof him to plede in any manner time / he would
bid crstes curs to al evil arbytrours and moyens / but to alle the good he
wold bid crystes blessing / he used furs of simple price / and rought but
little of wh^t manner skynnes / but be vsid more skynnes of lamb than of other
beestes / and if one had counseyled him sometime that he should use skynnes of
cattes / he answered in his game and said / I herd singe in the chirche of
gods lamb and not of gods cat / therefore I love better the heete of the
lamb than I do the beete of a cat / In a time his monks went in the more
chirche that he had builded / and he saw that the old chirche was destroyed
that saint oswald had bylded and wept full soore teres / He was in fair manner
wythsayd of that dede / and it was said unto him that he should rather be glad
that his chirche had so great worship in his time / And also as the houses
were more / so were the moo of monks / He answered and said I mene al other
wise than ye do / we wreches destroy the werkes of holy sayntes for to get
us a great name and praysyng of men In that time they used not to build / no
hostful buyldynges / But they used to offer them self to god under that roof
what it ever ewre / and to draw their subgettis to their own ensamples / but
we do the contrary and gader stones to hepe and retche not of souls In a time
he made a sermon of the pees to the peple / and many men turn to love and to
pees / But one there was that would not be acorded in no wise / another for
reasonne another for skill another for prayeng of the bishop / he stood byfore
the bishop / and the bishop said to him / It is y wryt^n that men of pees ben
blessyd / Than they that ben not men of pees be wr^tches and the devils
children / Than till thou amend the / I betake the to him that hath the as his
own child / And anon as he was made the enemies manciple / he byganne to
lygge and to some / to grysbyte and to grynde with his teeth / and to caste his
heed about Wulstan heeled him again / but he wold not of peas / Than the fend
had him efte and the third time till he had foryeuen all manner trespaas / In
a time lanfrank put against wul-stan of lettrure / And the archbishop of
york Aldredus chalengyd of him lawful subjection / and he went out of the
palace / and said the hour of none that he had behind and cam again boldly
/ and answered and had the mastrye / One Alwyn that leuyd as an anchor at
maluerne hills had great will to take the weye to the holy land and told
his counseyll to Bishop wulstan / the bishop answered nay / said leave of
Alwyn with thy good will / trow thou me / thow would have great wonder if
thou wit / what god thinks to do by the / he died by his rede / and went
thennes^ and gadred thyrtty monks in the same place / A shipman that hight
Sewulphus shroof him to wulsta oft of the same sins / than the bishop said
I see well that es makes a thief / therefore I counseyll the that thou be a
monk / He wold not for it was an hard lyf / Go quoth the bishop / whether thou
wolt or no thou shalt be a monk / and so it happed afterward / In a time
wulstan groped the heed of one nycol that was his own nory / that byganne to
wax balled right in his yongthe / wulstan said to him / I trow son that
thou shalt be balled in short time / Than said he / fader why kepyst thou not
my here and make it abide. Soon quod the bishop trow thou me / the other del
of thy here shall abide while I am alive / and it happed that the same weke the
bishop deyde / That here of Nycols heed fill away and loft not on his heed
but the bare skyn After wulstans death when al the chirche was a fire / there
fell neither ysel nor spark another soot upon wulstans grave / and so it ferde
of the matte that was under him / when he bad his beds / Of him it is said
that king william the conqueror would have pryued for vnsuffysaunt lettrure /
And also for he couth no Frenssh and cast in that manner to bring in sum nor
mans in his stead / Thenne wulstan toke his cross / pyghte it in the harde
stone at saint edward the kings feet that lay there in his grave / he pyght
so the cross / that no man it might take out of the stone er he toke it him
self at the kings heeste / While he pyght there the cross / he said to king
william a better man than thou art / betoke it to me / and I take it to him
again / take it away now if thou might /

the king chalengyd the inuestiture of prelates and pylled and shaved the peple
with tribute / and specially to spend about the tour of london / and about
the great hall of westmynstre / Also the kings meyne grieved the peple over all
where they went /

Willelmus de Regibus libro quarto / And yet herto the rote and norysshyng of
couetyse of Ranulph that was sometime the first king williams priest and his
chapellayne was made thus his procuratour in every place / If this Ranulph
should gadre the kings tribute / he would take such two as reasonn would / He
pylled the rich / bare down the pore / dysperagid herytages toke hem in to
the kings honde / therefore the king bourded in a time and said that he was a
man alone / for he couth so torn his wit that he rought of no man
wretch while he might please his ^orde att full / By his doyng holy dignytees
were sold / and soon thereafter he bought the bisshopryche of durham for a
thousand pound / That time they used strowtyng locks and lunge blasyng
clothes / gay spurs and sharp / tho men yede tryppyng showing the sides /
Ancelm wold amend al this and had no help of his suffragans / and therefore he
went out of englond / but by hest of the king in his going in a haven of ket
he was pylled and robbed and faren with as it were a thief / His males were
searched / his bouges and his trussyng coffers all that he had / Thenne ancelm
went to pope vrban in great couseyll at barus in apulea / he declared clerly
ayenst thoppynyon of the greeks that tellyn that the holy gooste comes of the

never nether slaked the great doyng of his wit / er ancelm in his going had
brought his cause to a good end / And also this wold he not assent that the
king should take tribute of prestes that used fornycacion / but in al his
dyocesy the service of holy chirche was suspendyd and the chirche doors were
stopped with thorns / the king was awelded by grymnesse of that dede So that
he granted to him aloone the tribute of his preestes / Also he aleyde that the
chirche that is destroyed and brent should not be pylled and robbed with
trybutes. but it should be releued and helped with fre yeftes / And the king
that had take from al chirches / he yaue gladly to raufes chirche many great
yeftes / This Rauf spared not to blame mysdoers for her sins and if his
blaming halp but little / he would destroy the sin wyttyly / with game and
with myrth^ he would go about his dyocyse thryes a year / but he pylled not
his subgettis by might or by maystry / but what they wold frely yeue him he
toke it with good will / Hereof wold I not speak at this time nether that it
should be acounted a miracle now in our age to find in a bishop besinesse of
prechyng and reasonable receiving / Willelmus de re / li / 4 Will / de regibus

Robert losang that had be sometime abbot of ramsey and was thenne bishop of

toke the wey to Rome and come home again and changed and turned his see from
Tedford to norwiche / And he founded a solempnel abbey with his own catell

is nought that thou dost / we seek and axe a prince and not money / Neygh every

axe a man that needs money and not money that nedyth a man / And so the
patriarck^ went his wey / his hope was lost and the king folowid him un to the

Think and have mind what our lord hath yeuen the and what thou hast yolden

now thou forsakest the defence and protection of crysten men / The king was
wroth with thyse words The Patriark saw that and proffered him his heed and
his neck and said do by me right as thou dydest by saint thomas^ For me is as
leef be slain of the in Englond as of Sarasyns in siria / for thou art worse
than any sarasyn / though all my men said the king were one body and spake with
one mouth / they dared not speak to me such words / No wonder said the
Patriarch for they love thyn and not the / this peple folowyth pray and not a

wold arise against me / when I were absent / No wonder said the patryark for

a duke / I have studied to take the flowers of steuens book / This king
ordained redyly his things beyond the See / cam in to Englond for to be

Baldwyn Archbishop of Cauterbury the third day of September the which day
is acounted an evil day by the vein believe and usage of mysbyleuyd men / and
is clepyd in the calendar Dies Egypciaca / and dies mala an evil day as it
were a day of bodynge of evil haps to the Iewes for the Iewes of Englond had
evil hap that day / Many Iewes cam to this solempnyte lest the welthe that
they had under the old king should be withdraw in the new kings time /
But the king heet and commanded that the I^wes shulde not come in to the
chirche / while he were crowned nowther in to the palace while he were at mete
/ But while the king was at mete / sum of the Iewes pressed among other / and
come within the palace gate / and one of hem was smitten with a man fist /
Than the Rabyssh peple wend that the king had so commanded / and up with

Iewes were fled for dread / and brent and spoylled and toke what they might

pass what he might nought take of full wretch / Att last the Iewes had pees

Also he yafe him the erles daughter of Gloucestre to wyf that was his Cosyn in
the third degree with all her faders lordship / The lordship of the fourth
del that was yeuen him made him unkind and vntrewe and desire the whole
kingdom / The king committed the governance of the Royame to the Bishop of
Durham / that should more skylfully and semely occupy him self in gods
service than in the kings service / For the Gospel saith that no man may
serve twey lords at full as he should / though the Bishop wold to del him self
for to please either king of heaven and of earth / Certainly the king of heaven
aloweth not service that is so deled For he would be seruid with all the might
of the soul / And what if the Bishop that is but half yeuen to Gods service
doth not his office as he should / but ordained unworthy and recheles persons
in his steed for he wold serve ho^ily in the palais other in the feire and
court / For in none half man makith God att full of the acountes of an

Jerusalem he resigned the Castles of Berwick and Rokesburgh to the king fo
Scotland for ten thousand pound / Also he begiled the old man the rich
bishop of durham and made him bye his own prouynce for a greet sum of
money / therefore the king said oft in his game / I am a wonder crafty man /
For I have made a new earl of an old bishop by such manner while and speech he
empted many man purses and bags / and sold dygnytees and lordshipes that
longed to the king as though he thought never for to come again / In a time
his friends that were homely with him blamed him therefore and he answered said
I would sell london and I might find a chapman that might well paye / many
men bought with the better will / For they trowed that the king wold never
come again / he had take power of the pope that he might byneme the cross
whom that he would / and thereby he gate many thousand pound / than the king
as it seemed betoke rechelesly the governing of the kingdom to his chaunceler
bishop of hely / and sailed in to Normandy byfore mydwynter tide / That time
at dunstaple the sign of the cross was seen in heuene / and soon thereafter
the sh^p of the cross was seen forsake the baner and pass somewhat of space
therfrom / Tell who that will what it might mene / For I have learned to tell

there the hostiler slow him pryuely by night for couetyse of money that he

the archbishop and for to do away the monks / but in the oth^r side the
monks appellyd to the pope and compellyd to ceesse the werke that was begone
/ and after baldwyns death they threw it down straight to the ground / In
that doyng it is wonder of so greet a man / that was first archedeken and
than white monk / and than abbot / and than bishop of wyrcetre and than
Archbishop that ^e would bring men of more wnparfyghte lyf / seculer chanons
in stead of men of more parfyht lyf / For sometime holy princes and bisshops in
englond wold not have to many of such manner clerks / yeue them choice /
whether they wold leave their benefyce other change their lyf and goo in to
Relygyon / Treuisa / It seems that baldwyn was well advised that cryst was heed
of holy chirche / and his apostles heyghe bisshops / and none of them all was
never monk another freer / and so it might seem that he knew well that other
clerks were more parfyht than eu was monk other freer / but for it is said
that the clerk^s had^ choys whether they wold leave their benefice or go in to
Relygion / of that choys it might seem great wonder / for it semyth thereby that
they should leave their benefyce / how it ever were / for if they yede in to
relygyon they should leave their benefyce / if they yede not in to relygyon they
must leave the benefyce by the rule of relygyon / other they speak other wise of
relygyo than al men in comyn spech^ wol mene so it seems more wonder of that
water than of his menynge / but men wold wonder that baldwyn that was a mok
wold not flater with mokes but held other clerks more holy than mokes / sith
he knew the degre of eu either. than it folowith in the story / aft{er} the wo
ten that king rychard had in prison in almayn a year three months / he was
delyuerd in the month of January for an / C / thousand poud of silver / left
with the emperor pledges / the Bishop of Rothomage and of bathe for sum of
the money that was not yet paid / And for to pay that sum of money al the
woll of white monks of chanos was take / also rings of prelates vessels
croyses and chalyces were take gold of seuentene shrynes y shave molten and no
pryuelege of person another of holy chirche another freedom was spared / the
king dwelled two months full at swynne in Flaundres other to abide the wind
other for to array what him needed / There the emperors men had almost take him
eftsoon / for the Emperor thought that he had latte goo the king as phaaro
forthought sometime that he had let go the children of Israel / But in the
month of marche the king cam a land at Sandwyche / and dwelled a while at
london and went and toke the strengest castle that his brother Iohan had The
Castles of nothyngham and of tykkehylle / and put the wardeyns thereof in
prysonne / by counseyl dome of lords he pryned his brother Iohn of al manner
worship / For he held him vntrewe and unkind / And heeled his eester at
hampton / And so at wynchester when the meschyef of his taking was wyped of /
he was newly crowned as a new king the fyfthe year of his kingdom / After
the solempnite of that crownyng the king axyd again al that was byfore
lygh^ty yeuen or grievously sold / and he acounted for the sort all the fruit
that was take in the mean time and spared for no covenant another for charter
/ another for dede / another for instrument / And so he dwelled a while and
sailed in to france for to werre against the king of France / than the kings
fought and either sped dyuersly / And trewes were granted for one year / and
that was prouffytable for king Rychard for to gader both riches and strength
/ though hit would not stoned with reason of honest / Iohan king Rychardes
brother that torn to the king of france against his own brother for he had
right nought / he might do right nought / therefore he was forsake of the king
of France / But by help of his moder Elyanor he cam mekely ageyn to king

About that time one steven procurator of Angeo that had wisely y bore him in
the second king henryes time / and in this king Richardes time also / he
supposed that the king that was tender of body should be ou{er}come with long
wey perylle that he should never come again / other if he come again it should
be vnnethe / therefore he bygan rabbysshly to pass his warrant in absence of
the king / than one that was homely with him conseylled him to axe of a
nygromancer / whether king Rychard should come again or no / the nygromancer
lad steven in to a privy place and showed him a brazen heed in the which
was a spyrite closed / Axe of this what thou wolt quoth the nygromancer but

Rycharde quoth steven / nay quoth the spyryte / how lunge shall mine offyce dure
quoth steven / To thy lives end quoth the spyryte / where shall I dye quoth
steven in pluma quoth the spyryte / Than might he axe no more but he went from
his prophet and forbad his men and bad them that they should bring no
fetheres nyghe him in no manner wise / and that by cause that a feather is pluma
in latin / Thereafter he byganne to worche the more boldly and grieved his

own castle by cause steven pursued him / This man espied when steven was
Recheles in the syege and toke him and al to hakked him / That Castle was

out of their land / But afterward somewhat of years this was weary of
trauaylle and of woo and cam to king henry in to normandy / and had of him a
noble widow to wyf / And when the priest should wed them / he axyd of the

knew the gyle and the fraud of the falls spyryt that arered his own coueytous
heart in to vein hope / when king Rychard had made ready to pay to the duc of
austryche twenty thousand pond that was behind of Raunson / the pledges that
king rychard had left with him come suddenly and told that the tyrant was
ouertorned by wretch of gods dome and his land byfore his death was grieved
with many great meschyefs / For Cites were suddenly brent / and the River
dannbyus passed the brynkes and died great harm fer about / Sedes that were
sow fordryed in the earth / Also this duke was acursyd of the Pope / for the
taking of king Rychard and scorned the cursing / Also on a saint steuens day he
rood to the fields and hurt so his foot that it most be kytte of / And he
without hope of lyf saw that he must dye / and in presence of the lords of
his lond he prayed to be assoylled of the sentence that he was in bounden / The
clergy answered and said that it might not be / but he wold swear to stoned to
holy chirches ordenaunce touching the wrong that he had done to king Richard /
the duc swore and delyuerd king Rychardes pledges anon after his other / Than
the king amended his lyf / and had also another warning for to amend his lyf /
For a man of Cenomania went to saint Iames for great devotion and cam home
again sauf and sound / Thereafter he had a greet devotion to wend and went
to the holy land to see our lords grave / As he went by the wey upon caas

the fend vanisshed away the man was comforted and left his weye that he had

About that time were tweyn that fouded as it were to do the kings prouffyte

outrage should be chasted that men of the contrayes might live in pees / But
william with the long berd warned the king of the outrage of rich men that
spared their own Rychesse pylled pore men / Thenne this abbot had a warraut
and cam to london in the month of Februar and made sum to come byfore him /
the offycers of countrayes and of prouynces to yield full ac^untes / But death
him let so that he saw not eesterdaye / Men sayn that this william was
borne at london / and had ^ of his lunge berde that he used / and was cleped
william with the long berde / He used that lunge berde because that he would
seem the more worthy / semely in speech and gaderyng of many me He was sharp of
wit and somewhat y lettred and over mesure a great speker and by a manner
kyndly Rabbysshnesse of wit and of thewes. he would geete him a great name and
caste him to do new deeds and byganne to here great doyng and deeds / Also
his wretched and shamely deeds against his own brother was sign and token of
his wodenesse in his other deeds / For he accused his own brother of treason to
the king / for he yaf him no more large spence of solace cost than he was wont
/ His brother was a bourgeys of london / had found him to Scole / He was
scorned of the prince for that deed / yet by favour of sum men he had
place among the great of london / Also among the people he blamed venymously
the pryue deeds and outrage of rich men that mysferde with pour men and so
he excited hugely^ the mene men to love and desire freedom out of mesure So
that he socyed many to him as though they were bywytched right with wytchecraft
/ For there he had tendaunt to his heestes five honderd thousand and two
thousand men of london / as it were to the comyn puruyour of al / when he had
so many fautours as he that would stoned for the pore people and for the kings
prouffyt he wold in every gaderyng and counseyll with stoned gentylmen and say
that by her fraud the king lost many great enchetes / they grutchyd against
him therefore / and he sailed to the king and said him / that Rich men died him
greet wrong by cause he was true to him / Thenne he cam again and byganne to
worche with fraud as he was wont more besyly and more trustly / and comforted
his fautours as it were by favour of the king. Noise and tidings of this
conspyracy sprage out and hubert Archbishop of Caunterbury that had the
rule of the Royamme herd thereof / and sent for the peple / and rehearsed how
it was told / and for to put of all evil suspection / he prayed well fair and
axed pledges / The peple was plesyd with his fair speech and yaf and delyuerd

folk about him and went with great boost and array and made openly Conuentycles
and counseyls and gadrynge of m^n and cleped him self the sauyour of poor men
/ and made great boost and brag and said that the frowardness and outrage
of mighty men should be alayd / and that in a short time / And he toke a teme

about him that he that had sent for him was aferd and the softer in his doyng
and put o^ the dome for that time Afterward oportunyte was espied by two
burgeys of london / when he might be found aloone without peple about him
men of arms were sent for to take him / But william with his axe slew one of
the bourgeys that had espied him / Anon william with few of his men and with
his concubyne that would never from him went in to a chirche / that was there
fast by that is saint mary chirch at bow / there he wold not defend him as it
were in a chirche but as it were in a Castle with strength and hoped in veyn
that his peple wold come and deliver him / The people was soory for the peril
that he was Inn / and is no wonder but by cause of the pledgys that they had
yeuen him / for dread of the knights that they saw armed they cam not to his
delyueraunce / than william was boden come out but he would not / than he was
compellyd by fire and smoke to come out maugre his teeth / when he cam out
the bourgeys son / that he had slain forkytte his womb with a knyf / but by
d^me of the court when he was taken he was first draw with horses and than
he was hanged with nyne felawes that would never leave him / but fautours
defamed the Archbishop as a mansle^r and not only that but alfo for to wipe
away the shame of their own conspyracye and for to preue that they that
dampned william were wicked men and evil doers / By craft and by fraud and
gyle they fonded to make william to have the name and worship of a martyr Also
men seyn that a priest of williams kin leyde the cheyne that william was with
bounden under a man heed that was seek of the fevers and preached openly that
the man was hool anon / Right this sprang out among the people / and the peple
cam pryuely by night and toke away his gybet and pared away little and little
the earth that was by bled with his blood / And made a great dyche and kept
the earth as it were holy relyques to heal with seek men / Name and tidings
hereof sprang well wide and great company both of sly men and of fools cam to
the place and woke there by night / Alwey cam theder greet multitude of
lewdmen and of fools / and as much worship as they died the dede man so
much vylonye they put upon him that him had dampned / This error had so
his forth when it was bygon that it wold have by witched wise me ready had
they redyly take h^ede to the doyng that they knew of this willias deeds / for
he slew a ma a little byfore his taking / and that is enough for a wise man to
know that he should not be worshipped as a martyr / yet his last confession
that he made when he should dye / should sham^ al that worshipped him / for a
martyr. Many counseylled him to be shreuen mekely of his sins / and to
worship god / he shroof him / though it were laate and knowleched that he had
defouled saint mary chirche and lay there by a woman while he was therynne /
Also by cause his men come not at his will to delyuere him / he forsook mary
soon and called the devil to help and prayed that he wold deliver him Williams
fautours denied al this and said that it was falsely feigned / also the vanyte
of this tale fill down soon dured but a while and alayde the stryf / For
sothnesse is steadfast and is str eager in long time / but falseness feigned
vanished away in short time / Than hubert the Archbishop ruler of the
Royamme cursed that priest and set men of Arms to keep that place / by cause
men should not c^me thither a pylgremage / And so the sleyght that was feynyd
