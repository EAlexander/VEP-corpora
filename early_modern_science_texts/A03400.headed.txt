disea ses thereof. With an exact Table showing the substance of every APHORISM.

AT LONDON Printed by H. L. for Richard Redmer and are to be sold at the
great Westdoore of Paul's, at the sign of the Star. 1610.

TO THE WORSHIPFVLL AND his worthy friend M. TIMOTHY CHALONER, a great lover of
learning.
PHilostratus, a famous Philosopher, writing sometimes to a Noble young man,
uses these words: Cauendum esse no temporis preciu sine fructu praetereat: and
Nazianzenus saith, that our time being but short, and yet precious, is not
carelessly, and negligently to be let slip; but that every man in his Place,
and Calling, is to do some good to the Country Commonwealth wherein he was
borne. For which cause, I have taken some pains in the publicatio of these
Aphorisms; a work very needful to be known, and understood, by all sorts of
people: and as Leonardus Fucchius witnesses, the best work that ever Hip.
compiled; wishing that all Physicians and Chirurgions, should carry them in
their bosoms: as it is reported of Tully, concerning the Comedies of Terence,
tanquam in sinu portare, to have them at their fingers ends.

These Aphorisms were first of all written in the Greek, and since translated
into Latin by many excellent and learned Physicians, and are daily set forth
with large Comments: which doth show unto us their excellency and worthiness.
For a man may by them preserve himself from sickness being in health, and
being sick cure himself of sickness.

Accept therefore I pray you of these Labours, which I for the benefit of my
Country have undertaken to make common: which if you shall so do, I shall
little esteem of the venomous teeth of any carper. For, to you only I present
them as a token of my love, affection, which I bear unto you: not for many
favours which I have received from you, but for your many virtues and love of
learning which is known to be in you. For (truly) I do not know to whom
books may better be presented, then to those that love books, whereof I know
you to have many; a great riches to you, but little regarded with thousands
of your rank. But I leave to trouble you: and wishing you as many happy years,
as you have virtues, I commit you to the Almighty his protection.

Yours, S. H.

To the understanding Reader.
I Doubt not (gentle Reader) but thou art very well acquainted with the hardness
of translation, and how uneasy it it is to translate a Greek Author into our
english tongue, that it should carry that grace and elegancy, as in the
original. For as a fruitful tree being removed out of a fertile soil, into a
barren, doth rather wither ^d become unfruitful, then to bring forth such and
the like kind of fruit as formerly it did; so doth it happen with a diverse
translation: so that the first translation cannot have the grace of the
original, nor a second translation, that of the first, but must needs seem
more harsh and barren then the first: So I fear me it will happen with these
Aphorisms, which were first written in Greek by the Author, and after in
latin, and now as thou see in English. Wherefore if thou dost find any
faults committed, or any mistaking in the translation, my request is that thou
wilt rather wink at a small fault, until it may be amended, then to carpe
with Zoilus, and do nothing thy self. Well, what the labour hath been to the
Translator, sapientum sit iudicium; this I am sure, it is for thy profit if
thou list, and for the benefit of all such as do not understand either greek
or latin. And if thou accept of this work kindly, thou may have it
hereafter in better fashion, and perhaps with a Comment. In the mean time use
these, and let the Translator have thy good word: and so fare thou well.

The Aphorisms of Hypocrates Prince of Physicians.
The Argument of the 1. Section.
THis first Section of Aphorisms doth handle for the most part the Dietarie
part of Physic; prescribing not only the measure observation in meates and
drinks for soud bodies, but also for those bodies that are sick and diseased,
with a moderation also of labour and exercise.

Aphorism. 1.
THe life of man is short, the Art of Physic long, occasion sudden,
experience uncertain, judgment difficult. Neither is it sufficient that the
Physician do his office, unless also the Patient, and those which are
attedants about him do their duty, and that outward things be as well
ordered as those that are given inwardly.

[2]
In distempratures, loosnesse, flux of the belly, and vomitings, which do come
of their own accorde; if those things be purged which ought to be purged,
they are easily suffered, are profitable: but if it be otherwise it falls
out contrary. In like sort if such an emptying of vessels be done as should
be, it is well suffered: but otherwise it is hurtful. Wherefore, discreet
consideration is to be had, both of the region the time, as also of the age and
the quality of the disease for which such things ought to be evacuated, or
else not.

[3]
The full habit and state of the bodies of wrestlers and Champions if it come
to the highest degree of fullness is dangerous, for it cannot continue or
remain in the same state: and when it cannot so remain, nor grow into a
better habit, it remains that it must needs decline into a worse. Wherefore
that ouer-full plight of body must be speedily dissolved, to the end it may
take a beginning of new nourishment: Neither must we proceed so far that the
vessels be quite empty void (for that is dangerous) but we must proceed so
far as Nature will bear tolerate. So, extreme euacuations are perilous, so
again extreme repletions are likewise dangerous.

[4]
A small slender diet, in long lingering diseases is always dangerous: so in
sharp sickness when it is not convenient. And again diet reduced to extreme
slederness is as full of peril as extreme repletio fulness is laborious
painful.

[5]
The sick may offend in a slender diet: for thereby it happens that they grow
worse; for every error in this case is wont to prove more dangerous, then
should be. Wherefore a very slender diet and too precise is somewhat dangerous to
a sound healthful body, because they endure the errors thereof with more
difficulty. Wherefore a thin exact manner of diet for the most part is more
dangerous then that which is a little more full and plentiful then should be.

[6]
To extreme diseases extreme and exquisite remedies are the best.

[7]
When therefore the disease is sharpe, hath forthwith most extreme pains and
passions, we must use a most exceeding slender diet when it is so: but in the
contrary we may minister a fuller, and give more nourishment: and as the
disease shall decline we may remit the manner of thin diet, by little and
little, give the patient more meat.

[8]
When the force of the disease is greatest, then a most sparing diet is to be
kept and observed.

[9]
But we must conjecture by the sicke-man, whether he be able to hold out, and
persist with the prescribed diet, even to the state and uttermost extremity
of the disease, or may faint or fail, and being too weak with such diet may
yield the victory to the disease, before it retire be quayled.

[10]
In diseases which shall come instantly to their state, we must instantly
administer slender diet, but in the which shall not come so soon to state, we
must a little diminish diet: both in the time of the vigour, extremity, and
also a little about the time of the fit: but before we may allow more liberal
diet, that the sick man may be able to hold out.

[11]
In fits and their fierce invasions, we must take away meat; for then to give
it, it is hurtful: and when diseases do return by circuit, or course, in the
recourse of those fits we must use abstinence.

[12]
The diseases themselves, the seasons of the year, the observation of the
proportion of the periods between themselves, whether they be made daily or by
certain days returning by course, as the second or every other day, or by
greater distace of time, will show the sharp invasions state of the diseases.
Likewise, signs tokens are taken fro those things which do appear
afterwards. As for example, in a Plurisy, if the corrupt matter avoided by
spitting do presently appear in the beginning, it declares the disease shall
be but short; but if it be longer before it do appear it declares to
continue longer. Moreover vrines, the excremets of the belly and sweats do
declare and show the diseases to prove either easy or difficult, short, or
long.

[13]
Very old men do most easily in dure fasting, and next to the those of
middle age, young men not so well, children worst of all; and amongst the
chiefly those which are of the more cheerful, quick and lively nature then
the rest.

[14]
They which grow and increase have great store of natural heate: therefore
because they need plentiful and copious nourishment, we must abundantly
supply the same: otherwise the body is consumed. But in old men there
remains but little heate: therefore, they need not so much norishmet to kindle
the same, for a small fire is extinguished with abundance of fuel: for that
cause fevers which happen to old folk are not so sharpe because their bodies
are not so hot.

[15]
The venters by nature are most hot in winter and the spring time the sleeping
most long: wherefore at those seasons we ought to afford most meat, because
they have most natural heate: whereby it comes to pass that they need more
abundant and plentiful food. Of which thing the differences of ages and the
bodies of Champions and wrestlers are manifest arguments.

[16]
A moist diet is profitable to all perplexed with agues; but especially to
children others which have accustomed to use such diet.

[17]
We must consider whom it may be convenient to feed once or twice, more, or
less, and by little little: we must attribute something to the season, region,
ages and custom.

[18]
Sickly folk do most hardly brook store of meat in summer, in winter most
easily, in the spring time not so easily.

[19]
Nothing must be given to them, neither must they be constrained to take meat
which have fits returning at certain determined courses: but we ought to
diminish food before manifest tokens appear to judge of the disease.

[20]
We ought not to move, alter, or change those things which are, or have been
justly determined by nature, either with medicines or other procurements, but
to let them alone.

[21]
Carry those things which are to be drawn out, thither whither they shall
seem to incline, and bend, by such ways and places fittest for coueiance
expulsion.

[22]
We must move with medicine those things which are concocted digested; and not
those things which are raw and vndigested: Neither in the beginning of
diseases unless they be provoked by their own force and violence, which very
seldom comes to pass.

[23]
Things evacuated and purged are not to be estimated by the multitude, but
advisedly to be considered if those things be avoided sent forth which should
ought to be, and if also the Patient do easily endure it. Also when it is
needful we must evacuate even to souning fainting of life, if the Patient be
Meaning bloud-letting.
able to endure it.

[24]
In sharpe diseases, and in their beginning we ought seldom to use a purging
medicine: Neither must it be done without great advise judgment.

[25]
If those things be avoided and purged which should be, it doth good the sick
can easily suffer it: but if the contrary be evacuated, they do painefully
endure it.

The end of the first section of the Aphorisms. Now follows the second.
The Argument of the se cond Section of Aphorisms.
THIS second Section, of which the universal and full scope, or intention cannot
well be assigned and set down, hath many things appertaining to the Doctrine
of Ages, Signs, Nature purgation.

[1]
IF sleep bring pain and labour in the disease, it is a mortal sign: but if
it bring ease and mitigation of pain the sign is not deadly.

[2]
When a Delirium raving, is appeased by sleep it is a good sign.

[3]
Sleep and watching, if they be immoderat shall exceed a mean, are evil.

[4]
Neither satiety, neither hunger, neither any other thing which shall exceed
the measure of nature, can be good or healthful.

[5]
Weariness and dullness proceeding of their own accord do signify diseases to
come.

[6]
They which suffer pain of any part of the body, and do not almost feel the
pain have their understanding distempered and diseased.

[7]
Bodies extenuated and wasted with long sickness are to be restored and
refreshed by little and little: but those which have been brought lowe quickly
and in short time are sooner to be restored.

[8]
If any man eating meat after a sickness, doth not recover strength; it
argues his body is burdened and oppressed with too much store of food: But if
the same hap to one feeding meanly, we must understand that he hath need of
evacuation.

[9]
By how much the more thou shalt nourish cherish impure corrupt bodies, by so
much the more thou shalt harm and hurt them.

[10]
He which will purge bodies must make them fluxible and apt to flovve before.

[11]
It is more easy to be restored with drink the with meat.

[12]
Those things which are left behind after the Crysis in the body after
sickness, they are wont to bring forth back-sliding diseases again.

[13]
The night which goes before the fit and invasion is wont to be tedious and
grievous to them to whom the Crysis is caused, but the night following is wont
to be more easy and light.

[10]
The alteration of the excrementes not made to the worse part, in the fluxes of
the belly is good.

[15]
When the upper parts of the throat or gullet are sore, or a breaking out of
wheales do arise in the body, it behooves us to look upon the excrements: for
if they shall be choleric the body is also sick: but if they shall be like
the excrements of sound persons the body may be cherished without danger.

[16]
When hunger bears sway, we must rest from much stirring or labour.

[17]
When overmuch meat is received against nature, it causes sickness: as the
manner of curing diseases, proceeding from repletion doth declare.

[18]
The excretions and auoydings of excrements are wont to be quick, if they come
of those things which do nourish speedily and plentifully.

[19]
Praedictions and foretellings of death or health in sharp diseases are not
altogether certain.

[20]
They which in young age have their belly moist and loose, in old age have it
dry and hard: and contrariwise they which being young men have their womb or
belly dry and costyue, being aged have the same moist and laxe.

[21]
Drinking of strong wine puts away hunger.

[22]
Diseases which are bred of sacietie and surfeting are cured by evacuation: and
those which proceed from emptiness are cured by fulness: and in other things,
contraries are the remedies of cotraries.

[23]
Acute and sharpe diseases are judged and determined within fourteen days (and
have their Crysis.)

[24]
The fourth day is the Index of the seventh: the eightth day the beginning of
the week following. Also the eleventh day is to be considered, for that is the
fourth day of the second week. And again, the seventeenth day is to be
considered, for that is the iiij* from the fowrteenth, and the seventh from the
eleventh.

[25]
The Quart fevers of the summer are for the most part short: but the Autumnal
long; especially those which remain unto the winter: which are most long.

[26]
It is better that a fever should succeed a conuulsion, then that a conuulsion
should succeed a fever.

[27]
We ought not to be too confident, if any thing more easy light do happen in
sharp diseases without any great reason: neither to be troubled if any thing
more grievous do suddenly fall out. For, many such things are uncertain,
neither are they wont to persist* and continue long.

[28]
If the body of them which have a sharpe fever* do abide all at one stay,
nothing abated, or else is melted and wasted away beyond reason, it is a very
evil sign: for the first doth signify a continuance of the disease, and the
latter a great weakness and imbecility of nature.

[29]
In the beginnings of diseases, if any thing seem good to be moved for
evacuation, move it: but being in their state it is far better to let it alone.

[30]
About the beginnings and end of diseases, all things are more calm and
remiss: in the vigour and state more vehement.

[31]
If the body thrive not to him that after a disease feeds well, it is evil.

[32]
Those which in the beginning of sickness do feed much, and do not prosper
therewith, all such for the most part do at last fall into a loathing of meat.
On the contrary, those which in the beginning do vehemently abhor food,
afterwards desire much meat, are more easily freed from their sickness.

[33]
In any disease (similar, instrumental, or common) if reason be not weakened
nor hurt, but that they are desirous of those things which are offered, it is
good: but if it be otherwise it is an evil thing.

[34]
They are not so dangerously sick, to whose nature, age, habit, or season, the
disease in familiar and agreeable, as they to whom the disease is not agreeable
in any of those proportions.

[35]
It is better in any disease that the parts adjoining to the Navel and
nethermost belly be somewhat thick and gross: for the extenuation and
consumption of them is evil: and then it is not safe to minister purgatios
working downwards.

[36]
Those which are endued with health of body, do quickly faint, drinking a
purging potion: and so in like manner those are impaired which do use naughty
and corrupt nourishment.

[37]
Those which are of sound and perfect health of body do painefully and
grievously endure purging medicines.

[38]
Those meats and drinks which are worse yet pleasant, are to be preferred
before those which are better, but yet unpleasant and distasting.

[39]
For the most part old men are not so often sick as the young are. But being
once taken with long diseases they most commonly die of them.

[40]
Rheums desceding down to the mouth, and falling down to the throat, do not
come to concoction in those which are very old.

[41]
They die suddenly, which do often and exceedingly sown and faint without
any manifest cause.

[42]
Thou shalt never cure a strong apoplexy* and also a weak one very hardly.

[43]
Strangled and suffocated folk, being not as yet dead, do not return to
themselves, if about their mouth there shall appear spume or some collected
and gathered together.

[44]
Those that are very gross by nature, do enjoy shorter life then those which
are lean.

[45]
Change and alteration of place and diet, then also most especially of age,
doth deliver children from the Epilepsia Falling evil.

[46]
Of two pains at one time not possessing the self same place, that which is
the more vehement, doth dull the sense and feeling of the other which is not so
vehement.

[47]
Whiles the filthy and corrupt matter is digesting, pains, and agues do
rather happen, then when it is digested and brought to maturation.

[48]
In every exercise of the body, when it begins to be wearied,
straightwaies rest doth mitigate the wearisomnesse.

[49]
Those which are accustomed to daily labours, although they be weak or old
men, do more easily endure accustomed exercises: then those which are not
accustomed to them although they be strong and young men.

[50]
Things accustomed a long time, although they be worse, are wont to be less
grievous then those things unaccustomed: wherefore also a change is to be
made to unaccustomed things.

[51]
It is dangerous, at one time much and suddenly either to empty, fill, hear,
or to cool, or by any other means to move or stir the body: for any thing
passing the bounds of mediocrity is an enemy to nature: for that is safe which
is done by little and little, both at other times and also most especially when
an alteration and change is to be made from one thing to an other.

[52]
He must not pass forthwith from one medicin to an other, when all things,
fall not out so well as they should to him which doth proceed by good reason,
so that remain still which seemed to him to be so from the beginning.

[53]
Those which have a moist womb or belly, do pass their youthful age more
easily then those which have the same dry: but they pass their old age more
hardly with more difficulty; for when they wax old for the most part it is
dried.

[54]
As greatness talness of of body is comely to the state of young age, so it is
more unprofitable than littleness, lowe stature, in old age.

The end of the second Section of the Aphorisms of Hypocrates.
Here follows the third Section.
The Argument.
THis third book is almost reduced to the discourse of ages or times,
expressing unto us two Common places, that is to say the strength and the
forces of ages, and the diversity of diseases throughout those ages and times.

[1]
Alteration and variableness of the seasons do most especially bring forth
diseases, and likewise great alterations of cold and heate in those seasons,
and of other things answering to them in proportion.

[2]
Some natures are well, or ill in the summer season, and others are well or ill
in the winter.

[3]
Some diseases are well or ill affected, some more to one time, and some to an
other; some ages more to some one time, place, kind of diet, then they are to
an other.

[4]
Autumnall diseases are to be expected in these seasons, when on the self
same day, it is some times hot, and some times cold.

[5]
The South wind dulls the hearing, obscures and darkneth the sight,
offends the head with aches and rhumes, procures causes heaviness
faintness in the members. When therefore it is frequent and blows often, such
things happen and are incident to the weak and sickly. Contrariwise* the North
wind causes coughs, exasperates and excoriateth the jaws, hardneth the
belly, suppresses urine, stirs up cold shiuerings, and shakings,
engenders pains of the side and breast. Therefore when this wind bears sway,
those that are weak and feeble, must expect and look for such accidents.

[6]
When summer is like the spring time, we must expect much sweating in agues.

[7]
Sharpe Agues are engendered with great droughts and dryness: and if the year
proceed to be such as the state of the season is, which it hath affected, we
must expect such kinds of diseases.

[8]
In certain and moderat times, observing their seasonablenesse, certain and
seasonable diseases having a happy determination, are engendered: But in
uncertain, wavering, and unseasonable times, uncertain diseases are engendered
(whose Crysis is accompanied with grievous accidents.

[9]
In Autumn universally there are most sharpe and pernicious diseases: but the
spring time is most wholesome and not dangerous.

[10]
Autumn is hurtful to such as are in a consumption.

[11]
Amongst the parts of the year, if the winter shall be dryer and the wind
northernly, and the spring much raining and the wind southerly it must of
necessity fall out, that in summer sharpe agues, rhtums in the eyes, bloody
fluxes do happen, especially to women and to men being moist by nature.

[12]
Contrarily, if winter shall be southerly, full of rain, and warm, and the
spring dry northernly, women whose childebirth and deliverance happens near
the spring do upon the least occasion suffer aborsment and untimely birth: or
if they be deliuened at their due time, they bring forth such weak and diseased
children, so that either they die quickly, or live but leanly and sickly. To
others there happens bloody fluxes and hot inflammations of the eyes, and to
old men rhumes which do quickly bring destruction.

[13]
Summer being dry and the wind northernly, Autumn full of rain and the wind
southernlie, vehement pains of the head are to be expected in the winter
following. Also, coughs hoarsnesse, and rhumes, distillings at the nostrills,
to some pining consumptions.

[14]
A northernly and dry Autumn is profitable and good to men which are moist by
nature, and also to women: to others, it causes hot inflammations in the eyes,
and fevers partly sharp and partly long, and some also are troubled with
melancholy by (...)

[15]
Of all the seasons thorough-out the whole year, dryness and droughts are more
wholesome and less dangerous to mans life, then daily showers of rain and
moisture.

[16]
When much rain showreth down, these diseases for the most part are ingedred,
that is to say, long continuing agues, fluxes of the belly, corruption of the
humours, falling sickness, apoplexies, or the dead palsies, the squinances in
the throat: but when there is much dryness and drought there happens
consumptions, rhumes in the eyes ^ines of the joints, difficulty in making
vrin, and the passion of the Intestins.

[17]
Daily seasons of weather being northernly do close and strengthen the bodies,
they make them more movable and nimble, better coloured, and more strong and
able in hearing: they dry harden the belly, but they bite offend the eyes: and
if any pain have before possessed the breast, they make it more fierce and
grievous. Contrarily, southernely constitutions do loose and moysten those
bodies, they dull the hearing, they bring giddiness of the head, they bring
mistiness, and dimness of the eyes, dullness and laziness to the body, they
make the belly loose and laxative.

[18]
As touching Seasons of the year, in the spring and prime of summer, children
and those which are nearest to them in age, do live best in health. But in
summer in some part of Autumn old men live best: but in the rest of Autumn
and winter they which lead a middle age.

[19]
Any diseases are engendered in any times of the year: yet many are rather
caused and stirred, in someone more then in an other.

[20]
In the spring there happens madness, Melancholy, the falling evil, fluxes of
blood, the Squinancie, rhumes, distillations of humours, coughs, leprosies, dry
scabs, Morphues and many ulcerous wheales, pushes, and pains of the joints.

[21]
In summer there are some of those specified before in the spring: also
continual fevers and burning agues, and many Tertians also and Quart agues,
vomitings, fluxes of the belly, inflammations of the eyes, pains of the ears,
vlcerations of the mouth, rotting and putrefying of the privy members, and
sweatings.

[22]
Also many summer diseases are in Autumn, both Quartans also uncertain and
wandering agues, swellings of the spleen, hydropsie, consumptions, strangurie,
loosnesse and excoriation of the bowels, aches of the huckle bone, the
squinancie, shortness of breath, a straight pressing or drawing together of the
bowels in some part of them, the falling sickness, madness melancholy.

[23]
In winter are engendered plurisies, inflammation of lungs, lethargy, rheum in
the nostrils, hoarsnesse coughs, pains of the breast sides, and loins,
headaches, swimming and gyddinesse of the head, (causing dimness to the eyes)
Apoplexies (or sudden deprivation of the senses.)

[24]
But as concerning ages, these diseases do happen to little children, and
lately borne; ulcers in the mouth, vomiting, coughs, want of sleep, great
fears, inflammations of the nauill, moist running at the ears.

[25]
The time of teeth-breeding coming, there happens itching of the gums, fevers,
convulsions, fluxes of the belly; especially when they bring forth their
teeth, and most principally to those children which are most fat and gross
and have their belly hard and bound.

[26]
To those children which are a little bigger there doth happen inflammations of
the almondes of the mouth, disioynting dislocation of the turning joints in the
nape of the neck inwardly, shortness of wind, breeding of the stone round worms,
gut worms, long hanging warts, unnatural erection of the Yard, difficulty* in
making of water, Scrophulus in the neck, and other risings, especially those
before declared.

[27]
Moreover, to those which are greater and coming to ripe age, there happen
many of those former diseases* but more often, long continuing agues, and flux
of blood issuing out of the nostrells.

[28]
The diseases of children for the most part, some of them do attain to the
Crysis, or alteration within 40. days: some within seven months: some within
seven years, others when they come to ripe age. But those which shall continue
longer, and shall neither be dissolved, to men children when they come to ripe
age, nor to may den children when their monthly terms break forth, Hi
consenescere consueuerunt.

[29]
To young men* there doth happen spytting of blood, consumptions, sharpe
fevers, falling sickness, and other diseases, but chiefly these now
rehearsed.

[30]
To those which have passed beyond this young age, there doth happeu
shortness of breath, impostumes of the lungs, lethargies, frenzies, burning
fevers, long fluxes of the belly, choleric passions, or flowing of the gall,
bloody fluxes, fluxes of the stomach and belly of meates indigested, the
Haemorrhoides and such like.

[31]
To old men doth happen difficulty hardness of breathing, Rhumes, with the
cough, strangurie or avoiding of vrin by dropmeale, Disuria difficulty of
making vrin, aches of the joints, the stone in the kidneys, gyddinesse of the
brain, Apoplexies, or dead palsies, an evil habit or disposition of the body
called Cachexia, itching of the whole body, watchfulnes want of sleep,
moistness and humidities of the belly, eyes, and nostrills, dimness of the
sight, Glaucoma, and dullness of hearing.

The end of the third Section of the Aphorisms of Hypocrates.
Here follows the iiij. Section.
The Argument.
THis fourth Section is variable; but for the most part is reduced to
evacuation and prognostic signs of future events.

[1]
Thou shalt purge childbearing women if it be needful, at the fowrth month
after conception, and so unto the seventh, but those more sparingly: but the
coception being young or elder thou shalt abstain.

[2]
Such things are to be drawn out of the body, by the use of purging medicines,
as they are which issuing forth of their own accord do help the same: but
those which issue forth in a contrary manner are to be stopped.

[3]
If such things be purged as should be, it doth good, and the patient doth
easily endure it: but if otherwise it be done, the patient doth endure it
painfully.

[4]
In summer it is more convenient to purge the upper venters, in the winter the
inferior by stool.

[5]
Under the Canicular or or dog-star, and before the dog-starre, purgations are
painful anp difficil.

[6]
Lean and slender men are easy to vomit, therefore must be purged by vomit,
unless it be in winter.

7* Purge those which do not vomit easily, and being in good plight, downwards
by stool, so it be not summer.

[8]
Do not purge them upwards which are subject to the phtisick or a consumption.

[9]
Thou shalt purge melancholic folk strongly by stool. In like manner
beginning the contrary way of purging. (For, light matter bending upwards
must be drawn out by the upper parts: But the heavier and grosser matter by
the lower parts.)

[10]
We must purge in very sharpe sicknesses, if the matter do move to the purging
of it; and that the very same day wherein the sickness doth begin: for delay
in such diseases is very hurtful and dangerous.

[11]
Those which have gripings wringings in the belly, and horrible pain about the
Navel and the loins, and cannot be eased and dissolved by medicin or
otherwise, they shall fall into a dry dropsy called, aqua inter cutem sicca
(which is a Timpanie.)

[12]
Those are not to be purged in winter by vomit without hurt, whose stomach and
belly cannot retain meat until it be digested.

[13]
Their bodies are to be made moist before hand with abundance and plenty of
food and also with ease and rest, which taking a potio of veratrum or
hellebor, do hardly and painfully vomit.

[14]
Elleborus being drunk, the body ought rather to be moved, then to be yielded
to sleep, or rest: for the sailing in a ship, doth manifest that our bodies
are stirred and provoked by motion.

[15]
When you will have Elleborus or veratrum to work more forcibly, move and
stir the body: but when you will stay it, procure sleep, and do not move.

[16]
Elleborus is very dangerous to them which have sound flesh, for it engenders
convulsion.

[17]
When he which is not sick of an ague doth loath his meat, hath a gnawing of
the mouth of the stomach, a darksome gyddinesse of the brain, and bitterness
of the mouth, hit signifies that he had need to be purged upwards.

[18]
Whosoever having need of purging hath pains about the myddryffe, it is a
sign that he must be purged upwards: but the pains which are under the same
do note a purging downwards to be needful.

[19]
Those which do not thirst whiles they are purged with a medicinal potion,
shall not leave purging until they shall thirst.

[20]
If there be wringings and gripings of the guts without a fever, heaviness
of the knees, and pain of the loins, they: signify that there is need of
purging downward.

[21]
Black excrements of the belly like unto black blood, coming forth of their
own accord, either with a fever or without a fever are most evil: and by how
much the more those evil colours shall be, by so much the more those excremets
shall be the worse: But such things to be expelled out by a medicin, is far
better, and that by how much the more colours there shall be of them.

[22]
In the beginning of any disease if black* choler come forth either above, or
beneath, it is dangerous pernicious.

[23]
Those which are pined and brought low by sharp or long diseases, or by
wounds, or any other means, and do avoid black choler, or as it were
black blood: do die the next day following.

[24]
A bloody flux if it proceed from black choler is mortal.

[25]
For blood to be carried upward of what kind soever it be, is an evil sign:
but if black blood be egested avoided downwards, it is good.

26
If any man being afflicted with a blouddie flux do avoid as it were little
pieces of flesh, it is a mortal sign.

27
To those which have store of blood flowing, fro what part soever in fevers:
their bellies become moist, after they have been refreshed.

28
Those which avoid choleric excrements downwards, if deafeness come upon the
same they do then cease fro avoiding of them: and on the other side, those
which are affected with deafnes are delivered from the same, by the avoiding of
choleric excrements.

[29]
If cold shakings hap to them which are sick of an ague the sixth day, they
have a difficult Crysis, and we cannot well judge of the disease.

[30]
In them which are afflicted with fits of Agues, howsoever the ague shall leave
them; if it return again the same hour the next day, it is wont to have a
difficult Crysis and determination.

31
Apostumes are caused near the joints, and especially nigh the jaw bones, or
madible, to them which feel weariness, and lassitude in fevers.

[32]
Those which recovering and amending from a disease, and have some place
grieved with payne, shall have apostums, or botches in the same place.

[33]
But if any part shall be pained before the disease, the seat and abiding of
the disease is there.

[34]
If a suffocation or stopping of the breath do happen upon a sudden to one
afflicted with a fever, no swelling appearing in the jaws, or gullet, it is
deadly.

[35]
If to one afflicted with a fever the neck be suddenly turned awry, and he
can scant swallow, and there be no swelling, it is deadly.

[36]
Sweats are good to those sick of an ague, which begin to issue forth the
third day, fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, fowreteenth, seueteenth, one and
twentieth, seven and twentieth, thirty one, and thirty four: for those sweats
work the dissolution of the disease: those which happen otherwise, signify
pain, and length of the disease, or a return of the same.

[37]
Cold sweats with a sharp fever, do verily betoken death: but with a more mild
gentle ague, length of the disease.

[38]
In what part of the body the sweat is, there is the disease.

[39]
And also in what part of the body there is heate, or cold, there the disease
is settled.

[40]
And when alterations do happen in the whole body so that the body be
cooled, and heated again by turns, or one colour arise after an other, they
signify continuance of the disease.

[41]
Much sweating* caused thorough sleep, doth signify that the body is sed with
store of meat: but if this hap to one feeding sparingly, we must know that
there is need of evacuation.

[42]
When there is much sweat, cold, or hot, always issuing forth, the cold doth
signify the disease to be more grievous: and the hot sweat doth note the
disease to be less grievous.

[43]
Fevers continual which afflict every third day more vehemently and do not
cease, are the more dagerous: but by what manner soever they shall cease, and
pause, they signify that there is no present danger.

(44)
Swellings and pains about the joints are caused to them which are afflicted
with long agues.

[45]
Those which have swellings and pains of the joints after agues, do feed over
liberally.

[46]
If a cold shivering fit, the fever being without intermission, do assail
the sick man being already weak, it is a deadly sign.

[47]
Excrements avoided in fevers not intermittent, by vomit or spitting, if they
be of a leaden colour, blodie, choleric, or stinking, are all evil: but if
they come forth conveniently, and easily, they are good. Also, the same
consideration is to be had of those things avoided by the belly, and urines.
But if any thing be avoided by those places, which doth not help, it is
evil.

[48]
In continual fevers, if the outward parts are cold, the inward do burn, and
the patient be thirsty, it is a deadly sign.

[49]
In continual fevers, if the lip, eye, brows, or nose, be perverted or
turned awry, if the sickeman do not see, nor hear, which-so-euer of these
shall happen the body being weak, death is near at hand.

[50]
If there happens in a continual fever, difficulty and hardness of breathing,
with delirium, and doting, the signs are deadly.

[51]
Apostumes in fevers which are not dissolved in the first Crysis, or
judgements, they signify length of the disease.

[52]
It is not absurd to weep and shed tears in fevers and other diseases,
voluntarily: but to weep against the will is very absurd, inconvenient.

[53]
They have fierce vehement fevers, which have a tough clammy moisture about
their teeth in those fevers.

[54]
Those which have dry coughs provoking little, are not wont to be very
thirsty, in burning fevers.

[55]
All fevers proceeding from the tumors in inguine and other adenosus parts, are
evil, except those fevers which are called Ephemerae, and last but one day.

[56]
Sweat coming* upon one sick of an ague, the ague not ceasing, is evil: for
the disease is prolonged, and it signifies that there is much moisture.

[57]
If a fever happen to the cramp, Spasmus, or Tetanus: then it dissolveth the
cramp.

[58]
If a cold shaking fit do com upon him which hath a burning fever, then a
deliverance from the disease is procured by it.

[59]
An exquisite, and perfect Tertian fever, comes to his Crysis or state in
seven circuits or fits, at the utmost.

[60]
Those that wax deaf and thick of hearing thorough fevers* are delivered
from that disease by flux of blood at the nose, or by flux of the womb.

[61]
Unless the fever shall leave the patient in the odd days, it is accustomed
to return again.

[62]
Those which have the yellow Iaundis happening unto them upon agues, before the
seventh day, have an evil sign.

[63]
Those fevers which have their cold shaking fits returning at a certain day,
are dissolved the same day.

[64]
It is a good thing for them which have the yellow iaundes coming on them in
fevers on the seventh day, ninth, eleventh, or fourteenth day: unless the
right hypocondrium be hard: for then it is not good but evil.

[65]
In fevers, a vehement heat about the stomach, a gnawing about the heart, is an
evil thing.

[66]
Convulsions in sharpe fevers, and vehement pains about the bowels, are evil.

[67]
In fevers, great fears through sleep, or convulsion, do prognosticate evil.

(68)
The breath not keeping due course is evil: for it doth signify convulsion.

(69)
Urines with a fever being thick, clotted, and little in quantity, do profit
them which make them, if afterwards thin urines, and much in quantity be
avoided of them: but those urines most commonly become such in which the
Hypostasis or sediment, shall appear straight after they are made, or not long
after.

[70]
Those which have their water troubled or unclean in agues, such as are the
waters of Cattle, have or shall have headache.

[71]
Those which shall have their Crysis or alteration of the disease the seventh
day, have a little red Cloud in the urine the 4. day, and other things
thereunto belonging accordingly.

[72]
Urines very clear and white are very evil, especially if they appear in
those which are afflicted with frenzy.

[73]
Those which have an inflation of the Hypocondria, and a rumbling pain of the
loins succeeding, have their belly moystned and loosned, except the winds
break forth downwards, or store of urine do issue forth: and these things
happen in fevers.

[74]
To those that doubt of apostumations to come about the joints, much vrin
thick, and white, doth deliver from the apostum, such as is wont to be avoided
in painful fevers, the fowrth day: when also blood shall issue forth of the
nostrils there shall be a dissolution and a deliverance speedily.

(75)
If any peace blood or filthy matter, it signifies an exulceration of the
kidneys or bladder.

[76]
Those which have small pieces of flesh, and as it were hairs, issuing forth
together with thick urine, do avoid those excrements from the kidneies.

(77)
Those which avoid with thick vrin certain branny contents, have their bladder
infected with an ulcer, or scabbednesse.

(78)
It is signified to them which piss blood upon the sudden, that there is some
vein of the kidneys broken.

(79)
They in whose vrin there appears an Hypostasis or sediment full of sand, have
their bladder or kidneies diseased with the stone; but especially the bladder,
because it hath a very spacious hollowness or cauity.

[80]
If any one peace blood or clotts of blood make his water by drops, having
pain in that part of the belly (which is between the navel and the secret
parts) named hypogastrion, or at the seame-line of the skinnne of the coddes,
called perinaeum, and at the place called pecten* (where the hair about the
privy members grows) then the places about the bladder are diseased.

[81]
If any one peace blood or filthy matter, or little scales, and there be also
a stinking or strong smell, it doth betoken an exulceration of the bladder.

[82]
Those which have an apostume bred in the vrinarie passage, or conduit of the
water, they are delivered from it, the same being brought to suppuration
broken.

[83]
Voiding of much vrin in the night, doth signify final evacuation of
excrements by the fundament.

The end of the fourth Section of the Aphorisms of Hypocrates.
Here follows the 5* Section.
The Argument.
THe fifth Book or Section is variable yet almost it doth wholly entreat of the
diseases of women, of the good and bad dispositions of the womb.

[1]
A Conuulsion by taking Elleborus is deadly.

(2)
A Convulsion after a wound, is pernicious and deadly.

[3]
The hicket or a convulsion, after a copious flux of blood, is evil.

[4]
After an immoderat purgation (which the Greeks call Hypercatharsis) a
convulsion or hicket is evil.

[5]
If any drunken man do suddenly wax dumb, he shall die with convulsion,
unless he be taken with a fever, or presently recover his speech at that
hour in which the surfeit is dissolved.

[6]
Those which are taken with the cramp or distention, named Tetanus, do die
within four days: but if they shall overpass them, they recover their
health.

(7)
The falling sickness which is before ripeness of age, is removed away: but
that which happens after the 25. year of the age doth for the most part
accompany us unto death.

[8]
Those which are sick of a pleurisy, unless they be purged upwards, within
fowrteene days shall have the disease turned into an impostume.

[9]
A consumption most especially happens in those ages which are fro the 18*
year to the thirty and fifth year*

[10]
Those which have the evil cause of the squinancie converted into the lungs,
do dry within seven days: but if they escape them, they are affected with
corrupt and filthy matter (called empiema)*

(11)
If the spittle which they avoid by coughing that are affected with a
consumption, do stink strongly being cast upon the coals, and the hairs of
the head do fall off, it is a pernicious deadly sign.

(12)
If a flux of the belly happen to them which have their hair falling away by
a consumption, death is near at hand.

(13)
Those which cough forth frothy blood, do ^etch and draw the same out of the
lungs.

(14)
If a flux of the belly come upon him which is in a consumption it is a
pernicious sign.

(15)
Those which are infected with an impostume by a pleurisy, if they be purged
from the corrupt matter within forty days after the breaking of the apostume,
are cured, or otherwise they pass into a consumption.

(16)
Hot water too often used brings these discommodities; tenderness of the
flesh, distemperature of the sinews, heaviness drowsiness of the mind,
fluxes of blod, swounings, faintings of life to which death is incident.

(17)
But the use of cold water brings convulsions, the cramps called Tetani,
blackness cold shakings usual in some fevers.

(18)
Cold water is hurtful to the bones, teeth, sinews, brain, and marrow of the
back: but that which is hot is good and profitable.

[19]
We must heate those things which are ouercold; except those which power forth
blood, or are inclined to power forth blood, in short time*

[20]
Cold water bites and nips ulcers, hardneth the skin, hinders the
soreness from maturation of the corrupt matter, causes, blackness, brings
forth cold shivering fits of* agues, convulsions, cramps, and distention of
the sinews.

[21]
Notwithstanding, there is some time, when in the cramp without an ulcer in a
well fleshed young man in the midst of summer, plentiful pouring out of cold
water doth call back the heate, and so the heate doth dissolve the cramp.

(22)
Hot water yields unto us a great token of security, and safety in that ulcer
and sore in which it causes ripe and well digested matter: it softneth and
mollifies the skin, it makes it thin, it doth appease pain, it
mitigateth and asswageth cold shakings, convulsions, the cramps (named Tetani)
it dissolveth heaviness and pain of the head, it profits broken bones very
much, especially if they be bare without flesh; and principally in the head:
also it profits those things which are mortified exulcerated through cold.
Lastly, it is profitable to eating ulcers in the sudamet, privy members,
womb, bladder: to all those, hot water is a friend and comforter, but cold
water is an enemy and a destroyer.

[23]
We must use cold water to those sores from whence blood doth issue, or is
about to issue, and not to be applied in the same place by which it issues but
to those places from whence it flows. And if any inflammation or burning of
the parts, do incline to a red and bloody colour with fresh clear blood,
apply cold things, or cold water unto them: but if the inflammations be
inveterate and old, it makes them black. Also it helps the fiery
inflammation, named Erysipelas, if it be not ulcerated. For, being ulcerated it
hurts.

(24)
Things that are very cold, as snow, and ye, are hurtful to the breast,
they procure coughs, they cause ruptures of the veins, and also rhumes.

(25)
Cold water powered forth abundantly, doth ease and diminish the tumours and
pains of the joints, which are without vlceration, also gowty swellings and
pains and convulsions for the most part, dissolveth dolor and pain: for a small
benumbing hath the force of dissolving and putting away of pain.

(26)
Water that is quickly made hot, quickly cold, is most light.

(27)
It is good for them which have great desire to drink in the night to fall a
sleep, being very thirsty.

(28)
A fumigation, or perfume, of odoriferous spices doth bring forth the terms.
It would also be profitable for many other things if it did not breed
heaviness and pain of the head.

[29]
Thou shalt purge a woman with child if it be needful, the fowrth month after
conception, and so forwards until the beginning of the seventh month: but
those that come near the seventh, month not so much: but the foetus* being
younger or elder thou shalt abstain.

[30]
A woman with child, a vein being opened, aborteth is delivered before due
time: and so much the rather, if the foetus be of any bigness.

[31]
It is pernicious deadly if a woman great with child be taken with any
sharp disease.

[32]
A woman is cured from vomiting blood, her mothly terms issuing forth.

[33]
A flux of blood at the nose is good and healthful to a woman, her flowers
failing contrary to the due course of nature.

[34]
If the womb be very laxative and loose to a woman with child, there is
danger of aborcement.

[35]
Sneesing happening to a woman grieved with suffocation of the womb, or having a
painful and difficult deliverance is good.

[36]
The monthly courses being discoloured, neither coming forth always in the
same manner, and time, do declare that a purgation is necessary for the woman.

[37]
If the paps be suddenly extenuated and become lank to a woman with child,
aborcement doth follow.

[38]
If one of the dugs be extenuated and become lank to a woman conceived with
child with twins, she brings forth one of them before due time: And if the
right dug become slender she brings forth the male child before due time, but
if the left dug become lank she makes aborcement of the female.

[39]
If any woman neither with child nor having bin delivered of child, have milk
in her breasts, her monthly courses have failed her.

[40]
Madness is signified to happen to those women in whose dugs or paps there is
blood collected and heaped together.

[41]
If you will know whether any woman have conceived or no: give her a potion of
honey water mixed together going to sleep: if she feel gripings and wringings
of the belly she hath conceived; if she do not, she hath not conceived.

[42]
If a woman conceived with child do bear a manchilde she is well and fresh
coloured: if she bear a maid child, she is ill coloured.

[43]
If the inflammation called Erysipelas be bred in the womb or mother, it is a
perniuous and deadly thing.

[44]
Those women which are very lean contrary to nature and do bear children;
do suffer untimely deliverance; until they come to better plight and be
fatter.

[45]
Those women which being reasonable fat making abortion the second, or third
month, without any manifest cause, have acetabula vteri plena mucoris, neither
are they able to cotaine the foetus because of his heavy weight (but those
Cotylidons being broken) it falls down.

[46]
Those which are fatter then Nature requires and do not conceive child, have
os vteri compressed, closed together by the omentum and cal of the guts, and
therefore they cannot conceive until they wax leaner.

[47]
If the womb shall apostumate in that part where it lies near the hip, or
huckle bone, it is necessary to cure it with tents lipped in liquid medicines
such as the Greekes do call Emmota.)

(48)
Men children do lie are carried on the right side of the womb, and women
children rather on the left side.

[49]
A medicine procuring sneesing, put into the nostrills, doth drive and force
out the secudine* so that you stop the nostrils mouth close with the hand.

[50]
If it please a woman to restrain her accustomed courses, apply a very great
cupping glass to her breasts.

[51]
Those women which are conceived with child, have the mouth or gate of the
mother shut and closed up.

(52)
If milk flow plentifully out of the dugs of a woman bearing a child in her
womb, it signifies that the child is weak: but if the paps be hard and
stiff, they declare a stronger coception.

[53]
The dugs and paps become slender and limber to those women which shall loose
their foetus. But contrarily, if the paps become hard, pain shall either
molest the paps, hips, eyes, or the knees, but they shall not suffer
aborcement.

[54]
Those women have the mouth or gate of the womb closed or shut up* which have
the same hard.

[55]
Childe-bearing women which are take with fevers, or are brought to a lowe
state without a manifest cause, do bring forth the birth painfully, and with
danger, or are in hazard of life by untimely unseasonable deliverance.

[56]
If a Convulsion or swouning happen to a flux of a woman's flowers, it is an
evil thing.

[57]
Women's terms flowing immoderately, diseases are engendered: being suppressed,
stopped of their due course, diseases do likewise happen from the womb.

[58]
The strangurie or dropping out of the vrin doth happen by the inflammation of
the straight gut, likewise of the womb or mother, to the reins that be
exulcerated: also if the liver be inflamed, the hicket or yexing doth happen in
the mean while.

[59]
If a woman do not conceive, and thou would know if she shall conceive at
all, let her be wrapped and lapped round about with clothes, and make a sum
under the lower parts: and if the sent be perceived to pass through her
body, to her nostrills, her mouth; know that she is not barren, by any
default in her self.

[60]
If the monthly purgations do keep their course to a woman with child, it is
impossible that the foetus should be in health.

[61]
If a woman's monthly courses stop, and she have neither shivering cold, nor
ague coming upon her, and she loath her meat, make account that she is
conceived.

62
Those women which have their womb cold dry, do not conceive: and such as
have them over moist* cannot be conceived, for the seed is extinguished
perished in them. Also, those women cannot conceive, which have those places
over dry, and hot; for the seed becomes corrupted for want of due n^rishment.
But those women which have obtained a moderate temperature of the places in
respect of both the oppositions and contrarieties, do excel in
fruitfulness.

(63)
The same consideration and reason is likewise to be respected in men: for
either through the spoungy and poery substance of the body the spirits are
dissipated and scattered abroad, so that they cannot cast forth seed, or else
the moisture doth not issue forth because of his grossenesse thickness, or
else because of coldness it doth not conceive any heat, that it may be
collected in his proper place: or the very same thing doth may happen through
heate.

(64)
It is not good to give milk to them which are troubled with headache, or with
agues, nor to those which are troubled with the disease called status
Hypochondriacus, nor to those which are troubled with thirst. It is also nought
for them which avoid choleric excrements downwards, or to those which have
sharpe fevers, or have had some copious evacuation of blood. But it is good for
those which are in a consumption, so they be not troubled with any vehement
fever. It is also good for long lingering and mild agues, so that none of the
signs before spoken be present. It is good also for them which are brought
lowe without any apparent reason or occasion.

[65]
They are not much troubled with convulsions or with madness, which have
apparent and evident tumors with their ulcers or sores: But convulsions, and
the cramps (named Tetani) do happen to them to whom the tumors shall
suddenly vanish away, if it shall happen on the hinder part of the body: but
if they happen in the forehead, or fore-part, there happens madness, vehement
pain of the side, Empiema and spitting of matter, Dysenteria, if the tumors or
swellings shall be red.

(66)
If no tumour nor swelling appear in great and bad wounds, it is a great
euell.

(67)
Soft tumore aregoods but those which are hard and vndigested are evil.

(68)
To one which hath pain in the hinder part of the head, the venarecta in the
forehead being opened doth profit.

(69)
Cold shakings and shiuerings for the most part do begin to women from the
loins, and through the back do come to the head: But to men they do rather
begin in the back part then in the fore-part; as from the hinder part of the
thighs and from the elbows: the rarity and thinness of the skin is a
token there of* which thing the hair there growing doth declare and manifest.

[70]
These which are taken with a Quartain ague, are not much assaulted with
convulsions: but if before they have bin assailed, upon the coming of the
Quart they are delivered and freed.

[71]
Those which have their skinnearid, withered, and dry, do dye without sweat:
but those who have their skin loose, and open, do end their life with sweat.

[72]
Those that are diseased with the Iaundis, are not much molested with
windinesse.

The end of: the fifth Section of the Aphorisms of Hypocrates.
Here follows the 6. Section.
The Argument.
THIS sixth Section doth almost altogether concern that part of the Art, which
foretells good and evil things to happen in diseases.

[1]
In a long lubricity, and slipperinesse of the guts, if a sowrish belching do
happen, which was not before, it is a good sign.

[2]
Those which have their nostrils more moist then others by nature, and their
seed also, do enjoy their health but badly: but those which have the
contrary properties, do lead their life more healthfully.

[3]
In long difficulties, pains or fluxes of the bowels a loathing of meat is
evil: and with a fever it is more evil.

[4]
Ulcers or soars which are smooth and glaber, are maligne, and evil.

[5]
In the pain of the sides, and of the breast, and of the other parts, we must
learn if the sick do differ much, or keep at a stay.

[6]
The diseases and infirmities of the kidneies and bladder, are of hard
difficult curation in old men.

[7]
Dolours and pains of the belly being aloft in the upper part, are more light
and easy; not being aloft are more tedious and forcible.

[8]
Ulcers or sores arising in the body of those which are diseased with the
dropsy, are not easily cured.

(9)
Wheales being broad, are not very full of itching.

[10]
Corrupt matter, water, or blood issuing out by the nostrils, mouth, or ears,
dissolveth and cures a vehement grievous headache.

(11)
The Haemorrhoids happening to those which are troubled with melancholy and
pain of the kidneies, are good and profitable.

(12)
Unless in the cure of the Haemorrhoids which have long continued, there be one
vein kept open, it is to be feared that a dropsy or consumption will shortly
follow.

(13)
The hicket or yexing trobling or vexing us, is put away by sneesing.

(14)
If water flow, from the veins of him which is diseased with the dropsy, to
the belly, the disease is dissolved (if nature it self make evacuation.)

(15)
Vomiting coming by the benefit of nature, dissolveth and riddeth away a long
flux or looseness of the belly (by reason of the retraction drawing back of
the humours which did bend downwards.)

[16]
A looseness of the belly happening to one afflicted with a pleurisie, or the
disease of the lunges named peripneumonia, is an evil thing.

(17)
It is a good thing for him which is troubled with a waterish running of the
eyes called lippitudo, to be taken with a flux and looseness of the belly.

(18)
It is a deadly thing when the bladder is wounded, or the brain, or the heart,
the midriffe, any small gut, the stomach, or the liver.

[19]
A bone perished or cut off, or a cartilag, gristle or sinew, or any little
parcel of the eye lid, or the praeputium being diminished, do not grow or
join together.

[20]
If blood flow into the belly contrary to nature, it corrupts and is
putrified of necessity.

[21]
If the swelling of veins in the legs, named varices, or the Haemorrhoids,
shall happen to them which are mad and frantic, then the disease of madness
is dissolved.

(22)
Breaches or fluxes of humours which do descend fro the back to the elbow, are
dissolved by opening of a vein.

[23]
If fear and sadness do continue long, it is a sign of melancholy.

[24]
If any small or slender gut be wounded or pierced, it doth not close or
grow together again.

[25]
If the choleric tumor Erysipelas, being outward be returned inwards, it is
evil: but if being inward it be turned outwards it is a good thing.

[26]
Those burning fevers are dissolved with dotage, or raving, in which there are
trembling shakings.

[27]
If the corruption, matter, or water, do flow out altogether at once, from
them which are burnt, by catire, or cut, by the Surgeon for the cure of the
inward apostumation between the lungs and the breast, or of the dropsy, the
the diseased shall die without all doubt.

[28]
Eunuchs or gelded men are not diseased with the gout, neither do wax bald.

[29]
A woman is not troubled with the gout, unless her monthly terms do fail
her.

(30)
A young stripling is not troubled with the gout, before he hath used venery.

[31]
Drinking of strong wine, or a bath, a fomentation, phlebothomy (or letting of
blood) or a purgation doth cure pains of the eyes.

[32]
Those which slammer, are taken most commonly with a long flux of the belly.

(33)
Those which have sower belchings, are not much subject to a pleurisy.

[34]
Great swelling veins, named varices, are not incident to them which are bald:
but yet they have their hair growing again on their head, to whom the
swellings veins do happen being bald.

(35)
If a cough come upon them which are diseased with a dropsy, it is an evil
thing.

(36)
Phlobotomie, or bloudletting, cures the difficulty of making urine, but we
must open the inward veins.

[37]
If a tumour appear in the neck to him that is diseased with angina, it is a
good thing.

[38]
Those which have hidden or deep Cancers, are not to be healed or cured of
them: for they which are healed die sooner; and those which are not cured of
them live the longer.

(39)
A convulsion is caused either by repletion, or by evacuation: so is also the
hicket or yexing.

[40]
Those which have pain at the Hypocondrium without an inflammation, are cured
by a fever happening to them.

(41)
If corrupt matter give forth no signification, nor sign of it self in the
bodies of the diseased, the cause that it doth not disclose it self nor
appear, is either for the grossenesse and thickness of it self, or of the
place.

[42]
If the liver vvaxe hard to them which are affected with the yellow iaundis, it
is an evil thing.

[43]
The spleneticke, which are taken with a bloody flux of the bowels, do die of
a dropsy, or a slipperinesse of the bowels, called a lientery, following a
long flux.

[44]
They die within seven days, to whom the disease named Ileos, or pain in the
small guts, shall happen after a strangurie, unless a fever coming upon them,
store of urine shall issue forth.

[45]
If ulcers continue a year or longer, the bone of necessity must grow foul,
and be corrupted, and so hollow cicatrizes are caused.

[46)
Those which become crookt backed by shortness of wind, or a cough* before they
attain to ripeness of age, do die quickly.

[47]
Those are to be let blood or purged in the spring time to whom opening of a
vein or purging may do good.

[48]
The difficulty of the intestins, and guts, coming upon them which are
diseased with the spleen (viz. with hardness) is good.

[49]
Gouty diseases, the inflammation being assuaged, within forty days do
cease.

[50]
It must needs be that a fever, vomiting, and perbraking of choler must come
upon them which have their brain divided, or wounded.

[51]
Those which are in health being suddenly taken with headache and thereupon
presently become dumb, and snort, do die within seven days, unless a fever
come upon them in the mean while.

[52]
But we ought to behold in their sleeps also, if any part of the eyes do
appear underneath the lids: for if any thing appear of the white of them,
the eye lids not being fast closed, if it do not happen by a flux of the
belly or by some medicinal potion, it is an evil and a very deadly sign.

(53)
That doting which is done with laughter, is not so dangerous: but that which
is done with earnest sadness is more dangerous.

(54)
Painful breathings in sharp diseases with a fever, as it were, of such as
sigh, morn, are evil.

(55)
Pains of the got do most commonly afflict are provoked in the spring and
autumn.

(56)
The falling down of humours are very dangerous in melancholic diseases, at
these seasons, and do declare an apoplexy, or a covulsion, madness, or
blindness.

[57]
Also apoplexies are caused most especially from the fortith to the threescore
years.

(58)
If the Call Omentum shall hang forth of the body it putrifieth of necessity.

[59]
Those that are afflcted with long pain of the hips, having the huckle bone
coming forth returning in again into his place, have clammy phlegm collected
and gathered together in the hollowness of that part.

[60]
Those which have the huckle bone (being the head or upper part of the thigh)
coming out, and tormented with the ache called sciatica, shall have the thigh
of feeblished and consumed: and they do halt and are lame, unless they are
burned (with hot iron instruments.)

The end of the sixth Section of the Aphorisms of Hypocrates.
Here follows the 7. Section.
The Argument.
THIS seventh book is altogether prognosticall and foretelling things to come
in which he entreats of the presagements and foretokens of health and death.

[1]
Coldness of the extreme parts in sharpe diseases is evil.

(2)
Flesh black, and blew, because of a foul diseased bone, is an evil thing.

[3]
The hicket after vomiting, and also redness of the eyes, are evil.

[4]
After sweat, cold shiuerings, and shakings, are not good.

[5]
After madness which the Greekes call mania, a blodie flux, the dropsy, or an
ecstasy or trance is good.

[6]
Abhorring of meat in a long disease, and the excremets avoided downwards
without mixture of humours, are evil.

[7]
Cold shakings, and fond doting, after much drinking, is evil.

[8]
After the eruption of an impostume inwardly, faintness, and looseness of the
parts of the body, vomiting swouning doth ensue.

[9]
After a flux of blood, Delirium, or a convulsion is evil.

[10]
After the Iliack passion, vomiting, the hicket, doting and convulsion, are
evil.

[11]
An impostume of the lungs, named peripneumonia, after a pleurisie is evil.

[12]
A frenzy with a peripneumonia, is evil.

(13)
A convulsion or the cramp (Tetanus) because of hot burnings, is evil.

(14)
Astonishment, and doting called Delirium, thorough some blow of the head, is
an evil sign.

[15]
The spitting out of corrupt matter after the spitting of blood, is evil.

(16)
A consumption, or pthisis, and a flux of the belly, coming after spitting of
corrupt matter, are evil signs: for when the spitting is stopped the diseased
do die.

[17]
The hicket, or singult coming through an inflammatio of the liver, is evil.

[18]
A convulsion or delirium caused through watching, is an evil thing.

(19)
After the laying bare of a bone, the inflammation and hot tumor Erisipelas is
evil.

[20]
Putrefaction, or impostumation from the inflammation Erisipelas, is evil.

[21]
A flux of blood after a strong pulse, in ulcers is evil.

[22]
After a long pain of the parts belonging to the belly, an impostumation is
evil.

(23)
After avoiding of vnmixed excrements downwards, a bloody flux is evil.

(24)
Delirium, or foolishness doth ensue after the wound of a bone, if it shall
penetrate into the hollow or void space.

(25)
A convulsion after the taking of a purging potio brings death.

[26]
A great coldness of the extreme and utmost parts through vehement pain of of
the parts, pertaining to the belly, is evil.

(27)
If the disease, called tenasmus, shall happen to a woman with child, it is
the cause of aborcement.

[28]
If either a bone, cartilag or sinew shall be cut in the body, it doth neither
increase nor grow together again.

[29]
If a strong flux or looseness of the belly shall come upon him that is
diseased with the dropsy named leucophlegmatia, it dissolveth and cures the
disease.

(30)
They have a falling down of flegmaticke humours from the head, which do
avoid frothie and fomie excrements out of the belly in their laxnesse and
looseness of the same.

(31)
Sediments in urines made in the time of agues, like unto course wheat meal,
do signify that the sickness shall continuew long.

[32]
Choleric Sediments appearing in urines, but being before thin, and
waterish, do signify a sharpe disease.

[33]
Those which make diverse urines, have a vehement disturbance, and unquietness
in the body.

[34]
The urines, in which bubbles do swim aloft, do signify the disease of the
reins, and that the infirmity and weakness shall endure long.

[35]
It is a sign that the disease is of the reins, and a sharp disease to be
present, to them in whose vrin a fatty and thick superficies appears.

(36)
If also pains be caused to those which are diseased with the grief of the
kidneys about the muscles of the back bone, and have the signs abouesaid; if
they be felt towards the outward parts, look and expect that the Apostume
shall also be outwardly: but if the pains bend and incline rather to the
inward parts, we must then fear that the apostume shall be inwardly.

(37)
Vomiting of blood is wholesome to them which do it without a fever: but if it
be with a fever it is an evil thing; and the cure and remedy of the same is
to be performed with things that have a cooling and a binding quality and
virtue.

[38]
Distillations upon the upper belly, do come to suppuration and ripeness
within twenty days.

(39)
If any one peace blood, or clots of blood, and be diseased with the disease
named the stranguria, the pain attaining to the part of the belly, called
Abdomen or Hypogastrion, the place named pecten (and also to perinaeum) the
places and parts above the bladder are diseased.

[40]
If the tong be suddenly become feeble, or any part of the body being
astonished, be benumed without feeling, it is a sign of melancholy.

(41)
If the hicket do happen to old men purged above measure, it is not good.

(42)
If the fever be not caused of choler, store of warm water powered upon the
head doth dissolve the fever.

[43]
A woman hath not the use of both hands alike.

[44]
If clear and white matter do issue out from them which are affected with
corrupt matter between the breast and the lunges when they suffer cauterising
or incision, they do escapes but if bloody, stinking, filthy matter do issue
forth, they die and cannot escape.

(45)
If clear and white matter do issue from them whose liver is corrupted or
apostumated with filthy matter, and burnt, they recover health and become
sound: for the corrupt matter is contained in the coat: but if that which
comes forth be like the lees and dregs of oil, they die.

(46)
Cure and heal pains of the eyes which proceed from drinking of strong wine,
and bathing in hot water, by opening of a vein.

(47)
If a cough come upon one diseased with the dropsy, he is without hope of
recovery.

(48)
Drinking of nete strong wine, and the opening of a vein, doth dissolve the
diseases stranguria, disuria: but the inward veins must be opened.

(49)
A swelling and redness arising on the breast of him which is grieved with
angina, it is good: for the disease bends and inclines outwardly.

[50]
They die within three days whose brain is corrupted benummeds but if they
ouerpass them they shall recover their health.

(51)
Sternutation or sneesing is provoked out of the head, the brain being much
heated, or the void and wide space of the head being much moistened; for the
air enclosed within doth break forth: but it makes a noise because it passes
through a narrow place.

[52]
Those that are grieved with vehement pain of the liver, are delivered from the
pain, if an ague come upon them.

[53]
Those which have occasion to have blood taken fro them, must be let blood in
the spring.

(54)
Those which have fleagm enclosed between the ventricle and the midriffe, and
the same also painful unto them, having no passage into either of the
bellies, are delivered fro the disease, the fleagme being turned and conveyed
through the veins into the bladder.

[55]
Those have their belly filled with water, and do die, whose liver
replenished with water, shall make a breach, and eruption of the same into the
belly named, Omentum.

[56]
Wine being drunk with an equal proportion of water, doth put away sorrow,
yawning, and cold shaking.

(57)
For this, look in the 4. Section, and 82. Aphorism, where it is expounded.

(58)
They must of necessity become dumb forthwith, which have their brain
vehemently shaken, and troubled by some outward occasion.

(59)
Hunger and fasting is to be endured of bodies consisting of moist flesh: for
fasting dries the body.

[60]
Where there is an alteration in the whole body, the body becomes cold and
hot again, and changes from one colour to an other, the cotinuance of the
disease is signified.

(61)
Much sweat, hot, or cold, always issuing forth, doth declare, that the
moisture in a strong body is to be evacuated, and purged upwards: but in a
weak body, downwards.

[62]
If agues become more fierce and vehement every third day without any
intermission, they are dangerous. But in what manner soever they shall cease,
it signifies that they want danger.

(63)
Those which are afflicted with long fevers, have little swellings or aches in
the joints.

[64]
Those which have long swellings or pains in the joints after a fever, do use
too plentiful a diet.

[65]
If any give the meat to one sick of a fever, which he gives to a sound and
healthful person, he shall strengthen the whole person, and increase the
malady of the sick party.

[66]
We must look upon those things which pass through the bladder, whether they
be such as issue forth in prosperous health. For those which are unlike the,
are vnhealthful signs: but those which are like the are healthful signs.

[67]
Also when the sediments if thou shalt suffer them to rest, shalt not move the,
do sink down into the bottom like shauings, or parings of guts: or such
like matter: which if they shall befew, do signify that the disease is little:
but if they shall be many do signify that the disease is great; then it is
necessary that evacuation purgation be made downwards: otherwise if the belly
being not purged, thou shalt give broaths and nourishment, the more thou shalt
give, the more thou shalt hurt.

(68)
Crude, raw and vndigested excrements, voided downwards, do proceed from
black choler: if they be many they proceed fro a more copious quantity, if
they be few they proceed from a less quantity.

(69)
Spittings in fevers not intermitting, ash coloured, bloodish, choleric,
stinking, are all evil. Yet if they come forth conveniently and easily, they
are good. Also if any thing issue out through the belly, bladder, or from any
other part of the body whatsoever, which shall not restore him to health which
is purged, then it is evil.

[70]
When any one goes about to purge unclean bodies, he must make the bodies
soluble and fluxible; and if he will purge upwards, the belly must be
costipated hardened: but if he will purge downwards, it must be softened and
loosed.

[71]
Sleep and watch fulness if they exceed a measure, are a disease.

[72]
In fevers not intermitting, if the exterior parts be cold and the inward
be burning, and the patient very thirsty, it is a deadly sign.

[73]
In a fever not intermitting, but continual, if the lip, nose, eye, or
eye-brow, be perverted turned awry, if the sick man doth not see, nor hear,
whatsoever of these things shall hap to a weak sick man, death is near at
hand.

(74)
A dropsy is engendered by white fleagme.

(75)
From a laxness looseness of the belly named diarrhoea, doth proceed the
bloody flux dysenteria.

[76)
The flux named Lientery, doth come upon the bloody flux, named dysenteria.

[77]
After the corruption or putrefaction of the bone (called in greek
Sphacelismus) there follows an impostumation of the bone.

[78]
After vomiting of blood, a cosumption, an evacuation of purulent filthy
matter doth follow and ensue.

(79)
We ought to behold what things they be which pass out by vrines, by the
belly, or womb, and what things issue out thorough the flesh: And we must also
consider and behold if the body do decline or degenerate in any other thing
from nature. For if little be avoided, the disease is little, if much be
avoided the disease is great, and if very much then it is a deadly thing.

The end of the 7. Section of the Aphorisms of Hypocrates.
Here follows the 8. Section.
The Argument.
THE intention and scope of this eight book which is the* last, cannot be
assigned: because the Aphorisms be variable different; yet almost all are
reduced to that part of physic, which foretells things to come.

[1]
Men above 40. years of age, being troubled with a frenzy, are not cured at
all: for they are in less peril and danger whose disease is agreeable to
their nature and age.

(2)
It is a good thing in what disease soever, when the eyes do shed tears for
some cause or occasion: but when they weep without a cause, it is an evil
thing in any diseases whatsoever they be.

[3]

A BRIEF discourse upon the nature substance of the Ey.
Definition of the eye.
AN eye is a member, of substance, roud, whole and hard as a ball (which may
aptly be resembled to a bright basin, full of clear resplendent water) fixed in
the well or spring of the head to minister light to the living body by influence
of the visible spirit, sent from the Cell of fantasy, or common wits by a
sinew, that is called Nervus Opticus, with help of a greater light ministered
without. Right well may the place wherein nature hath placed the eye be termed
the fountain or spring of the eye, in respect of the abundance of watery
humidities, and tears which are often seen to issue flow thereat; which
happens upon diverse occasions: as The cause of tears.
sometime of inward sorrow and heaviness of the disstressed heart, sometimes of
joy and gladness immoderate: yea, and otherwhiles it proceeds of the only
superfluity abundance of humours engendered of unnatural and distemperate
coldness. And this may suffice to declare briefly what an eye is. It The
parts of the eye.
rests now, that we show of what parts it doth consist. Touching which matter
a certain learned writer called Iohannicius in his introductio affirms, that
the eye hath seven tunicles, or coats, four colours, and three humours. The
first of the said tunicles, or coats, he calls Retina: the second Secondina,
the third Sclerotica, the fourth Aranea, the fifth Vuea, the sixth Cornea, the
seventh and Four colours of the eye.
last, Subiunctiua. Of the colours, he saith, the first is black, the second
Subpallidus, that is whitish, the third Niueus, the fowrth 3. Humours of the

Glaucus. Now of the humours, according to his mind, one is called, vitreus
humour. i. a glassy humour: the second is called albugineus. i. resembling the
color of the white of an egg: the third is called Crystallinus, that
resembles the clearness of Crystal.

And this as I have expressed is the judgment opinion The Authors opinion.
of Iohannicius. Nevertheless, I my self upon knowledge attained by cutting
dead bodies, am moved to dissent from him both in coats, and also in colours.
Therefore you shall understand my mind also in this matter. I find in the
studious dissection of the eye, the tunicle called salua tricks, which saves and
keeps the humours ordained naturally, to be in the member; of which duty it
hath that name. Secodly, the tunicle or coat, called discolorata; so named
because that while it remains in the eye, in it self it hath properly no
colour, but is varied and diversely affected according to the diversities of
colours which appear in the eye. For, when the crystalline humour is near the
tunicle of the eyes, then lo they seem of no colour. But when it is deep within
them, it gives a show of 3. colours: wherefore I may well conclude, that the
eye of it self it discoloured, and of no colour properly.

Yet this by observation is found to be very true: they which have the humours
very lowe and deep set in Black eyes
the bodies of their eyes (by reason whereof they seem to be of black colour)
have their sight best for a time: but when they approach unto thirty years
and upward, it begins to fail and appaire. And such as have the humours
placed in the middle or mean region of the eye, commonly are endued with good
sight Gray eyes.
both young and old: the colour of their eyes is menable black, which is gray.
Howbeit, it is seen that this sort of eyes is more subject unto Opthalmies,
Pannicles, with diverse other euell affects then those that be of other colours.

Moreover, I say, those that have the humours more outwardly, underneath the
tunicles, as their eyes appear unto sight more various and diverse coloured,
inclining much unto whiteness, Whitish eyes.
so their visible faculty is not very good, neither in youth nor in age. The
reason is, because in such manner of eyes abounds humours and tears more then
in others. For when the visible spirits descend down, by the hollow optique
sinews, find about the tunicles of the eye abundance and plenty of vicious
humours, they be Note this reason.

eyes, which before we called menable black. And they that have the said gray
eyes may seem to have their sight more durable, for that the crystalline
humour being resident in the midst, makes the visible spirits to rest and
stay there; which by the glasen humour and the said tunicle are so preserved
and kept, that they may not readily be dispersed. But in them which have the
humours depressed, and kept Black eyes ^erfect of ^ight.
down (which as we said before) makes the eye to look black, the sight is
better then in other, because the crystalline humour is deep within: and
therefore the visible spirit coming from the Optique nerve at hand, finds the
larger space, possesses plentifully all the cauitie and hollowness of the
eyes, before it passes out from the glasen humour and the vppermore tunicles.
But as I said, it dureth not in many folk until age. For oftentimes in such
manner of eyes are engendered * Catharactes, yet more in some sorts of them, then
in other. As concerning the humour I willingly subscribe unto the opinion of
Iohannicius and make therein no variance.

Hereafter follows the manner of helping the catharact by the needle, out of
the same author.
Definition of a Catharact.
A Catharact is nothing else but a water corrupt or congealed like a curd,
engendered of humours distempered in the eye, betwixt the tunicles, and ^et
before the sight of Division of Catharacts.

seven kinds, whereof four be curable. And the first of the curable sort is
light, even like unto white The first curable kind.

the eye, with a stick or a stone, or any other outward The second kind.
violence. The second kind curable is somewhat white, and much resembles the
sky colour. It proceeds from the stomach; and is commonly caused of evil
meats, whereof a gross fumositie resolves and ascends up unto the brain,
from thence falling down again into the eyes. The third kind The third
kind.
curable is also whitish, but inclining unto the colour of ashes; and is
commonly engendered of pain in the head, as megrime and such others. Also it
is caused sometime thorough great sorrow and heaviness provoking great
lamentation weeping. And sometime of much cold, immoderat watching, and such
like. The 4. kind.
The fourth kind of Catharactes curable is of citrine colour, and is commonly
engendered of excess in meat and drink, evil digestion, great labour, and
sometime of melancholic humours. And these which we have remembered be the
four kinds of Catharactes curable, but not until they Tokens of ^penesse.
be ripe confirmed. And the time of their ripeness, is when the patient cannot
see at all any longer, except it be the brightness of the sun by day, and
the light of the moon, or a candle by night. Now for the cure to proceed
orderly The cure
first you must purge the brain, with these pills ordained for that purpose,
called Pillulae Hierusolymitanae. And giving the patient this on the one day,
on the next following about nine of the clock, while he is yet fasting, cause
him to sit overthwart a stool in riding fashion, and sit thou also on the same
stool face to face, make the patient hold his whole eye close with his hand,
and in that state charge him so to sit steadfastly not starting in any wise.

This done, first with thy own hand lifting up the over eye lid, with thy
other hand put in thy needle made for that purpose, on the side further from
the nose; and finely thrilling the tunicle called Saluatrix, writhe always thy
finger to and fro, till thou touch with the point of thy needle the
corrupt*water, which indeed is the Catharacts and then begin to remove
downward from above, with the point of thy needle, the said water which
lies before the fight: and driving it down to the neathermost parts, keep
it there still with the point of the needle, as long space as may serve thee to
say four or five times the Lords Prayer.

Then remove easily thy needle there from, and if it happen to rise up
again, bring it eftsoones to the cords of the eye to the earwarde.

But here you must beware that after the needle hath touched the Catharact,
in any wise you vvryth no more your fingers to and fro till it be out.

And after when it is all out, cause him to shut his eye, and anon make a
plaster of cotton or flaxen hardes, with the white of an Egg, and lay it
upon the sore eye, cause him to lie down in his bed, until the 9. day, giving
him in straight charge that during all that time he stir not his eye: thrice
in the day, and thrice in the night, remove his plasters, and make him to lie
in a dark place; namely, Diet.
all that time. For his diet within the said nine days, let him eat rear eggs
with bread: and if he be young, strong of body, let him drink water, and keep
straight diet during the time. But being in age, permit him the use of wine,
but well watered. Now The subtance of he needle.
for the substance of the needle wherewith you work, let it be of gold, silver,
or at least spanish latin, and in no wise of iron or steel: for iron and
steel is hard, and with the hardness it dissolveth the substance which it
touches. Or else for this cause, if the Catharact be hard, it might
peradventure break in the drawing down thereof at the point: for vron steel
be free and brittie, and the breaking thereof remaining therein, might be cause
of consumption of the same through the abundance of tears, and greatness of
pain.

Furthermore, I give you to understand, that the first kind of Catharacts
curable, The first kind of Catharacts.
are easy and soon helped: but yet they that be cured thereof recover not
their sight perfectly, for as much as the humours in the eye be imperfect,
disgregate and dissolved, by the bruise and stroke, which at the first caused
the Catharact.

The 2. kind.
The second kind of Catharacts curable, if they be well cured with a cunning
workman, in this feat, the sight returns again to his former goodness,
because of the pureness of the humours which be not dissolved, and also for
the abundance of visible spirits reserved in the eye: for these causes, I say,
they be better then other.

The 3. kind.
The third kind of Catharacts curable after they be helped, in manner above
said, and the sight restored, it endures not long time in that estate,
unless it be helped with medicines, as with our Electuarie, which is called
Dia Olibanorum Hierusolimitanum, and by wholesome regiment of diet, wherein he
must refrain from goats flesh, Eels, such other^ but especially those that
might engender raw humours: for certainly I have proved by experience, the
same to be very evil and noisome in this wise; for diverse have come unto me
with Catharactes not fully confirmed, to whom I have given raw onyons, by
eating whereof in short space they have become ripe and ready to the needle.
Whereupon I gather that raw Onyons be noysom unto the sight, and inducers of
Catharacts. Furthermore, let not the patient in the winter season (if it may be
otherwise) drink any hot wines, in the which be put sage and rue. Let him
forbear (as much as may be) the company of women, forbid him the use of all
common bathes and stews. But if he will bathe him, let it be with a vessel
ordained with the decoction of Camomill, and other sweet smelling herbs: but
in any wise let him keep his head without the vessel that the fume come not
into his even, for that were noisome. The Electuarie The virtue of Olibanum.
of Dia Olibanum is also good to avoid tears, and to dry them up, as likewise
it is right profitable for all manner pain of the megrime which is caused of
fleagme. The fourth kind The 4. kind.
of Catharactes curable is, those that be of colour citrine more harder then
the other, and of form round: wherefore, it may not be laid right down in the
eye, for it will not abide there, because of the said roundness and hardness
of it: therefore it must be laid in the corner of the eye to the ear ward,
there be kept with the needle a great while as is aforesaid. And thus to
conclude. I do you to understand, there needs not any abstinence from meats
which be clean and healthsome, after the cure is perfectly achieved; save only
in the third kind: which thing to be true experience hath taught me.
Nevertheless, it behooves oftentimes to use comfortatiues, nutritiues for the
visible spirits in the eye afterward.

Of the three kinds of Catharacts The first kind of catharacts uncurable.
uncurable.
THe first kind of Catharactes uncurable, is that which the Physicians of
Salerne in Italie do call Guttam serenam, and these be the signs whereby ye
may know it: when the pupil of the ey. i. the place of the midst of the eye,
hath the depth of the visible part, black and clear as though it had no
spot, and the eyes are always moving their lids, trembling, as though it
were quickesiluer.

Verily, this kind of Catharact is engendered caused of a corruption in the
mothers womb: and therefore they that have these kinds of Catharactes, be
blind even at their nativity; of which sort I have seen many, and have assayed
by many ways and medicines to cure them: but the success was not worthy my
labour, neither yet have I heard that any other have sped better in dealing
with that sort. Nevertheless, in process of time, I perceived that of this
manner of Catharact, there were diversities of kinds. For some of those persons
which had them might see the brightness of the sun, went by the way with
open eyes, as though they had perfectly seen: yea moreover some of them might
see the stature of a man, or a beast or any other thing, and some enjoyed this
little portion of sight unto their lives end, whereas in othersome it doth
vanish away, and they become stark blind. Therefore assure your selves, they
that have such manner of Catharacts, be deplorat and without al possibility of
cure by mans hand. For why? the nerve optique is deplorate and mortified, so
that there is no manner of help in power of hand, or medicine for them: and
this aforesaid kind is called Gutta serena, because it is engendered of a
corruption, coming down from the brain, like a drop of water, which one
drop corrupts and dissolveth all the humour natural in the eye: in so much
that from thence forwards the concave hollow nerues be oppilat and overlaid, in
that the visible spirits may no more pass down by them into the eye.

The 2. kind.
The second kind of Catharact uncurable, is that which doth appear in the
eye, of green colour like water standing in watery places, not much moved
with running. This sort is yet worse then al the other, and springs of the
immoderate and excessive coldenesse of the brain with great beating and
diseases of the head, with unmeasurable fasting such like.

The 3. kind.
The third and last kind of cureless catharacts, be those in which the
circles may not be seen within the tunicles of the eye; but the eye appears
all over black* or all over white: and who so busies himself to cure any of
these three kinds of Catharacts, he abuses his time and labour, more worthy
to be reproved for his ignorace, then any ways commended for his fruitless
diligence.

Here follows the cure of Ophthalmia and other diseases of the eyes.
THis Ophthalmia is an inflamatio of the whole eye, happening by some great
diffluxion from the brain, and in the tunicle of the eye which is called
coniunctiua: this infirmity is sometimes cured by dropping into the A good
medicin.

from some outward cause, or from blood. If it chance to happen by some blow,
or through cold, then the yolke of an egg boiled hard and mixed with oil of
roses and a little saffron must be applied, If it shall happen through dust or
smoke, wash the eye Bloudletting.
with cold water: if from repletion, or fullness, open the head vein, which is
a present remedy: if the humours be gross and thick, administer an
evaporation of the decoction of lentils with water, also wash the eye with
sponges intincted in a decoction of foenugraeck. In this disease it is very
good to use abstinece from meat and drink, the diet must incline to cold and
moisture. Wine, eggs, and all sweet things are hurtful.

An excellent Collyrium, which doth mitigate, re press and beat back heat,

Collyrium
TAke the muscelage of psyllium, of gum dragant, of quinces, being prepared in
rose water, of either 3. drams, of woman's milk giving suck to a girl five
drams, of the white of an egg well beaten, two drams: mix them and instill
thereof into the eye.

Emplaster.
Or else use this emplaster against an hot flux of the eye.

Take of the juice of the herb vermicularis, of virgapastoris, of plantaine,
of nightshade, of endiue, of purslan, such like* with the flower of barley and
oil of roses make an emplaster; which must be applied to the temples of the
forehead: or dip linen clothes in the iuyces and apply them to the
forehead.

The face may be washed with running water, rosewater mixed with a little
vinegar: so that will alter the biting humour, flowing to the eye.

If the eye happen to be hurt, or wounded with a thorne, needle, or knife, we
must presently make repercussion.

A water against in inflammamation of the eye.
Take bole armonick, sanguis draconis, tutia prepared gum arabic, dragant, of
either a dram, make a powder mix therewith 6. ounces of rosewater in a glass
viol, then let it stand in hot water the space of an howr, the afterwards add
1. ounce of the wine of pomgranats* so let it stand for 1. whole day, then
strain it, of that straining put a little into the eye Morn, Even; and for to
lay over, you shall frame an emplaster with the iuices of houslike niteshade,
of either two Emplaster.
ounces: or in their place take rosewater, bole armonicke, myrrh, gumdragant and
arabic; of either one ounce: make it into powder and so apply it in the form
of an emplaster to the eyes, for it doth both beat back, and cure.

For spots or webs in the eye being remaining after the cure, we must
presently use this remedy. Take young Pies out of the nest a little before
they are ready to fly, let them be clean pulled and cut in pieces, and then
distilled: of which water put into the eyes an hour before supper, and in the
morning it removes away al redness, spots, and cataracts: this remedy is
confirmed by experience: some do affirm the same virtue to be in
Consolidaregalis.

Weeping eyes.
Sometimes the eyes do weep and water against the will, which is caused by the
debility of the brain, being weak and ouermoist: for which cause thou shalt
do no more but drop into the eye for xv. days together, two drops of the water
of Tapsus barbatus, called in english Hagtaper.

Again, Rue being dried and beaten into powder, and mixed with honey and
vinegar, and boiled and after strained through a linen cloth and the eyes
therewith anointed will restrain the vveeping and tears thereof: the patient
must avoid all things that do euaporat fly up to the brain: if the cause
proceed from choler or from blood, it shall be diverted by bloud-letting: if
the cause proceed from fleam, it is good to purge with pills of aureae, and
imperiales; take heed of gargarisms, Bathes.
masticatories, and apophlegmatismes. Bathes of warm water are very
convenient so they be used in the morning fasting: for that draws the matter
to the utter parts.

If the matter be sharpe, apply a repercussiue about the forehead framed with
the white of an egg. and bolearmonicke, and so applied upon a piece of linen
cloth.

If the cause have proceeded from fullness or much drinking of wine, let him
use a spare diet, and open the head vein, and let him purge with the pills of
the 5. kinds of myrobalans: his diet must be dry; for he must avoid all
broaths and liquid things: sower grapes and unripe, being burnt in an earthen
pot to powder, and searced very finely and put into the eyes, do remove
away the tears and redness of them.

A singular remedy for the eyes, is to take true frankincense, and melted at
the fire, and so seven times extinguished in red rosewater, and thereof
instill into the eye that weeps.

An excellent medicin for the eyes that weep, for a pearl, and dimness, is
this.

Take half an ounce of tutia, one dram of red corrall, burn them in a vessel
of earth, then add thereunto half a dram of sine A powder for the eyes
pearl, and then beat them small into very fine powder in a stone mortar, and
then scarce it finely thorough silk, and then put thereof into the eye, this is
a great secret.

myrobalans. Let him take after his meals Diacitoniton, the confection of
Coriander prepared, Diapliris, and sugar of roses, in an hot cause. Venery

FINIS.
THE LIFE of Hypocrates.
HYpocrates by the testimony of Galen, was the son of one Heraclides: but
others affirm him to be the son of Asclepius, borne and brought up in the
Isle Cos. His master and instructor was the great Pythagoras. He was by his
nature inclined to goodness: for he hated, loathed and abhorred all pomp
worldly pleasures, and the use of venery. He constrained all his scholars by
an oath to use silence and secrecy, modesty, affabiliti, and humility as well
in manners as apparel. He restored the science of physic; being lost for
the space almost of five hundred years, even from the time of Esculapius. He
was in body and stature very little; but fair, and exceeding well favoured. He
had a good and strong head: he went slowly and softly: he was very pensive
and of few words: he was no great eater nor glutton: he lived nintie five
years, and used often this sentence; He that will live in liberty, let him not
desire that which he cannot obtain: and he that would have that which he
desires, let him desire nothing but that which he may obtain. In like
manner, He that would live in peace in this mortal life, let him conforme
himself to him who is invited to a feast, who gives thanks for all that is
set before him, and grudges not at any thing which is omitted. He lived about
the times of Eliachim, of Malachi, of Pereno Socrates.
