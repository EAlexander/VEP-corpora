THE History of Man, sucked from the sap of the most approved Anathomistes,
in this present age, compiled in most compendious form, and now published in
English, for the utility of all godly Surgeons, within this Realm, by Iohn
Banister, Master in Chirurgerie, and Practitioner in Physic.

La. And. Si illum obiurges, vitae qui auxilium tulit,
Quid facias illi, qui dederit damnum aut malum?
If that for him that aids thy life, thou chidynges up doest lay?
What can thou do to him that hurts, or seeks thy decay?
AT LONDON, Printed by Iohn Day, dwelling over Aldersgate. Anno. 1578.

Cum gratia Privilegio Regiae Majestatis.

TO THE RIGHT worshipful, Sir Frauncis Willoughby, Knight, Iohn Banister, your
most bounden, wishes the daily increase of virtuous knowledge, and happy
h^alth, both here, and euerlastyngly.
LIke as the earth was not made to lye was^e, and void, as arude congested
heap, but to bring forth copious store, and that in sundry sorts, of
creatures, corn, and fruits: neither those, as to glory in the riches of her
own proper nature, ordained, but for the special behoof, use, and v^ilitie
of mankind: even so (right worshipful) is man for ma, and all things for the
cause of others, engedred. Nothing hath a peculiar life. Nothing joys without
society of other.

Wherefore there ought to be one purpose, and Cic. o^. Iib. 3.
inclination in all men, that a like utility, and of all things, may be to
every one. Which if any man do snatch unto himself, all humane fellowship is
dissolved.

And if nature do praescribe this, that one man should assist, and take care of
an other, if it be but only for the cause that he is a man, it is necessary,
according to the same nature, that the utility of all things be common. For no
man, of wit, or understanding Demosthenes. Orat. de. Cor.
(saith Dem^sthenes) will suppose himself to be borne only to his father, and
mother, but also to his country. Why, what is between? Even this, that he, who
supposes himself only to be borne to his parents, expects afatall and
natural death: but he, that acknowledges his birth to his country, rather,
then he will see the same in servitude, shall willingly put him self into the
hands of death. Which caused that valiant young Roman Curtius to prostrate
himself, headlong, into Titus Iiu. M. Curtius.
the insatiable gulf of the earth, which suddenly had opened in the market
place, that (I say) he might free, and (as it were) ransom the whole City
from the terror of that monster. With no less piety have some abandoned
themselves, lest, by their own prosperity, the state of the commons might be
impaired. As Genutius Cipus, Val. Max. Ii. 5. ca. (...). G^nutius Cipus.
being Praetor, and walking forth of one of the gates of Rome, their sprag forth
of his bead ij. horns, upon a soaaine, and answer being given, that, if he
would return into the City, he should be king: he, that it might not come to
pass, forthwith freely commanded him self into perpetual exile. If then it
be so, that a solid common wealth is most prosperous, and that is a solid
common wealth, whereof the faithful inhabitants bear themselves as the true
members of it, their natural body: of duty ought we that are the parts, to
use, invent, and communicate that (each one according to the portion of his
talent) amongst ourselves, which may procrastinate the continuance of the
healthful state of our body, that is, the common wealth.

And he that endeuoreth nothing to further it, is unnatural, like as he that
hinders the same, is, as arotten member, worthy to be cut away. To this saith
the I ^an ^ib. (...). do Catone.
Poet, commending unto us the manners of Cato, that is,

servare modum, finem{que} tenere,
Naturam{que} sequi, patriae{que} impendere vitam,
Nec sibi, sed toti genitum se credere mundo.
Also that divine Cicero saith, that, to take away any thing from an other, or
(...) off. lib. (...).
one man to increase his own profit, by the discommodity of an other, is
more contrary to nature, then death, then poverty, then payne, or then
whatsoever may chance to our body, or outward things. For if so we be affected,
that every one may catch unto him self, and hide from others, there is love
broken, then is humane society buried. It is more laudable therefore, and
according to nature (saith Cicero) to take upon us the greatest labour, and
molestatios, for the conservation and helping (if it may be) of all nations,
imitating that same Hercules (whom fame, mindful of all benesites, hath
canonised, or as it were made a God) then to live in all security: not only
without any griefs, but abounding also in all pleasures, and riches, beauty,
and strength.

Which, o so sacred a saying (right worshipful) hath made me, quite forgetting
my impotency, willingly to put on armour also against ignorance, and boldly
to march towards the castle of Art, there to offer my service to sciece, the
general. Of one thing being sure, that the armour, which I carry, is most
precious and costly. Wherefore, I shall humbly crave at his hands, that I may,
not as an enemy, be received into his gates: and the, if he shall esteem me
unworthy, or vnhable to carry so costly and weighty armour, I shall (right
gladly) yield the same, to the use of some of his valiant Captains: to whom my
good will, now showed by endeavour, is nothing inferior.

Which good will in deed, is all that I am hable to show, and that taken
away, my burden might easily press me to the ground: for considering so ripe a
world, such plenty of Arts, such profound wits, such learned ears, and,
there withal, such Tigrish whelps of Momus pampering, if fear should have
surprised my senses, and there withal (if it had been possible) vanquished my
zeal, to the utter ruin of these my labours, the wise would not have
marveled at all. Good will there fore may, of right, he called the bulwark of
the common wealth. For what thing is so hard, that good will makes not easy?
what is so high, that good will may not reach? what is so worthy, that good
will shall not win? It is love, it is truth, it is the author of all arts,
and the key of all treasure saith Demosthenes. In sine, there (...).
is nothing so high in the heavens above, nothing so low in the earth beneath,
nothing so profound in the bowels of Art, nor any thing so hid in the secretes
of nature, as that good will dare not enterprise, search, unclose, or discover.

And this benefit I am assured my benevolence shall purchase, that either, be
it, others shal^e moved, to fall, and fashion these my rough forged labours, or
else, accesed with the like piety, and the rather by example hereof, which
shall move them (as it were) to aemulation, to build a new work out of the
ground, that may, in all things, perform that, which here I have wished to
have been fulfilled. Of both which, whether soever shali come to pass, my
desire shall be satisfied.

And, howsoever it be, I hope the godly minded will rather praise my
benevolence the discourage my want at all. As for those of Marius sect, which
ever scorn Val. Max. Li. 5. ca. 6.
Manus. Curt^us.
the noble courage of Curtius: such Syllaes, as always deride the rare virtue of
Genutius: Sylla, Genutius.
and such Cinnaes, as perpetually laugh at the marvelous piety of Aelius,
Cinna. Ath^.
what should I force at all? nay, I am far fro taking care for their endless
malice, as that it shall greatly joy me, if my virtue may shorten their lives.
To the which (I hope) all the soldiers of science will hold up their hands.
For although it be so, as the Poet saith,

Invidia vexantur opes: nam{que} optima livor ^al. Lib. 2.

Quae{que} malus laedens, odit foelicia semper.
Yet virtue is a sufficient spur unto us: and well it is said,

Verum age nate tuos ortus, nec bella pavescas (...). Ital. ^ib. 13.

Vlla, nec in coelum dubites te tollere factis.
There is one thing also, which ought to be a great comfort unto the godly
minded, that is, that none do persecute virtuous proceedings, save only the
enemies 4. ad ^eren.
of virtue. And envy (saith Cicero) of force will accompany virtue. Wherefore,
letting Demost. 2. ^pist.
such go as retain only the figure of man, since Adversus invidiam nihil
prodest vera dicere, especially time present cannot say well, as Martial saith.

Esse quid hoc dicam, vivis quod fama negatur, Lib. 5.

Et sua quod rarus tempora lector amat?
Hi sunt invidiae nimirum, Regule, mores,
Praeferat antiquos semper ut illa nobis.
Whereto also Ouid.

Pas^itur in vivis livor, post fata quiescit: ^ib. 1. Elig.

Tunc suus ex merito quem{que} tuetur honos.
He that intends in deed to bear the name of a man, must first consider his
Cic. 2. de. ^nib.
birth, and secodly his calling. For as the horse to run, the Ox to plough,
and the dog to hunt: even so man (saith Aristotle) is borne to two things,
that is, to understand, to do, or endeavour: as who should say, we are not borne
only to have understanding, but also to put it in use. For else in deed we
shall know nothing, but liu^ in silthy ignorance: that the song of the Poet
might be verisied, who saith,

Deni{que} nil sciri si quis putat, id quo{que} nescit Lucretius Lib. 4, d ^
not. Re^um.

An sc^ri possit, quo nil se scire fatetur.
Then which abominable crime, what to be more unseemly in a man, cannot be
declared or thought. But he that detests that, and enters in unto the
understanding of him self, accordingly also employing his time, his calling
shall be to a higher steppe: which likewise shall be required of him. For therefore
saith the renowned Athenian Orator, By how much thou hast a more excellent
nature, by so much Demosth. ex. or. ama.
thou exspectest greater dignities, and so much the rather, I judge, thou wilt
make trial of thy self. And surely Cicero supposes it cannot be in a man to
hid his virtue 2. de. Finib.
in him self. Which moved him to say, we are driven to it of nature, to desire
to prosite many, especially in teaching, and revealing the reasons of wisdom.
Therefore it is not easy to sinde such a one, as will not be content to teach
that unto an other, which he knows him self. So that we are not only
inclined to learn, but to teach also. And truth it is in deed, for what
piety is in him, that sees another out of his way, and will not show him of
it? or what humanitic hath he that earnestly uses his time, in gathering
together the goods of virtue, and at length, in one instant, causes them to
perish with his body?

As therefore (saith Demosthenes) he is accounted great and mighty, whom every
(...). Olinth. 2.
one do judge to make each thing profitable to him: eve se, by the same things
he shall be rejected, when he is convicted to have done all for the cause of
his own utility. Which things considered, I shall not need to render account
of my enterprise, neither (I hope) to crave the further ance of the godly
learned. For although, to discuss the secretes of nature, which are so
meruatlous in mas body, it is the hardest point in Philosophie, yet is not the
difficulty thereof such, as ought wholly to terrisie us from the search
thereof: nay, rather it ought to spur us forward, to use more serious
diligence therein. Since the payne is not half so great, that is taken in the
winning thereof, as the utility rewaraeth of that which is obtained.

And albeit this is so worthy a matter, as needs no authors commendation,
and therefore should worthily merit the labour of the learned: yet as Darius
denounced (...).
that to be the sweetest draught that ever he drunk, which, in his weary
flight, he had drawn from a silthy standing puddle, because, it seems
before, he had never drunk thirsty: even so, I hope, my labour shall be
thankfully taken, of all honest Surgeons, considering the barren draught,
that Chirurgerie, throughout the Realm of England, in this present age,
endures: and which can never be quenched, by the fruitful water that sloweth
from the fountains of Anathomie. Of which, I have now endeavoured to turn one
cock. Which faithfully being done, according to my might, such as it is, I
offer, before all others unto you right worshipful, and my most bounden,
beseeching you, to accept the dedication of these my rude labours: which, were
they as worthy as Galens, you might of duty challenge. Notwithstanding,
whatsoever they are, good will is full in them. And that is the rest of my
hope, and that is it, which your worship never denied. Which cherishing me, I
am bold to publish this History of Man, under your name, to the benesite of my
Christian brethren, the godly, and toward Surgeons of England.

Whereupon also if your worship, sometime in Ciceroes ocium (whereto you are
much addicted) shall chance to look, no doubt, but you shall take great
delight in the matter thereof. Which, now also, of force, comittyng to the sundry
judgements of infinite opinions, I cease, beseeching unto your worship, and
all that godly shall use me, the sweet increase of all slourishyng virtues:
and unto the rest, the obtainyng of a better mind in Christ Iesu.

Your worsh. in all I may, Iohn Banister.

TO THE WORSHIPFVLL THE Master, Wardens, Assistants, and fellowly Fraternity
of Surgeons in London: and from them to all godly, true and zealous
professors of Medicine, throughout this Realm of England, Iohn Banister
wishes the testimony of a clear conscience, before the highest Auditor.
After the publication of my vnpolished Book of ulcers (most grave Patrons)
withdrawing my self into my naked study, and devising how best to perform my
promise therein, but first considering, and in deed more deeply weighing
(according to the state of time, and present want) which way I might most of
all seek the aduauncemet of Chirurgerie in England, in the which cogitatio (I
confess) my zeal hath long time turned: At last I called to remembrance,
that the greatest want that reigns in Surgeons at this day, is ignorance
in the subject of their work, weighing also on the other side, that no English
Author, which hitherto hath written, hath sufficiently applied his time to the
amendment thereof. Then was I wholly overcome in this purpose, and then did I
clearly see, how that to write Methodes or means to cure the affected parts
of the body, the parts them selves being altogether unknown, or falsely
imagined of, might rather be a mean to indurate the cataract of inscience,
then to eat it through, or take it away. So thus I decreed to change my
purpose, that is, in steed of the Book of Tumours, which I had before
promised, to compile some work of Anathomy, which might occupy fufficient
scope to entreat of all the parts of man.

But as the wanton child, that cries oft to handle that thing which his
strength is not able to meddle, but rather to damage or hurt him self: Even
so did I full little understand the weight of my burden, till I had it on my
Caluisius shoulders: when as it Caluisius Sabin^.
immediately had dissolved my good enterprise, had not then the flames of zeal
accensed the courage of Hercules in my breast. By (...).
means whereof although the same be now finished, yet so, as I determine
nothing less then hereby to hinder the proceeding of others in the like cause,
nay rather I am resolved, that hereby I shall instigate and set forward the
endeavours of such as are equally minded, to the advancement of the famous Art
Chirurgerie. For, as to the building of some rich tower, or strong castle,
beside the deuisours of the work and free Maso^s, there are required sondry
inferior Officers and laboring persons, neither all to one end, use, or
office, but some to dig, some to square stones, some to carry them to
woorkemen, c: Even so I, not having the knowledge to devise, nor the policy
to dig for the best stone, neither the skill to temper the mortar, nor yet
the reason rightly to square the stone, notwithstanding because my zeal is
nothing inferior to the chief Masons, have had the will to gather the stones,
and lay them by the workmen, now also hoping that some cunning Mason will
reach his hand to my heap, and lay of the stones of my gathering to the
building of this famous tower of health: since I shall conceive incredible
felicity, if I may hereafter, in viewing this renowned building (for so I hope
surely to see it) cast mine eye upon those stones which my homely hands had
so rudely congested, and see them cunningly wrought, and aptly applied to the
building.

Into which consideration of me I first beseech you (most grave Seniors and
Christian brethren) to enter, before you take any occasion to accuse me of
temerity, which crime I had worthily incurred if zeal should not mediate my
cause, so do I hope, that you will not only favour the fruits of my labours,
and add to them your helping hands, but also be (in my behalf) the shield of
Pallas, against such Serpentine tounges as duly seek to profane of all godly
endeavours.

But to return to my first determinatio, when I had wholly give my consent to
this end, I might see first a far of, what sondry great mutatios nature hath
used in ye body of ma since Galen wrote in Anathomy: and omitting diverse old
writers, whose works had not all equal success, I came at length to
Vesalius, whose whole work seemed as tedious as his Epitome ouerculled short.
But when I saw Fuchsius to have extract a notable Epitome out of Vesalius Galen,
I had thought to look no further till Collumbus appeared in my sight: whose
labours then reuoluyng, and saying him in some things use sufficient
prolixity, as in his Books of Bones and Muscles, in other causes to be
somewhat brief (because Vesalius had sufficiently hadled them) as in the
nutritiue parts, immediately I refused to bind my self to any peculiar
translation, choosing rather to pick a posy of the chiefest flowers fro all
their Gardens, the opinion of Fernelius and others not being utterly refused,
as throughout the History is diligently noted.

And so much the rather I esteemed this the best, because that way I perceived I
might both more plainly describe the parts to the judgment of the Reader, as
also use sufficient scope upon the dissention of Authors in the most notable
causes. These considerations used, I set foreward in this matter, purposing (to
speak briefly) to pen it in form of a History, least the Volume of the
book should over hastily increase, whereby I might be inhibited to use
requisite prolixity in convenient causes.

And now finally being finished, as I may, not as I would, I (the least of the
number) do offer the first fruits thereof unto you, the ancient fraternity
of Surgeons in London, and conse quently from you, to all Godly, and single
professors of the Art of Chirurgerie, throughout this Realm of England: into
whose minds, I beseech God to inspire the grace of his holy spirit, that we
may all (yet at length) with one consent together, endeavour, study, search,
knock, and call at the gate of Gods mercy, for the guidyng of his holy
spirit, that, in all our proceedings, being thereby protected, we may seek
the advancement of the glory of God, in healing our afflicted brethren,
whereto his divine power shall (so oft as it pleases him) (...), and appoint
us Ministers, that (I say) with the testimony of a clear conscience, we may
render our vauntaged talentes unto the high Auditour, in the day of coming,
which, we know not how near, approaches.

As for you, O ye chafe of the earth, ye sting of the Godly, ye Imps of
Hell, and children of wrath, you (I say) that, under pretence of the sacred
Art of Medicine, devour the sheep of Gods pasture, slay the labours in his
Harvest, and deny your Lord the fruits of the Uineyard: since no warnynges
may admonish you, no exhortation amend you, no laws bridle you, no
punishementes tame you, nor any fear of God sink into your breasts: behold,
all the true professors of Christ Iesus, and who carefully endeavour Godly to
discharge their functions, do cry for vengeance from heaven upon you. And I
(in these my labours) from the depth of my hart renounce you, hoping assuredly,
that from none of the flowers of this Garden any of you shall take opportunity
to suck that, which may maintain the infection of your pestilent
wretchedness hereafter. If therefore I have any where frequented a phrase
above the common use of our English language, or used words little different
from the Latin, esteem the same to be done only for your cause, since (as
much as in me lies) I have endeavoured every where, to shade the kernel with a
harder shell then you shall be able to crack. Away therefore you Vipers. Let
these my simple labours, whatsoever they are, be entertained in the hands of
thee true, virtuous, and honest Artistes, and professors of Chirurgerie, that
my expectation may be fulfilled, Art rightly advanced, and God duly
worshipped.

And now returning to you again (most Godly governors, for whose sakes I was
most encouraged to persevere in this enterprise) considering your Godly
affection towards me heretofore, and that it hath ever pleased you to esteem
of me, far more, then the uttermost of my power, at any time, may merit, I
thought it not only the office of piety, by this means, to prick foreward
the minds of some of the learned sort, but also to commit this unto you, as a
pledge of my vnfeyned zeal to the Art of Chirurgerie, and consequently to you
the chief pillours thereof in this Realm: which, being thankfully received of
your grateful hearts, may testify for me, that inwardly I wish, which
outwardly I am not able to manifest.

Have now therefore this History of Man, picked from the plenty of the most
noble Anathomistes above named, wherein I have earnestly, though rudely,
endeavoured to set wide open the closet door of natures secretes, whereinto
every Godly Artist may safely enter, to see clearly all the parts, and
notable devises of nature in the body of man. From the Female, and that (as I
suppose) for sundry good considerations, I have wholly abstained my pene:
least, shunnyng Charibdis, I should fall into Scylla headlong. No more, but
vouchsafe to accept Sinaetes faithful offer, and protect this handful of
water, from the pollution of strange beasts.

Farewell from Nottingham.
THE PROEM.
Time, the general rust of the world, which wears eats, consumes, and
perforateth all things, hath denied that the precepts of the divine parents
and progenitors of Physic, should for evermore remain insoluble, or free
from all future change: else what should withstand, whereby the works of
Hipocrates and Galene should not suffice all posterities that come after? For
what thing notable have they not noted? what secret so dainty, that they have
not uncovered yea what mystery so covert, the door whereof they have not
opened? And yet notwithstanding, these divine Oracles have not taken from
posterity all occasion to write, neither shall the books which hitherto are
written, do the like to those that come after. But each age hath his time, each
nation his nature, and each nature his property.

Albeit, this excellency we ascribe to Hipocrates and Galen, that never any
hath been their equals, and that from their fountains flow the springing
streams, that nourish Physic for ever. So that what good thing soever we
have, or achieve, we are to consecrate the same unto their honour and praise:
and what work soever is published, if the same be worth the reading, we owe it
wholly unto them. What the (you will say) is the cause, that their works
suffer in these days such sundry contradictions, especially in the parts of
mans body? It is answered a little before, how that time, natures, and nations
must be respected.

For first; that the magnitude of our body is greatly diminished, it is a Iac.
Sil^. in Isag. Pre.
thing in readynes to every man, not only by the authority of ancient Ph.
Lib. 7. cap. 6.
writers, but also that daily, and (as I suppose) throughout the world, the
stature of ma in all points decreases: especially in those regions: whereas
matrimony is over liberally, before the just age, permitted. Who is so
ignorant; to whom the Scriptures have not ere now testified, how much longer
then in these days, the age of ma hath been in times past? Iac. Sil. Ibid.
how abundantly do our bodies testisie, how sondry of the inner parts both in
magnitude, number, figure, and situation, do differ from those in others of
other regions? neither are the same in all our bodies in these days, as, in
elder time the ancient Anathomistes most commoly observed: do not their
writings, and our bodies make it manifest to all living? but towhat end? that
it might not seem to us incredible, that in men of every region, like as in
beasts, yea in the plants them selves, is either some thing peculiar from
others, or else some certain mutation from the first nature to have chanced.

As, to come first to the exaples of beasts. In Ciria the sheep have Arist.
Lib. 8. hist. ca. 28.
tails a cubit broad, and the goats ears ix. intches in length. What
marvel is it when as the ram and the ewe, which both in Africa bear
horns, in Pontus a province of Scythia, to have therefore none at all? As other
where sheep, so in Cilicia goats are clipped. The oxen, sheep, hearts, and
such others, are greater in Aegipt then in Greece: but for that the dogs,
wolves, foxes, hares, and hawks, are greater in Greece the in Aegipt. Ox in
Scythia through cold possess no horns. Oxen in Phrygia have horns that are
movable. The Isle Ithaca is destitute of a hare, like as the field called Ager
Lebadicus of a moule, and Sardinia of a wolf.

If histories be to be believed, then these are true: if not, what do we with
ancient testimonies? why credit we things written, or believe any thing to be
true which our own eyes have not witnessed unto us? yea let us reject the
monuments of our elders, detract their doings, and wholly obliterate their
writings. And if the books of Aristotle, Plinie, and others most famous
Historiographers, be worthy to be opened, the are beasts in Asia, all more
cruel, in Europe more stronger, and in Aphrica more diversely formed. But, to
speak more appertinet to the body of man, these aforesaid varieties, observed
of ancient writers, arguing only unto us, that, as beasts are bred diversely
in each nation, and according to the nature thereof, so to be in men some
dissimilitude, by the same reason, was not denied. Every one knows that the
Moors have only white teeth, but black skin and nails. But it is not a
thing so common that they, and also the inhabitants of such hoate Cor. Cells.
Li. 8. ca. (...).
countries, are without seames in their Skulls, which with us is a thing so much
approved.

But, omittyng those natios which differ a little among the selves, let us come
to those which more manifestly vary in figure. In Asia are a people named
Macrocephali, having very long heads, though first of custom Hipochr. de.
^ere.
Aquis et lo^is Lib.
then after of nature: of custom, because they kept the compressed heads of
their children, swathed so, till some consistence of years grew on them, which
thing afterward made their children beget the like, though in tract of time,
and through their negligence, nature amended that fault. The people called
Phasiani, inhabityng a marish ground and rainy region, are in figure from other
men very diverse: as, of mighty stature, and marvelous corpulet, so that
neither veins, nor joints are in them apparent, always bearing a yellow
colour, like persons afflicted with the iaundes, and in voice most base and
terrible.

It is strange to us that women have beards, albeit not so every where: Hipp.
Lib. 6. Epid.
for in Caria it is a thing familiar: whereas some of them being a while
frutefull, but after widows, and for that suppressed of natural course, put
on virilitie, being then bearded, hoary, and changed in voice. Shall it be
counted a fable that touches the transformation of one kind into an other, as
the Male into the Female and so contrariwise? surely Plinie Lib. 7. Cap. 4.
saith. No: since him self to have scene a woman changed into man, in the day
of marriage, he plainly avouches. And again, a child of a year old, from a
maiden to a boy. There are certain wild men whose feet are turned backward on
the legs, and some of them having viij. P^i. I: b. 7. cap. 2.
toes on a foot. What shall we say of the Cyclopes, whose eyes have in the two
apples or balls? I omit to speak of those that have but one eye: of those
that are both Male Female: of such as have heads like dog^: of the people
which have no heads: of them who with one leg cover their whole body: of
those without mouths: and so forth of such sorts many, which are in Indie
very familiar.

True it is also that the Scythias, named Nomades, are very corpulet, Hipp.
^ib. d^. (...).
Aquis. et. (...).
and fleshy, their inferior bellies ever slippery, their joints through
moisture very weak, in so much as they are ever found to have applied fire to
their shoulders, arms, hands, breasts, hippes, and loins, for no other
cause, then for the natural moisture and softenes: for thus if they should not
do, they would not be able to hold their bows, or cast their darts, for
losenes of their loints, through slippery humours so obnoxious to luxation. And
it is no more truly written of the Pygmeias, then marvelous Lib. ^ast. cap.
15.
to our understanding, since they are of so small stature (for they exceed not
in height the length of a cubit) that daily they are pressed to put on armour
against Cranes.

These Arguments, and sundry such others, which Iacobus Siluius Iac. Sil.
(...). (...).
hath gathered together, and therefore I think them also most fit for this
place, may not lightly move us, to believe likewise that in our bodies sometime
sundry mutations do happen.

In places either very hoate, or very cold, men are in countenance Sec. 1^
Pr^b.
and manners fierce and cruel: notwithstanding they that inhabit hoate places
are more fearful, though wiser: and they which dwell in cold, stroger. The
Asians are fairer, greater, more gentle, fearful, effoeminate, and unapt to
war for the temperature of the air and laws.

The Europ^ans cotrariwise are in magnitude much different among Hipp. Loc.
(...).
them selves, cruel, of hauty courage, bold, upright or honest, and given to
war. They differ (I say) in magnitude, and form, through the mutations of
the times of the year, which there are great and often: as strong heate;
vehement cold, much rain, long draught, and strong winds, whereby every where,
sundry, and many mutations are made. In Asia so the other creatures, and all
plants are more happily produced then in Europe. Many kinds of men are in
Europe, which in magnitude, fortitud^, form, and stature are much different
among them selves. The caus^ of which variety is somewhat before touched, but
Hipocrates Loc. cit.
more clearly doth descriue. As they which inhabit a place or region full of
mountains, rough, high, and watery, and have with the many mutarios of times
much differet, it is requisite that of their own nature be mad^ many forms os
bodies, and such as are laboursome, exercised, and strong, and such natures
also to be fierce and cruel.

Again ^hey which reign in places more medowy, or groudes flowing with herbs,
and hoate, their winds more hoate the cold, use hoate, or warm waters, these
persons are not high, butrather broad, with black hears, and they more of
dusky colour or browne, then are bred in other places, and of their own nature
less flegmaticke then choleric. But they that inhabit a high and pleasaut
place, not rough, or windy, and have good waters, these are large in body,
straight, and like unto them selves, endowed with wit and minds more mild
and gentle: like as they of thin, barreine, and not watery and naked places,
neither have the mutations of times temperate, are hard bodies, not great,
rather yellow then black, wayward, ireful, bold, and obstinate in opinion.
For where often mutations of times are, and those also much different, truly
there also may you find their forms, manners, and natures greatly
disagreeing. The regions wherein times and waters are changed, or do vary,
the bodies there also do vary: since always, or for the most part, the manners
and forms of the people do imitate the nature of the region.

If then the variety of times doth so transmute, and change the state ^ig.

altogether this sense.)

It is strange to see how sturdely some strive to deface those, which, full of
Natural piety, write the truth of their own times. Why, they will have it
that there were never Amazons in Scythia, because perhaps Iac. S^l. Loc. cit.
there are none now to be found. Aristotle erred, for saying there were no
Asses in France, Ponte, and Scythia, because now in those coutreys they
abound. Hipocrates he is reproved, for affirming no kings to be in Europe,

Aesculapius were no distillations nor inflations. Hipocrates Plat. Dial. 3. de.

saw no rigour without a fever, though in Galens days it chanced often, but
now a days most often, especially to women, through a more intemperate diet.

If we shall stand upon disseases purchased by times, yea yet daily, by the
immoderation of diet, when should we draw to an end. In the age of Galen
Eunuchs did incur the gowte, though long before, and in Aph. 28. 29. 30.

of the lunges were not wont to chance before the age of xiiij. years, but
where stands it at that stay now? who hath not scene them all at younger
years? yeasome of them at x. ix. yea (though the more marvelous) at viij.
years of age. The which thing I dare boldly testify, since, in Not^ingham, in
An. 1574. it pleased God to make me the instrument of health to diverse children,
of the ages before recited, finding no present remedy (for to diverse in the
beginning I assayed other helps in vain) but Phlebotomy, notwithstanding
their tether years, the dissease being the Pleurisy, and the time of the year
the spring.

What Artist of experience in these days knows not, that women (for the most
part) do bear males as well on the left side as the right, and their females
as well on the right side as the left? the transuerse processes of the Vertebres
of the neck appear unto us always as if they were cloven, Iac. Sil. Loc. ci^.
though to Galen the last of them was seldom so. Os Sternon Galen, with the
elders, observed perpetually to consist of seven Bones, but we in these days
never invent the number so large: albeit that we never find the number
certain.

What then? shall we find the number of the Vertebres always one? he that hath
so the hap, let him set it down. For my part, amongst those very few
bodies, which, also in very few years, though to my cost, yet for the very
zeal I have had thereto, I have dissected, I have found some of Galens
Sceletons in sundry points. It may fall out to be no new saying, that almost
in all bodies, some variety is to be scene.

Much marvelous shall it be to him that uses dissection, to see such sundry
and often varieties: yea, setting aside monstrous shows, the Anathomist shall
see in his own region, and in few years, sundry notes of new shapes in nature,
not so strange now, as worthy the noting.

To praetermitte those which Vesalius observed, because they are confused, let
us come to the most notable, by others descriued and set in order.

Collubus, that Anathomist of worthy fame, beginning at the head, Col. Lib.
(...).
runs through the whole body, noting what new thing he hath in any particle
observed. So that first he excuses not the head, but that he hath scene it
sometime without seames, sometime with sundry seames, and those keeping diverse
orders, to have been compact together. The teeth in diverse numbers: and the
neither jaw grown to the upper. Of the neck, the first Vertebre inseparably
grown to Occiput: the number of the Vertebres of the neck sometime six, and
sometime eight with the like variety at sundry times of the other Vertebres.
Of ribs xxij. xxv. and xxvj. Os Sternon consisting of two, three, and iiij,
Bones. The thigh to have overgrown the leg into an incredible tumor. But
above all these it is notable that he reports of a Sceleton, whose Bones all,
from the head to the toes, were joined together, so that the party in his life
time, being old, could move no part save his eyes, tongue, breast, belly, and
yard. I pass with silence, the abundance, or want of Muscles whereof he
remembers, and the sundry trases of Veins, with their want, or extraordinary
divisions. Of the kidneys he saw the singular number, although that a great
one, and Splenes so large, as that each one in weight peised twenty pound,
being outwardly overcovered with a Cartilage. So ulcers, and tumours in the
hart. So the hedge that distinguishes the Ventricles of the hart,
Cartilaginous. It was strange to behold Pericardium, the enclosure of the
hart, wanting. What then? he observed stones in the lunges, liver, Vena Porta,
vrinarie ways, in the bleddar, Hemorroidall Veins, and in the navel of
sundry strange abscesses, in diverse bodies observed, the same author also
remembers. But among all things that he hath noted, this one seems most
notable, which he reports of a woman, who had outwardly a perfect shape,
only the neck of the matrice, but no matrice, seminary vessels, or Testicles
at all: and so oft as ^he used the company of man, (which she did often) she in
marvelous sort moved her self.

But why stand I so long upon the observations of Columbus, an Anathomist of
such yeared experience? come we to them that scarce dissected two for his
twenty, for it is more rare that they have invented such novelties. Lib. de.
Var. Corp. ^ec.


Iacobus Siluius in his time saw sundry illusions of Nature, both in men,
women, and children: in the liver, spleen, kidneys, ventricle, midreif,
intrels, veins, and matrice. All which, to pen particularly, I omit, (...).
Botall. ^ib. de cat^o.
together with the strange, or rather monstrous kidneys which Botallus
mentions, and hath openly depainted: as also his observation of the four
Ossicles or little Bones in the diuisio of the brain: since it hath been my
hap to see much in few dissections.

And first (touching the Sceleton) in the number of Vertebres: as sometime six
in the loins: sometime four, sometime five in Os sacrum: and sometime three,
sometime one in Cauda. Among the inner parts, I have observed the liver twice
divided into lobes. To the outside and bottom of the matrice I have found a
certain mole, or mass, white in colour, and hard, or in substance
Cartilaginous, in fashion like the Testicles, as yet within their purse
enuolued: save that it weighed almost ij. poud. This bieng cut, coteined
abundance of slimy matter, which at the first burst forth thinner, though at
last, very thick and slimy in deed. Once, in an aged Gentlewoman I searched
in vain for the right vetricle of the hart. And once in the hart of man I found
a thing notable, and which these before named have made no mention of, that is,
a bone in the hart, situated at the ends of the vessels inserted thereinto, as
in the History of Bones I have more copiously handled. Besides in the same old
ma (forso he was in deed a man pressed to the ground with days) I saw one of the
vrinarie vessels, which, for the space of an intche (or more) in length, had
wholly possessed a Cartilaginous substance, which seemed still to increase.

But here perhaps some are ready to object, and say, why what then? do you
intend to reject those authorities which fo oft you have here alleged, nay,
not alleged, but rather out of whose mines all this treasure is dug? no,
but I could wish with Siluius that every one might be more zealous to search
the truth, then busy seekers to find opportunity against their elders. And
those in deed the parents of all Physic. For if in any thing they disagree
from the bodies of other regions, surely these rehearsed Arguments are
sufficient to prove the same far more worthy to be imputed to the varieties
of regions, and change of times, then otherwise, with foul obloquy to spurt
our elders, whilst we ourselves in the mean time, L^c, ci^.
as malevolent detractours are publicly denounced. Siluius therefore wishes
him that finds any thing otherwise then Galen hath written it, to ascribe the
same as a certain addition to Galens Anathomie, else friendly to admonish the
reader thereof.

As for my self, I confess I have in sundry places cited, and as it were
enrolled Galen in sundry errors, yet not by half so oft as my authors have
provoked me? for Vesalius chiefly, and Collumbus (as I suppose) have spared him
in no place. Which hath excited me (friendly Reader) familiarly thus to warn
thereof in the beginning, that when thou read them, thou may rightly know
from whence they come.

In the mean time to come to the matter proposed, I commit to thy diligence in
the beginning the History of Bones, the frame of the body, wherein (of truth)
attentiuenes ought to be used, both to carry in mind, together with thy eye,
the direct sense of the present described part, or rather (if it may be) to
confer the same with the Sceleton it self, as also because it is an
introduction to the whole History of Man, and may be called the key of
knowledge to Anathomie: without the perfection whereof, the rest is not only
obscure, but almost vain at all to read. After the Bones, ensue the
Cartilages: then the Ligamets: after those the Muscles: next the Muscles the
nutritiue parts: and next the nutritiue the generatiue parts. Then at length
the spiritual members: and finally the animal. To these I have added a ninth,
least (otherwise) the marey, Periosteon, and the hears should have been sought
in vain in the History of Man. All these to my power, I have faithfully, and
therewithal sufficient briefly, compiled together. Now rests no more, but
read, and enjoy.

William Clowes Surgeon, to his loving friend Iohn Banister.
THy noble skill in Surgery (for so we call it heer,)
Thine honest life, and faithful ha^t unto thy country dee^,
Well known to me (good Banister) thy poor and loyal fiend,
I would I could in skilful Verse so cunningly commend,
As well I know it well deserves both praise and praise again.
And sure I am that this thy toil, and here employed payne
For painting out the frame of man, in this our mother tongue,
Could out of learned Latin works, heerehence hath only sprung
That thou thereby thy country men mighst further much in skill:
And give them light that erst they lacked, as sure (I hope) it will.
Thou wrightst not for the learned sort (I know) that were but vain,
But hope to help the meaner folk. And so, I trust thy payne
Shall win such praise of skilful men, as painful toil may crave,
And as a mind that means well of duty ought to have.
If error ought hath escaped thy pen, or painter hapt to halt,
Let that no whit dismay thy mind. None scapes devoid of fault.
Where skilful men give just reproof, with careful payne amend it.
Regard not much the rascal sort that blyndly reprehend it.
For as we know that men be men, and easily apt to stray:
So Enuyes Imps do bend them selves to sclander every way. De Mo^bo (...)

My self of late have tried in that so small a work of mine,
Wherein I sought no praise to win, nor get a name divine,
But only to content my friends, whose earnest suit to crave it,
I could in no wise satis^e, but so, as they might have it.
Yet some I found with readyer tounges forth with to reprehend it,
Then fraught with skill to frame the like, or ought perhaps to mend it.
But who so ready to control, or fit to carpe, and clatter,
As he that hath the dymmest sight, and judgment in the matter?
What if I did somewhat omit? what if the Print were lame?
What if I meant at leisure more to have enlargd the same?
How ever it be, I never meant to please each curious head,
Sith who so toils him self in that may bring a fool to bed.
Wherefore my good and honest friend refer the whole success
Of this, and all thy toils to him that will thy travails bless.
And as thou hast by labours great, obtained a grounded skill,
And settled sight in Surgery, so I exhort thee still
By skilful works the fame of such a faculty to raise,
Wherein we know most famous Clerks have, often, spent their days,
And travails great: in hope thereby immortal fame to win,
Whose worthy works do well bewray their painful toil therein.
I speak not of the famous Greekes, and fathers of the Arts:
Nor Guidoes works, nor Vigoes works that write of other parts:
But of the whole Anathomie Vesalius passing well.
Collumbus and Fallopius works, how much they here excel.
Whose skilful pens have painted so each part and piece of Man,
As none looks now to better it, (I think) nor ever can.
Whose lasting fame no age shall once be able to deface.
Among the which (good Banister) I wish to thee a place.
And so Adeiwe. And thou (good Reader) pardon I thee pray
My pen that in this homely rhyme hath raungd to far astray.
But three fold ways enforst thereto. For zeal unto my friend.
For wrongs of mine. For my professed Art. And so I end.

with diligent care, to consider the parts supporting. And the reason is good.
For The ^octrine of this History is most obscure, unless the bones be first
learned.
if you do not first exactely examine, and to a sufficient fulness feed your
appetite, with the diligent peruse of this History of Bones: you shall find
the rest of this book, not only in reading unsavoury, but also to your
sensible understanding very obscure. Wherefore of the Bones of mans body, what

Neither was it the mighty pleasure of God (whom we call Nature) nor any
parcel of his decree, that the substance of the bones at all should be made
sensible, Note that thoroughout the History of Man, we cite nature, for God.

Now forasmuch as in this our narratio of bones, diverse strange names, such as
to the simpler sort are altogether unknown, be here there scattered: It
shall be very convenient before hand, briefly to table out an expositio of them:
That thereby the reading of such in their places (being now first cracked and
shaled ^rom their obscure Husks) may be more perspicuous, and pleasant to
your contemplation: which otherwise would be loadsom, and tedious.

And first to begin, we will say what is understood by this word Appendance,
What an Appendance (...).
which the Greekes call (...). It is nothing else, save a bone springing to a
bone: or rather an addition or coagmentation of some bone, obteinyng a peculiar
circumscription, yet not being a true portion of that bone, whereto it is
committed. In young creatures therefore it is easily discerned, but in older and

to the bones, are called Appendances: which (contrary to the mind of Galen) we

must needs affirm to be softer then the bones them selves: since we delight
of^ times with our teeth, to pluck the Appendances of small Bones, to chew of
them in our mouths: for the pleasant juice that often they retain. Which A
proof, for when we eat meat, we will often pluck of the Append^ces of ^ones,

contrariwise we cannot do to the bone. Neither are they lightly to be losed,
or divided from the bones, by every motion: for that nature hath so well
provided for the turning of the joints, with such soft and slippery

Collumbus: or rather invented: and so as no man hath fully hitherto judged:
although Col li. c. 1 2.

many others h^ testifies, that nature hath made nothy^g in vain, but every
part to good purpose, and serving to some use. Realdus I say therefore sound,
that Appendances were in that order to the bones annexed, to the end that from
the place of their conjunction, Ligamentes might be produced and made, to
stregthen, hold, and stablish firmly, the composition and knitting of the
joints: as you see the top of the thigh, with the bone of the hipp: and
the neither part of it, with the bone of the leg. Likewise the bone of the
shoulder, with the How the Bones are united tha^ have no Appendances.
scaple bone: and that which in like sort is tied to Radius, and Vlua. As for
those bones that have no Appendances, how they are united. I refer you to the
History of Ligamentes to sinde. And not only where the joints are, do these

spring, but where no Coarticulatio is made also; as in Ilium, the Scaple
bones, some processes of the Vertebres. Thence also proceed Ligamentes,
necessarily chancing to yt sramyng of the good constitution of Muscles, as in
their proper place is to be sought. Whereby it comes, that from thence very
many Muscles often spring ^ut of Liga^tall Cartilages.
Muscles have their begynnings, whence also Ligamentall Cartilages proceed:
for so we think it good to call them, that to strength the Muscles, are
amongst them disseminated: ending also at their Tendans, Now again it is
manifest, The Ligamental Cartilages do a^ last end in (...) among the Muscles.
that Galen (for all his industrious search) failed to find the truth, in
affirming these Appendances to be added to the bones, for the conservation of
the marey, with in them included: but then saith Vesal. How happens it, that
other bones, (...). us part li 9.
Gal. supposed the Appendances se^ued to hold in the marey.
in which are no cavities so notably allotted to the reteinyng of marey,
should (notwithstanding) also have proper Appendaces: even as those, that are

bones, A plain confutation.
which not being much medullous, are nevertheless not of Appendances
destitute. But pretermittyng this convict assertion of Galen, it is sufficient,
that the Ligaments serve to the byndyng to gether of bones, and to the
constitutio of tendans.
truth is touched by the aforesaid reasons of Col. proving how Ligametes by
Appendances are most engendered, and consequently the two proper gifs given unto
Ligamentes. Which, whilst they are so necessary, as we have proved, that the

Ligamentes should sittly proceed. And thus much you have to understand, as oft
as you read of Appendances: in what bone or part so ever it be. What a
process, called of the Greekes Apophilis, (...).

fully and directly to speak of every particular Bone in the body, you shall
commit unto your memory, a word or two of the manner how mans body is construed,
and combinated, as touching the frame and Coarticulation of bones: as also of
the strange, and diffused names, wherewith their kinds of knittynges, in each
respect are nominated.

First therefore we must consider, how unprofitable unto man it had been, if
Col. li. (...). ca. 3.

the frame of his bones had been continual, whole, or Solide, so consequently

infinite number of Arts, that need innumerable actions, man, by natures
provident work in the construction of his frame, obtains accordingly, the
passing perfection of moving, sit for every one. Then so it were requisite,
that the composition of the bones should neither be dissolute, and vnioyned nor
yet altogether whole, and continual: but so made, that by the fit
Coarticulation, and knitting together by proper joints, they might as well
bow, and extend, as also remain one depending on an other, and together
supportyng. And notwithstanding the needfulnes of such Insoliditie, it is
otherwise as requisite, that the Bones were The (...) of the head are made for

not continual, but rather by proper means united, and that is for
Transpiratio sake: as in uniting the Bones of the head by Sutures: and again
for the diversity of the parts, as where the more hard, are committed to the
more soft.

Since then Nature (as we say) in construing, and compoundyng the bones of
mans body, hath not done it after one absolute reason, or manner, which every
man might easily comprehend, but so diuer^y, as seems sufficient, tedious for
the wise^: I will let you hear the opinions of the best learned, and famous
Anathomistes, with the meaning of the strange names, wherewith they have
entitled the diverse compositions.

differences of Symphysis, are endowed with any kind of motion.

But now let us come to every kind by him self. What is Sutura.
First Sutura, which the The Comissures like the nails.

whereat (notwithstanding) no man ought to grudge, if such a one as rectified

description of Bones: which, this well noted that we have hitherto said, you
shall in reading, far more easily understand. But first, if in the reason and
names of the compo sition of bones, hitherto so copiously handled, you be not
sufficiently instructed, or fully satisfied, it shall not be amiss, that now
and then, you help your self with this Table following.

The Bones of mans body are compounded together.
By Toynt, which is a composition of Bones with moving, whereof be two
differences: Diarthrosis,

Which is a knitting together of bones to some manifest moving, and is divided,
into Enarthrosis, Arthrodia, Ginglymon.


Enarthrosis is, where a round or long head is inserted with in some cauitie
answerable to it: as is the Articulation of the thigh, with the hip. y^
shoulder with Sapula. the first joints of the fingers, with y^ bones of the
back of the hand.

Arthrodia is, where a place being lightly hollow, that in the enter part,
admits a little ex pressed head, as the first Vertebre with y^ second, radius
cum cubito.

Ginglymos is that, where in the Bones do enter mutually one into an other,
that is, both receive, and are received: as the cubit with the shoulder bone,
y^ thigh with the leg, and the second and third ioynte^ of the fingers.

Synarthrosis,

Which is a Coarticulatio with obscure moving, being divided into the same
Species, or parts, as Diarthrosis is Videl. Enarthrosis, Arthrodia, Ginglymon.


In that only they differ among them selves, these having but obscure, those
manifest motion.

Neither is it any marvel, that the same things, being diuer^ considered,
may under diverse kynds in the same Praedicament be placed, for it falls out
sometime in diverse Praedicamentes.

Examples in this kind are these. of: Enarthrosis, the Bone Talus with the
botelike bone, and the third Bone of the wrest, with the first, and second of
the same. Of Arthrodia, the Bones of Tarsus among them selves, Cyboides with
the heel bone, and certain Bones of the wrest among them selves. Of
Ginglymos. Talus with the heel Bone, some likewise of the wr^st Bones among
themselves.





or By Symphysis, which is a ioynyng together of the bones without moving, and
is divided in three: Videl.
Sutura, Gomphosis. Harmonia,
Sutura is that manner of composition, scene in the head, wherein the bones are
committed together like the teeth of a saw, as is Sutura
Coronalis, Sagittalis, Labdoides.


Gomphosis, is, when one bone like a nail is fastened with in an other, as the
teeth in the jaws.

Harmonia, is a joining toge there of bones by some simple line, as y^
Comissures of the upper iaw, that chiefly, which is in the nose, and runs
after the longitude of the palate.


All these are connitted together by
Synchondrosis,

Which is an vnio of the bones made by a Cartilage: as is scene in Os Pubis, the
breast bone, and Ilium, when it is knit to Sacrum.

Syssarcosis.

Which is a conjunction of bones by the apposition of the flesh coming upon
the, as is scene between the teeth jaws, as also in those joints, which Muscles
do environ.

Syndesmosis.

Which is a composition of Bones by the means of a Ligament, as in y^ joints
appcareth.

regarding outward causes. But besides that, Hipocrates Lib. de homine hath
testified against Celsus in these words: Saniores capitis sunt, qui plures
Suturas habent: and that Galen, in sundry places, commends the construction
of the head made with Sutures. I think it good also to declare unto you the

vaporous sumosities (which otherwise by the seamy Commissures, would
transpirately evaporate) being in such retentive sort included and finding no
passage to regurgitate the superfluities, were not only the original causes
of his perpetual dolor, and animal vexation, but also in fine inferred

I have (right willing Reader) in the delineation of these bones, imitated
somewhat narrowly the judgment of Collumbus, because, in the invention of the
upper jaw bones, he triumphs over all before his time. Nevertheless, if any

It is furthermore to be considered, that the implantation of the teeth is not

But now to speak somewhat generally of all the teeth, we say, by the probable
assertions of the best forewriters, that from all other Bones (to the parts of
mans body appertinent) the teeth do plainly differ iij. manner of ways.

so much as is infixed within the Goummes to be perfect sensible, by virtue of
the Nerve extended to that region. Wherefore their Assertions are odious, and
most loathsome to answer, who fantastically fain, that all Bones are
sensible, or else the teeth also destitute of any feeling: as though it were
as much requisite for the Solid parts of the body, and such as, no otherwise
then the frame work of a house, do support, the other members should retain
as delicate sense as other parts Organs of the body, whose functions without

necessary to the comely form of the countenance. And we see it happens (many
times) that they are ruined, by such cruciable torments of Rheumaticke
incursions, or other like affects, that no Medicin may prevail to procure the
patiets ease, till the same dolorous tooth be extirped plucked up by the
roots: at which separation, and departing from the sensible Surcles or twigs
of the Sinew aforesaid, It Nerues be inserted to y^ roots of the teeth, they
must needs have sense.
how painful it is, I refer it to the sentence of them that have tasted the
bitterness thereof. And if any man will wilfully run in such absurdity, as
that he will deny the insertio of Nerues within the roots of the teeth, to be
of nature ordained for any purpose, let him still lye drowned in dreaming

increase: which makes the last of the three differences, whereby I
distinguished the nature of the teeth from other bones. That is to say, that:

They are not only nourished, but also perpetually grow: whereas the bones How
lunge the teeth do grow.
And according to the sentence of Galen, they augment, and are nourished the
space of forty and five years. But in Lib. 5. de comp. Med. secundum loca, he
saith, they increase almost the whole term of mans life. And thus much of the
triple formed difference. Now I will return again to the peculiar properties
of the teeth. How the roots of the teeth are ^erforated, and to what end.


Among which, it is worthy to be noted, that all the roots of the teeth are
perforated, and persed through into the Celles or Cavities within the said
roots: which are very little, but most notable, to comprehend more aptly the
parts, whereby they are nourished, for at these holes the teeth receive, both
the Vein, Artery, and Sinew lately spoken of. Which three vessels, penetrate

them, as long as that Humour in the said Membran is deteyned: or until of the
Fluxion by purging the brain, the cause be aptly consumed.

Moreover, for so much as appertains to the generation of teeth, it is
worthily approved, that not at that very instant when they issue forth of the
Goummes, they are engedred: but rather the root of their generation is in the
infant, whilst That the teeth a^ (...) ut the mothers womb although they

testimony sufficient to satisfy us, or the authority of Collumbus credible:
the which roots, or begynnynges, preordained of nature for the after growing
of teeth, he protests Lib. 1. cap. x.

to have inuensed many times, and so ost as he had occasion to search in
children that never were extract, or brought to light, as also in Abortes,
bearing short the time of xij. or viij. months.

Furthermore, the first Dentition of children brings forth Appendances, The
teeth hau^ Appendaunces which fall away.
which in Process of time (for the most part) fall away, and others with more
sollisitie are produced in their places, which seldom so easily fall again.
Wherefore in persons of riper years I reckon no Appendances: Notwithstanding
that in some, the fall of teeth are renewed at many years.

It needs not to be inferred, since therein experience instructs each man

how greatly they avail to the modulation of speech. And that principally, the

we note by the way: that by the customable manner, and frequented phrase of our
English speech, this word hand, comprises all the space between the inferior
head of Radius, and the extremities of the fingers: which, by the order of How
the hand is be^ded by Anathomicall description.

The fourth and least of all is knit unto the third.

The fifth is the first of the second rank, and next unto the thombe.

And thus, as you see in number, and figure, they are different, so also in
greatness, and litlenes. For the greatest of all are the first, and vij. of

the inner side by the aforesaid valley, or vawlte, seems to make a most apt
way, and safe conduction for the tendons, produced in that region: so must we
consider, that they of the extrinsecall region of the wrest, are not rashly

the truth stands otherwise. Vesalius notes the composition of these bones,

saving that the Articulation thereof, is more slack then in the rest: whereby
(also) it purchases a more evident motion. It is fastened unto the fifth bone
of the wrest, by Arthrodia under Diarthrosis although (by reason of those bones
which be s^all) such manner of Articulation may be referred unto Enarthrosis.
For the ^ift bone of the wrest hath a cauitie sufficient plain, as a corner
excaued, whereunto, the head of the joint, after a certain manner long, and

The second Postbrachiall bone, which Galen numbreth the first, ends at a
Brachiall bone, and joins his side to the side of the fifth: whereto, in that
manner it seems to clave.

appropinquate, and touch the effect: and of their quantity, form, and
combination to say as it is.

the third, and so the third, being last, are also least in all the fingers.

Furthermore a double, or ij. fold form remains to these bones: in one of

which, all the joints agree: but the other, much unlike the first, the last
joints obtain common to them selves: for their bones are more depressed then

stretch, the more also are they attenuated, and stretened, until they have

and thick: that is, both their extremities are consistent in heads: whereof,
the uppermost, is greater then the neithermost: and all the whole space, from
the uppermost head, to the nether, is made more slender, and slender.

Furthermore these bones outwardly, are made (as it were) crookyng, or bending
inwards: but on the inside flat, and rather sinuous, or hollow: because there

is Enarthrosis Articulation: being in this place right requisite that fingers
might have free scope to all sides, and turns: though Vesalius denied them
their circular motion, or round turning, as Collubus notes.

In the inferior part of these bones, are prominent two heads, between which,
one angular, or cornered cauitie is engraven, into the which enters the middle
portion of the head of the bone following, being, for the purpose, lightly
proturbered, or swelled forth: and those heads again, are likewise inserted
to the cavities, exculped on either side in the other. Whereby it is manifest,
that these joints both receive, and also are received: the which manner of

the Cartilages, and swathed them every one in Ligamentall bonds, according as
to every part she called dew, it followed then necessarily, that some
instrument were devised whereby those parts should be drawn mutually one to

necessities, nature Why voluntary motion could not be by Ligaments Why not by
Nerues.
easily did foresee, that only by Ligamentes she might not use voluntary
motion, because they were neither with sense nor moving endowed, not being
continually with the virtue of the animal power: neither yet of Nerues only
actio might be made, since they have not the force, thorough their softness, and
tenuitie, to draw, and use so great a weight as behooved. Wherefore she devised

might be in conclusion harder then the Nerve, and softer then the Ligament:
therewith also to participate of sense less then the Nerve, but more then the
Ligament. The Muscle hath less sense then the Nerve and more then the
Ligament.
So that of the Ligament the Muscle hath his strength, and of the Nerve whereby
to feel and move. Collumbus to this purpose hath these words.

have found it. These ij. Muscles occupy the whole forehead, and as much of the

nothing then truth may be truer. And other places as this which I was not able

thou shalt reap as much commodity (friendly Reader) by the description of such
parts as here by him I have inferred, as by any Anathomist that ever writ

as one upward, an other downward, and other into. to either side, it is meet
they had as many Muscles also as guides of their moving. Wherefore there is one
resident in either side of the eye, and the other two placed one above, and an
other beneath: for all these being dissolved into Sinewy Filamentes, make one
circle of a broad tedon ending in Iris. But besides, that the circumaction of
the eye might be the surer, Nature made two other Muscles and placed them in
oblique sort, one in one eye lid, and the other in an other, extended both
above, and beneath towards the lesser angle or corner.

Furthermore of these vi. Muscles the first iiij. even as they yield straight
motions (...). (...). 2. Cap. 11
to the eye, eve so are their seats accordingly set straight, and all each
where answerable one to an other. The heads of them have their beginning, as
from the hard Membran of the brain, covering the visible Nerve, and from the
Sinew of the second payse of the brain, immediately after the coming forth of
the visible Nerve out of the Scule. Moreover their belly is more ample and
large, then deep and profound, yet in sight is most round, lying to the
posteriour region of the eye and visible Nerve, after the longitude of it in
going from the Scule unto the root of the eye: and whereas the same belly
approaches near the middle seat of the eye where it is broadest, there it
makes an end with a broad Membraneous eneruation. Which is in deed beyond the
middle part of the eye, and directed to the hard tunicle thereof, like as if it
were to the moving of a bone: but being brought after the longitude of the body
of the eye: it is settled to the line near Iris or the greater circle of eye,
as in the former part of the eye appears separatyng the black from the
white.

Again, the Muscles of circumduction, or they that lead the eye about are in
fashion like to the first, and also in beginning, yet less, and in the manner
of their situation and insertion differyng from them. For the first hath his
beginning from Dura Membrana clothing the visible Nerve from the region of the
lesser corner, and is inserted to the lower seat of the eye with his sinewy
thinnes, and with an oblique lyne near to Iris after the manner of the rest.
The other spryngeth from the Membran of the visible Nerve, out of the region of
the greater angle of the eye, and sustayneth his sinewy tenuitie to the hard
tunicle of the eye, with a more (...) lyne, at the upper seat of the eye.
Hereby it appears, that the Muscles of the eye do vary among them selves
only in situation, and by insertion to the hard tunicle of the eye. For the
iiij. first (as is said) are wholly straight, and with a more straight line
inserted. The other ij. more cross, or slopwise, attempt their insertion with
an oblique line. Which although they are available for circumuertion, yet
besides they move the eye both upward and downward.

Further those Muscles together whilst yet they observe their proper place,
are reckned in figure like a Pear made sharpe beneath and broad above: whose
sharpe end is their beginning, but the broad part or seat, their insertion. In
their short space they are knit together to the visible Nerve, containing in
the capacity (which by meeting together they make) much hard fat, which
other where, in the description of the eyes we have spoken of at large. Briefly
all these said six Muscles, produced from the hard Membran of the brain,
covering the visible Nerve, or in compassed sort inserted with Membraneous
tendons in the anterior seat of the hard tunicle, near to the sides of Iris.
The first therefore, which is in the great corner, draws the eye inward
towards the nose: the second lying in the lesser angle, leads the eye there
towards: the third lying beneath, brings it downewardes: the fourth above,
toward the eye brows: and the fifth, and sixth circumuerte, and turn the eye
about each way.

Besides those vj Muscles, there is yet an other great one hid on each side by
Galen. Ibid
the others, and compassed about with the aforesaid fat. This shows the same
likeness that the other vj. do figure together: for from the hard Membran
moving the visible Nerve, it hath his beginning, but somewhat more forward the
the first six. His beginning is fleshie, as the rest of the body thereof, that
round compasses the visible Nerve, and being stretched forth from the
beginning to the four parts like a Pear or pine apple, increases, and
enlarges by little and little until it touch the posterior part of the eye,
whereto it is emplanted as a circle. Neither doth it assay this insertion near
this visible Nerve, but almost where the eye begins to increase the largest.
This Muscle lifts the eye upward, and downward, and therewithal turns it.

Netherto (as briefly as I might) thou hast to consider of the Muscles of the
eyes, abstract sensibly from Galen, Uesalius, and the rest of Anathomistes,
(...) all described the eyes of beasts, not of men. Because I will be purged of
all superstition of partial judgment, thou shalt thy self (friendly Reader)
discuss the case, and since both the ways are laid before thy face, see if
thou caust separate the eye of man from beasts: the worthiest of both being

abstain a while both from Vesalius and Galen. Who whilst herein they
dissected not the body of man, I know not whether we have more cause to shun
both their opinions in this respect, or condyngly to commend Collumbus, for his
integrity: not in finding the fault but for hating the fault, neither for
reproving those authors, but for his endeavour to amend the miss. But of the

imputed unto him, where he describes the eyes, which in man (although the more

had considered diligently, imagined that those muscles sprung from the

heavy. Wherefore (saith Collumbus) there is nothing in this left whereby to
excuse them, when as a great absurdity should be followed, if we should also
affirm those muscles to proceed from thence, whose Fibres only well marked,
shall descry them to be one, and not ij. deuisible muscles.

after diminishes, and at length ends at a Tendon short and broad: which is
inserted in the anteriour part of the shoulder under the neck thereof. This

muscle to be divided in iiij. but that is denied, albeit sometime that in the
nether part thereof (as saith Collumbus) a certain portion sharpe stretching
out, is found in some men as though it were a muscle, when as in deed it is
none. But (saith the same Author) to this absurdity he hath added another more
absurd, by thinckyng the arm to be moved obliquely by means thereof: which in
Apes, and not in man is proved true.

The second muscle of the shoulder is iij. square, thick, and intertexed with
Fibres, and is called by Anathomistes (...), and (...), and Humeralis. It
springs out of the midst of the Cannell bone, from Acromion, and the whole
great Process of the shoulder blade: it hath a broad and tendinous beginning,
but the end of it is sharpe: it is carried above the head of the shoulder, and
ends in the midst of the shoulder at a strong and ouerthwarte tendon, which
^edon embraces the middle thickness of ye shoulder: it consisseth of many
Fibres, wherewith the arm is lifted above, forward, in the midst, and
backward.

But the third muscle of the shoulder is carneous and round, which from the
Fibres straight, from the beginning unto the very end: being situated
obliquely, goes foreward above the anteriour and bounched part of the shoulder
blade, and goes out into a broad and strong tendon, which plants it self in
the posteriour part of the shoulder: and it is the part of this muscle to draw
the arm downward towards the posteriour parts.

The fourth muscle is great and broadest beginning at the point of the ridge

the cauitie which we call the armehole. Diverse Fibres hath this muscle, and
therefore it is a mean to move the arm diverse ways downward, that rather in
oblique sort then in any other kind of position. It hath iij. corners unequally

of them the one is short, the other ij. long, and their original is thus. The
short corner is from the sixth Vertebre, unto the end thereof: and of the long

that place unto the end thereof.

The fifth Muscle occupies all that cauitie which is betwixt the top of the
Process thereof, springing from the posteriour part of it. It is fleshy, and
ends at a strong tendon, whilst it is carried under the Ligament that
knits the shoulder and the scaple bone together. It ends in the head of
the upper part of the shoulder, much cleauyng also to the shoulder blade it
self.

soever The sall of Galen.
Galen saith to the contrary, of whose confutation in this matter for the
moving Col. Lib. 5. cap. xvij.
of the head, read before in the History of bones: where is described the
first, and second Vertebre of the neck.

The Muscles serving to his proper mouynges are seven on each side.

The first spring fro the Spine of the superior Vertebres of the breast,

up the Vertebres of the neck, unto the third, are afterwards divided, run
stopwise towards the hinder part of the head, where they end between the
posteriour part and the ears. Their Fibres are straight from the beginning,
until they come to the place where ye Muscles are divided: but afterwards as
they stretch upward, so far their race is a slope, or oblique, and sufficient
fleshy are these Muscles. Their office is when both labour with one consent
together, that ye head might be drawn backewardes to the posteriour parts,
but when the one works only, then is the head compassingly turned to the one
side. To those Muscles are three sides, one from the beginning to the place
whereas he is divided from his fellow, an other from thence to the hinder part
of the head, and the third from the hinder part of the head unto their
beginning.

The second Muscles are diverse, because they have diverse figures and
impressions, Muscles. Although in deed it is but one pair, as one would say
the right, and the left. They spring with a sharpe beginning from the
transuerse, or ouerthwarte Process of the fourth and fifth Spondiles of the
breast, and ascendyng upward, are at length fastened in the midst of the hinder
part of the head. Their situation is directly straight, their office is to draw
the head to the posteriour part straight.

The third Muscles are sclender, which spring from the ridge of the second
Vertebre of the neck, and end at length in Occciput, which is the hindmost
bone of the head, but by the way, they go somewhat disjoined. The Fibres which
they possess are straight, therefore do they lead the head directly
backewardes.

The fourth Muscles are hidden under the third, and are all fleshy even as the
Vertebre, where should have been a ridge or Spine unto the same Vertebre, but
that nature took it away because it might be no impediment or greuaunce unto
the essence of the third Muscles. In the midst of Occiput is their end, and
their office is to draw likewise the head backewardes directly. Neither is it
any marvel, why nature ordained so many Muscles only to draw the head
backwardes, for so it was necessary: Why nature appointed so many Muscles to
the drawing of the head backward.
since the Anteriour part of the head is much more heavy because thereto is
joined both the face and nether jaw. Whereby the fore-part becomes of right
heauyer then the hinder.

In oblique sort are situated the fifth pair of Muscles moving the head being
Vertebre, and ended in the ouerthr wart Process of the first. These Muscles
are sclender and all fleshy, serving to pull the head in round compass
together with the first Vertebre.

The vi. are also oblique, but contrary ways they make ye form of a triagle,
Process of ye first Vertebre, so do they end in ye hinmost bone (Occiput) of
the head, and that in the midst: these draw to the fore parts.

So these ij. last recited the v. the vj. are the proper Muscles which move the
head roud or in compassed sort, by the help of ye first Muscles, and the last
which yet are to describe. But now therefore they which are in the vij. place
are long. Fibres spring from the top of the breast and Cannell bone. They have
ij. begynnynges, between which lies a concauitie, or spare hollow. They are
sinewy and broad in their beginning, after also fleshy, and are planted to the
Mammillar Process, which they embrace. When both of them labour, the head
enclineth forward, but as oft as only one of them moves, the head goes to
the side. They are further very strong, and able also to how the head directly
downward. But this more over is to be noted, that these What Muscles do make a

they are more largely moved, because the breast by the Muscles is also more
dilated. The proper Muscles of the breast are 81. the common 8.
Of these motions the voluntary is made by Muscles, but the other only by

proper Muscles 81. and 8. common. Which although they be put in Abdomen, and In

which they serve to dilate.

The secend Muscle is great, broad, and all fleshy, beginning at the seat of
the Cartilages. The ends of this Muscle are like unto fingers. and was made to
dilate these viij. ribs.

The third is a small one, coming from the Spine parts of the three last
Vertebres of the neck, and first of the breast, in the beginning broad and
Membraneous, but ends at the first rib of the breast and sometime in the
posteriour part of the fourth. And thus was it made of nature to dilate those
ribs.

The iiij. Muscle is also small and iiij. square, brought from the Spine of the
ij. Vertebres of the breast. And sometime fro the first of the loins. In the
beginning it is broad, sinewy, Membraneous, but after becomes fleshy, ends
in the iij. last ribs, after the manner of fingers: so can they dilate those
ribs.

The fifth carneous, rises from the hinder, and upper part of Os sacrum, and
Ilium, cleaning so fast to the second Muscle of the back, as it may be thought
a portion thereof. Nevertheless when it comes to the ribs, it shows
plainly it self to be diverse from the Muscle of the back The higher it
ascends the slender it waxes, being at length inserted by the stay of sinewy

The same Author infers also by what means Uesalius was deceived. For
(saith he) he supposed in this motion that the first rib remains not moved.
But the matter is plainly otherwise. For it is stirred by the first Muscle of
the breast, which springs from the Cannell bone: so that when it is lifted up,

it draws the ribs after in order: whereto the Intercostall muscles are
assistant: and so they are outward extended, the exterior Muscles helping
them: but downward contrarily by the help of the inferiors. For because the
last rib is drawn downward by the oblique ascendent Muscle of Abdomen: And
after this order aforesaid they are dilated. Notwithstanding when that both do
work together, that is the outer and inner, then follows construction of the
breast generally, as somewhat before is written.

THere is yet an other Muscle common to both sides, which the Grecians call

overthrown by Collumbus. For as touching that matter, if Septum transuersum

away it forces not, since the meat hath a close entrance, and passage into
the Uentricle, neither may it by any means send, or let pass vapors to the
hart: for the substance of the stomach is not so light and Spongy. Again if
it might, it appears the hart should not be offended at all thereby, saying
(for proof,) in birds, and diverse creatures, it is naturally wanting. But to
the purpose.

Moreover this Muscle of the breast ministers both to expiration and

using this his Col. lib. 5. cap. 21.

asendyng, draws to him the extreme parts of the breast, and binds toge^her
all the inferior part: all which effect it works whilst we expire, or
breath forth. But when we receive in the breath, it takes a clean contrary
labour in hand: for then being relaxed, and saggyng downward, it suffers the
inferior parts of the breast to be dilated. And this is the notable utility
of Diaphragma, as the same Author reports to have beholden in quick
dissections.

therewithal compellyng the expulsiue faculty: as when we draw together the
belly to the expulsing of excrementes, we cannot sitly accomplish the same
only by straying the lower parts, but by enlargyng the breast, and compressyng
the midreif together with forcibly retaining of breath. By which means
Diaphragma thrusts upon the lower parts: to the end, that in straining the
nether belly by the assistance of the strong Muscles of Abdomen, none of the
intrels might seek to have scope or recourse upwards, but altogether
consentiuely forcing one an other downward, to make a most strong, and certain
exclusion of the supers^uous dregs of the third digestion.

words: The midrief called also an ouerthwarte diuisio, and a girdle to the
body, besides that it is the first instrument of inspiratio, it helps also
very well to the vnloadyng of the belly, and driving out dregs.

This Muscle is clothed both above and beneath as with a garment: above with
Pleura, and beneth with Peritonaeum. It springs from the Vertebres.

Others esteem the sinewy part to be the beginning thereof. Notwithstanding
Col. Ibidem.
Collumbus ascribeth the beginning thereof unto the ij. little long parts
thereof, The beginning of Septum transuersum.
which Vesalius calls Ligamentes, which little bodies, come from the side of
the body of the xij. Vertebre of the breast, and from the upper joints of the
loins, and from thence afterwards doth the sinewy part take his beginning,
which is joined to the Cartilage, called Gladialis, or commonly Mucronata.
Which in the Mucronata Cartilago.
History of Cartilages is fully described: being begotten as a propugnacle to
this aforesaid Muscle, but not to the mouth of the Uentricle as the come crew
of Physicians do suppose. And to this part also the hart lies.

Finally the midrief is fleshy on both sides, and is implanted at length to the
Ca^tilages of the false ribs, embracing the last. The perforations of this
noble Muscle.


Uesalius hath affirmed the perforation of this noble member to be made three

needful parts, for the communion of the vital with the natural, and the
natural with the vital members. Yet it is but twice pierced, or bored
through, as once by the hollow Ueyne, which forthwith marches into the breast:
and the second time, by the stomach, or neck of the Uentricle called also
Aesophagus, wherewith likewise do descend two Nerues from the vj. pair of
sinews of the brain. But the journey of the great Artery perforateth not
this Muscle: for as much as whilst it amplecteth the Vertebres, it embraces it
also, but therefore Lib. 2. Cap. 21.
makes no hole. To this end (therefore) Fuchsius saith that the way of the
great Artery deserves not the name of a hole, but rather a half circle
carved out of the compassing part of the midrief, that is when it embraces the
inner side of the Spondiles, there lying the way of the same great Artery,
called in Greek (...) (...).

and not the same hole where through Aesophagus passes. For flat against that
lies the testimony of verity, had it been the sentence of Socrates him self,
as it The fall of Hipp. and Galen.
was of Hipocrates and Galen: though no man can say they were men of no Divine
understanding.

Thus Septum transuersum is accounted among the Muscles of the breast, whereby is
showed how much, and of what efficacy it is in respiration.

But so much as is said in that behalf, tends to the sense of natural
respiration. Galen Lib. de Mot.
Muse. (...).
For whatsoever is vehement, or violent, the same is contrary thereto. For if so
the quality of the heate of the hart do increase, or occasion serve that, for
the speech, or other like, larger breathing is required, then else could well
suffice nature, by by the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth, together with
the interior Septum trasu^sum is only y^ author of natural respiration.
muscles called Intercostales on both sides, do labour with Septum transue^ sum.
But if further by bodily causes or sudden occasion, great and larger
respiration be required, as for example to the use of hollowyng, crying,
blowynges of trumpets, shalmes, or other vehement efflations, then the
exterior Intercostales are provoked Natural ^respiration.
to move, which be motions not natural. For natural respiration is that which
is brought to pass without the help of the Intercostall Muscles, and that is
it which this worthy member sufficiently brings to pass: and whatsoever
E^tation.
is more, the same hath more help, and is natural, but rather we may term
them necessary for serving at needful times.

As to be plain, this is not natural, but a very necessary kind of
respiratio, when a man by earnest study ormuse unto him self, upon any earnest
or weighty matter, by tossing and turmoiling of his wits, with continual
inward cogitation of the hart, accenseth and heats more the spirit then
natural respiration is able to temper: then he at a sudden makes a vehement
inspiration, and after as large efflation, which with indifferent intermission,
proves profitable to cool the kindling heate of the hart: a more vehement
then that is proved in trumpettors, pypers, hunters, and such like exercises.
And therefore necessary, though not accounted of Galen natural. Which argues

parts, their Fibres running the same race: therefore are they called oblique
descendents, being broad, and situated in the side parts. They issue forth
from the sixth, seventh, eight, and ix. rib, before they begin to end in a
Cartilage, and further from the ribs following, and the top of the
transucrse Processes of the Vertebres of the loins, and from the half of the
Appendaunce of Os Ilium: they have most broad beginning and fleshy, set out
like the fashio of fingers, between which ends the second Muscles of the breast
do enter, which dilate the viij. ribs. But after they have gone a good space
foreward, they degenerate into a broad, sinewy, and Membraneous tendon, which

and like as is said of the Muscles Intercostales they cross one another,

the beginning like a Mebran, and going upwards sleshy, as knit unto the lower

by being embraced between these two, are made by that means stronger, and in

divided, the strait muscles in no wise could have been placed in the midst.
But these Iendons are united together again at the white lyne, and here do

nevertheless sometime they have but one fleshy beginning. They are ended in

without tendons: yet have they three tendinous, and sinewy intersections,

principal properties of these Muscles: in that they retain such worthy
faculties as to attract, retain, and expulse. In deed I confess that our
meaner sort of Surgeons, who are not able to dispense with the Latin

although Galen we see himself, was in Anathomie now and the deceived.

But I much marvel whence they took this fond opinio, that the straight
Muscles made the attractive power in the body, the transuerse the retentive

every of these should orderly baire unto the body, without any other cause of

nature commands and provokes to be done?

I answer unto thee briefly, that as the Uentricle hath oblique Fibres to

As touching the retentive fa^ultie, whereby each thing should be kept till

turns, and wyndynges of the intrelles.

How the expulsiue faculty is made, I have already fro Galen, Vesalius, and

the Abdomen, Diaphragma also depressed.

the top of the great Trochater or Process of the thigh, and embraces it.

The third Muscle of the thigh lureketh under the second whole, being also Os
Ilium, and as is said of other two in his progress it diminishes, ceasing at
a tendon, which to the said great Process is knit, and that in the inner point
thereof, where it is somewhat inuerted.

These iij. Muscles have the office to extend stretch out the thigh, to

and draw it upwards, as also to lead it to the exterior parts.

The fourth hath an oblique situation, and springs from the iij. lower hones
Os sacrum, with a fleshy (as it seems) and round beginning. The end of it is
at a round tendon, which in the top of the greater Process toward the
posteriour parts ends, and drawing the thigh to him self, hath also power
to help the circumaction thereof.

The fifth Muscle is of the loins sited in Abdomen, being round, fleshy, thick
Vertebre of the breast, and the iij. uppermost of the loins, where the body of
the Vertebres is: it destendeth upon Os pubis, and ending at a round tendon, is
to the lesser Trochanter inserted.

The vi. Muscle occupies all the whole inner hollow part of Os Iliu: it
begins Abdomen with a semicircular rising: it descends above Os pubis, and
is fleshy almost to the extreme end thereof, where it degenerates into a
tendon, which to the lesser Trochanter is The use of the fifth and (...).

thigh.

The seventh goes out from Os pubis, near unto the Cartilage thereof with
Trochater with a slender tendon. And this nature made to draw one thigh toward
an other, and to put one thigh upon an other. And thus saith ^ib. 5. Cap. 50.

or a loft an other.

The ninth Muscle occupies all that hole contained in Os pubis, and Coxendix,
Trochanter apparent.

The tenth and last Muscle of the thigh is in the interior part, and the
aforesaid Muscle (saith Collumbus) is not only not to be neglected, but
chiefly, and most especially to be marked, for it is marvelous therein to
contemplate the great providence of the high creator. For the beginning The
ma^ueilous creation of this tenth Muscle.
thereof is broad and fleshy, as before is said of the i^. Muscle, and from
within, it is carried without above Coxendix, where ye cauitie is made that
represeteth the form of a polley. This Muscle where it bows to it self in
going forth makes oft times iij. tendons, sometime four, and five, which are
at last united together, constituting one only notable tendon, whose end in the
posteriour part of the greater Trochanter is finished. But ere I end, where
this Muscle begins first to taste of tendinous substance, there immediately
nature by great in dustry hath pre^red a ^leshy purfe or bag, wherein this
tendon is safely placed from any burt by the same bone, which is by this muscle
comprehended, neither is the same fleshy bag being so good a propugnacle, any
way to be accounted an a distinct muscle from the (...).

earth, and the other taken from the same, and cir^lated. But to fasten and set
down on the earth is the action of the foot, and to circumlate, or fetch
about is the action of the whole leg. This is not only in going, but also in
running: the one foot continually being set on the ground the other together
with the whole leg carried forward. But to change the platos of footing
happens by the benefit of the leg: albeit that the stay of our falling,
and firm setlyng on the ground, is brought to pass by the good composition of
the foot.

Veselius describes the leg as though it were only to be exteded, and
bowed, V^l. ^pit. Cap. 2.

any thing, that it doth imitate the motion of the first muscle that moves
Radius directly downward. For it being sited obliquely could not have or make
any straight motion: and because he had denied oblique moving to the leg I
omit to say he would not acknowledge the right office of it. But surely he hath
left the use thereof to be of other more aptly described, as appears by that
is said. Where fore so much the rather I give credit unto Collumbus, and to his
assertion as touching this oblique motion.

The first of these Muscles rises both sinewy, also fleshy fro the inner part
of Appendance of Os Iliu, but forthwith goes forward sleshy, broad, thin
like a swadle band, slopwise is delated by the interior parts of the thigh,
but when it comes to the inner head of ye thigh, it proceeds, at a sinewy
tedon is ended, which is not round (saith Collumbus) as Vesalius would, but
broader, fastened in the fore part of the leg. He also reprehedeth Galen
(unless his meaning was only of Apes) in that he affirms, by the benefit of
this muscle that one leg is laid upon an other, as children have occasion to
do in playing.

But to go forward, the second muscle of the leg springs from the anteriour
Cartilage of Os pubis, the beginning thereof being broad, after the length of Os
pubis commissure: it descends fleshy, with straight Fibres, at the interior
head of the thigh made round, and cease at a sinewy tendon, also almost
round: notwithstanding it is furthermore dilated, and at length ended in the
fore part of the leg.

The third with a sinewy beginning long, and also round, springs from the
Appendance of Coxedix, being made fleshy afterwards about the midst of the
thigh, and is carried down by the hinder part of the thigh, with many sorts of
Fibres: but coming to the knee, it makes a sinewy tendon, wherewith it is
implanted to the posteriour but interior part of the leg.

The fourth from the same place begins near unto the third, but the be,
Fibres. Near unto the knee it goes out in a sinewy tendon, which before the
end is dilated, and ceases at length in the Anteriour part of the leg
between the first and second.

The beginning of the fifth is from the Appendaunce of Coxendix near unto
Muscle, Collumbus assures us it is not separable from this fifth Muscle neither
to be accounted one distinct Muscle from it. Nevertheless if any man will call
the same fleshy part of the fifth Muscle an other new Muscle. He supposes it
sufficient to have admonished us of his judgment. In the same place it
begins outwardly to degenerate into a tendon, which together with the
aforesaid flesh descends even to the end, and in the end is collocated in the
head of Fibula. If the cause be inquired why nature added to this Muscle this
portion of flesh, Collumbus saith, that to the end this Muscle might he made
the stronger, Nature would that it should come from the midst of the thigh to
be the nearer The use of yt (...) first Muscles of the leg.
unto it: for on the outside is only this Muscle, but in the inside be four.
And the office of these five Muscles rehearsed is to howe the leg. Although
that which Collumbus hath orderly described in the fifth place, Galen and
Vesalius have cited for the fourth.

This is that Muscle that Galen saith he commanded to be cut in a certain

unworthy, for such a prince of Phisic^e to imagine, or say. For this muscle
being taken away: direct flexion can in no wise be brought to pass: which
straight ^ectio of the leg, to be in running Galen admonishes: us in Lib.
secund. de Anat. administrat. And truly this case stands clean contrary: for
such as be wounded or cut into this muscle, although the wound be not very
great, yet when they are healed, it shalve a labour unto them to bow the same
leg. Thus much of the Muscles bowing the leg.

the midst of the leg ends at a broad and sinewy tendon, which always after

yet Collumbus (with Lib. 5. Cap. 30.

further, if it were not that he endeuoreth to shun by all means, what soever
might make the mind of the Reader perplexed, he would not fail to affirm
these ij. muscles (as they describe them) to be one, and only a muscle, with a
double beginning as is already said.

But in the mean time these two, which may so worthily be called one, do What

The third is a small muscle, rising fro the outer head of the thigh near to

under these two aforesaid, is obliquely placed, and contains oblique Fibres.

having in office to euerte the foot to the interior parts.

thereof.

The fifth muscle comes from the two Bones of the leg Tibia, and Fibula,
Ligament that is put between them to divide the Anteriour, from the posteriour
muscles. It is ^leshy almost to the end of the leg, and near to the inner
ankle: it ends at a strong, sinewy, and round Tendon: and going under the
inner ankle, as also under the botelike bone, at length ends under the sole
of ye foot in the part that is called Tarsus. Nature begat this muscle to
this use, to draw the foot inwardly: nether is it without a Ligament.

The vj. muscle flows from the posteriour part, with a long, and fleshy

inserted for no small utility: for they bow the iiij. toes, and strongly bind
them.

The vij, begins long, and fleshy fro Fibula the space of three fingers
under the Appendance: it is fleshy, until it come unto the heel, where it is
changed into a roud tendon, which from under the Ligament under the ankle
slips under the sole of the foot, and is inserted to the bone of the great
toe, to bow it. Hitherto of the posteriour Muscles of the foot: now to the

the Tendon, which is so lifted up, and evident to be se^e under the shin. It
ends at the part of the foot called the Plant, in the Bone that is put
before the great toe: and hath the power to bow the foot.

The second goes forth with a sharpe beginning from the Appendaunce of Tibia,
and cleaves to the Ligament that lies (as is said) between Tibia and Fibula.
Moreover at the end almost of this same Fibula, the root of this Muscle is
fleshy: notwithstanding it ends in four round Tendons, which are detained
under that Ligament, that rises out from the Appendance of Tibia, and Fibula.
The tendons extend^g the four toes.
These four Tendons are enlarged, and at last inserted to the upper part in

stretch forth these toes.

The third springs fleshy from the midst of Fibula, near unto the
Ligament: Ligament, carried and inserted to the last joint of the great toe,
which it doth extend. This tendon is into ij. divided, whereof the one ends
as aforesaid, the other is inserted in the same bone of the plant, yielding
help to the bowing of the foot. This second tendon springs also from the
muscle: which portion in some seldom bodies seems to be an other Muscle, as
some perhaps will suppose. But Collumbus affirms it to be but only one.

distinct begynnynges: whereof the one is sinewy and round, beginning from the
upper part of the brow of ye ruppe, or acetable made in ye scapple bone, it
goes further above the head of the shoulder, slips through that chincke
that is sited in the same superior part, which chincke in deed nature created
of purpose for this tedons sake. The other beginning of this Muscle, goes out
fro the Process called Ancyroides, partly sinewy, partly also fleshy: but the
fleshy part cleaves to the shoulder, and seems a distinct muscle, separated,
which yields help unto the shoulder, since thereby he is drawn towards the
breast. Furthermore these ij. beginninges of the said Muscle are united under
the head of the shoulder together, making athicke Muscle and almost roud,
strong, and filled with straight Fibres, which in the elbow leaves at a
sinewy Tendon, which near to the end is dilated, and knit to Radius, who hath
in the inside thereof a Tubercle, made propperly for the insertion of this
Muscle.

The ij. Muscle from the hone of the shoulder is carried all fleshy, with
straight Fibres, and lies hid under the first Muscle. It is carried fleshy
beyond the joint of the cubit, and lastly fastened to Cubitus, and Radius.
And the cubit by the utility of these two Muscles, is made directly to bow.

Here the hand is spoken of last of all after the same order, and accordingly

But to speak first of the interior Muscles, they be in number viij.

Collumbus writes of certain thieves which had not this Muscle, but only a
tendon brought from the inner Ligament of the wrest.

The second goes forth from the inner tubercle of the shoulder, tedyng sharpe
in the first beginning, both sinewy, and fleshy, it cleaves fast to the
cubit, and

The third Muscle begins at the same place, with an oblique progress after
Radius: yet in coming likewise to the wrest, it goes out into a round, and
strong Tendon, which is inserted to that of the Postbrachiall bones that
supports the little finger. The office of these two Muscles is, that, if both
move at once, they bow the wrest, but when one alone styrreth, then doth it
move obliquely, now up, now down, by the help notwithstanding of two
exterior Muscles, as we shall come unto anon.

The fourth hath a marvelous beginning. For it springs sharpe and sinewy
Cubitus, Radius. After, when it hath passed the midst of the cubit, it
stretches out narrow, is ended in iiij. round tendons, sinewy, perforated,
which are brought under the Ligament of the wrest, under which nevertheless the
iij. first Muscles are not carried. The end of these tedos is in yt second joint

wrought, to the end that the fingers after a certain order should follow one
an other.

The fifth Muscle is much stronger then the fourth, and no marvel: for that it

bowed by this Muscle, and that one of the tendons thereof should extend unto
the thobe: which to be true in Apes, Collumbus plain affirms. For the thombe
in man is moved by his proper Muscle, as shall be said. This fifth (moreover)
cleaneth to the Ligament which divides the inferior from the posteriour
muscles.

The vj. springs from Radius being likewise adherent to the same Ligamet and
iourneth down along the length of Radius, ending near the wrest at a round
Tendon and sinewy: which together with the Tendons of the fourth and fifth
Muscle, runs under the coape, or vault of the wrest of the hand, and
finally is inserted to the last joint of the thombe, which it bows.

The seventh Muscle with a fleshy beginning comes from the inner Tubercle

the flesh and nail, as is proved when any hurt happens between them, by the
great dolor that ensues, although the same payne lies not between the flesh
and nail saith Collumbus, but between the flesh and the Tendons. And the
office of this Muscle is to extend the four fingers.

The second Muscle begins at the same Tubercle near to the first with a
Radius, and Cubitus, and to the extreme end of the little finger is inserted.
The Muscle that leads the ^tle finger from the rest.
This round Muscle hath the office to lead the little finger from the rest, and
is no small use unto us for the making of the Paline of the hand.

The third Muscle goes out fleshy from the middle, very near, of Cubitus, in
Cubitus is a long rough lyne, made to give beginning to three Muscles. The
situation of this is oblique, and the end at a roud Tendon, which is inserted
to the fore finger to extend, and stretch forth the same obliquely. But this
said Tendon chooses a Ligament from the Appendance of Radius, and this Tendon
is divided in some, into two.

The fourth Muscle with a fleshy beginning from the cubit near unto the
Appendance of Radius, then ending at a round, and sinewy tendon, is to the
third joint of the thombe, to extend, and lead the same from the other fingers,
inserted.

The fifth from the same lyne of Cubitus, near to the fourth Muscle, with a
fleshy Collumbus) he that deliteth in the multitude of Muscles, may divide this

third to the first, and the iiij. to the bone of the wrest which supports the
thombe: there are sometime beside in this place found ij. other tendons: and
this Muscle hath the office to extend the thombe.

The vj. springs from the root of the outer Tubercle of the shoulder: it
em-braceth braceth, and is knit unto Cubitus, creepyng after the length thereof:
nevertheless in coming to the wrest it degenerates into a round sinewy, and

that although the tendons of the outside of the fingers be divided, and cut in

therefore: as diverse that (having small knowledge in A^atho my) do here and
there, greatly esteem them selves, for the good success of such cures,
purchased more by the benefit of nature, then their rare experience, or
singular application.

The sixth muscle goes forth from the Ligament of the wrest, and fro the forth

THe Uentricle consists of two broad and thin coats together joined, even

therefore the coat common both to the stomach and ventricle, immediately as it

varies from the inner coat of the stomach. For the interior part of the
coat, that respects the concauitie of the ventricle, is endowed with many
straight Fibres: for so (saith Vesalius) it behooved the vetricle by them to
draw, suck in the meat drink by the stomach. Galen before him also made the
like affirmation.

Galen, and after him Vesalius supposed that nature had constituted straight
Fibres in the inner coat of the ventricle, thereby that it might possess the

therefore it stood in no need of straight Fibres. Notwithstanding it is not

After this, as it was expediet, expulsion of the confected meates should
follow, like as after attraction, retention: so accordingly nature (put in the
second or outer tunicle of the ventricle, transuerse, or overthwart Fibres,
folden in also with some oblique for the outer coat, which is thicker and
softer the the inner, being not so stretely compact and bound together)

there are two proper coats unto the ventricle, and one common. And this

thence after the whole body thereof, even to the beginning of Duodenum, being of

The second vein is every where accompanied with an Artery: it is stretched

The third vein of the ventricle is very small, not associated with any

The fifth vey^e, being not depriued of the felowshyp of an Artery, goes about

prolonged down to the ventricle. For after that the recurrent sinews (in the
History of Nerues expressed) have poured out Nerues and branches to the
inuolucre of the hart, and by the like also communicatyng with lunges, they
immediately haste down to yt stomach, the right to the right, and the left
unto the left side: but the Nerues, so soon as they have a little space
descended with the stomach, committed only thereto by the interuenture of
Fibres, they both are divided in two and the right with oblique branches is
carried to the left side as the left unto the right: both which, accompanying
the stomach, pearse through the midrief, not offering thereto any branch at
all. But where the iiij. branches of the two Nerues do touch the upper Orifice
of the vetricle, with diverse orders of braunchynges they embrace it, reaching
straight downward surcles, with notable space between.

From the left Nerve of the vj. pair embracing the right region of the mouth
of the ventricle, a certain notable branch, after the higher side of the
ventricle even to the lower Orifice thereof, is deduced: which albeit that in
the progress thereof it pours out portions, and enwrappeth the nether Orifice
of the ventricle with some surcles, yet is it not there wholly wasted, until
further it have crept into the hollow of the liver.

But moreover, unto the lower part of the ventricle comes two Nerues,
purchasing their begynnynges from the stocks of the sixth pair of sinews of
the brain, brought down after the roots of the ribs: and being the mates
of those Arteries, supported by the superior Membran of Omentum, are digested
into the bottom of the ventricle. The use of the Nerues of the ventricle.


Amongst all which sundry portions of sinews that the ventricle stood in
need of, nature by none showed such noble providence, as in those to the
superior Orifice thereof inserted: which are not there in such manifold manner
scattered only to discern annoyance, at any time offred thereto by
choleric humours, or other of that kind, but likewise that by them, as by

his whole superior region towards the anteriour parts, and his right side,
and the right Gibbous part in the posteriour seat. But the higher part
thereof, consisting to the posteriour seat of the upper Orifice, and all the
whole left side thereof, is compassed with the midrief, only that side
excepted, with the spleen on the left side of ye vetricle, and lower posteriour
part thereof, occupies. But in his hinder part the ventricle obteineth the
inferior Membran of Omentum, and the vessels which therein are diffused.

Beside that, under his posteriour part, a part of the midrief, Vena Caua, and
the trunk of the great Artery, beside the back, and Muscles thereof, do
consist. But there is notwithstanding a great part of the Anteriour region of
the ventricle, which covered neither with the liver, midrief, kell, nor spleen,

beside Peritonaeum, and the viij. Muscles of Abdomen, there is a vein from the

after time of birth becomes without blood, and use.

To this vein, where being knit to Peritonaeum, it is laid over the ventricle
in round circuit, much fat springs, which, that the ventricle in his
concoctiue office might more swiftely labour, yields there some help.

Neither is the ventricle as some have fondly supposed, nourished by Chylus,

which it engenders, since by the benefit of those faculties, which it
obtains common with the other parts, it draws to it self out of the
veins, and retains and labours proper nourishment, thrusting out from it

follows the third, fourth, fifth, and others a great number. Wherefore for the
streit and long passages, with so many turns and foldyngs, every part of the
meat is at length constrained to appropinguate the mouth of some one, or other
of the vessels. Cue as the whole gut every where round about, is replenished
with an innumerable multitude of vessels: whose Orifices penetrate into the
capacity of the intrels, after the manner as shortly shall be said. Of the which

gut, but rather a rising, beginning, or a Process of the intrels. This
portion or part Duodenum is led into no anfractuous folds, as before of others
is said, Why Duodenum hath no folds.
for as much as under the ventricle where it is carried, it obteineth no spare
place, or vacant room in which it might aptly bow, and enfold it self. As
also that it be^oued it to give place to Uena porta coming from the hollow of

being the mother of all other veins in our body. To this are diverse thick
and great roots, which are inserted in the substance thereof from the top to
the bottom, and do all at length constitute that large vein, which is
extended and ramified both up to the head, and down to the foot. This vein
is rightly compared unto a great river. For from thence as there be many dikes

many branches are derived from this vein, like little brookes, and running
dikes, which are spre^ abroad throughout the whole body, transposing blood to
every Membran, of late made, and laboured in the liver.

This Vena Concaua, in ascending upward from the liver toward the head,
perforateth the midrief, in what place it is distant from the bodies of the
Vertebres, and in that place puts forth two veins, which, again divided
into branches, are distributed throughout the same Diaphragma. Which done,

the superior spaces of the upper ribs, and not only in the right side, but
in the left also, except in some, and those very few, in which a little branch
is derived on the left side from Vena Axillaris, and carried now to two, now to
three, and sometime to one of the spaces between the ribs only.

FRom all these veins nourishing the spaces of the ribs, as is said, there

spring yet other veins, which go in between the Vertebres, where the holes be
for the production of Nerues. These veins nourish the said Vertebres, and
Spinall marey, and enter in at the holes sited behind the bodies of the
Vertebres. From these further, before they enter in the Spinall marey to
nourish it, veins are also sent to the Muscles of the skin and back.

THen after from him stretches the humerall vein called also Capitalis or The

Cephalica, which nevertheless ascends not to the top of the shoulder: but
rather is carried after the inner region, and passing forth between the first
and second Muscle of the shoulder, stretches to the outer parts, and there
lies evident aloft. For when it is passed through the fleshy Membran, it goes
between it and the skin to the cubit, and is carried outwardly near to the
first Muscle that bows the cubit: at which bought it divides in two
branches, whereof one goes to the inside of the cubit, and in departing from
the bought thereof it is united with an other like branch of Basilica: of which

To which (of truth) me seems no reason can consent.

After that this Vena Axillaris is gone from out of the hollow of the breast,
and hath committed from him this vein lately described, it plunges it self
deeply ^.
under the Cannell bone at the Process of the scaple called Anchiroides: in
which place it obtains very many branches, which nourish the first Muscle
of the arm, and not only it, but also the second of the scapple bone, and the
second of the breast, and the fourth, and seventh of the shoulder, and the
scapple it self, and all the space even to Abdomen. Besides these, in women,
you must understand that other branches are convenient to the nourishing of
the breasts.

FUrthermore this Axillaris Vena being carried to the shoulder, under the first
Muscle bowing the cubit, is divided into iij. and those notable great veins.
The vein called (...), or (...) (...), and (...) (...).
Whereof one is called Basilica, or Hepatica, the inner veins (after
Hypocrates) of the cubitte.

This vein, which we have said to pearse so deep, comes alost by little little

Cephalica, it is divided in two, whereof the one is united in the inside of the
cubit with a branch of Cephalica: in which place is made the common vein.

apply two little veins, which after their sides to their extremities are
carried. An other branch passes at the bought, by that Ligament that is sited
between Cubitus and Radius, and is distributed to the exterior Muscles. The
other Axillaris in the midst of the shoulder is reflected toward the
posteriour part, limiting branches to the Muscles extending the cubit.
Afterwards it tends more downward to the longest Muscle and to the two
horned Muscles, and to those Muscles, which have their beginning from the outer
tubercle of the shoulder, and so is it among these Muscles dispersed.

compelled to stand lower. But after it is come unto the reins by the aforesaid

have us think of these to be made the searse, whereof Galen esteemed so much,
and that through it the Urine is streined, and it being dilated blood to be

Here in deed nature (saith he) might have been able to place Membrans as to
the Misera^ul veins, and to the ends of the vreters: but, because this seemed
more commodious unto it, there are certain eminences begot of the same
substance of the reins, which entering into the same branches, resist that the
blood, How bl^ud happens to be made with Urine.
which together with the serous matter is deduced to the reins, should

notable, when nature endeuoreth to thrust down any stone, that commonly is

The use of these Emulgent veins is to purgethe blood of serbu^ substance,
and to the reins to yield due nourishment. From this vein springs a bessell
called Vreter, that is Vrinarius: it springs invery deed from the body of
the same reyne, there it takes Urine, and brings it to the bleddar.

In the right side the same Emulgent vein is sited lower then the left, and
shorter far: for betwirt the hollow vein and the right kidney is f^ial
di^aued, yet is it set to in the same order as the left.

THere springs from the left Emulgent a vein called Seminalis, or a seed

not from the Emulgent to carry the serous humour to the left testicle whereby
the feast of Venus might with greater pleasure be celebrated, as many of the
aunciet Anathomistes heretofore have devised. For (say they) nature therefore
determined the beginning of one of these Seminall veins to be so far of, to
ye end that in the act of coiture, the trickling down of the humour so long a
scope, should only be to purchase the greater delectation in that present

But the true cause (saith Realdus Collumbus, is the litlenes of the said

which if it should have sprung out from the body of the hollow voyne as the
right doth, because it should then have gone over the great artery, it should
ever have been in danger in every great dilatation, which the same Artery
must needs make, to be broke. Which incomoditie to prevent, prudet nature
devised a needful mean: willing therefore that from the left Emulgent vein,
and not from the body of the hollow vein, the left Seminall passage should
take his beginning.

Contrariwise the right Seminall vein flows out from the fountain of The

And this is the race of the Seminall veins in men, with a more likely
conjecture then among the a^cientes was known, or imagined: who would by their
assertion prove (as it seems to me) that the longer the Seminall veins The

so, then prove they also that mon hath more pleasure in the use of venery then
the woman: whose Seminall veins having the like beginning and ends, yet but
half towards the length of those in man, for that her testicles are sited

under the right Seminall vein, to the fourth Vertebre of y^ loins, to be no
vein sent unto the superior parts but only to the inferior parts. For

end of the straight Muscles.

In some bodies they are joined only in one part or two with a very small
branch. But Collumbus saith that in some bodies of women, what diligence
soever he used, yet might he not possibly find the union of these veins. But
this he saith, that they come not from the nature, but from that division
whence the veins of the matrice do spring, which are not instituted to cherish
the substance of the womb, but to nourish the neck thereof.

also are through the purse of the testicles disseminated.

Out of the same place whence we have said all these veins do spring, goes
forth a vein most evident, which obliquely ascends to Ilium os, marching
vnner the skin toward the outward parts of the ribs, and above Abdomen is
shed out in diverse branches.

This notable arm which a little before we have mentioned after it passed over
the flank, it goes forth in three parts, whereof one descends obliquely
inward towards the knee between the skin and sleshy Membran, and above it on
the inside descending through the leg, travails above the inner ankle, and
upon the foot towards the toes, especially the great toe where it is diversely
bestowed. The vein called Saphena.
This is that vein of name called Saphena, out of which in disseases of the
matrice blood is wont to be losed, in the descense whereof very many branches
be here and there sent both to nourish the skin, as also to engender fat.

The other ij. thick bows or arms are carried covered of Muscles,
notwithstanding that obliquely they descend through the inner parts of the
thigh, and pass forth, between the ij. lower heads of the thigh, thus carried
under the knee: first distributyng many branches, which e^ult on the thigh
where it is bowed.

But from the greater brauch, which we have spoken of, rises a vein, which
under the skin first, then after through the hinder parts of the leg,
runs eve to the foot. Under the same bought of the knee an other vein
breaks out, which nourishes the Anteriour Muscles of the leg; and an other
also deeper: thus being carried downward, it cleaves to the Ligament sited
between Tibia Fibula, which it perforateth, creeping to the Anteriour parts of
the leg, and descending above the foot, is with the Ligament thereof
coherent.

A greater brauch goes so lowe, that it runs even under the sole of the
foot by the inner ankle; sprinklyng in the leg and sole of the foot diverse
branches, surcles, and twigs.

An other branch likewise very notable is divided also through the Muscles,
and sends a vein under the (...). First Muscles sited behind in the leg,

arms are reached, that is to say, each of them to ether of the reins, which
break not out one directly against an other, but always the one higher then the

the Emulgent veins. The like reason is of the Arteries, which being reached

the veins, are together with the carted ouerthwartly into the bosom or
hollow of the reins, which is formed in the inside of them, as lately was
declared.

Immediately, and so soon as the vein and artery have come unto the said
bosom of the kidney, they are first either of them divided into ij. branches,
before they make any entrance at all, one branch offering it self to the
upper corner of the same hollow, and the other to the neither. And in the same
progress of the vessels into the reins, the arteries very seldom scatter
from them selves any branches, but are wholly spent in the substance of the
reins. Yet from the Whence begi^neth the Seminall vein.

testicle, is sent. And sometime like the right vein, springs a branch
abroad in the fat Membraneous coat of the kidney, which Vesalius saith is to
be found, when the left reyne occupies the higher seat, and that is either
always or most commoly.

a vein or artery throughout the body of the kidney distributed. For, first
by little and little being dilated, it is separated after a certain sort into
ij. parts: of which we will call the one the anteriour and the other the
posteriour. The anteriour after one order and course produces now six, now
seven, and sometime also more bra^nches of equal thickness, in which this
anteriour part of the Membraneous body or first cauitie is finished. These
present branches after the anteriour part of the kidney, one equally

bleddar one vein, and one Artery, from the branches of Caua vena, and magna

ascendyng after the length of the body of the bleddar, are wasted into a sort
of small twistes and hearelike surcles.

it becomes so sharpe and biting, that unless the bleddar by sense could
judge the quality of Urine, in retainyng the same long it should be grievously
affected. Therefore amongst the other parts of the body the bleddar obtains
not the least Nerues, only for the sense of touching, reached from the
branches of the vj. pair, lent out to the roots of ribs, as also from the
lower payres produced from the spinall marey.

Beside these vessels and Nerues, out of the higher part and midst of the
bottom of the bleddar a way springs (that is to say, infantes whilst they
yet are in the mothers womb) called Urachos, which going forth at the navel

Urine from the reins, called Vreteres. Nether were they rashly devised of
nature. For when the reins (as most behooveful) must be placed near unto the
liver, but contrariwise the bleddar in a lower region: it was necessary that
certain passages were made whereby to convey the urine out of the reins into
the bleddar, those nature effourmed very like unto the body of reins. For they
consist of one simple coat, a little harder then the coat of the veins, and

These by the way are very little, anfractuous, or turned. For out of the
cauitie of the kidneys they are downward a little towards the inner parts
deduced, the better to come unto the bleddar. But lest they should hang, and
not firmly be inserted to the bleddar, or should make over crooked a way to
it, they Why the brinary vessels are not ^planted to the bottom of the

way for the Urine of the infant to the navel, as before is said: but that side
of the bleddar, which is nearer to the posteriour region of Peritonaeum, to the
which these vessels in all their progress securely grow.

But the region, where first on each side these pores take hold, is in ye
posteriour part of the bleddar a little before the neck, and penetratyng the

answerable to the office of the Membranous Processes growing to the way that
leads choler: that is to say, they give place unto the Uriue flowing out of

inhibite the return of the Urine. Which work so effectually they bring to
pass, as that by them no air at all may issue out, notwithstanding that the
bleddar be filled with wind, as Galen abundantly teaches Lib. 5. de vsu
partiu. And that the same oblique going in of the insertion of the pores
serves to the same use, the blowing up of the bleddar exquisitely shows.

The same experience we daily see in bellows, for by the hole which is on the

force of the wind being pressed to the hole, none at all may return. The

the hole of Peritonaum, they are led from the right side, after a certain

the right testicle, in this last descense, one with an other mutually mixyng as
aforesaid, and effourmyng one body like a pillar depressed before, and behind,
whose crest, the first meeting, and mixyng together of the vessels make. But
the foundation is that part, whereby they are committed to the upper part of the
Testicle.

About this body ten thousand branches confusedly are packed, nether all of
them directly proceeding downward, but some partly straight partly round

and it is impossible to follow one manner or order of their tracing.

not any more growing to it, nether reteinyng the same form. For all the way

NOw it rests to express the uses of these singular described parts. It is
evident to all men, that the substance of the Testicles, by a peculiar
facultic begotten to them selves, doth make seed of that matter, which the
veins, and Arteries bring, and carry throughout the Testicle, as do the
Ueynes, through the liver, the blood. But the best portion of the blood, and
spirit, the veins, and arteries of the Testicles do (...), with a long (...)

vessels, made of the same so thin a coat, dispersed through out the
substance of the Testicle. And like as is said of the substau^ of the liver,
so likewise the substance of the Testicle, by his ins^ted faculty, adds
unto the blood, and spirit, contained in his vessels, the perfect Nature of
s^de. And this force, in men, is the cause of strength and manhood, and in
women (if so we may say) of womanhode.

Furthermore the seed prepared of the Testicles, innu^ (though very ^ow the

the Testicle, writhen with so many turns, and w^dynges to the end, that
sooner, and in more copious sort, it might receive seed from the Testicles, as
also that the seed from it might likewise obtain some-elaboration. But the
applantation How the bringing vessel (...) to the testicle
of this vessel to the testicle, with most street, and small holes, is brought

inner coat of the Testicle is, in hardness, inferior to the vessel bringing
seed: therein, the same coat, by so much again surmounts the Testicles:
although not round about, but only in that place, where the seminary vessels
grow to it. For here it is softer then any where else, and pierced through with
small holes, as is said.

Neither doth this vessel grow to the Anteriour, but posteriour part of the
Testicle, that now, whilst it may reach, or contain the confected seed, for
the Testicle alone doth confect it, it might be reposed in a sa^er place, using

man, the yard was made of a certain substance, which may either be erected,
or enfeblish, made stiff, or bending.

It is therefore (I say) of very right spongious, rare, and porie, almost like
the substance of the Spleen, albeit Nature hath endowed it with thick Ligam^,

Of the History of Man, the vij. Book: of the making of the hart, and of the
Instruments ministering to his function: commonly called, The Vital or
Spiritual parts.
BEfore you all whosoever you are (most attentive Readers) I freely protest,
that hitherto my pen hath not wavered in the doubtful balance of
ambiguity, but passed the plain path of truth, guided by the footesteppes of
my forerunners: till now at length, being come to a place somewhat ascendyng
(as they that will attain to the scope of their desire, must not refuse the
hill with the dale) I find the steppes of some willingly yielding to so tedious
a journey: others, with senses unappalled, to have ploughed a path directly over
the moutaine: here I see one willingly walking a contrary way: and there an
other, praising their endeavours, but protesting him self only to have light
in the nearest way. So that here, no marvel, though I should stand amassed, and
as one plunged in the depth of contrary streams.

hence, being prepared by the elaboration of the lunges, is by the same vessel
carried into the left ventricle of the hart, where, meting with the blood lately

the mixture of air, is drawn, by the venial artery, into the left ventricle
of the hart, whereas, being almost made before, it is now perfected vital
spirit.

Albeit I am not ignorant, how lately, both these assertions are denied:
Leonardus Leonardus Botallus.
Botallus proving that blood is brought into the left Uentricle an other way,
that is, by a proper Ueyne that is found somewhat above the coronall Ueyne,
near adjoining to the right auricle, thence with direct tract marching to the
left: which contrariety notwithstanding (lest I should seem to confound the
History of the vital members:) I have thought good to describe the parts after
the best approved, and that in such wise, as there shall appear therein great
perspicuity, and likehode of truth. Yet not that I mean to reject Botallus,
although he hath neither distinctly set down the derivation of that Ueyne,
neither apertly the insertion thereof, but because the labour of him shall be
less, that endeavours, alone, to stop the running stream, accomptyng any
duty none (right courteous Reader) in describing the parts, to have forewarned
thee of this late invention.

To the which description that I may briefly come, I will omit further
circustauces: only to do away obscurity, I mean, that the whole be not
maimed, by wanting part, it behooves to begin at the pannicle covering the
ribs, thence to the other parts, contained within the capacity of the
breast.

THe coat therefore or Membran to all the ribs (beside the xij. on each side

the hollow Ueyne: but it is hollow, as Galen most excellently hath said,
because it gives place to the roundness of the hollow vein. But since that in

sworn them selves to the decrees of Galen, and Vesalius) confuted, and

the same Auth^ur hath (as it were) entreated us willingly to contemplate,

far otherwise supposed, affirming the inuolucre of the hart to be fat,
deluded peradventure with the intersepient Membrans, which, growing to this
inuolucre, are very fat, especially in man. But the exterior face of this
inuolucre, for ye Fibrous knittyngs, as Mebrans growing together, is rough. To
the anteriour part of the inuolucre of the hart, whereto those Membrans are not
knit, Mebranous Fibres, fulfilling, or supplyeng the room of these Membrans,
do grow. But to the whole posteriour part, the intersepient Membras are freely
growing.

very strongly, and in most ample space, to the sinewy circle of Septum

and Swine it is much distant from the midreif. Also, in man only, the
anteriour part of the point cleaves to Pleura, with Fibrous knittynges, in
that part (I mean on the left side) where the Cartilages of the vj. and vij.
ribs are bound unto the breast. But that knitting of the inuolucre is brought
to pass among the Membrans that divide the breast in the midst for no where
the inuolucre of the hart exceeds the midst of them, nether in any part
touches the lunges, but by their interuenture.

Moreover there are no arteries dispersed in this inuolucre, neither veins,

Notwithstanding the branches of the coronall Ueyne, running from the seat to
the point of the hart, with the fellowshyp of their Arteries, which swelling
with blood do cause a little inequality, but not much, because ye greatest
portio of their bodies, is impressed within the substance of the hart: so
likewise doth the fat, wherewith mans hart abounds, induce some inequality:
but the foundation of the hart for the going forth of the vessels, is every
where unequal. For to the right side thereof, the right auricle, together with
Vena caua, the arteriall vein, is committed. But it hath on the left side the
left auricle, and besides the venial artery, the beginning of the great
artery. Of which more at large hereafter.

do The (...) of the ha^t.
think. For only the seat of the hart, which, since it is the original of
the vessels, is supposed the most noble part, exactly obtains the midst of
the right and left side of the breast: both beholding the anteriour, posteriour
parts. For so far it is distant from the breast bone, as it is in space from
the bodies of the Vertebres. Of the longitude of the breast, which is
constituted of xij. ribs, it respects the body of the fifth Verteb^e. But in
the anteriour region of the breast, which is ended by the longitude of the breast
Bone, it obtains truly the midst, being so much removed from the Cannell
bone, as distant from that part of the breast bone, whereto the midreif is
inserted. And thus in his seat, this noble part is safely situated, being much
removed fro the injuries which outwardly might happen. From which part, the
rest of the body of the hart, by little and little, is so reached forth towards
the anteriour parts, and into the left side, as that the posteriour part of
his point, bends more to the breast, and forwards, then the centre or ^ddest
of the foudation: and the right part of the point being more to the left side,
the the midst of the same seat, exceeds the midst of the breast bone,
into the left side, and the centre or prick of the point respects the
Cartilages of the vj. or vij. ribs on the lest side, where they are bound
unto the breast bone. Furthermore it lies so apt for the embracing of the lobes
of the lung^s, as most readely the vessels might, from the one, to the other be
conveyed.

doubt, yea, by the premises, frame a sufficient argument to prove, that the

referreth the case to the more sapient Philosophers to discufse. And so it

The figure of this auricle is like a pointed steeple pillour or other
building, (...).
whose brodest part is the bottom, and thence the nearer to the top, the
narrower. For so it begins, but at a log fashioned foudation, goes forth
into a sharpe, albeit not very sharpe, nor long. The exterior face of the
auricle varies, according to the fulness, or emptines thereof. For when in the
constriction of the hart, it swells, being filled, then it is Gibbous, every
where equal, as with a wa^rie humour anointed. But being fallen, and emptied,
appears wrinkled, and set with folds. Sometimes also, though very seldom,
it chances, that the outside of the distended auricle appears unequal, but
that is through fatness then, that grows upon it. The inside or interior
Superfice of the ear, (...) a cauitie, is wholly answerable to the same side
of the Uentricles of the hart. For like as that, where the vessels are inserted
educed, is smooth, but (...) where else rough and full of caves: even so that
ear, where it grows to the insertion of the hollow Ueyne, is smooth, but in
all the other rowme beside, so full of Fibrous foldynges, as that it
surmounts the ventricle of the hart, in inequality.

The substance of the auricle is little, but that very hard and skinny flesh,
wherein Substaunc^.
it much differs from the hart, but in that it contains the three sorts of
Fibres, Fibres.
it is therein answerable to the flesh of the hart.

The setting to of the auricle is much after this sort. The left side of his
seat, Situation.
grows to the extreme part of the substance of the hart, where the anteriour
region of the Orifice of the hollow Ueyne consists in the right Uentricle of
the hart: or more truly, the auricle goes forth from that same extreme part.
But the right side of his seat, grows to the body of the hollow Ueyne, after
the longitude of his insertion into the hart, and in the anteriour part thereof,
being made, as it were, one body with the vein. The rest of the auricle is
free fro the knitting to of any part, being contained also within the inuolucre
of the hart, though with no Fibrous knitting committed thereto.

The left auricle of the hart, is in very many points like unto the right. For
The descriptio of the (...) ear of the hart.
it consists in the anteriour seat of the rising of the venial artery
according to the longitude thereof. And so from his seat also, ceases at his
point, as is said of the other. Which point being sharper then the point of the
right auricle, but is reached more toward the left side. Besides, the left in
more aged persons, gives place to half the largeness of the right auricle,
like as the Orifice of the venial artery, is much less then the Orifice of
the hollow Ueyne.

As touching the inside and outside, the auricles are every where one like an
other. Although the exterior Supersice of the left, is always more wrinkled and
unequal. In substance also they are agreeable, but the left is much harder,
and in constriction and distention is less obedient. And if it be compared to
the right auricle, it appears feeble and dried, and on the outside always,
abounding more with fat then the right.

In knitting they agree altogether. For as the right grows to the right side
of the hart Vena caua, nigh the insertion thereof: so in like sort the left in
the right side of his seat grows to the substance of the hart where the
venial artery goes forth: but on the left side to the same body of the
venial artery.

In use notwithstanding they differ, although very little. For when as the (...)
^se.
with great force, doth receive his blood into the right Uentricle from (...),
and, as it were in snatchyng wise, doth swallow it, the same Vena caua, not
consisting of any strong or arterious body, should greatly have been daungered,
I mean for breaking, in that strong attraction of the hart: save only that
therefore nature created the right auricle of the hart, which being obedient to
the moving of the hart, and full with blood, should pour forth the same blood
which it contains, into the right ventricle when the hart is dilated, and that
the same should be, after a sort, rolled into that ventricle to dispense with
the force of attraction, and to be to the hart, as a ready hand or storehouse.
Answerable to which use is the cuticular construction of the auricle which is
light, and to the suffering of injuries resistaunt. Hollow it is to contain
the matter, and construct with Fibres, as a thing subject to attraction,
retention, and expulsion.

Likewise the left auricle of the hart, growing to the venial artery, bears
altogether the like service unto it, and to the left ventricle of the hart, as
we have said the right ear to be in use to the right Uentricle. And so much
the less is the cauitie of the right ear, by how much the Orifice of the
venial artery, is narrower then the orifice of Uena caua. In moving also,
air is more ready to follow then blood, so that for this occasio also, the left
auricle is made less the the right.

THe hart of ma obtains within, two notable and large cavities, called of the
Ventriculi or Sinus, sited after the sides of the hart, one on the right, the
other on the left. Whereof the right exceeds the other in largeness, and both
of them in form vary much one from an other.

For the right descending more downwards to the point of the hart then the
Superfice which is Gibbous. But on the left side of it, it is Gibbous like the
outside of a half circle, by means of the hedge between the Uentricles, which
as a thing half round, bouncheth into the amplitude of the right Uentricle.
And this form the right Uentricle of the hart obserueth, from the seat down
to the point. No otherwise then as the figure of the hart is made also from his
seat narrower.

The left Uentricle also begins with a large seat, but by little and little
becomes Superfice, a round cauitie like a Pincapple. For the hedge that is
between the Uentricles of the hart, on the left side, wherewith it makes the
right of the left Uentricle, is hollow contrary to the other side, which
bouncheth into the right Uentricle, and hath equal thickenes and nature with
the substance of the hart, constitutyng the anteriour and posteriour parts of
the left Uentricle. But the whole substance of the hart, beside of the hedge
of the Uentricles, constitutyng the amplitude of the right Uentricle, is very
thin. But that which effourmeth and compasses about the left Uentricle,
surmounts much in thickness the substance of the right Uentricle, and is
every where a like thick, saving the seat only, where for the insertion of
the vessels, so much substance must needs wat, as the amplitude of the
Orifices do occupy space.

The Superfice or inside of both the Uentricles is very unequal, and beset as
it were with many causes, deeply impressed into the fleshy substance. Neither
do these consist only in the sides where the right ventricle respects the
left, but round about, throughout the whole Superfice of the ventricle: and
that not only in new dissected bodies, but perpetually apparaut as oft as you
lust to behold the hart: neither at any time not appearing in a dried hart
besides this inequality, which in the left ventricle is something greater:
both of them have inwardly certain fleshy explantations or Processes, which
are round and slender, and cease into Membranous Fibres, continual or joined
to the lower seat of the Membrans in their borders reposed. These Processes
are chiefly discerned fleshy at the point, or lower part of the Uentricles,
which make to the strength of the Fibres, which they conteyne.

That through the hedge situated between these two Uentricles, blood should
Col. Loc. cit.
pass, as it were by resudation, from the right into the left Uentricle,
almost all Anathomistes hitherto have affirmed. And that the same in passage
also should be made thinner for the more easy generation of vital spirits.
But very wide they wander, saith Collumbus. For the blood through the arteriall
Ueyne is carried to the lunges, whence, being attenuated, it is carried by the
venial artery into the left Uentricle of the hart together with air: which
no man before his time noted, or at least have left extant.

Moreover about the seat or foundation of the hart, four vessels are
apparent: ^essels of the ha^.
two to the right Uentricle, and two to the left: in the right, the hollow
Ueyne, and arteriall Ueyne: but in the left, the great artery Aorta, and the
venial artery.

Notwithstanding, esteem not (as many suppose) that the hollow vein doth

The arteriall vein neither springs from the hart, but from the liver. For

The artery named Aorta, which of all other arteries is the mother, springs
from the left Uentricle of the hart, and rises upward.

But before we prosecute the description of this artery, it seems meet to

The opinion of other Anathomistes is, that the use of these divisions of this
vessel into the lunges, is to cary unto the lunges the altered air, which are
as a fanwynde to the hart, to cool the same: they supposing also that then the
lunges do receive certain I know not what fumes fro the left ventricle. And
this inuetion doth marvelously delight them: because they imagine that in the
hart surely the like is accustomed to be done as in chimneyes: as though in the
hart were green sticks, which whilst they burn, do make a smoke or fume.
Thus much Collumbus writes according to the sentence of other Anathomistes.
But he him self judges clean an other way: as thus, that this venial
artery is made to cary from the lunges, blood mixed with air, into the left
Uentricle of the hart. Which thing (saith he) is as true, as that which is most
true: not only being apparent to every inspection of dissected bodies, but
manifest also in quick diffections of creatures, how full of blood this Ueyne
is always found: which could not be so, if it had been made only for air and
vapours.

It is to be noted that in the Orifices of the iiij. vessels, at the seat of
the hart, xi. Membras do stand, called Trisulcae or iij. edged that is to say
iii. to Vena caua, (...). to the arteriall vein, iij. to the artery Aorta,
ii. to the venial artery: which are not all in figure alike. For those which
are put to the hollow vein, venial artery, are diverse in form from the
Membrans of the great artery, and arteriall vein. For the Membrans of these,
are like iij. of those letters which the Latins call C: but the others are like
arrows. The use of these is marvelous: and by their means, we learn and
perceive many things, that appertain to the knowledge of the functions both
of the hart and lunges. Know therefore, that as they are in figure diverse, so
their utility not all a like. The wickettes therefore (for so they may not much
unaptly be termed) of the hollow vein and venial artery, are sited from
within forth, as serving to the emission of blood: but the wickettes of the
other ii. vessels, contrariwise, from without forth, or inward, that so they
might seem unto us to be made, for the containing of included blood. This also
note, that those little wickets, which from within forth are opened, abound here
and there with certain filmentes or threedes, dispersed through the
ventricles, made so to hold and strengthen them. By which filmentes
peradventure Aristotle was deluded, supposing them to be Nerues: so therefore he
assigned the hart to be the root of Nerues, and consequently of feeling and
moving. But to return to the four vessels: two of them are made to carry into
the hart, whilst yt hart is dilated: but the other ii. to bear forth in the
time of constriction.

When the hart therefore is dilated, it receives blood from the hollow ^eyne
into the right ventricle, as also from the venial artery, prepared blood and
spirit into the left ventricle. Therefore those Membrans lye down and yield to
going in. For whilst the hart is coarcted, these are shut: left any thing they
have received, should return or go back again the same ways: and at the
same instant the Membrans, of the great artery, and arteriall vein are
opened, and give way to the going forth of the ayerie blood, which throughout
the whole body is dispersed, and to the natural blood carried forth to the
lunges.

The matter therefore is always so, that when the hart is dilated, the Membrans
first mentioned, are opened and the rest shut. So that you shall find the
blood which is now gone into the right ventricle, not able any more to go back
again into the hollow vein. By which sense we gather that the hart by no
means is that member wherein blood is engendered, as Aristotle saith, when as
the blood is from Vena caua distributed,

This moreover know for a surety, that in the hart of man is no bone to be
found, although in Oxen, Horses, and such great creatures it may be showed, but
in man no such thing, except it chance, that in very aged persons the like be
invented: as in the History of bones I have protested my self once to have
found. Only a Cartilaginous substance at the root of the great artery,
towards the arteriall vein is scene, which a Bone in no wise may be called,
although Galen him self would have it so: whose sentence partly I have set
forth in the place before cited.

Suppose this assertio most approved in Anathomie, that all arteries proceed
from the hart, even as all ^eynes from the liver, all Nerues from the brain.

From the left Uentricle of the hart therefore, springs that artery named
Aorta, of all other arteries in the body the mother. In quantity it is
sufficient large, and in substance thick and white. The cause of the thickness
is first, least the blood with filled spirit should easily vanish and wast,
and secondly least it in moving should be broken. For the Artery moves
continually, yet not by it self but through spirits.

AFter that Aorta is gone forth from the hart, immediately it brings forth
Vesalius describes it: but further ascendyng, it is divided into ij. trunks
or stocks, one greater, the other lesser: the greater descedeth, the lesser
ascends, that trunk is made the greater which I say doth descend, for that
the great portion of the body was to be revived therewith.

The trunk ascending puts forth an artery from the left side, which is
called Axillaris arteria, which stretches forth obliquely towards the
armehole, and sends branches to the superior ribs, and going forth to the
arm chooses his journey after the inside, to mate himself with the inner
Basilica, but sending a branch upwards, commands others to all those
Muscles, which are about the shoulder, the scapple bone, and his cauitie, not
faylyng the anteriour parts of the breast, nor the Glandules under the
armehole.

But the trunk of Arteria axillaris descends straight through the inner
region of the shoulder, down to the bought of the cubit: and before it pass
this part, it gives out a little Artery to accompany the fourth Nerve of the
arm, which Artery is among the Muscles distributed, that serve to extend the
cubit: but so soon as it hath passed the bought of the cubit, it is divided
into two, sometime into three arteries, yet first it levies little arteries to
those Musc^es that are in the shoulder and cubit, and one branch goes near
to that Ligament that is set between Cubitus and Radius, and being gone forth
marches to the extern Muscles. The remnant follows the longitude of the
cubit: which after it hath flowed beyond under the inner transuerse Ligament
of the wrest, in the palm of the hand, it is diverse ways divided, and to the
extremities of the fingers divided: but an other branch tends towards
Radius after his conducting: and so soon as it is past the mid^est of the
cubit, it arises between two Muscles: and goes under the skin by the inner
part of Radius. This is that branch, whose moving Physicians are accustomed to
feel, when they lay hold of the wrest, to take counsel at the pulse.

By the way notwithstanding I wish thee this to note, that in some persons this
branch is diversely placed, so that to be the same, which hitherto we have
spoken of, thou may take occasion to doubt, in that it is sometime carried on
yt outside. So that what Physician soever, unexpert in Anathomie, shall in the
accustomed place (chiefly in a sick body) only seek for the pulse, and can
not find it, he will judge untruly death to be near that person, and so
prognosticate falsely.

Albeit no man may deny, but that very seldom it is otherwise situated, for in
deed for the most part, it doth occupy the inside. This moreover so soon as
it departs from the wrest, it proceeds through the outside, to the
extremities of the fingers. An other branch near to the Ligament is carried.

This trunk afterwards ascendyng, this Axillaris arteria being now dispersed,
it is cut into ij. arteries called Car^tidas, or Seporarias, which through the
laterall There are both Internae Extern^ (...).
parts of the neck, are straight carried to the seat of the scull, cleauyng
to Aspera arteria, fixed to the inner veins called Iugulares. But before they
enter into the Scull, they send ij. arteries to the face, being divided under
the neither jaw, they impart of the smaller sort, to the Muscles of the neck,
of the head, of Larinx, of Hyoides, and of the tongue. But the two branches
(which are the greater) carried to the tongue, are carried throughout his logitude
to the extremity thereof, which journey being achieved, they ascend under the
ear, and both before beside the same, are to the temporal Muscles elevated,
so then being to the forehead, to the skin of the head, and to the Muscles of
the face distributed.

The other arm or bow thereof, which to be carried backwardes we have affirmed,
is bestowed upon those i^. Muscles, which (according to Collumbus inu^tion) are
placed in the posteriour part of the head. So is it carried also to the skin,
and Muscles of the head. From the same place, and somewhat higher also two
arteries fetch their beginning, entering into the nether jaw, under the ear,
in at the hole there (if you behold diligently) sited, after the longitude of
the jaw: with which Arteries a Ueyne and Nerve are joined in society: but
then they are dispersed to all the roots of the nether teeth: a part
notwithstanding goes forth through the hole in the chin, and marches through
the lip. This Artery (...) 7.
Uesalius forgot, in so much that he hath made no mention at all thereof.

BUt before we fall to the description of those arteries which are contained in
the Scull, certain others are first to be described, of which a part also is
taken from the Scull.

It is to be noted therefore, that y^ right Arteria axillaris doth spring fro a
place The beginning of the left is higher then the ri^ht.
less exalted then the left. Moreover it marches not in oblique order as it
doth. But the beginning of it is fro the right artery Soporaria, in the regton
of the Canell bone it goes straight through the armehole under the Canell
Bone: to the right arm: where it is divided marches foreward like as doth the
left. But from the anteriour part, whence these Soporaria, Axillaris arteria do
spring, ij. arteries do grow tending downwards, seno their branches to the
superior spaces of the ribs, to the Vertebres, of which two arteries,
Vesalius was ignorant: Col. Ibid.
also other ij. small arteries do arise, which under Sternon are converted,
descend, associatyng those two veins, which tended to the paps, to the
borders of the straight Muscles. After their manner therefore are divided.

Almost in the same region, but backwardes, towards the bodies of the
Vertebres, you shall note ij. other arteries, which being carried through y^
trasuerse Processes of the Vertebres of the necks (for to that end nature left
them perforated) as also through those holes, out of which the sinews do
proceed, do command their brannches to the Spinall marey and Vertebres, to
those Muscles, that side ways do serve to bow the neck: albeit that in some
persons these ij. arteries are not from Soporariae, as in the most, but often
from the arteries Axillares, produced. These arteries, which thus we substitute
to animal contemplation, between the head and first Vertebre, do make ingress
into the posteriour part of the Scull: that is to wit, between the same
Vertebre and the Spinall marey: first ministering unto the cave or laberinthe of
the ear ij. arteries, which in their ingress do mingle together. But in such
order the right is united to the left, as that of both, one for the length of
half a finger, is made: Into ij. it is afterward divided: then again into
many others, and first they reach to Dura and Tenuis meuinx, and then to
Cerebellum. By these the beginning of the Spinall marey, Cerebellum, and part
likewise of the brain, are reuined and quickened: and if nature had not
begotten, these (saith Collumbus) the posteriour parts of the Scull had wanted
arteries.

These ij. arteries, which through the transuerse Processes of the Vertebres
do arise upward, between the first Vertebre, the bone of the hinder part of the
head, enter into the inner region of the Scull between the same Vertebre, the
spinall marey. But after they are entered into the cauitie of the Scull by the
length of half a finger, they are joined together, and of ij. made one only
artery.

Nevertheless they are again forthwith divided, and that into a right and a
left, from which, arteries are to the ij. Membrans of the brain, and to
Cerebellum suborned. And further, through the substance of these parts, in
the upper part, through the half space of the Scull, most large is the
distribution of these arteries. The rest of the Scull is reuined by the
ramification of the ij. arteries Carwtides, or Soporaria, as shortly shall be
said. Which before they penetrate into the Scull, impart of their power by
little Arteries into the laberinthe of the care. But so soon as this trunk of
the Artery is entered into the Scull, as is before said, it dispatches forth
branches to the Spinall marey, to the hard and thin Membran, to the brain,
and Cerebellum.

Of these ij. arteries the true distribution, no man hath known before
Collumbus, Col. (...). cit.
nether did Uesalius invent it, who, whilst he was practised in the
description of the Arteries ascendyng through the transuerse Processes of the
Vertebres, was contented to affirm, that they entering into the Scull, do tend
through that camtie of Dura matter, into which the Ueynes Iugulares do enter,
but this rather he supposed to see with his eyes. Wherefore (saith he) no
marvel, if so much he divided the description of ancient Anathomistes, as
touching Rete mirabile: since rather from these Arteries, of which he was
ignorant, then from the Artery Carwtides, the marvelous net is effourmed:
although neither P^te (...).
to Galen these two Arteries have been known: therefore he saith Ueynes are
carried through the posteriour parts of the head, and Arteries through the
Anteriour.

But these two Arteries which we have described, are under the Spinall marey
exalted upwards, and besides those manifold branches, which are sprinkled
throughout the thin Membran, they pass into the substance of the brain, in
that place, which is called Cwnarium, or Glandula Pinealis, in the This
glandule in the brain bears the shape of p^us.
extremity of the superior Uentricles, and there brings to pass a large
and notable plicature, or weaving: which (after Collumbus opinion) may
worthily, for the marvelous workemanshyp thereof, be called the marvelous
net, which is in the posteriour part fastened to Torcular. Into this
plicature so notable Torcular is the forth caui^e of Dura matter quabruplified
between Cerebrum and Cerebellum.
and worthy admiration, are immitted two Arteries named Caratides, as in their
place shall not be omitted. Therefore of four Arteries this marvelous net is
made, most notable to each studious Anathomist, both for the dignity and
newnes of the thing, which before Collumbus was never taught or noted.

The Arteries Carwtides, so soon as they are come to the seat of the Scull,
they seem to enter the hole, forth of which did pass the vj. pair of
sinews, and which doth take in charge the inner Ueynes Iugulares: albeit they
arise not up, nor here do bring forth two Arteries, as Uesalius affirms: who
also Col. Loc. ci^,
would have them to enter into the cavities of the hard Membran together with
the Ueynes Iugulares. But then thou wilt say peradventure, what do these
Arteries under the seat of the Scull? They are converted to the Anteriour
part, and pass through a hole, which lurks in the teporall bone near that,
through which the sixth coniugation of sinews descends, and they enter among
the inner Iugulares: but before they be received of the inner part of the
Scull, they deliver forth two Arteries, whose branches are diverse, to wit, to
the palate, to the inside of the nose, to the upper teeth: others enter into
the Scull by those holes there sited, and like a tree through the sides of the
hard Membran, together with those Ueynes therein conspicuous, are explicated,
and therefore is Sincip^t in that place excaued.

But after that these Arteries have esfused forth these brauches to the palate,
teeth as is said, they rise up into the Scull through that hole, which is sited
between Sphenoidos the temporal bone, in which place a part of the third pair
of sinews descends: although Vesalius for the same doth reprehend Galen. But
so sooue as they are passed the seat or sell of Sphenoides, they minister ij.
Arteries to the eyes a long by the optic sinews, to show life unto the eyes,
and not only life unto the eyes, but also to the Muscles of the eyes, and to
those by which the jaw is opened, I mean the upper jaw: wherefore you shall
find the divisions of these large and many.

That which remains of these Arteries Caralides, ascends above the
aforesaid sell coherent with the thin Membran, and after the callous body
toward the posteriour parts, and diverse ways is sprinkled through the thin
Membran, above, within, and to the sides. Also some of their branches are
deduced from the thin to the hard Membra, and others from the thin Membran
to the substance of the brain.

After so many distributions of the Soporiferous Arteries above the sell of the
The Arteryes called (...) (...)
Cuneall bone, they underlay the upper Uentricles of the brain, immediately
after they have perforated the thin Membran, the which Uentricles are The
cuneal bone is the bone Sphe^. (...) men^o^ed.
anfractuous or full of folds: and whereas at first they seemed but two, they
are severed into very small ones and those innumerable. There therefore you
shall behold a most pleasant net contexed and woven together of Arteries:
the which Arteries have their Ueynes to them joined in fellowshyp, and in
their ends lies the Pineall Glandule. These hath Galen described for the
netlyke Glandula P^ls called also (...)-(...),
folding, as though it might represent the Secundine.

Collumbus notwithstanding boldly affirms this (if it be any where at all) to
be the marvelous net: for no where (saith he) shall you find such folds,
through folds, and interweauynges of the least, and innumerable Arteries, else.
But Galen did describe the marvelous net whereof he makes mention, to be
above Sphenoides, where that Glandule, which receives every excrement
begotten in the brains, being to that office by Nature dedicated, is resident.
But whosoever shall seek the same where Galen hath described it, he shall be
frustrate of his purpose. For nothing else shall he find there, but certain
little Arteries, ministering life to these parts, and to the bone Sphenoides.
The same Arteries, which thus constitute the marvelous net, do send their
power through the substance of the brain: which thing of no other
Anathomist, save only of Collumbus, hath been written.

And this is the end of the description of the superior trunk of the great
Artery, without you make account of those Arteries to be described, which flow
forth to the right superior ribs. This by the way is worthy to be noted,
that not one Artery tends to the lunges, whereby they might receive vital
spirits from the hart. And this is a sentence most approved in Anathomie, that
(excepting the lunges only) all other parts of mans body are endowed with
beating Arteries. By which reason, Collumbus protests sufficient authority
to what severe disputer soever, shall go about to prove, that in the hart it
self are not begotten the vital spirits. But of this matter is other where
said.

The greater trunk of the great Artery called (as we have often said) Aorta,
tending downewardes, declines towards the left side, and is to the body of
the Vertebres adherent, which to the superior trunk is not incident. For
that, no otherwise then Vena caua, is distant from the Vertebres. This
inferior trunk therefore, whilst it descends, out of his hinder part
proffers Arteries to the spaces of the ribs: and these again charge others
to the Spinall marey, to the Vertebres, and to the Muscles, in the posteriour
part of the breast sited. But where it comes down to Septum transuersum,
bringing forth two a like Arteries, which are into the same distributed, it
passes under the same, and still cleauyng to the body of the Vertebres,
marches down to the last Vertebre save one of the loins. But so soon as it
hath passed the midreif, it produces an Artery to the liver, in place whence
^ena parta went forth, as we have said: being there distributed. An other
spredeth to the vessicle of choler, an other to the spleen, an other to the
Uentricle and Omentum: other little branches to the Glandulous body Pancreas,
and others also to the intestine Colon. Under this an other appears, whereof
are very many and large divisions, both through Mesenterium, and to the small
guts: being perpetual mates to many of the Meseraicall veins.

Moreover a little lower it begets two Arteries, and those very notable,
called the Emulgent Arteries, which enter into the kidneys. Under the Emulgent
Ueynes, a little more bending down, it produces the two seminall Arteries,
which have their begynnynges from the body of the great Artery, but not from
the left Emulgent (except in very few) as to Galen it seemed. These
descending, are folded together with the seminall Ueynes down to the
Testicles, both in man, and young maid, and in women to the body of the
matrice, yea to the inner part of the matrice: and from these the vmbellicall
Arteries of the infant, take their beginning.

Under these seminall Arteries, in the midst of the trunk emergeth an other
Artery, which is carried to the Mesenterium of the straight gut, and to part
of the intestine Colon, after the left side of Ileon. But the Arteries of the
straight gut, down to the extreme part of the fundament, together with the
Meseraicall Ueynes of Vena porta, do descend, wherefore there are made both
Ueynes Arteries called Haemorroidales: in the posteriour part out of the same
Artery under the midreif, Arteries make egress to the Vertebres, to the
Spinall marey, to the Muscles of the back, and to the Muscles of the belly.

But so soon as it is come to the last Vertebre of the loins but one, and in
some bodies to the last of all, it is first divided into two and those great
branches, which (...) the right and the left side, but surmounting the hollow
Ueyne in the region of Os sacrum. These two branches are subdeuided, and
descending more, are ramified to the sides of the bleddar, to the neck of the
matrice, and to the Muscles resident in the concauitie of Abdomen. Two others
likewise pass through the holes sited in Os pubis and Coxendix: from which
holes, so soon as these Arteries are gone forth of Abdomen, they are sent to
the two bodies of Penis, from the top to the lowest part, and them do they
pass in branches: they being those Arteries, by which erection of the yard
is made: which thing neither hath any man noted unto us but Collumbus. The
remnant of these Arteries, is dispersed through those Muscles, which are put
in the inside of the thigh, but they pass not the knee.

From those Arteries which the bleddar receives, others also are purchased,
which being brought to the inner part of Os sacrum, through whose holes they
tend, both to the same, and to the Spinall marey: but without, to the Muscles
serving the thigh. Like as also from the great division of the Artery, some
issue forth, which with vital blood, do nourish the Muscles of the thigh,
which are within the belly situated. But of those Arteries which after Os
sacrum and Coccix do descend, some together with certain Ueynes of Vena caua,
do flow to the Muscles called Sphincter: the which Arteries, may also be
called Hemorroides.

Moreover out of the great division of the great Artery, two other Arteries
spring, which are reflected upwards, and passing through Peritonaeum, do
ascend under the straight Muscles above the navel: and in many branches are
ended among the Muscles of Abdomen.

In this division two Arteries, called Vmbelicales, are set down, which are
the first Arteries that in the infant are begotten. For after that they make
appearance from the Navel: they marche through Peritonaeum, in what place it
is double, unto the sides of the bleddar, and do beget these Arteries, of
which somewhat before is said. But after the beginning of the Vmbelicall
Arteries, the hart it self is begotten: but to return again to the
Vmbelicall Arteries, for of any such parts I determine not further to speak.
These, after our bodies are brought to light, are dried up, and usurp the
office of two Ligamentes.

But furthermore the two arms of the great trunk, which are carried down
into the legs, pass under the fifth Muscle of the loins bowing the thigh,
and going forth towards Abdomen above Os Ilium, and Pubis, are joined in
fellowshyp with the inner veins of this place, which marche among the
Muscles. And like as those veins are divided: so in like sort we see these
Arteries to all the Muscles of the leg, foot, toes, and their extremities,
disparcled. Finally, they commend their force by branches, to the Glandules of
the flank, to the purse of the Testicles, and under the skin to the yard.

Now diligent Reader note, that not the Bones them selves are destitute of
Arteries, least so they should lack vital warmth also: without which, no part
in the body lives.

fort to the nobleness, of the brain. But this is not all, for under the Scull
are contained two couerynges or nearer enclosures, one distant from an other,
made also for the safety of the brain. Those Bones of the head (as in the
History of Bones is largely declared) are so worthily closed and seamed
together, that they can not be separated, nor the brain hurt without exceeding
violence. Whereof contrariwise The hart is more easily hurt then the brain.
to the hart appertains no such defece: forbetwene the spaces of the ribs,
an instrument moved with small force may intercept the office and function

But Vesalius Lib. 7. Cap. 4. avoiding that error, and (...) forth a more

brain as a means of nourishement to the substance thereof: for neither is it
so firm in any place, that Ueynes and Arteries, as in other parts of the
body, may be through the same in every place scatteryngly dispersed: nor yet so
small and slender in quantity, that Ueynes, and Acteries in the top only
braunchyng, are sufficient to nourish and warm the same throughout. Which
provident Nature foreseeyng, hath engraven these cornered implexures, that in
them the thin Membran, replenished with sundry vessels, might insinuate it
self, whereby to minister nourishment more fitly to the substance of the
brain.

And chiefly also for the occasion of this nourishment, was the brain in two
parts dissected, that is to say, that the thin Membran might fold it self
in the middle thereof, and there made in reflexures, should nourish the
substance of the brain: without which division of the brain, and deep
revolutions, that part of the brain, whereas the right side beholds the
left, should not be nourished. Hitherto Vesalius.

It seems certain that Aristotle was not a little deceived in matters

Fernelius reports, (...). Ibid.

fastest being a loft, and eyes there most ^ightly seat in the head, no man
judges rashness or improvidence, not only because nothing may be amiss, that
is wrought by the omnipotent creator, but also forasmuch as the same in the

it that brings the sense of tasting to the tongue: and the tongue therefore is
said amongst other gifts to have the discretion of tasting.

These vij. pair or coniugation of Nerues, are all that are remembered either of
the ancient, or later Anathomistes, as touching the sinews coniugated fro the

proper hole in the bone Sphenoides passes to the temporal Muscles, to the
Muscle lurkyng in the mouth, called therefore of Galen Latitans, and to the
third Muscle also of the nether jaw called Masseteres: the original of this
being distant fro the fifth pair of sinews sufficient enough.

BEsides all which we have hitherto yet said, in declaring the original and
distribution The descriptio of the (...) pair of ^newes of the brain.
of the vij. pair of sinews proceeding from the brain: and besides also the
viij. and last spoken of, you shall hear the opinion of Realdus: who by his
often search and diligence, doubts not to prove a ix. pair or coniugation of
nerues, which no man before his time ever write or invented. And this is (saith
he) a slender pair, beginning at those two folds, or two together Processes
of the brain called Nates, Penes, Testes. These being thin and small, walk
towards the face, and pass also to the second pair, and are scattered into
the third Muscle of the eye lids, fitly also braunchyng out to the fifth
Muscle of the eye.

In deed as he doubts lest some, or most will not admit his late invention
of these two last pair of Nerues, but, holding them selves more steadfast to
the fame of authorities, will rather account them as the roots of others: so
he professes not to contend therein, neither will we pretermit any time in
discussyng the matter. For me thinks it suffices us to know the braunchyng
of the Nerues, as also perfectly from whence they proceed: which may be well
enough, without so many sundry divisions, naming (except it please the gentle
Reader) neither vi^. nor nine pair: only be diligent to find out how Nature
hath made their distribution.

Galen, in his ix. book De vsu partium fully affirms that the harder sort of
(...) ut errou^.
sinews are only made and ordained for the cause of moving, but other wise
unapt for sense: again the soft sinews, in like sort, to ^inister sense to
the singular parts of the universal body, being not so able for moving as the
rest. Where fore the harder sort of nerues, have their original from their
Spinall marey, but the hardest of all from the lower parts thereof: the sort
then again are brought from the brain, but of those likewise, the nearer to
the Spinall marey, so much also more harder then the other. So that by this
reckenyng, Galen accomptcth this of the sinews, that the softest are the
perfect sensible, the more hard the further from perfection of sense, but the
hardest of all, to be not farthest of only, but (saith he) altogether unapt
for sense. For which Realdus Collumbus, no otherwise Collumbus Ibid.
All the Nerues (except ye op^icke) caty sense moving.
then reverently reproves him, assuring us, that there be no nerues in the
body (the visible only excepted) but carries with him both sense with moving,
and moving with sense. But now, since we have laboured sufficiently to
prosecute the order of the vij. pair of sinews, we will presently resort to
the nerues of the Spinall marey, called also Cerebrum elongatum.

in the history of Bones. And this is to be noted of the Spinall marey, that as
the brain, so this marey thence produced, is covered with the like two
Membrans, as Pia matter, and Dura Matter, or Crassa Meminx: which enwrappe the
same, and to the outmost end of this elongated body. Whereof the one next the
substance, and the other on the outer side of that again, to defend the same
from the ruinous actions of the Vertebres.

as is the cavities of other bones, for neither is this so fat or flowing,
neither is the other covered with the Membras of the brain, as is the Spinall
marey, neither is there with it any communion with the instruments of sense,
or Muscles. Again, the Spinall marey differs from the brain in two things.
For first, The differec^ between the brain and Spinall ma^y.
the brain hath Diastole, and Sistole like the hart, (as before we have said)
but so hath not the Spinall marey. Secondly this marey is carried through Bones
which are moved, but steadfast and stable are the Bones of the Scull, compassing
about the brain.

The beginning of the Spinall marey is double, or two fold, the one more, The

and the other less: the more part springs fro the brain, but the less fro
Cerebellum. And again, that that is brought from the brain, is only one
manner of way or form, but from Cerebellum, two fold, or divided into the
left, and right part. But the greater beginning of it proceeds in such sort

of the brain, as i^ seems to be the very ground thereof.

Wherefore to speak apertly, it springs from the fore part of the brain: fro

place it is endowed with no circumscription. And if then the beginning thereof
be in so high a place to be appointed, are we not forced to grant the third,

brain, but from the Spinall marey?

besides. But again at such time as it comes to the top of the breast, it is
thence to the top of Os sacrum, of equal thickness. Although some, not of the
nearest, supposed it in the mean space to waste by the getting of nerues, when
as in deed in Os sacrum only it becomes more slender.

In going forth of the Scull it is clothed with Pia, and Dura matter, therefore

it clotheth also those Nerues that stretch forth from it. But when it must
pass through the movable Bones, nature added thereto an other thin Membran,
least the same marey should any way be hurt by the hardness of the Bones. In
which Membrau Galen is thought to be deceived, for because he esteemed this
third tunicle to be a Ligament, wherewith the Vertebres should be conected and
Gal^n l^b. de Osstbus.
knit together. Which to be true, think how: since the turning joints
besides are not destitute of the proper Ligamentes, as in the History of
Ligamentes appears. For no man can surmise, or judge this thin tunicle to
be fit or apt in colligatyng and byndyng together these bones, whose motions
are so great.

matter descending through the Spinall marey, the greater hurt is felt in the
inf^riour part. The cause is very apparent: for that in this place it is
sinewy, but in the other medullous, or rather a portion of the brain
elongated, as we have said before. For else it may seem, that we use this word
medullous improperly: since that is only marey, which nourishes the Bones. To
which in nothing this is like: neither yet is the Spinall marey (though Galen

would have it so) softer, then that, wherewith the bones are nourished.

And had not the almighty creator thus produced it of two things, the one The

had come to pass. For either all the parts of the body under the head, and
besides the Nerues of the vi. pair and admitting no branches of the sinews
of the brain, should have been destitute of the arbitrarious moving, and
frustrated of sense, whereby now so exquisitely they have the knowledge of
every annoyance: or else of necessity to every part of the body a nerve from
the brain must have been derived. But if they had wanted induyng, then no more
had man answered the form of a living creature, but a picture rather of
stone, or clay: and on the other side, from the brain to reach both small
great nerues to every part, had been the part of a workman, little wayeng the
security of the nerues.

Therefore the Spinall marey was provided, that there hence Nerues might The use

spring to fulfil all other parts of the body with sense, and moving: which
are otherwise destitute, for any of the vj. pair of the brain, that visits
them. Then that this marey should be of affinity with the brain, which
provides so noble parts to the body, who can doubt, gain say, or inveigh to
the contrary, unless he bear armour against truth.

IT is described by Anathomistes diversely, as touching the parts of sinews
traduced from the Spinall marey: but because we will consume no time to
answer, and reply upon every self opinion, for seeming over correctiue, as
some are ready to object, we will fall to the only distribution of Nerues. That
is when they proceed, and how they are after sown abroad among the parts of
the body. Collumb. Ibid.


The first pair therefore of these Nerues is sent forth between the bone of the
Vertebre of the neck, so privily, and artificially, The first pair of nerues
from the spinall ^arcy.
as that the motions of the head are all together denied to injury them. And
to the end this might safely be brought to pass, nature hath engraven a proper
cauitie, as well in the bone of the hinder part of the head, as also in that
side of the first Vertebre, or turning joint of the neck, which ought to end
at a spine, or point. This coniugation of nerues thus departing, are
afterwards disparcted into diverse and sundry little branches, both by reason
that the pair it self is but small, as also more commodiously to be
distributed unto the notable company of small Muscles that serve to the head.
For they arose the first Vertebre, and were carried to the hinder part of the
head, and again, from thence reduced to the second Vertebre. But before it go
forth, is reflected above the Spinall marey: a thing notable to behold.

The second pair, or coniugation of sinews, because of the impossibility of
Vertebres, as appears, hath two (...): whereof the greater appearing
backwardes, is carried here and there by the sides of the Spine of the second
turning joint, whether once being come, it divides it self into very many
parts branches, which reflected presently upwards, stretch forth to the
skin of the head, to the ears, and to Muscles there abouts. The other
beginning less then this, comes forth by the forepartes, between the first
and second Vertebre, by the sides of the tooth thereof, (as appears by the
description of the second Vertebre, in the history of Bones) and is distributed
to the fifth Muscle of Larinx, which is common to Aesophagus.

The third pair of sinews engendered of the Spinall marey, creeps through
Vertebre; from their sides as you have heard by the rest. Then after hath a
former division, which is into four parts or brauches, but those not so
contented are into very many parts, some to the Muscles of the bead, to that
^ong quadragular Muscle brought from the fleshy Mebran, which obliquely draws
the lip downward, some to that log Muscle that pulls the shoulder blade
upward, others to the skin of the neck, ramified.

The fourth pair passes forth between the iij. and fourth Vertebre, through
Vertebres, I will repeat no more hereafter. This pair thus passing forth (as
I say,) is into diverse branches divided, whereof some ascend, some descend,
and others (...) them selves to the hinder part. Further more from this pair
are sent small sinews serving to the Muscles of the neck, as also to the
Muscle called Cucullaris. But among the fore parts or branches, some are
inserted to the Muscle, strewed under the stomach, one of the which, being a
small one, is united with a branch of the fifth pair, and the fifth with the
sixth: of the which three beginnyngs are constitute those Nerues, which march
forwards down to the Septum transuersum, descending by Mediastina, and above

divided thence into many Nerues, both anteriour and posteriour. The anteriour
branches, which is most of the others apparent, is united with a brauch of the
fourth pair, and in some, takes a little branch from the others that follow.
This nerve, thus made and costructed of three, descedeth to the sides of
Aesophagus by the fore parts of the turning joints of the neck, and so down
to the sinewy parts of Septum transuersum: In which part the end thereof is
determined. Collumbus saith that in some this rises from the fourth pair: but

seldom, for it is most often found to proceed from the fifth.

BUt note when first this comes to the hollow of the breast, least the
continual moving of the lunges should be a mean to hurt or break the same,
it is bound or stayed with certain Membrans; both above and beneath
Pericardium. This nerve with a vein is properly associated.

And no marvel (gentle Reader) that nature so willingly provided for the
safeconduict The (...) a noble muscle.
of this Nerve, since to the midreif it was destinated: a Muscle so rare and
noble, as in all mas body is none the like. That which remains of this fifth
pair or coniugation is diversely disparcled: for a branch thereof accompanied
with a Ueyne and Artery, is sent through the midst of the hole that is ^ited
in the shoulder blade, and there spent amongst the Muscles that from the same
scaple bone do spring.

An other branch descends through the sides of the neck, and is distributed
to the Muscles called (...) Cucullares. Other branches stretch to the
shoulder, others to the fouresquare Muscle that draws the lips obliquely
downewardes, as also to the iiij. Muscle of the bone Hyoides. Sondry others to

to the skin: two other post themselves to the extreme parts of the
forefinger, in the mean time neither laying wast the skin compass about
them. The fifth runs through the inside of the middle finger. And these are
the five parts: but in such as it is divided into vij. parts, note the vj.

the inside of the little finger. And thus much of the second pair of sinews

the joint between Olechranon, and the inner Tubercle of the shoulder, where it
brings forth diverse branches, which through the first Muscle, of which is
made a large Tendon, may easily be found scattered, as also to the second and
third Muscle of the wrest. Then it marches after the length of the cubit on
the inside, about the midst whereof, or little more it is divided into two
parts: the one greater, and the other lesser, the one again takes his race
more deep, the other more outward. That which runs inward, passes under ye
inner Ligamet of the wrest, there ramifieng to that first Muscle with a broad
Tendon, which Collumbus first observed, from thence to the vj. Muscle which
leads the little finger from the rest: not ceasing to yield y^ like kindness to

place) we have said to spring from the tendons of the first Muscle that bows

braunchings liberally to the skin all about, namely to the palm of the had,
which makes it become so sharply sensible, and exquisite in touching. But now
to come to the lesser bow or branch before divided. This, strayeng through
the exterior parts of the hand, is reflected above the wrest, there into
three proper rames specially divided. But in some preparing five casts them
through the upper of the back of the hand. So through the sides of the little
finger ring fingers, and through the half of the aforesaid middle finger, and
to their extremities committed in like order as is declared by the other on the
inside: Only in this differyng, that the inner are much greater, then the
outer Nerues, most nobly done of Nature, who was not ignorant that the outer
might with more facility be hurt then the inner.

The fourth coniugation of Nerues prepared for the hands, is greater then Of

all the Nerues thereto distributed, and takes in hand the like rising and
journey as doth the rest, but when it is come very near to the midst of the
shoulder, it is reflected to the exterior and superior parts thereof, whence
and in what place issue forth little Nerues to the Muscles that bow the cubit,
and further to the exterior Muscles, not neglecting the scope of the skin to
the ^ubite and shoulder appertaining. Among diverse other Muscles there abouts,
this fourth nerve lurks, wherefore braunchyng along by the Bones Radius and

is said of others before. But from those which we said to go foreward to the

they may to the Muscle that is place^ between the Thombe and forefinger. And
truly great is the distribution of this fourth nerve beside among the Muscles

yield sense unto the skin of the shoulder and cubit: other branches it
sends in like sort under the armepit: what remains associateth Bas^ca
Vena, and in the same journey disparcleth diversely surcles through the skin,
and at length ends at the extreme parts of the hand. Moreover fro this fifth
nerve certain are sent under y^ Cannell bone, to the viij. Muscle of the head,
so to the first, and fourth of the bone (...), to the first, and second of the
breast, and to the vij. of the shoulder; as also to those Muscles, that serve to
draw the neck sidewayes. And this is the place whence small nerues are con^ded
to the fleshy (...), and so to the skin of the neck. In this sort consider
of the distribution of nerues unto the hands, with as much perspicuity as
brevity described. But note that in all persons you shall not finds the small
surcles and twistes of nerues alike dispersed, yet the bodies, stocks, and
bows of them you shall see in sundry bodies smally disagr^yng. But this is not
to be marveled at, if you espy in some bodies a Nerve that runs through the
midst of a Muscle, and the same in an other to go through the sides of the
same. And for because in some that are wounded, some time feeling is lost, and
yet the manner of moving remains still, and in others contrarily, as the
moving lost, sense seizes not, in others so both are destroyed together: Some
Anathomistes (I say) in this case seeming astonished, and devising to find the
cause, have made differences in Nerues, that is to say, they will have it that
in every place where Nerues are distributed in the body, there should be both
Nerues sensitive, and moitie. But (...) in (...) persos (...) sense sometime
moving sometime both is lost.
this opinion Realdus Collumbus supposes none to be of, save such only as are
ignorant of the true distribution of nerues. And therefore that it is
sufficient to say, that those surcles of sinews that disperse abroad in the
skin, do bring sense, (since the skin moves not) and such as are addicted
to the Muscles, impart to them both feeling and moving. Wherefore when the
Nerues of the skin are wounded, or that noyfull matter segregated to those
parts doth corrode or destroy them, it is no rare matter if the skin in such
places be left destitute of feeling: as also moving is marred, when in place of
the Muscles where they are resident, solution of continuitie is made, with
breach of the concourse of the Nerues: And both are then maimed, when not
only in the Muscles, but also in y^ skin, the sinews be dispersed or
divided. Judge therefore in this wise the causes, when either sense or moving
perishes, as also when both be destroyed together. Or if I shall speak
plainly, a hurt that When by the hurting of a Nerve feeling or monyng may be

it should Retrahere, and Contrahere, cannot be any means conjoin, or knit
together again. But if the like happen in that part which is already entered
the Muscle, in that part shall neither continue amission of sense, nor moving.

If the fancy of any reasonable man, that labours with no less industry to
seek the truth, shall persuade him to add a sixth pair of Nerues to the
hands, as heretofore it seemed good to Vesalius, let him beware, least in his

distribution, some reach forth greater on the one side, the on then other, and
some to the fore parts whereas their mates to the hinderpartes are reflected.

Those that delight the fore parts, marche after the inferior parts of the
ribs, after the cauitie in the lower part long wise engraven: which in the
History of Bones and description of the ribs is more plainly set out, being
couersaunt each one in course, with a branch of the vein that is said to
have no mate, and of the great artery. All which three (I mean the nerve,
vein, and Artery,) passing by one way, even from the aforesaid Vertebres to
Os Sternon after the length of the ribs, and the Cartilages, under the
succingent Membran, or Pleura, like lines equally and proportionably
distaunced, do enter among the Muscles intercostales, amongst which, both the
outward and inward, they are ramified and spread.

Others are thought to bring sense to the sixth Muscle of the breast, being
placed in the inside of it, and do bind together the forepartes thereof. From
the foresaid, Nerues flow through the first Muscle of the shoulder, and through
the second of the shoulder blade. Furthermore other branches are carried to the
paps, and their nipples or teates, brought from these nerues which in order
follow: then more downward, from the nerues that are placed in the middle
region of the breast, surcles are derived, which are charged with the oblique
descendent Muscles of Abdomen, in which place, of these nerues a large
distribution is made. But from the last nerues of the breast are others
departed, in which the ^leshy part of the famous Muscle Diaphragma is delighted.
The re^aunt of the Anteriour sinews are commanded both to the skin of the
breast and belly, sending also nerues among the Muscles, laid under
Aesophagus: as also to the roots of the ribs. Note further that with these
nerues, the vj. coniugation of brain is interlaced and mingled.

The other division of the nerues of the breast is reflected towards the hinder
parts: and nerues from the aforesaid begotten, do carry sense to the first and
second Muscles of the head, and to them of the neck: so in like sort to the
fifth and ^irt Muscle which circumuerte or turn about the shoulder, some making
speed to the first and fourth of the shoulder blade: diverse direct them selves
to the third of the (...), and to the skin about the shoulder blade, many
visit the Muscles of the back, making no less way to the fourth of the
breast, and to the skin of the back being distributed.

But of this I would have every one that reads the History of nerues to
consider, that this Fibre like braunchyng of sinews among the skin parts,
The (...) Distribution of nerues (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...)
is in no wise to be accounted like in every person: for so they be not in
(...), neither is any Anathomiste able to decide perfectly in one special
description, the crafty creepyng courses of the small twistes, or cutaneous
surcles, to serve for all bodies: For as much as they can neither invent the
right order, nor certain number, but in some more, in other some fewer, now
also higher, and now more crooked. Thus severally ^ourneyng, and diverse is
their distribution.

THe painful Anathomist shall sinde, that in comparison of the sinews
appertaining Of the Nerues produced fro (...) Vertebres of the loins.
to the breast, these of the loins are much greater. And although among five
Vertebres of the loins, there is but four common holes, yet five sinews are
from them derived, that is, as we have said five, pair or coniugations: (...)
there are v. payres of (...) of (...) (...) and but (...) (...)
For because the first pair goes forth between the extreme Vertebre of the
breast, and the first of the loins, giving back from the last rib, and is
therefore rather nombred among the sinews of the loins, then of the breast. And
that the more willingly since it denies his service to the breast, to yield the
same to the lower belly.

Wherefore now to speak briesly of this first coniugation addicted to the
Vertebre Of the first pair of Nerues of the loins.
of the breast, first of the loins, which being of it self sufficient small,
marches forewards under Periton^um. After the egress or going out thero^, it
cleaves into two branches, whereof the one is greater, and the other lesser:
the greater of them is carried to the fore parts, first preparing nerues to the
beginning of Septum ^ransuersum, which we have said to arise from the bodies
of the Vertebres of the loins: Other sorts it seizes not to pro^er to the
ends of the fifth Muscle of the thigh, called by his proper name Lumbalis, and
many others to the Muscles of Abdomen. But the lesser nerve of this first
coniugation, reflected towards the hinder parts, ends among the Muscles of
the back.

The second coniugation goes forth between the first and second Vertebre of Of
the second pair of Nerues of the loins.
the loins, marching under Peritonaeum, and under the fifth Muscle of the
thigh, in which Muscle many branches also from this coniugation are spent.
But rising up at length, notwithstanding under Peritonaeum, dispatches a
branch from the top of Ilium, which leapyng out of Abdomen, proffers both
sense and moving to the first Muscles of the thigh, and to the sixth of the
leg. But an other branch it commands to the sixth of the thigh; and
first of the leg, and mountyng above the upper part of Os Ilium, to the
skin of the thigh. Besides all this, a very small sinew springs from this
same second pair, which being likewise very long, doth associate the
seminary vessels, The error of some.
and ends at last in the Testicle. Which Nerve, some being greatly deceived,
do call Cremasteres, for neither is this Nerve, nor the seminary vessels What

The third pair of Nerues from the loins going forth between the second The

and third Vertebre, is carried under Peritonaeum, and under the fifth Muscle of
the thigh. The first branch from this pair decided, runs under Os pubis,
near unto. Os Ilium: where it is into two divided, the one part through the
upper parts brought to the skin of the knee, the other follows the vein
Saphena. And what portion thereof remains, is committed to the Muscles, and
skin clothing the back.

The fourth of these coniugations appears between the third and fourth Of the
fourth pair of Nerues of the loins.
Vertebre, and being the greatest of all the nerues produced from the loins,
is carried under the fifth Muscle of the thigh and Os pubis, and fellowly
accompanies a Ueyne Artery into the flank: In which place it begets a
sort of small surcles, which to the skin and cutaneous parts of Penis and
Scrotum are right seruiseable, but no deeper do they run. Afterwards in this
region of the flank it is divided into seven branches, which are distributed
to all the Anteriour Muscles which show their service partly to the leg, and
partly to the thigh: Of which branches, some likewise descend unto the knee.

The rising of the fifth coniugation is in like sort between the fourth and
fifth O^ the fifth comu^ion of the (...).
turning joint, which like unto the rest is into two parts divided: whereof
the greater hath his passage under Peritonaeum, towards the fore parts,
through the hole between Os Coxendicis, Pubis, and Ilij, whence after nerues
are proffered to the ninth and tenth Muscles of the thigh, that turn it in
compassed sort: Others thence straight to the seventh eight Muscle of the same
thigh, to the Muscles of Penis, and to the bladder, and in women not only to
the bleddar, but also to the matrice: not withstanding the sinews that resort
thereto from the vj. coniugation of the brain. And thus much of the first part
of the fifth pair of the loins. But the second part is reflected after the
Muscles about the back, and to the skin, as is said by the iiij.
coniugation. And is this the brief description of those five pair of Nerues
that appertain to the loins, which in going Now these payres of nerues of
the loins are (...) and (...) together.
forth are connected and knit together, the first with the second, the second
with the third, the third with the fourth, the fourth with the fifth, in order
comparable to the implications of the sinews of the arm.

And although the whole pack of the principal Anathomistes have thus affirmed
(...) Collubus ^ib. 8 ^p. 7.
five pair of sinews to the loins, yet Realdus Collumbus confesses that The
Nerues of the loins are not (...) (...) (...).
not always five pair are found, but sometimes four: for that in some
persons (saith he) the fourth with the fifth hath such community, that of them
both but one pair can be described. Wherefore it avails not to marvel why
the grounded opinions of such famous men as have sustained great labour and
traueil in the pilgrimage of mans body, should in tract of time sound so
dissonant, since neither country, age, nor nature have consented, that in the
bodies of creatures should be no dissention. But now to come to the
coniugations produced from Os sacrum, which may be called, and that worthily,
the sinews Of the nerues of (...) (...), (...)
of the feet.

THese sinews therefore are found to issue forth between the last Vertebres
Their (...)
of the loins, and the fop of Os sacrum, and from the first, second, and
third hole of Os sacrum. They are four in number, which from their begynnyngs
once gone, are so conjoined and knit together, as worthily they may constitute
the greatest nerve in the body, which, being esteemed no less, runs in The
Nerve the gr^est o^ all in the body.
progress under Peritonaeum from the inner part of Abdomen, to the outer,
towards the haunches, and (...) Coxendix, and Coxix, above that fourth Muscle
that turns about the thigh. After where it iourneyeth near the greater
Process trochanter, it sends forth nerues then, to the three Muscles
springing from Coxendix, and that serve to bow the leg. Others also to the
black or lady coulored Muscle, growing after the same sort from the greater
trochanter: but here it cease not, since afterward it casts about through
the hinder parts of the thigh, between the fourth and fifth Muscle of the
leg, almost to the bought of the knee. In which place it is after divided
into two notable branches or bows, one somewhat greater then an other:
whereof as the greater is ^llently occupied among the hinder parts, so the
lesser with as great (...), sp^eth him towards the fore-part of the leg.

The greater again with sundry surcles from his body derived, visits the
^ought of the knee, and the first Muscles to the outside of the foot
appertaining. But from the lesser it is easy to discern one little one
derived, which searches the body of the Muscle under the home, and an other
that assails the third Muscle, whose beginning is at the exterior head of
the thigh.

But note by the way, that the greater body of this sinew after it hath passed
the bought of the knee, is presently into other parts diversely divided: whereof
one stretches forth under the two first Muscles of the foot, whose sleshy
parts, when it hath passed, and overgone, it creeps along under the skin,
hasting speedely after that sort to the h^der parts of the leg, not
neglecting the extreme parts of the foot. From the other branches, small
surcles arrive at the fourth, and greater Muscle of the leg, from thence to
the interior and posteriour parts of the leg, and keeps his course under
the inner ankle, so stretching under the sole of the foot, to augment his
circuit, strayeth out to the very skin, and to the first, second, and third
extreme Muscle of the foot, then afterwards to all other sorts of small
Muscles, that in the sole of the foot retain any serviceable offices.
Moreover, besides the sundry deuisions and distributios of this branch
rehearsed, it is after cut into ten portions of nerues, which by couples, that
is to say, two to every one, are commanded to attend upon the toes of the feet
and their extremities, as also to yield like bounty of their functions, to the
skin and cutancous parts of the toes.

But an other branch more deeply penetrates between the greater and lesser
Focile, cleauyng to the Ligament there intersited, which Ligament is said to
divide the anteriour from the posteriour Muscles, and ramifieth not obscurely
amongst the fifth, sixth, and seventh Muscles of the foot. An other lesser
trunk is entertained among the fore parts of the leg, sliding under the
Appendaunce of the lesser Focile, or Fibula, where it proffers nerues to the
Muscles, as well from the greater, as the lesser Focile exorted or sprung. The
trunk descends A Caveat for the applicatio of cauterie to the leg.
still downewardes, notwithstanding by the anteriour parts of Fibula. Wherefore
in this point we are admonished that in the application of a cauterie we
presume not so far as Fibula, but only to the shin or greater Focile,
neither pass the depth of the first Muscle, for further, shall perish the
nerve last recited, after which ensues most grievous accidents, and payne in
that place perpetually.

That portion of this nerve that remains, is carried under the Ligament, and
fore part of the foot, pearsing under the extreme ankle, and through the
extreme parts of the foot: out of which seat certain surcles are sent to
the xviij. Muscle of the foot. Then after what remains, is separated into x.
little nerues, all which are notably inserted, and surely settled to the
extremities of the toes. Yet this is not all: for from the same trunk, one
other small sinew is extended, least the extreme skin parts of the foot,
void of their company, should be frustrated of sensible property. After the
iij. holes in Os sacrum, follow the fourth, and in some the fifth.

But here before I intermeddle any further, you shall consider a reasonable
cause, why the number of these nerues of Os sacrum be not certain, since as it
seems each author writes as he found: which made some describe vj. others
five, others four c. the cause I say is to be alleged in this point, like as
in sundry other parts, the variety of nature, and unlike construction of the
^yes of creatures. Wherefore Collumbus willingly declares Lib. 8. cap. 8. that
he hath Os sacrum con^steth no^ always of like number of boness.
found in diverse bodies Os sacrum, to consist of four, of five, and of vj.
bones, albeit never of three (saith he) as Galen falsely affirms: howbeit I
have a sceleto to testify the same at this day: so that whatsoever was then,
it argues Collumbus The author hath a Scele^ wherein Os (...) both consist

was not of natures counsel what she would do hereafter.

This note therefore, where Os sacrum hath five bones, there are four holes,
and where six, there five between bone and bone. Then in these two last holes
are nourished and begone two other pair of sinews, wanting in those that lack
the v. and vj. bones. Which after they are egressed or gone forth, beget also,
by together knitting, one notable nerve, which is naturally reflected and
distributed amongst the Muscles of the haunches, and their skin: also
inwardly to the parts of Abdomen, as to the Muscles of the straight gut, and
of the bleddar. So in some women to the matrice, and neck of the matrice, with
like concourse of other surcles to Scrotum and Perineum. Likewise from the

sacrum, through the same holes are departed other nerues, small, and short, to
the Muscles of the back, haunches, and other posteriour parts of the skin.

GAlene rehearses besides all these a Nerve inconiugated, or having no fellow:
Of the (...) inconiugated.
but Uesalius denying that, saith that it may so happen that whereof Os sacrum
doth consist of five bones, there the end of the Spinall marey sliding out of
the bone may constitute a surcle on each side. Collumbus also not seeming
obstinately resistaunt in this matter, saith, if any such be, it is to be
imagined at the extreme part of the Spinall marey: notwithstanding that in all
his time, albeit very often, and for that only purpose he protests to have
sought, he never found wherefore to avouch the same. But saith he, amongst all
which hitherto I have dissected (almost innumerable) I have scene the extreme
part of the Spinall marey in very many surcles, both to the right, and left
side, distributed as also further dispersed through the fourth Muscle of the
thigh, and throughout the skin which is between the haunches, and even down
to the fundament.

So is manifestly argued unto us, how deuinely the incomprehensible creator
hath made the body of ma, not only simply to live, but aptly to live, with
all requisite parts parcels thereto. For as no part is destitute of natural
warmth, tell me what member wateth the vital and animal spirit: which as
the first by the liver and veins, the second by the hart arteries, so the third
by the brain sinews is transposed through all the parts. And if nerues be
