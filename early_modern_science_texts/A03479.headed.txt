A NEEDEFVLL, new, and necessary treatise of Chyrurgerie, briefly
comprehending the general and particular curation of Ulcers, drawn forth of
sundry worthy wryters, but especially of

Antonius Calmeteus Vergesatus, and Ioannes Tagaltius, by Iohn Banister Gent.
practiser in Physic and Chyrurgerie.

Hereunto is annexed certain experiments of mine own invention, truly
tried, and daily of me practised.

Imprinted at London by Thomas Marsh. Anno. 1575. Cum Priuilegio.

The Contents.
First a treatise of Chirurgerie, containing the general and particular
curation of Ulcers. Certain experiments of mine own invention, truly tried,
and daily practised. A general diet, necessary to be observed in the curatio
of Ulcers, taken out of Angerius Ferrerius. A certain compendious and
profitable description of the natural temperatures, and diverse operations of
simple medicines, diligently collected, and truly practised.
To the right worshipful master Thomas Stahope Esquire, and high sheriff of
Nottingham shyre, this present year of our Lord 1575. Iohn Banister prays
prosperous life, cotinual health and daily increase of worship.
IN those days (right worshipful) when the world was vnfourmed, orders
unprovided, and laws not established, but al sorts of men and ages, enjoyed
and embraced their own licentious liberty: Before Princes took power,
Magistrates authority, and Rulers government: At what time art was unknown,
miseries unsearched, and studies neglected, the people of all Nations lived in
beastly and brutish manner, following their own fancy as a God, and their will as
reason. But after it pleased God (of his inestimable providence) to illumine
the shadowed sight of the world, and of his divine pleasure, to inspire and
breathe into certain of his Creatures, the prudent knowledge of sapience
skill, then wisdom begat policy, policy diligence, and diligence a desire
to know, so that the working of the one, found out the nature of things,
and the experience of the other, invented arts for the use and practise of the
same, whereby Laws after were confourmed, Justice feared, and raw things
ripened, Rules regarded, Scieces searched, and mysteries vnfoulded. At this
time the world began to bud the blossoms of a delectable fruit, and sow the
seed of a happy harvest (if worldly delights may so lawefully be termed) for
every man now delighted to excel, all sorts embraced knowledge, and each
degree laboured to profit his country. Yea all men so allowed labours, and
contemned idleness, that immediately all the world flowed with liberal arts
and scientiall Artificers. As Philo Philo.

Astrology, some Cosmography, and such like, some one thing, and some an
other, so that in few years there seemed nothing left in nature unsearched or
unknown. Among which Physic (whom it pleased God to predestinate a succour
and aide to the universal world (though not at first or presently, yet in
space of time, among many other things, as a princely pearl) was created,

proof, so that in short space it was so sought, searched, and experienced in
every Nation, and so brightlye displayed her beams to each Region, that as
Princes could not cease to praise and study it, neither could the common
people leave of to worship it, but extolled the Artistes as Gods, and
embraced the fruits thereof as incomparable. From time to time (right
worshipful) as it hath increased, so hath it been esteemed unto this day in
great honour, worthy fame and princely dignity, and never valued of so little
price, nor prised for so sm^ treasure as in this our age and pre^t days,
wherein al Natios are geue^ ^re to esteem private gain, then p^aque commodity,
and more to regarde^ ^esser profit, then favour a further vtil^e. Such is the
property of this mutable world, and in such wise is it alte^d by the course of
ages, that where as (in time past) all expert persons (whosoever excelled in
any quality or property) was magnified to the skies, erecting their pictures
in Cities, Towns, and Temples, as Claudius Claudius.
was in Rome, Armodius Armodius
in Athes, and Hanniball Hannibal
in the Temple of Pallas, with an infinite number more, whom the people thought
not enough commended in words, but extolled their fames by Pictures and
Epigrames, and they which with lesser skill, wit, or cunning, did their
diligence, were laudably encouraged, Contrariwyse, now a days the best that
write, reap scant commendation, but have their works skornefully skanned,
and a silly fault found, with curious Momes derided, and the younger Students
(who no less desire their Countries commodity, then hate to walk in
darkness) are flouted for trifles as doultishe dreamers, and their works
dispis^d as error holders. My meaning here is of such, ^ have and do take
pain daily (for their natural Nations sake) in pening forth and openig unto
ot^ the secret mystery of Physic and Chyrurgeri^ ^euealing and publishing
forth to al people, tha^ Talet which God hath lent to them, thinking nothing
to worthy which may profit others, nor that any thing ought to pleasure one
privately, which might benefit many openly: following the old and oft recited
saying of Cicero: Cicero.
No solum nobis nati sumus. c. Why should we wallow thus in disdain? and why is
amity so furiously fettered? shall Heathens surmount us Christians? and shall
Tyrants surpass us in enbracing the learned? Hyppocrate^ Hyppocrates.

that (when he had finished his bloody broiling wars, and rested at his own
palace) he took pleasure in no company, nor esteemed any mans council like
to his Physician. A thousand more examples could I infer, wherein the very
Pagans seem to excel us Christians in lauding the learned, and encouraging
all willing favourers of learning and sciences. But affection (at this day) so
rules the roast, and disdain stirs such contempt (among the bleting babes
of Momus charm) that a slender fault, Trituest. Inuidia est serra animi,
or slight escape, they deride without ceasing, and a learned work doth even
saw their minds asunder. For this cause right worshipful) some perhaps
would demand of me, how I dare put pen to paper to entreat of any matter
or part of Physic, considering the scrupelous state of time present,
together with the barrennes of my wit, and want of learning, or lay in my
dish this saying of Terence. Terence.
Quid dici possit quod no dictum sit prius? Where I answer, tha^ neither the
curious cracks of the envious can stay me, nor yet the bragging boultes of
the vain glorious, are of force to hold me back, since I am moved hereto by
three notable causes. The first cause.
The first is, to pleasure my country and friends (amongst whom your worship
is chief,) and therefore some fruit of my power painful practise, are due
unto you, hoping also, (as other more learned do in the publishing of their
books) that these few lines (partly by the study of other good authors,
partly also by mine own experience collected) may under your worships protection
be defended against Sicophantes and faultfinders, of you, whose wit,
prudence, and authority (in this country to this respect) is of great force
among us. This little labour therefore it may please your worship to accept,
as the hearty present of a friend poor and faithful, to you offred this
present year, of your new Office, to be a monument to posterity of that good
will I bear towards you in words, and would declare the same in deeds (if
hability were correspondent to my will.) The second cause.
Another cause is, for that I protest my self to have set forward and
finished this my present enterprise, devoid altogether (as knows God) of
haughty mind or stout courage, but with so simple and zealous heart, that
neither ill will with all his mischievous darts, vainglory, with his pranked
pikes, nor envy, with his sudden shot, are once able to give me repulse or
touche. The third cause.
And the last cause is, the remembrance of Aristotle Aristole.
his saying, Bonu quo communius tanto prestantius, So that to pleasure and
profit, other men is best, and most to be desired, but seeing (as the
proverb monisheth,) Non datur cuique adire Corinthu, I shall think my pen
and time well employed, if I may profit some men.

One sort of people there are (and that is the learned) who are commonly given
to disdain the reading over of such simple collections, chiefly of this part
of Physic, fulfilling the common saying, Aquila nocapit muscas and such
peradventure will little regard, or less esteem it then the meaner sort (to
whom this book is chiefly left) who (I know) will not disdain or despise the
perusing of this treatise of Chirurgerie, as necessary as the other (more
exquisite) though some of late more precise then wise have fondly affirmed,
foolishly feigned, and frantickelye faced that the Chyrurgian has not to
deal in Physic, small courtesy is it to break faithful friendship or
atonement, but it is mad dotage, to part that which can not be separated.
Howe can Physic be praised, and Chirurgerie discommended? can any man despise
Chyrurgerie, and not defame Physic? no sure, he that speaks evil of the
one, slanders both, and he that robs the one, spoils the other. For
although they be at this time made two distinct Arts, and the Artistes
severally named, yet sure, the one can not work without some aide of the
other, nor the other practise without the help of both. For further assurance
whereof, learn of Hyppocrates, Gal. li. de tum. preter natura De mittedo sang.
De meth. medendi.
who practised both together, and in reading Galenes books, you shall clearly
see howe they embrace one an other with firm friendship and inseparable
^amitie. Without diet (I say) and purgation, Vlcus sordidum, or Cacoaethes
(with other like diseases) may not be healed. Herehence comes it diverse
times, that many men almost in every country, decay and perish in the Art
of Chyrurgerie, by the ignorant dealings of Chyrurgians, unskilful in
Physic. Hereby also it comes, that so many Runagates and Idle livers, make
such daily incursions, and oft entringes into those worthy and mysterious
sciences, who durst not route if they were at unity, but that can not be, so
long as this error is maintained, that the one ought not to participate with
the other, for so neither of them can be perfect. Seeing that thing is only
perfect, Cui no minima pars quidem deest. Great ruth and pity it is, that so
many idle Idiottes and Erroneous Asses, are permitted to practise this Art of
great difficulty, that requires so many helps and sudrie knowledge of
things, as the nature and names of diseases, Simples, Roots, Plants, parts
of mans body, and a thousand things more, whereof the greatest sort of them
are utterly ignorant, whereby they ruin the body with their blind and
desperate dealing, oft to the utter subuersio of li^e: for as the body hath
need of the government of the mind, so hath the mind need of the service
and ministry of the body, which is the Tabernacle of the Soul, and lodge of
the mind. ^. Pet.
A man shall have ill lodging or rest in a ruinous dropping house, and the
mind less quietness in a sickly body, which may be through the occasion of
local Plaster, or Poulder, or Cerote, unaptly applied. Therefore the Poet
wisely wished (in his prayer for a friend) Mentem sanam in corpore sano.
Juvenal.
And Galene proves that the discrasie of the one infects the other: for a
solitary sad mind makes a Melancholy body; and a Melancholy body
engenders Melancholy passions of the mind. This Art therefore well
manifests the needefulnes of diverse sciences and qualities, whose subject (
Et materia circa quam) is mans body worthelie compared to a City or common
wealth. For in a City there is but one governor (if it be well ruled) and
that in mans body is reason, the Prince is placed on high, ^or peril of
rebellion, as here reason inhabi^eth the brain, the prince hath his watchers
^nd guarde, so has the body memory as ^hief councellor with the other
senses for ^is guarde, retaining wrath in his heart and ^oncupiscense in the
Liver, like Pensioners, ^o repulse all injuries, and the mind riffe go^ng
between reason and these affections, which ^oresee, and let all commotions or
tumults, ^ls the inferior savage mebers, would soon ^cale the Tower and
dislodge reason their Prince. But as that common wealth, who hath ^ainefull and
circumspect governors, can ^aue no common uproar or seditious discen^ion, so
hath the body that is healthful, like ^iligent artificers, to maintain his
quiet ^ate, as the stomach to boyle the meat for ^ll the body, The body his
office.
the Liver to strain and forge ^od blood, the Milte to drain the Melan^lie,
the Bledar urine, and the Gall Choler, the Veins convey blood to all parts
and places, the Arteries have the transporting of the vital spirits, and the
sinews, the ani^al, whereof comes all seeling and mo^ng. Discords in a
City, happens through ^ill and unruly rages, and in the body through vile
and vicious humours, which vnordinatly flow and overrun their place^ and must
be corrected and chastened diversely. For even as your worship (and such like ^
Authority) punishes not all offences wit^ one kind of pain, that is to
say, every of fence is not repaid by death, so every discrasie and grief of
the body, merits not extreme dealing, nor the dangerous affects slight
respect, or slow administration. An^ as offenders oft times are rebuked, and
ye^ pardoned, in hope of amedemet, but again ta^ken in like crime, without
grace or repen^taunce, are shortly executed, least their graceles acts and
pernicious counselles should^ entice others to like lewdness of living. In lik^
manner doth the Art of Chirurgerie (th^ Artist being expert) procure and
purchas^ healthful members to the body, abating th^ malice of every humour,
so log as in due tim^ it is followed: but when such aboundaunc^ of rebellous
matter, hath so settled it self a^mong the common or exterior labour i^
parts, and so rooted in space of time, that n^ there nature nor medicine can
preuaile, th^ we chose rather to seperate it from the bod^ then to suffer it
further to corrupt, since th^ old proverb is that, To much pity m^reth a
city, and untimely pity differs little from plain cruelty. This I speak
of such Vlcered members, as may not be both cured and also preserved.
Notwithstanding, that I have known many in my time, that have most ruinously
lost their limbs by the desperate dealings of wilful wretches, whose
ignorauce hath spoiled that which might have been saved, whose blindness hath
marred that which the wise could have made, and whose wilful arrogacie hath
cut of, that which might safely have grown and continued: such as in meding
one grief, make commonly two more, and the best success they have, is chance
medley, the blind man so lays hold on the hare, but no wise man will
prefer hap before cunning, Fortune before Art, or chance before reason,
which is the infallible foundation of all scieces. To whose judgment (right
worshipful) I willingly commit these my labours, knowing that in reasons
school, neither envy reigns, parcialitie rules, nor arrogate faultfinders
have access, but in their steeds, art, equality, and godly reformation are
in greatest authority, fulfilling the law of Christ through charity, which
envies not, but furthers al me and hinders none. 1. Cor.13.
They therefore that are not able to swim, may here with me wade till they
have got the courage to enterprise further. And notwithstanding that Ulcers
be taken for a base part in Physic, yet (as Quintilian Quintilianus.
writes of Grammar) Plus reces^u praestat quam front promittit. Every Art is
necessary, and each part of Physic is needful: no age can be without them,
no country miss them, neither will any nation despise the goodly creature of
God (for so is Physic in the book of Ecclesiasticus Eccle. 39.
named.) The same God therefore (who instituted this Art for the health of
mankind, as also al other scieces for our succour) preserve guide, and govern
your worship (and all other that love and encourage the professors of good
arts and godly mysteries) the right way to eternal bliss and heavenly
happiness.

Your vvorships always to command, Iohn Banister.
The Author in the commendation of Physic and Chyrurgerie.
IF things which have ben much esteem^
in perfect plight remain:
And profitable practises,
may commendations gain.
If things which famous me have found,
do most of all excel:
And that which needful is deserve,
to win and wear the bell.
If virtue thou wilt truly scan,
can thou ought better have:
Then that which saves a perishing man,
even from the greedy grave.
If thou would seek what most of all,
doth passing things attain:
Then that regard which from the death,
so many doth detain.
And Physic sith it yields such,
as thou can aptly crave:
A sightly seat above the rest,
of force it needs must have.
For if thou wander searchingly,
from East unto the West:
Thou shalt perceive that every where,
for Physic there is rest.
More profitable nothing is,
(although the world abound:)
And nothing more that man can need,
in all the world so round.
For lands and livings though thou have,
abundant gold and fee:
With such like plenty very huge,
which seems good to thee.
Yet if with sickness thou be grieud,
and eke to pain subject:
What will avail thy plenty store,
can it thy health direct?
Lo Physic can the so much give,
if thou unto her lore
Attentive be, and crazed corps
before her do deplore.
Hyppolitus it did revive,
and eke his life restore:
And ( AEson) yonge it caused to seem,
as he had been before.
It Phaon fairst of others made,
and so he did endure:
And Philip, Alexander great,
it made from poison pure.
Who else no doubt had perished,
by drinking in a Lake:
Such horror great and anguishement,
this art did undertake.
Examples many do abound,
whereby a man may see:
If that no Physic could be found,
great were our misery.
Who could the force of herbs attain,
or sickness well discern?
Who could diseases with their names,
that be so many learn?
It would exceed all human wits,
no reason could it know:
It would appear unpossible,
to all that dwell on lowe.
Since then such wonders it doth work,
of force we must maintain:
And love the same exceedingly,
as chiefest health and gain.
What men (alas) abiected are,
by wan^ing of this art:
When as they may no salve obtain,
to cure their urging smart.
And but that it doth quickly help,
it daily doth appear:
That many should in grave be closed,
whom yet remains here.
What number should here never live,
nor see the light of Sun:
But that this art doth succour them,
er in the world they come.
It doth also not only bring,
the pained from the woe:
But even the healthful sort it makes,
their state not to forgo.
What health Chyrurgerie doth yield,
also in every land:
In long discourse or praise thereof,
it needles is to stand.
Since that her virtues passing rare,
in every town doth flow:
And warlike armies every where,
her benefits do know.
Howe could Machaon and his mate,
Whom Podalirius hight:
Have spared been in Troyan wars,
and Greecians gristy fight.
When thousands there they saude alive,
in Agamemnons band:
Of worthy Greekes which else had died,
and perished out of hand.
What Ulcered parts also it doth,
restore unto their kind:
I leave, the sooth let each man say,
and praise it as they find.

To the worshipful the Master, Wardens, and genenerall assistants of the
fraternity of Chyrurgians in London, Iohn Banister, (a member of the same)
wishes to them a^l, the true direction in the perfect way of knowledge to this
mysterious science, according to their profession.
BEfore the gracious goodness of God, had created medicine on the earth, before
(I say) he vnfoulded ye mystery thereof to worldly wights, and mortal
creatures, no ma knew what plants could prevail, not one could show the
nature of herbs, every man was ignorant of the properties of simples, many
mineralles were unknown, most gummes vnfound, an^ all seeds unsought. (To
conclude) all natures benefits (that now so oft preserve and keep mans
healthful state frihurt) lay hugely heaped in the boisterous bowels of confused
Chaos, distant from light, absent from knowledge, and far from doing good.
Which now (being brought to light by the same almighty his providence) not
only ministers health to the sick, ease to the painful, pleasure to the
sorrowful, health to the healthful, but ofttimes as we daily prove (eve by
fine force) encounters the merciless might of fell disseases, and prevents
the dreadful darts of death (whilst the skilful only have her in use. But as
envy that subtle Serpent hates all virtue, contemns all good things, and
spiteth the prosperous success of famous sciences: so hath she of late
procured and stirred vp^ such a sort of beastly abusers, or devilish
dissemblers, as (study only to deceive the world) invent willingly to
embase the worthy art, and seek shamefully to slaughter the godly students
thereof. As it is not unknown unto you (therefore needeles for me to tell) howe
Physic and Chyrurgerie have in time past been renowned throughout the world:
No more is it to you ignorant, how little it is in these days regarded, which
if we compare time present with that is past, we shall see and plainly
perceive it, rather despised (as needles) then regarded as necessary, such
slender judgment and fond affection reigns at this day, and so is the
world upside down turned: that what so before time hath ben best accounted of,
the same is now the basest, that which was principal, is (at this time) ye
poorest, and the chiefest become lest esteemed. In this case (therefore) as I
must needs blame the fickle state of the world and most of al accuse the
frail estate of mas nature (I mean the common sort of people, who are always
ready to turn with every blast of Eolus wavering wind without stedfastnes
or consideration of righteous^causes) So can I not altogether excuse the, unto
whom authority is given, to establish orders and reform malefactors with
the causes of offence, whose only slackness, and untimely clemency is the
greatest encouragement that offenders have. I speak not this as seeming to
cotroll your worships (knowing you will rightly conceive, it comes of a zealous
heart) but if the love of our country, eminent desolatio (which might hap by
want of this art) do not draw us all hereunto, yet (at the least, if we love
our selves) we are forste to cry out upon abuses, deplore double dealing, and
seek for spedie reformation. Very harde it were for such a rowte of Rogishe
livers, so boldly to practise, and to fill all places with the slanderous
shauinges of their deuelishe practises, were they not permitted of some (in
authority) winked at of such as should them punish. I do not a little
marvel also, howe and by what means or merit, so many get their
authorities or licenses to practise, when as in examination they (not only)
show them selves ignorant Asses, and in their works bussardly beyardes, but
also of them selves altogether disposed to incontinency, and daily
dissimulation, without either fear of God, or obedience to their Prince, I (my
self) know them at this day, the most beastly deceivers, and licentious
livers that ever professed any art, (having neither knowledge, modesty, nor
honesty, and yet practise their accustomed deceits, under the colour of
admittaunce fro our hal, being (in deed) far fitter for the cart the
Chyrurgerie. Smally shall it avail ye learned to take pains, less encourage
the willing to spend their time in opening things obscured, revealing
mysteries unknown, when every saucy Sicophant shall (not only by peevish
permissio) defame us with their desperate doings, suck our commodity with
^their chattering charms: but also wrest construe our labours at their
poopishe pleasures, accounting the best basest, the worst worthiest (like
spiting spiders, which turn good to bad, sweet to sower, and bonie to
poison. If therefore your worships would prevent these proud practisers,
pluck up these wicked weeds, which thus pollute the vineyard (as already you
have godly begone) I doubt not but more commendations will grow of the art in
short space then there was in the time that Apollo Apollo.

so stimulate prick forward the hearts of mindful studetes (such as God be
praised, are of late frutefully sprog up amongst us) so as they shall rightly
account their travails worthily taken, their labours well bestowed. At ye like
stay stand I at this present time, offering these my loitered labours, to the
skanning eyes of the stately world, abiding (as at a view) to see if courage
will be moved (by ye thankefulnes of such godly patros as you be) to resort to
me again, for recompense, which then (as I have here debated of the curation
of Ulcers, as the most necessary part of Chirurgerie at this day) I will
shortly (if God lend me life) enforce my pen to extend her travail to the
curatio of Tumors against nature. In ye mean time (craving your worships
assistauce in protecting these my first enterprises (so much as you may) fro
ye tepesteous tautes of such witless wisardes as always love to find faults
in the best, them selves not amending the simplest. I commend to you at all
time, present health, and lasting joy in the world to come.

At my house in Nottingham, the.vi. of June. 1575.
Iohn Banister against evil and counterfeit dealers in the art of Physic
and Chyrurgerie.
Even as it can not be,
by reasons rule denied:
That Physic skill deservedly,
by trusty truth is tried.
To be the thing where,
dame Fame is chiefly bound:
Above all earthly arts below
that are, or may be found.
The Artistes which profess
the same, likewyse are they:
Which worthiest are to wear (I guess)
the wreathed twist of bay.
Such men of honest life,
as godly gains frequent:
Without deceit, debate, or strife,
or forged fond intent.
But few of those there are,
(God knows) the greater ruth:
Among a sort whose dealings far,
distaunced are from truth.
For Roisters now do range,
and ruffle every where:
And men to much delight in change,
without regard or fear.
Each Jack that wants grace,
and ^dle life hath spent:
And that to jet from place to place,
hath fixed his intent.
Such nought have now to feign,
their fond and foolish trade:
But that they health can plant for pain,
and sickness fell invade.
Leave of you Jugglers vain,
let Physic live in rest:
Most worthily with them to reign,
that learn and love her best.
Fie fie you steine the art,
of worthy surgery:
More fitter far to fill the cart,
then use Anathomie.
Your falsely feigned grace,
is but for certain time:
You run range fro place to place,
and still augment your crime.
You promise help for pence,
where as you do but noye:
O secret foes depart from hence,
poor people you destroy.
Our Auncientes oft have scand,
and told that some dissease:
Cannot be curd, you take in hand,
the dead (to life) to raise.
Nothing may miss you sure,
if pence be in the ward:
O misers mad, confess some cure,
for healing to be hard.
Be warned once by fear,
and of your friend take heed:
The price of blood is passing dear,
as we in scripture reed.

Ars Chyrurgica alloquitur Lectorem.
YE learned dames that do delight,
in sciences divine:
Refuse not now to taste a while,
this sacred sap of mine.
Which I abundantly do yield,
to every man each where:
Like Tellus with her fertile fruits,
when Autumn doth appear.
Or Nilus when it overflows,
doth fat and feed the soil:
Which after that abundant fruits,
doth yield withouten toil.
Who can depaint the passing joy,
that bird and beast do taste:
In new return of Lady Ver,
when Hiems fits are past.
Even so do I to mortal wight,
more by a thousand part:
Send sweet relief in hard distress,
To appease the pinching smart.
The woeful wounds and sundry sores,
that mortal men oppress:
And do consume the crazed corps,
by me they have redress.
Let Cronos tell (that ancient dame)
which bear all things in mind:
Howe bount^full lo, I have been,
always to human kind.
And these our days can well declare,
howe many men I save:
Were not for me which had been shut,
long since within the grave.
My virtues they are known beyond,
the farthest part of Inde:
I help, I heal, in every coast,
I comfort all mankind.
Since that my fountain flows so far,
and serves each degree:
Howe can you say that any art,
is equal unto me.
Although there be a number now,
for pleasure counted chief:
Yet none to man I dare well say,
it brings such relief.
When Atroppos to line of life,
his mortal ^aunce would lay:
Then steppe I in with helping hand,
and can set him to staye.
Among the sundry skilful arts,
by hands that handled are:
Disdain me not though with the best,
my self I do compare.
My genitour is high Iehoue,
a parent without peer:
My mother hight Experience,
by tract of many a year.
As Hyblaes hill of pearlesse praise,
that sweetest honey brings:
So was I weighed in all their time,
with Emperors and with kings.
Howe famous was Phillirides,
that first found out my skill:
And taught me to Appollos Imp,
and he the world did fill.
With knowledge of my worthiness,
and what great fame he wan^
When that he called back from death,
Sir Virbius, twice a man.
As Phisons flood aye full I flow,
what need you any more:
I have all things that may do good.

Against the Treacherous trade of paltry Practisers.
HOwe can that common wealth endure,
where governance doth lack?
The happy state will soon decay,
and all things go to wrack.
How should the ships yt shreads ye seas,
in dark and trembling tide,
From perishing preserved be,
without a skilful guide?
And all things else under the Sun,
without good government:
Can not in steady stay long stand,
but fall to languishement.
Then how should man which subject is
to all infirmity:
Without the help of Physics art,
in sickness saved be?
Who can of fountains dried up,
sweet waters justly crave?
Who seeks of Codrus simple soul,
a Princely gift to have?
And can a man in griping grief,
have aid to ease his smart,
Of such as have no skill at all,
in noble Physics art?
A retchles rowt of doltishe dorres,
have overspread our soil:
Which do bereave the bees alas,
of that wherefore they toil.
Oh noble school of conning skill,
that bears the branch of Bay:
In haste come with your helping hand,
to drive these Drones away.
They trot about from place to place,
as Frogs hop in the rain:
And thus this noble art God wot,
they do nought else but stain.
But most of all I do lament,
to see them blind men's e^es:
In every coast where they do come,
and give them chalk for cheese.
Such success have those in the end,
which practise without skill:
Where one or two by hap they heal,
a hundredth more they kill.
This is their trade to promise help,
and health to every one:
But when they once have cropped their coin
away they will be gone.
This g^ar must needs al good me grieve
and grate them on the ga^l:
To see these caterpillars spoil,
the tree, the fruit and all.
Flee, flee (I say) this hurtful kind,
much worse then furies fell:
If they do escape vnpunisht here,
they will be hanged in hell.
When yt the Lord shall come t'inquire,
for blood shed in the land:
I fear the blood of some will be,
required at their hand.
Leave of this lewdness repent,
for former fences made:
And heceforth look to bend your selues^
to use some other trade.

George Baker Chyrurgian, in praise of the Author.
THe thing where any cunning lies,
to speak in praise were vain:
As that which can commend it self,
without an others pain.
And where no cunning is, to say,
that cunning doth abound:
For winning credit to the thing,
is but a silly ground.
Even so the credit of this book,
doth not consiste in speech:
Words therein be but spent in vain,
it hath a further reach.
The matter it entreats of,
is needful both and good:
And he that penned it for thy use,
no little pains it stood.
First read it well and after judge,
upon that you shall find:
That as it needs no foreign praise,
praise should not be behind.
The book both dares and doth it self,
adventure in your hands:
The author of it with his pains,
At your good courtesy stands.

To the gentle Reader, Iohn Banister sends salutation, in the name of the
highest.
AS no man without diligent travail, ca merit commendation, nor any man by his
idle living deserve to be praised: No more doth it behove such lasy livers,
as sup gains without sorrow, and enjoy pleasure without toil, to bark at
other men's labours, to deride the diligent, scorn the skilful, and disdaining
those who never think their bodies busied in helping others, esteem their
wits weakened to further many, nor account their mebers martyred (for any
pains) to profit their country, but would God such (as be lulled with the
sleepy songs of selfloue, and rocked in the lustles cradle of security)
would ether rise to light, and see their loathsome lives, or else wallow their
fill in sloughtfull delights, and suffer the diligent to escape their dreaming
parts, but since no writer ever had that hap, nor any author that fortune,
since (I say) that Grecian sweet Maecenas, and that eloquent Romaine orator,
could (in no wise) shun their saucy charms: Let my barbarous brain and
wilful pen, never hope of look to purchase praise of all men. If therefore
(gentle Reader) thy modest mind be any thing addicted to the commendation of
virtue, banishement of vice, augmenting of scientiall knowledge, or thy nature
inclined to love light, and hate darkness, or desire to know the secret shapes
of nature, then praise painful practisers, commend cunning artificers, and
welwillers to worthy professions, cease never to encourage, and that the
rather, because al writers do account them selves satisfied, if thou accept
their labours with a chereful countenance and grateful heart, rather
commending then dispraising, amending then despising, and encouraging rather
then contrariwyse by thy ingratitude to force them fly such virtuous
enterprises, as lead all men to the light of truth according to the saying of
Plato, Per argumenta multoru cernitur veritas, So might the world in short
space, not only decay and barbarism, but also become more brutish then were
the Athenians before Draco taught them, more senseless then the Argiues, before
the instructio of Phoroneus, and more Aweless then were the Lacedaemonians
before Licurgus laws. My pen, labour and diligence, therefore (loving
Reader) shall I account worthily employed, if (according to my expectation)
thou thankfully accept my travail. And as for such ambitious Idiottes, as
neither mean to do good them selves, nor wil^ingly would suffer others, let
the bark ^t their own banes, and sink in their ^wne sins (without heed of
me) since I know the wise will way my good will, and the honest my true
meaning. And when thou hast perused this pam^hlet comprehending the curation of
Ulcers, partly extract from worthy ^riters, and partly by mine own expe^ence
collected, with a general diet for Vlcered bodies, and natural properties of
simple medicines) if (by proof) thou therein find commodity, refer the
same (with humble thanks) to thy maker the giver of goodness and no more but
think well of him that herein did his diligence.

Fare well.
VVilliam Clowes Surgeon in praise of the Auctour.
SO far as Pen and skill will guide,
this simple verse I frame:
Which may be said I rove to wide,
and strive against the stream.
Yet friendship bides me still,
Master Banisters works to praise:
Which deserves therefore good will,
That thus doth spend his days.
Although that Zoylus would him spot,
Let him do what he may:
^o spit his spite and stay it not,
force ye not what such say.
For they I kn^w will scoff,
as is their wonted guise:
But such they are but chafe,
and known among the wise.
I read that one Thessalus a Tesaler of woll,
despised Hippocrates, whose knowledge excelled:
But Galen in colours, so painted that fool,
for his rude rashness wherein he dealed.
Such witless heads which seeks the overthrow,
of things unknown that passes much their rea^
Doth plainly there, their poverty but show,
whose skoole wants skill them better for to teach.
What humour leads my verse astray
I mean to praise the man:
Whose work right perfect is I say
if you it rightly skan.
Behold therefore and read this book,
peruse it to the end:
And mark what pains he undertook,
to show the authors mind.
He hath such sweet and sugared sap
within this book compiled:
As grievous dollars will abate,
and great wounds easlye healed.
My simple skill wants Tullies quill,
to writ of this my friend:
For barreine head my pen hath led,
wherefore I here will end.
Iohn Griffin Chyrurgian, in commendation of this Book.
Sith healthful body helps much,
to make a healthful mind:
In lusty plight to pass the days,
by God to man assigned.
Great reason wills thankfully,
to celebrate the praise:
Of skilful wights: whose painful stile
for mans avail and ease.
All times and tides refuses not,
such fruitful seed to sow:
As may be to the benefit,
of him and many more.
Among the rest Iohn Banister,
of right may challenge place:
Whose travail hath at length brought forth,
this work: with open face.
Of young and old to be perusde,
and learned: if cause be such,
That loths^me Ulcers should their limbs,
infest and trouble much.
Not only this, but sundry sorts:
of other practise here
Is well set down: and may do good,
to all both far and necre.
Accept his pains, afeerd good will,
like well his Book and him:
And suffer not discourteous speech,
thy sense amiss to dim.
So thinks he his pains to be
requited: so likewise
Shall he receive encouragement,
and greater works devise.
ULCERS IN general.
The definition of an Ulcer, and the difference between an Ulcer and a
wound.
AS my chiefest intention is in this part, to entreat of Ulcers, so do I
purpose first to define what an Ulcer is, Vlc{us} quid sit.
which after the mind of Auicen, is a solution of continuitie in the flesh,
containing corruption and pu^refaction. For by the name of an Ulcer, we
understand that separation of union, which is not simple as a wound, but is
^lwaye found annexed with other dispo^itions and accidents, hindering the cure
^hereof. Quid per nome vlc. intelligatur.
Whereupon it comes, that in Ulcer is to be understanded as a com^ound
affection, or unnatural motion: Notwithstanding, no man is so ignoran^
(bearing ye name of a Surgeon) but he knows, that in wounds also is
contained certain dispositions necessarily chaucing: as bigness, litlenes,
streitnes, crookednes, equality, inequality, depth and height, c. Which make
the differences in wounds. Discrimen inter vlcus vulnus.
To conclude therefore, that is to be called as Ulcer, where as there is
corruption. And that a wound, where (as yet) there is no putrefaction. Of the
like opinion also is Corn, Celsus, Cor. Celsus.
and in manner also Hippocrates, Hippoc.
affirming ye to be a wound which is yet new and bloody, an Ulcer, when it is
become old or inveterate. And thus far as touching the definition of an
Ulcer, and the difference between the Ulcer and the wound: the differences
general with the acccidentes, after follows.

The differences of Ulcers and whereof they be taken.
THe differences of Ulcers are diversely taken, but especially of three causes,
viz. from the causes provoking them, fro the members, and from the accidents
or dispositions joined with the. Other take them only of two, as from the
causes and accidents, and also from the natural dispositions them selves, to
which they are enwrapped, and pass over those differences, which are taken
of the members or labouringe parts, because they belong not to an universal
treatise. These therefore be the diverse sorts of Ulcers, true differences
taken of the causes, that is to wit, a virulent Ulcer, a corroding Ulcer, a
filthy rotten or putrified Ulcer, a hollow deep Ulcer, and Ulcer full of holes
and a cankered Ulcer. And the differences which do come of the accidetes natural
dispositions, to which the wounds them selves be joined, are also diverse.
Which of the Chirurgias of later time are thus described. viz. an Ulcer with
inteperatnes, which ye Grecians call Discratu, a dolorous Ulcer, an Ulcer with
a swelling or tumor against nature (commonly called impostumation) a broken
Ulcer, an Ulcer ouergrowen with superfluous flesh, which ye Grecians
call(...), a hard Ulcer, a cankered Ulcer, a hollow ulcer, ^n Ulcer corrupt at
the bone, an Ulcer with diverse separatios, an Ulcer called Cacoethes, which is
a wicked, cruel, very hard Ulcer to be healed, and others of that sort. But
these many and diverse differences of Ulcers, are not supposed of Galene to be
true differences of Ulcers, but only agreeings of other effects with the
Ulcer, of which sort are, the cankered Ulcer, the ouergrowen, putrefied and
hollow Ulcers. And the Ulcer with some swelling, as the Ulcer called
Phlegmonodes, and Resipelatodes, or the cankered rottennes, the inflammation of
blood, the canker, and residue of that sort, are of the kind of effects
besides nature, corrupting the actions which severally and by them selves may
existe and be. For that thing (saith Galen) which can consiste severally,
shall never be the difference of an other.

Let this therefore be as a precept and rule, by which thou maiste discern
whether the difference of an effect be any otherthing, or the enwrapping of an
other natural motion, but after an other sort. Also the vexing and dolorous
Ulcer, and the filthy ulcer, are called (as it were certain differeces of
ulcers when as in deed they are not true proper differeces, but the joining
rather of an accident with an ulcer. c. In like sort the Ulcer called Vlcus
cacochymon, is an Ulcer replenished with evil juice, or troubled with a
rheumatic matter there caused, being joined with theffect. Many such therefore
are usurped of common Surgeons Physicians, for the differeces of Ulcers
which are in deed no differences, but only (as Galene saith) binding together
other dispositions, or the effects of that which is compounded. The proper and
true differences of a simple Ulcer are taken of the nature thereof. And that
(saith Galen) is a simple Ulcer, which doth only exist, that is, where no
other affect or accident is joined. Vndepropriae vlc. differ. sumendae.
It shall not therefore be a simple Ulcer if any other part be exulcerated, or
be ^exed with a rheumatic matter, or evil ^uyce, or altogether without
natural tem^erature, full of hollowness. c.

Therefore the differences taken of the ^ature of the ulcers are most proper,
Different. vlcerum sunt magis propriae.
^f the substance of the thing, and coming ^utwarde. They are taken of the
substance of the thing which are brought from the form bigness or quatitie of
ye diuisio, from ye measure of space. Forma vlcerum.
Fro the form, as the straight Ulcer, the Ulcer declined or bowed, the round
or compassed ulcer, the wrythen and the crooked ulcer: from the bigness of the
division or quantity, as a great ulcer, a little ulcer of the measures or
spaces, as a long ulcer, a short ulcer, a broad ulcer, a narrow ulcer, a
high ulcer, or an ulcer in the top or height of any part, a deep ulcer, an
equal ulcer, an unequal ulcer.

And the differeces of the ulcers coming extrinsecall, Diffe. vlc. extrinsec.
are taken of the time, of the way of generation, as all the ulcer or scarce
part thereof cannot be seen or beholden, the differences of the time, as a new
ulcer, or old ulcer. Of the reason of the generation, as a cut ulcer, a broke
ulcer, an ulcer partly cut, partly broken. O^ the placing in thaffected part,
as an ulcer evidently appearing or out of sight, an ulcer hidden within or not
appearing. Also an ulcer in the beginning of the muscle, in the midst, or in
the end of the muscle. The differences of ulcers taken of the affected place,
though they are to be judged. ulcers, yet not (as Gal. saith) of their own
propre nature, as the aforesaid differences are taken: for the places wherein
the ulcers do consiste are similar, and organicall, therefore to show the
differences of places wherein the ulcer is, the division must be after this
sort, from thaffected place. An ulcer in the similar organick or instrumental
part, dividing also the differences of ulcers in the similar part after this
sort. viz. Ulcers in the veins, ulcers in the arteries, ulcers in ye skin,
and ulcers in the muscles, for the muscle and the similar part, is easy to be
discerned by sense. And the differences of the affects in the organicke part,
are of this sort. The ulcer of the ear, the ulcer in the Jaws, the ulcer in
the sharpe or rough artery, ulcer of the lunges, ulcer of the breast, ulcer of
the yard, ulcer of the fundament and seat, and so forth in like order
discoursing the singular parts of the body, which we call instrumental. And
this is the complete and absolute division of a simple and only ulcer, and of
an ulcer to whom no other affect is joined in his differences taken of his
propre nature. Also if any affect or disposition do consiste by it self, as
Phlegmon, Gangr^na, or putrefaction, there cannot the differences of ulcers be
taken thereby, or at least be so called properly. But for because it is spoke
of Galen at least in 600. places, let us not hold any cotention upon the
names. Non esse de nominibus contedendum.
For if any man should cal the putrefied ulcer, ye corrosive ulcer, Gagrena,
Erisipelas, the cancrous ulcer, the holed or cornered ulcer, the ulcer with
putrefaction at the bone, the ulcer called Cacoethes, the painful ulcer, and
all others of that sort: If any man (I say) should prescribe these as
differeces of ulcers, we ought not to contend with him, so that he minister
right curation to every of the. And they are called differences of ulcers taken
of that where they are joined, that is to say, the differences of the things
contained with the disease: the differences of the things contained with the
accidents: and the differeces of the things contained with the causes and
others (if any be) of like sort.

Of the causes of Ulcers.
THe latter sect of Surgeons have instituted two general causes throughout
all ulcers, Causae vlceris.
that is to say, the Antecedent causes named of the Greeks(...), And the
conjunctive causes also called (...). The antecedent causes are these, viz.
cutting, breaking, tearing, and such like solution of continuitie, which
cannot even by by stir up Sanies, Pus, or Sordicies, which are judged
necessarily to associate the ulcers, although it may be done in time, that in
removing the antecedent and corporal causes. Therefore the antecedent causes
of ulcers is Cacochima, which is evil juice, and that is, when the humours
have only default in quality and not in quantity: and also to much
abundance of those perverse humours being in the body, may at length corrupt
and putrefy the said parts of the same body. Furthermore, the wickedness of
the said juice, is either engendered by a perverse kind of diet, or through
the whole body, or else some particular member: as through default, which may be
either in the liver or spleen, as Galene in diverse places hath sufficiently
testified.

The conjunctive causes is said to be that intemperature, Causae coiunct.
which is called the malice of complexion in the wounded parts through the
antecedet causes, or through the wounds and hurts them selves, or other
tumors against nature, but especially through malignant ulcers, either broken,
opened or stirred. For eve the corroding ulcer is engendered Ex herpete miliari,
called of the Greeks Cenchrias, also of Esthiomeno, which is an eating ulcer
proceeding of choler more gross thick, so may it also happen of the
carbuncle, chiefly if it be venomous, which makes an escharous ulcer, full of
banks, filthy, and full of deep hollowes. Tres modi aegre sana biliu^ vlc.
Wherefore these three are accounted ulcers rebellious hard to be cured. First
because of intemperature, which comes to the subject flesh. Secondly through
default of the blood thereto resorting. And thirdly through copy and
quantity of the matter flowing, Gal. lib. 4. meth. medendi.
as Galene credibly hath us informed. He also affirms that the same division
may be made otherwise, that is of curable, and also rebellious ulcers, the one
for intemperature of the ulcerated flesh, and the other in respect of the
humour flowing, and the same intemperature also may be divided two manner of
ways, viz. when the flesh is subject to the only quality of nature above
measure, or otherwise when there is present some access or certain tumor. Now
also that flowing may be divided into two parts, that is as well in the
quality as also in the quatitie of the humour flowing.

There shall be therefore four kinds of ulcers, Quatuo^ gen. vlc. aegre sana
bilium.
contumelious or hard to be cured: that is to wit, the only intemperature of
the subject flesh, which we call Discrasia, inteperature with an accessiue
tumor, the humour flowing, or vicious, or much, for the humour which flows
abundantly into the grievous part of the ulcer, yea although it be not vicious,
yet (for because it engenders therein excrementes) it hinders the healing
with long detraction of time. Galen seems also to make and add hereto a fifth
kind in his Cometarie upon the Aphorism of Hippocrates, Hippocra.
which begins thus. Vlc. quaecun{que} annua sunt. c. which is the passion
of the corrupted bone in the vlcered place. For when the flesh which covers
the bone having applied (according to art) exiccatiue medicines) receives
cicatrice: by and by it seems perfectly restored and amended, but shortly
after some matter thither resorting from the corrupt bone, reduces in the
healed part a present inflammation, so that after, there follows not only
generation of matter, but also erosion of the aforesaid cicatrice exulceration
of flesh. Gal. lib. 4. Therapet. meth.
And as we may plainly gather by Galen, among the aforesaid affects and
dispositions, al others to be united and knit, and that many and diverse
differences of ulcers do spring of those above mentioned. Furthermore, there
must be a methode of healing showed and declared, not of al together, but every
one by him self, which shall follow after, beginning only with the cure of
simple things, that thereby the way and mean to heal the compound affects
may the more easily be attained.

Now, seeing that as we entreat thoroughly of ulcers, these words Sanies, Pus,
virus, Ichor, Sordes, and such like, are much in use, I think it not much forth
of ye way, if in this place we show what those words do signify among the
Chyrurgians, and that in few words, how they agree and disagre. Sanies.
Sanies quid.
i. ichor, is properly yt thin humour, which the Greeks cal(...), such as is in
a wound, neither new nor old, but between both, and some kind of this Ichor
is interpreted Sanies sanguinis, the matter of blood. And of Sanies Sanei spec.
duae celso.
saith Celsus, be two kinds, the one named(...), and the other(...), being
thin and half white, proceading of an evil ulcer, and chiefly where as a sine
we being hurt, inflammation is gathered. Meliceria is more gross, glewie, and
like to white honey, proceeding also of evil ulcers, where the sinews about the
joints be hurt, in which places it greatly flows.

But now amongst the new and later Physitios and Chyrurgias, who not
observing the true propriety of voice, or agreeing upon the nature of the
thing, do wrongfullye usurp the name of Pus, in steed of Sanies, Sanies vul
go pro pure male vsurpatur.
sometime they make Sanies a kind of Sordes, Virus, Virulentu, and Purulentam
colluuiem, called of the Greeks(...), and of the Latines Pus. For the name of
Sanies being truly defined, signifies all humidity altered above nature.
Wherefore if the humour be thin which proceeds from the ulcer, it is called
Virus Virus.
or virulentia. If it be thicker, Sordes. Sordes.
And if it be in a mean betwixt both, it hath to name by proper appellatio
Sanies. Sanies.
And it is said to be found abundantly in ulcers, and but little in deep
wounds. Sanies therefore is properlye among the vulgar Physicians and
Surgeons, the same that Pus is among ye Latines, and(...)among the Grecians.
Celsus calls it the Genus, having under it two kinds contained called of
the Greeks(...)and(...), the which ichor of the Latin interpretors is called
and turned to Sanies and Meliceria called Pus, Puris generatio.
having the beginning of contused flesh or blood. But in the generatio thereof,
there is a doubtful or half evil transmutation or alteration. Gal. lib. 5.
Simpli.
For as Galene saith, there is in the bodies of living creatures three
alterations. One plain and according to nature, yt is when the meat is
digested in the belly, bowels, or vessels, wherein the iuyces are
engendered, and from whence every part receives nourishmet. Tres alterationes.
An other plainly against nature. viz. in putrefying all things, this (after a
certain manner) is contrary to it self. The third is mixed or in a mean
doing, partly according to nature, partly contrary to nature.

Therefore the transmutation or alteration, which doth engender Pus, hath the
midst place among the best transmutation, which is the nourishement of the
parts of living things, and that which is simply the worst, which is made
stinking with putrefaction. For neither of only heat against nature, neither
of heat obtained according to nature is suppuration or Pus engendered. But the
heate of the inflammation is (after a certain manner) mixte of them both,
which whilst it gathers to suppuration, moves great pain, and by the heat
above nature of the inflamed part, fevers oftentimes are raised, and that by
extreme heating yt heart. And these two do chance (as it were of a certain
boiling or burning of ye blood, which being thoroughly exusted or burnt, the
remnant of it is made Pus, as by the altering of wood into ashes by burning,
as Galene hath left testified in his Commentary upon Hippocrates, thus
beginning. Dum pus conficit. c. By this now it is manifestly proved what pus
is, howe it is engendered, and what is the efficient cause and matter thereof.
Now we will show in few words what Virus, Virulentia, and Sordes are
amongst the Surgeons. Virus Virus.
or Virulentia, is a subtle superfluity begotten of abundance of watery
humours, which (says Guydo) is of two sorts, hot and cold, whealike or
ruddy. But Sordes Sordes.
is a certain superfluity more thick, engendered of humours having a thicker
substance, which truly is of three sorts, for some is thick, unequal,
heaped, and white, some black and like dregs mixed with ashes.

Furthermore, that which they cal Virus, Galene calls it in Greek(...), in
latin Sanies. Sanies seu virus quid.
But to say at one word Sanies or Virus, is that thin excrement in ulcers
which continually moistneth them, even as Sordes thickneth the, which procures
the ulcer named Rhyparon, that is Sordidum. Gal lib. 3. m^h.
For even as ( Galen saith) the excrementes whether they be thick or thin,
do follow every mutation of the quality of the nourishement. So is there
wont to be a double kind of excrement, and that chiefly in hollow ulcers:
that is to say a thinner, called in Latin Sanies, in Greek(...), and a
thicker also named Sordes. Of the thin excrement, the ulcer is made moist,
and of the grosser, filchie, whereof it comes, that the said ulcer needs
two sorts of medicines, viz. to dry that which is moist, and to mundifie the
filthy, but these things do belong to an other contemplation. But Pus Pus
est me dium inter saniem sordem.
doth chose (as it were) a middle substance between thick and thin,
especially if it be that which is good. For that is best (saith Hippocrates)
which is white, Boni ac mali puris notae.
light, equal, and without noisome savour. And that is evil (says Celsus)
which is thin, watrishe (especially if it be so from the beginning) also if
ye colour be like why, pale, yellow, or like dregs, and besides that, if it
smell evil. There is an other kind of Pus Pus(...)
faieth the same Corn. Celsus, called in Greek(...), which is apparauntly
found in great ulcers beginning to heal, which is thin, half white, and as
it were vnctuouse, not unlike the white fattines of oil. That Sanies is evil
which is much in quantity, Malae saniei notae.
over thin, yellow, pale, or black, glewy, or of evil savour, or if it
corrode in the same ulcer, or the skin ne'er thereto, is little better, if it
be somewhat more gross, half red or whitishe. Therefore the better that the
excrementes aforesaid appears in ulcers, the better hope is to be had in
their curatio: even as that wound is like to be cured with expedition, which
has good and fresh blood flowing from it, wherefore the signs both good
and evil, in every of these, must of the Surgeon be diligently weighed. So
that he may either reprehend, or pronounce what ulcers be uncurable, which be
easy to be cured, and which be harde to be cured. Which thing is of no small
weight, and the Surgeon thereby may laudably be wondered at and avoid
cauillouse slanders. And this said, shall suffice as touching Pus, Sanies,
and Sordes. Now it rests that we speak of the signs of ulcers, and
likewyse of the judgements.

The signs to know the differences of ulcers taken of the definitions.
Every ulcer hath his proper note or token, whereby he is diseried and know
from an other, and they are taken of the definitions of every of them.
Wherefore I suppose it to be worthy the labour here to recite by the way, the
short definitios of the chief differences above mecioned, wherein doing, we
would not have the Reader to regard so much the words as the thing it
self. For we had rather use the common definitios allowed long ago of all
professors, though they be more rude and common, then with eloquence (though
it were more pure stile) to ^ast a mist upon that thing which is obscure
enough of it self. Notwithstanding ^ have eschewed, in every place as much ^s
I might lanfully, that gross and idle ^arbarousnes. Therefore to go to the
purpose, that is a virulent Ulcer wherein is ^oyson, which is a certain
thin, and li^uid excremet, called properly of the La^nes Sanies, abounding
about erosion, called also by an other name Saniosum. The ulcer which by the
malignity and malice thereof doth stir up evil and biting juice, which
eats and gnaws the affected part, is made by the increase of humours more
ample daily, is named Corrosiuum, or Arrodens. Vlcus corrossi. sieve arrod.
But if the malice thereof do so much increase, that not only it vlcerateth the
corrupt flesh, but also wastfully consumes the sound with daily increasing,
it is the called Depascens. Vlcus depascens.
All the Physicians of Greece, (Galene also witnessing) do call this
affect(...), (...).
because it was wont to feed and carry to the sound parts, the corruption
of the affected, and to the affected, that which was in the sound. Whose
species or kind is Phagedena, Phagedena.
which is an ambulatiue Ulcer, which creping here there in yt ski^ and subject
flesh, doth corrode and feed^ on the top or outward parts, but it never
perseth inwardly. Wherefore it hat^ to name also Vlcus, in sumo residens, ^
never Profundum. That Ulcer with^ Galene is cal^ed Sordidum, Vlcus sordidum.
which hat^ more gross viscous excrementes, which we call Sordem, but in
Greek Rhyparon but the later writers have otherwise defined it, affirming that
it hath certain crusts thick and gross, or (as they say) some flesh
soft, thick and superfluous. The ulcer named Putridum, Lanfrancus sic
definite. Vlc. putrid.
is that from whence some vaporouse evil smelling fumes do proceed like to
dead carcases, or to that which putrefieth and corrupts the flesh, having
evermore thereto annexed Sorditiem, with outward heate, superfluous humidity,
and ofttimes a fever, and differinge from the filthy ulcer by the malice
thereof. They call that ulcer Cauernosum, Vlcus cuniculosum.
whose orifice is strict narrow, but in the bottom larger, without sense
hid, and having many corners, and like the Cunnie, running many ways, but
without callositie or hardenes, but others call it cotrarily Cuniculosum. The
fistulous ulcer differs little from the hollow or cuniculouse ulcer, Vlcus
fistulosum.
but that the wynding and turning ways thereof are ^callouse and harde. The
cancrous Vlcus cancerosum.
ulcer is in sight horrible and stinking, having edges hard, thick, swelled,
and inuersed, the colour in the midst betwixt red and black, as one should
say dusky or leadie, and about the vlcered part certain Ue^nes appearing
black, puffed up, swelled, thick, and replete with black blood. Vlcus
Vlcus(...). id est inteperatum.
discraton, commoly called Discrasiatum, is that, wherein Quaedam discrasia
(that is inteperature) reigns, a certain evil quality ruling above nature,
as immoderate heate, cold, moisture or drienes, or many of them together, and
such are properly called among us Vlcus inteperatu. That is called Vlcus
crucians, Vlcus crucians.
or Dolorosum, which in labouring, doth cruelly vex or torment, or (as Guydoa
Cauliaco saith) wherein Sense of the contrary thing is felt. Which may be
called in Greek(...). (...)
That (saith Galen) is Vlcus rheumaticum, Vlc{us} rheumaticum.
which by the Flux and resort of humours, refuse to be healed. And that is
called Verminosum Vlcus veminosum.
vlcus, which avoids Worms, called of the Greeks Scolesondes, whose
generatio is putref^ct. And those Ulcers, both of Galene, as also of all the
Physicians of Greece, are called Cacoethes, Vlcus cacoaethes.
who having all things applied, and each thing diligently administered and
ordered in all points according to art, and yet refuses utterly to heal, for
because that in the vlcered or affected part, some maligne pernicious matter,
lies hid to us unknown, and hinders the healing of the: We call those
Ulcers maligne, rebelliouse, and hard to be cured. Vlcus varicosum, Vlcus
varicosum.
is that, which hath certain Ueines in parts above the Ulcer appearing
swelled, and replete with thick gross blood, which swelling, is called
Varices, which by flowing to the said Ulcers, doth prohibit and hinder the
healing thereof. And the Apostumouse Ulcer Vlcus apostemosum,
is yt, which hath a tumor against nature, proceeding of some humour, such as
Phlegmon or Erisipelas. All other Ulcers are sufficient easy to be descried by
these aforesaid.

The Prognostications or Judgements of Ulcers.
what Ulcers soever saith Hippocrates, Aphor. 45. lib. 6.
do continue the space of a year or longer, the Orifice must needs be taken
away, and the Cicatrice made hollow. What Ulcers soever (says Galene (in
his Comentarie upon this Aphorism) are of long continuance, Vlcera anua
diuturna,
or having no Cicatrice by any means coming, or once received, breaks
again, and yet nothing left in the curation that ought to be taken away, it
signifies Cacoethes, which is a certain malignity, hard in receive curatio.
And yt chances through the Flux of vicious humours, or through evil
disposition of humours of long time gathered, and contained in the member, or
else some affect or corruption of the bone in that member. ( Auicen saith) that
what Ulcer soever, after it be filled with Flesh and a Cicatrice induced, if
it suddenly break fourth again, it is in danger to degenerate into a
Fistula, Vlcera dura viridia aut nigra.
and Ulcers that be hard, black, or greenishe, are evil: for in such there
is extinction of yt natural heate in the Ulcered part. Vlc. frig.
Cold Ulcers (saith Arabs) are known by softness and whytenes.

But the hot Ulcers decline to a rednes, Vlc. cal.
and are eased by cold Medicines, and are discerned by feeling. Therefore, every
one are known, partly by colour, partly by touching, Li. 4. Therap.
and partly (saith Galene) by the sense of the patient. Some say they feel a
burning, others, a manifest cold in the part, and do take pleasure in hoate or
cold Medicines. c. Dry and moist Ulcers, also have their propre Signs, and
know chiefly by feeling. For feelig doth discern and judge dry and moist
things, and such as follow those qualities, as hardness and softness, sharpness
and lenity And if maligne Ulcers do represent the colour of the rest of the
Body. viz. white, purple, Vlc. totius corp. colorem representantia.
duskish or citrine, it shows some default worthy reproof in the Lieuer,
whereby the blood there engendered is corrupted.

Ulcers succeeding other diseases, are harde to be healed. Aliud.
Vlcera circumglabra Vlc. circuglabra.
praua sunt, that is to say. Aliud. Apho. 4. lib. 6.
When thou see about the compass of the affected place, the Here's to fall
away, or Scales to arise, Judge that Ulcer to be perverse and froward, for it
signifies evil humours, and maligne juice to flow to the vlcered part, which
do vehemently erode. Therefore such maligne juice, doth neither clean
abolish the roots of the Here's, nor yet suffer the Ulcered place to receive
Cicatrice or Curation. But when those Here's had fallen before, do spring anew
about ye Ulcer, it is a good toke or sign.

The Ulcer (saith Hipocrates) whether it come before the disease, Aliud. Lib.
i. predictionum Vlcus ante morbu vel in ipso morbo enascens.
or in the sickness, ought diligently to be looked upon, for if the sick shall
die, the Ulcer will be dry, black, or very pale before death.

Ulcers wherein (after long emission of Sanies, and Virulentia) perfect and
laudable pus begins to appear, is a good sign, for it signifies both
strength of nature, and obedience of the matter. What are the signs of good
Pus, is before spoken of.

Ulcers in ye outward muscles of ye back, legs, or arms, are not without
danger. Aliud. Vlc. in quibus partibus periculosa.
Very perilous are they deemed also which occupy the inward members, or
reach unto them. In what Ulcers so ever incarnatiue medicines be applied, Vide
Hip. apud Gal. li. 4. The.
before they be well modified: evil and superfluous Flesh will in them
increase. But contrarily, which soever be duly, as they ought to be modified
and made, (as it were) dry before, the Flesh in such (saith Hippocrates) can
never increase superfluously, unless contusion happen thereto. Ulcers round in
compass, Vlc. rot^da.
are wont to be the worst, and not to come to a Cicatrice, but difficultly and
with much business, they bring children to utter ruin: Therefore in such, the
Chyrurgians counsel ought to apply a Cauterie actual, made after the
quantity and fashio of the Ulcer compassed. In the outward members, Artuum
vlcera.
that is to say, in the hands, feet. c. Ulcers and Tumors against nature, as
Phlegmon and such like, do oft happen, and commonly in the Glandulouse
parts, especially in those bodies that be Plethoriques, that is, given to
much repletion, for these parts, for as much as they be rare, are easy and
(as it were) ready to receive every humour flowing. For so it comes to pass,
that through an Ulcer, either in the finger of the hand, or Foot, the Kernels
about the armeholes or privy parts, do also swell or receive inflammatio,
for when the blood flows, or other humours should have recourse to the
outward parts, straight by their losenes and rarity, part of the said
flowinges are in them retained, Colli capit. vlc.
sometime also the glandulouse parts of the neck (either by Ulcers of the
head, or parts nigh to them, or else in them selves) do swell. And Galene
calls these glandulouse parts, which in that order do swell, Bubones.
Bubones.


When medicines applied to Ulcers, Aliud.
do profit, or (at least) do no hurt or discommodity: Si auxilia profuerint
aut nocue ^int.
it is a sure agrument, that such medicines were rightly administered. But if
they cause any present hurt, or do make the Ulcer more dry, hot, or cold, it
is a token that the things ministered are not fit for that present grief, for
that things more dry or more moist (as the thing requires) should be
applied.

Also if (by the things applied) the Ulcer become more soft by by, use things
more astringent. Si vlc. arro d^tur.
Nevertheless, if the Ulcer do erode and become more deep, then beware
diligently, for that springs of sharpe and vicious juice together with
malignity of the Ulcer, else through the faculty of medicines applied, which
do more then sufficiently mundifie: Nota.
for such by arroding the vlcered part, do increase much Sanies, and make the
Ulcer very moist, whereby it happens that unskilful Chyrurgians, are so
oft deceived in their purpose, for thinking the Ulcer to be Cacoethes, that
is, that ye matter therein coteined to proceed of malignity, or (as they term
it) of virulent and superfluous humidity, and while they earnestly minister
things sharpelye to mundifie, and thereby makes not only the Ulcer more
deep, and hollow, but also more hot, sometime makes it Phlegmonodes. Hereby
the parties affected, do feel erosion and mordication. Furthermore, amongst
many things which hurt or hinder Ulcers, saith Guy do de Cauliaco, ye South
wind is unprofitable, and also a moist air joined with heat. Vetus
merid^onalis officit vlceribus
For they induce putrefaction in Ulcers, even as all things that putrefy,
proceed of heat and moisture. Hence comes it (saith he) that Ulcers of the
Legs, are harder difficulter to be cured in ye South parts the in the North,
but in wounds of the head, it is contrary. And even as many tokens and
judgements in wounds, are common to Ulcers, so likewyse the judgements of
Ulcers, whereof we now speak, may be to wounds compared. Wherefor^
whatsoever is spoken before in the judgements of wounds convenient, or
agreeing to Ulcers, revoke them in this place.

Of the curing of Ulcers in general.
IN the curatio of Ulcers, Duo spectanda in curatione vlcerum.
there are two things to be considered and propounded unto us, that is, the
contemplation of the Ulcer it self, by what means it is an Ulcer, with
consideration of the cause of the Ulcer, of the Accidents, and every
disposition therein coteined, as also what part here or there it occupies.
For every Ulcer (as we have said before) either is alone and by him self
(that is, having no other affect, neither conversant with it, neither going
before, nor following it) or else is joined with one or more, of which some have
not only stirred up the Ulcer fro the beginning, but also do now make it
greater. Others be of yt sort, without the which it can not obtain the reason
of the scope of curation. But every Ulcer, in that it is an Ulcer, hath some
common indication of the cure (eve as Galene saith) the way of healing Ulcers,
Vlceris sa natio mediocris siccatio est.
is by a mean drying: this indication also is common to wounds, if (at least
they be woudes) that is, received of some stripe. This only is their
difference, this needs less: and the other (through the great humidity)
requires greater desiccation: If the Ulcer be joined with any other affect,
curation ought not to be applied to the Ulcer, but first to cure the affect,
lastly the Ulcer. For whether Phlegmon, Erisepelas, or ye tumor called Oedema,
or blackenes, or Ecchimosis, do besiege the Ulcered part, the cure must be
gentle. But if there be some strong intemperature (which is wont to bring
weakness to the affected part) and be joined to the Ulcered flesh, then, that
is first to be cured. And when thou hast cured the intemperature, afterward
thou shalt easily heal the affect. So must we first help the tumors called
Varices, which are oft above the Ulcered place, and then to cure the Ulcer.
But none of these curations (says Galene) is of the Ulcer it self, but of
some other affect, which either makes the Ulcer or nourishes it. In
tollendis dispositionibus cum vlcere coplicat. duplex consilium esse. Gal. li.
4. Meth. med.
Furthermore, Galene affirms that in taking a way the dispositions cotained
in Ulcers, there are two things to be considered: that is to say, either
utterly to take away such like affects in the body, or else to destroy that
which is therein unprofitably contained. But this he means to be done where
affect is little and plain, for where it is great, it can not be brought to a
Cicatrice before, till the other affects have remedy. Partic. in curandis
vlceribus scopi.
Of such like Ulcers therefore as are joined with other affects or
dispositions, there be four particular ways of curation.

1 The first prescribes a convenient diet fit for the curation of such Ulcers.
2 The second is to divert the matter antecedent. 3 Thirdly, in correcting and
removing the accidents and dispositios joined with the Ulcer. 4 Fourthly,
those accidents being corrected, doth teach and instruct us to cure them
after the manner of hollow wouds.
But we do follow the first and second intention, both by amending, emptying,
diverting and preventing that same flowing, wherewith the body of the
affected, doth abound, and flow in the vlcered part. Furthermore, the ways
whereby we may aptly amend and divert the abundance of humours, take away
their corruption is thus. viz. by Phlebotomy, Purgation, Approved diet,
Cauterie potential, Uomiting others of that sort. We prevent flowinges with
hinding, washings, epithmes, ointments Exbolo armeno, and other restrictiues.
When as therefore the humour flowing in the Ulcered places, is neither more,
nor yet much worse then convenient, sufficient repercussiues, binding above the
Ulcered place shall suffice, which binding doth shut the pores whereby the
matter should flow into the Ulcer: it is meet therefore that the medicines
applied to such Ulcers, be more dry then they that serve for the simple
Ulcer. But if it happen that this flowing can not be stayed or kept under, the
cause the must be searched forth, and that must first be taken away, which if
it come by weakness of the part that receives it, it must be strengthened
with proper curation of the vlcered place. But if it come by abundance of
blood or evil humours, either in the whole Bodies, or in any of the parts,
they are first to be cured but the imbecility of the part, whereto by reason
thereof more of humours then is convenient doth resort, doth come altogether of
intemperature, notwithstanding, not of every intemperature. Whereupon it
comes to pass, that the vlcered flesh is ofttimes only temperate not weak,
and ofttimes both vnteperate weak, for strong inteperature brings weakness
to the affected part.

The third and last intention, which is in amending and taking away the
accidents and dispositions, joined with the Ulcer, is brought to pass by due
consideration of the qualities of the humours and nature of the affected part.

The Second part.
The second discourse of Ulcers, with their particular cures.
HEretofore I have expressed the causes, signs, differences, and universal or
general cure for all kinds of Ulcers, with their Prognostications or
Judgements. Now also will I prosecute the matter without ceasing, until I have
prescribed to every Ulcer his particular distinction, and several cure,
gathered forth of diverse Authors, and especially out of Antonius Calmeteus
Vergesatus.

Of an Ulcer with intemperature.
what kind of intemperature De intemperie cu^vlcere.
soever it be, it may be abated by universal remedies, as by diet convenient
purgations, Calid. quo modo emendetur.
and (if it be joined with any humour) by reuulsions of all sorts. Hot in
temperature, whether it be alone, or joined with the Flux of humours, it may
be amended with Vnguentualb. or Rub. cum Camfora, or Vng. ex Pompholig. vel de

Of an Ulcer with pain.
Pain in an Ulcer proceeds most commonly of hot and sharpe intemperature
with corrosion. De dolor cu vlcere. Sic accidit dol. ex caliditate.
And then profits public medicines, as Succus Plantaginis, Solani,
Seperuiui, Hiosciami, or their stilled waters, mixed with Vinegar, and Oil of
Roses. It profits also to minister the white of an Egg, or the whole Egg,
mixed with Oil of Roses, Bolo armeno, and Terra sigillata, and Aceto.

A Cataplasme also is commodious, made with Mallowes, Plantaine, and Bran,
and boiled and mixed with oil of Roses. Or it shall not be incommodious to use
the white of an Egg, with Oil of Roses, Litharges, diligently mixed in a
Lead mortar, after boiled at a gentle fire in a pound of the juice of
Housleeke, to the consumption of the said juice. Else the whole Egg mixed with
Oil of Roses, and Terebetine, or vng. Popillionis, half an ounce, cum oleo.

wash the place with wine, wherein hoot things is boiled, such as is spoken
of before, and these or such like also are profitable. viz. Basilicon,
vnguentum Fuscum, Citrinum.

But when the pain springs by dissolution of continuitie, Si per

stupefactiues then are exceeding commodious. Notwithstanding, those are much
more profitable, which increase the natural heate, Anodina. hic confe^unt,

Of an Ulcer with a tumor.
IF with the Ulcer through pain, De vlc. cu tumore.
a tumor do chance, it must be assuaged, (ye cause of pain considered) whether
it come thy dissolutio of cotinuitie or with biting, or inteperature. But if
the swelling come by the malice or abundant Flux of humours to the place,
then prescribe a diet thin and cold. Mollisie or purge the belly (respecting
the humours nature) use Phlebotomy, restrain ye humour flowing, and resolve
that which is already flowed^ which all must be considered in tumors against
nature. If the tumor proceed of hot humours, Si tumor ab hue. cal.
it shall be expedient to boyle in tart wine a sweet Orange bruised, or Quinces
and sower Pears, boiled with the poulder of Myrtles, else Lintels decocte with
the poulder of the rindes of Pomegranettes, mixte with Roses and Terebintine.

Of the discoloured Ulcer with hardenes of the edges.
VUhen the Ulcer is discoloured, the edges hardened, note if ye hardness be but
small, it may be cured by resolutiue medicines, which be these. De vlc. de

Of the Ulcer with tumor in the the Veins.
OF this we have little to entreat, De vlc. cu varicibus.
when (as touching this matter) we have spoken sufficiently in the Ulcer with
tumor. This only resleth, that the Ulcer can not be cured till the tumor in the
veins be taken away with often bathinges, and after a sort nourishing, the
which being taken away with the accidetes aforesaid, either it will cure it
self, or else receive the cure of a simple Ulcer.

Of the Ulcer with putrefaction in the Boon.
IF in an Ulcer the Boon be also putrefied, De vlc. cu ossis carry.
the Boon is first to be bared by corrosives, or other wise as is aforsayd,
so much of the boon as is corrupted must be taken away, till the Boon

Nevertheless if the Boon be greatly corrupted, nothing can be better
therefore then Cauterie, for safely and speedely it dries both the bottom and
top. Rationem habe ad cauterij ca lidiratem.
Notwithstanding, so order the heate of the Iron, that it serve aptly, both for
y^ depth and quantity of the Boon corrupted, for we have seen that to hot
and vehement cauteries, expels not so soon the Boon corrupted, but have
spoiled it with corruption. But if the corruption lye ye^ deep, after thuse of
your first cautery (to the end it may be more easily avoided) to make the
Boon sound and whole, Terebra erit multis foraminibus apericda.
it shall be most expedient to pearse it with many holes, until some blood
appear, in those holes to apply a cauterie, by means whereof, the Boon may
be very well dried. Or else fill them with Aqua forti, so shall the Boon be
dried, and by little and little, expel that is corrupted. Sub eaque natura car
nem generabit, no sa nu os aere externo iterum corrumpatur.
And under that shall nature incarnate flesh, to preserve the sound Boon
from the corruption of outward air. To conclude, the Boon corrupted shall be
excluded, and none, or very little humour shall follow it. After the Cauterie

Of the malignant Ulcer called Cacoethes.
IN curing these kinds of Ulcers, De vlc. malig. quae Cacoethe vocantur.
the causes must first be diligently searched, to wit whether it be Plethora,
Cacochymia, or Cachexia, else an universal intemperature, or of some inward
part, as the Liver, Spleen, Uentricle, Ulcered part, swelling of the Ueines,
hard edges, weakness of the affected part brought to pass by evil humours
therein heaped, or the causes aforesaid. Toll cau^fam ante affectum.
Therefore let us take away the causes according to their natures then by
diet, Phlebotomy, and purgation to suppress the members intemperate,
whatsoever it be, and in what part. As for intemperature, look before in the
chapter of the Ulcer with intemperature. And commonly in these kind of Ulcers,
we have prescribed to the patient the use of Guiacum, Guiacum his procest
with happy success, after the use of common purgation, but in them whose
humours and juice is profitable, a diet is sufficient, but if the ulcer seem
bathed in humours, it is time to restrain the. For the tumors Varices, thou
hast a proper chap. but for inteperature of the inner parts, take counsel of
the Physician. And as touching Ulcers maligne and harde to receive Cicatrice,
V^l emens ^xi^atio est summa curatio.
the sum or chief scope of curation is vehement exiccation of the biting
humours, which is brought to pass per repellentia, and discutientia. Having
good respect to re^resseth at which flows, and to take a^aye that which is
infixed. And for this ^urpose these following are most expe^ient. Aristoloch.
Corticis Radi. Caparis. Malicorium, Radix Pannacis, Sarcocol^ae, Vitrum
Combustum, Testae pisciu Vstae. All metalles burnt likewyse are profitable, as
Cadmia, Calchitis vsta, ^ota sub Canicula, cum aceto trita, Antimonium,
Diaphriges, Plumbum ^vstu lotu, Squamma aeris ferri, Sco^ia plumbi, Erugo
rasilis vsta lota, om ^nia Aluminis genera, Terra sigillata.

But a further respect must be had to the body, for that in some bodies the
metalles and such like aforenamed medicines, must be washed before they be
ministered, but in harder bodies, without danger, certain of them may vnwashed
be applied, because in such parties the mebers sense is more dull. Habe
rationem ad corporis habitum sensumme brorum.
Wherefore first let the Ulcer be washed with an astringet decoction made with
Allome water, like as follows.

Of the virulent corroding and feding Ulcer.
THese kind of ulcers which differ ou^ Secundum maius minus, must ha^ue the
Methode of their cure consiste ^ three things only. De vlcere ^
First in a diet col^ and dry, secondly by evacuation of the a^ ^ecedent
matter, both by Phlebotomy ^ it seem profitable as also by medicines

^ modious, as cupping, frication, and b^ding the contrary member, or use of
vn^ de Bolo, to beat back the matter flo^ing. Catartica Particulares

appertains to diet and other universal order, according to the disposition
of the body, and Ulcers, forseeing and preventing all pain, intemperature. c.
associating the Ulcer, for always the causes both efficient and favouring,
must be resisted. The part affected must be so ordered, that the Ulcers
orifice, may decline downward, whereby the matter may more easily auoyde^, but
if that can not be done, incision is to be made from the orifice to the
bottom of the Ulcer, chiefly if the hollowenes be along or ne'er the skin, else
if the imminet danger prohibit the same in the botome, at the least it ought
to be opened, and anointed with a mundifying huguenot. The which if it cannot
be fitly applied, then in to the hollow and crooked corners, must iniections
mundicatiue be ministered, for which purpose, these or such like, are
profitable. viz. Oximel, Oenomel, of astringent wine, Aqua alluminosa cum

Notwithstanding, I having proved the like once in a Fistula of the ridge of the
back, next the region of the heart, there chanced to the patient Lipothimia.
Helleborus in aliqua part thoracis tutus non videtur.
To conclude, I judge it nothing profitable, chieflye if the Fistula be in any
part of the breast. If the Fistula be new, it is cured with the aforesaid
remedies, but if it be old, the orifice streit, it must well be enlarged,
either with Penicillo, or a tent of Gentian, or a Sponge often prepared.

it be in the outward part of the body, which may be safely taken away with
the roots, must be cut wholly, and the gross blood of the veins nigh
thereto pressed out, afterwards the lips of the Ulcer to be taken away, and
finish the cure in some with medicines cauterizing, in others to consume it
with a cauterie, or after incision expression of the veins, to apply the
cauterie. And amogest cauterizing medicines, Arsnick in this case is
principal, or the cauterie above written, but then use defensatiues to avoid
inflammation. Then take away the eskar, and proceed as in other Ulcers. But if
the Canker be great, and have deep roots, or be near some principal member,
or inward part, or the party cannot suffer excisio, either through weakness
or fear, or that by the cure thereof, he should incur greater danger, it
is enough then to hinder the Canker to increase, by diet, purgation of adusted
or melancolike humours, and that gently with drying medicines, without
mordication or biting. And this potion is exceeding profitable to be used nine
days before excision, taking every day two ounces thereof, which prevails
also though the cure be desperate.

may draw forth another, and keep it from blistering. Others with the same
reason do apply Onions with salce. But the common remedies are these. viz.
Aqua Solani, Rosar. vel Endiuiae, log beaten with the white of an Egg, but to
mingle Vinegar therewith, I allow not, because of the sharpness thereof, but
vng. Album rub. cum Camfora, Albumine Oui, aqua Rosar. is very good and

outward skin of the head of natural temperature, requires strong
exiccatiues, if Craneum be putrefied, howe it shall be removed, is before
mentioned.

Of the mouth.
IN this disease is requisite a thin diet, De Achoribus seu tinea.
and such as may decay all Flegmatike and Melancholy humours, and besides that
to have evacuation of humours, partly by Phlebotomy, if strength and age do

FIrst consider the cause of hear falling, Ad pllor^ generationem.
viz. whether through rarity of the skin, or defect of nourishement, I es
through corruption of humours, as in Morbo Gallico. If through rarity of ye
skin, then are they to be thickened moderately if through want of nutriment,
then apply nourishementes plentifully, but if it proceade of corruption of
humours, then prescribe a convenient diet for the same, and purge the body
according to the nature of the humours, mundifie the skin of the head, use
after such medicines following.

Of the Ulcers of the eyes.
FOr the cure of these Ulcers, use the general orders, both by diet,
evacuation, and all other universal remedies prescribed in Cap. de Opthalmia,
with a special respect to the nature of humours in the body. De oculorum
Vlceribus.
As for medicines meanly mundifying and ceasing dolor, and biting, use the like
as in wounds of the eyes, viz. Sir rosar^ Mel Virgineum, Saccharum Candium,
Aloe lota, Mirrha c.

To glutinate or join: Rec. Tuth^ae. preparat. Collirium de plumbo, Collirium

Many mo forms of medicines, as wel^ simple as compound, are diversely in
Authors prescribed, nevertheless full little commodity have I at any time by
them found.

Of the Fistula in the corners of the eyes.
THe order aforesaid. viz. De Fistula lachrimari
both diet, pu^gation, other universal medicines, is excellent good in the
beginning, when the Fistula is not confirmed, filling the hollowness of the
Ulcer, with a certain light or woolly substance, found about the root of
the reed, until it be clean modified. Also a Colliriu made ex Thure,
Sarcocollae. Sang. Draconis, Balaust. Antimon. Alumi. mixtis ad parts equals,
whereto ad quartam partem floris aerise, and the Collirium cum aqua pluuiali.
And I my self have never founde^ more excellent medicine the this following.

If the bone do not putrefy, but only tallous flesh abound, it may be
consumed with vng. Egipt. or the poulder of Mercurie, or Asphodel. Afterward
being well modified, seek to regenerate the flesh.

But^ if there be putrefaction at the boon, Si fuerit ossis caries
use cauterie actual, for in this case it excells the potential, the
largeness of Caries will show the form of the cauterie, so that the eye be
safely regarded by laying upon bombase in the white of an Egg, and covered
with a silver spoon.

An old Fistula in this place, is scarcely curable, for the great default of
the bone, and if it be cured, the eye will water continually.

Ulcers of the Nose.
IN curation of Ulcers of ye Nose, De Nasi Vlceribus.
called Phagedenici, or Cacrosi, others call th^ Noli me tangere, some
prescribe diet and other orders, as In curatione Cancri, and use cauteries,
Other caustiek medicines, as is written in the chapter De Polipo. Or a Sponge
dipped in Aqua Arsenici adding Olei De Euphorbio, which separateth the
putrefied flesh, but some would have those used only in the beginning. And
that wisely to be done, for ofttimes much use of corrosi^es, makes the Ulcer
worse (as experience teaches) but whe^ the Canker is cofirmed, it is best to
leau^ the cure, which if thou do, to preseru^ the party prescribed a

After lotions (if the Ulcer be filthy or virulent) the poulder of Mercurie or

Now if (by application of this cataplasme, it cease not to swell, neither may
be uncovered, in the mean season, the Ulcer do more and more corrode (which
is discerned by dolor) then the skin longwyse is to be cut, whereby the
Ulcer may come to sight and be cleansed. And if it be but small, peradventure it
shall suffice to make iniection with the aforesaid collirie, or such like,
but if it be great, apply one day a collirie, cum Aloe Mirtha, and an other

Notwithstanding, Si ad meatus corrodat.
if the Ulcer so corrode, that it be come to the ways and conduits of the

purging gross, sharpe and melacolie humours. And as touching due purgatio and
diet, therefore peruse the curation of tumors. Notwithstanding, those which
were accustomed to flow, and have been long stopped, are to be opened, either
with a lance aptly applied, or else a horseleach put to the place, first
anointed with blood, whereby she may the better take hold, or open them with
a plaster made ex alo^ fell bouis cum aceto, or make a suffiture ex decoct

Fistula, De any fistula.
the diet being thin and good, with other medicines and purgations, chiefly
by the upper parts, if it seem necessary, likewyse with Phlebotomy, and
enlarging the Ulcers orifice, and the callous substance diminishing.

But if it have, Quado intestinu penetrat.
pierced the intrelles, put the finger anointed with oil of Roses, into the
foundament, also Phaceolus that chances in the fistula, is in like manner with
the finger to be draw furth, so that it may not err, least perhaps by
cutting the callouse substance, thou cut also the hemoroicall veins, yet
incision seems better in my judgment, then detraction of Callus done by
ligature. After incision apply Albume oui cum puluere restrictorio, and then a
digestiue ex terebentina oleo.

Notwithstanding, great heed is to be taken, that Callus pearce not above
four fingers in length into any intrell, for if it do, the cure is desperate
and to be eschewed.

Ulcers of those parts, De femorum tibiarum pedum vle.
of what sort or kinds soever they be, are to be cured by methode universal,
with the institution of diet, Phlebotomy, and inward medicines, according to
the habit of the body, and quality of the humours, with the disposition and
kind of the Ulcer, as in the cures of certain tumors hath been diligently
handled.

And as touching outward remedies, the nature of the parts affected, must be
advisedly noted, if the refuse of humours fall thereto, they are before all
things to be stayde, both by universal medicines, simple and local.

In Summer they are to be washed cu aqua Plantag. wherein some Alume is
dissolved, and to be anointed cum vngueto de Minio, and if they be round,
apply thereto a cauterie of some other form and shape, and ease the parts
from time to time.

Certain Additions of diverse medicines of mine own invention, and oft by me
experimented and practised in the curing of Ulcers, as follows particularly.
First an Oil which I used in hollow deep Ulcers, whereby great commodity
ensued, having not only virtue to mundifie without erosion, but also aptly
applied to hollow caued Ulcers, within the space of four and twenty hours,
obteineth Pus perfect of kind, chiefly if the body be before prepared, and
the member void of accidents and evil dispositions. The right making thereof
must be in the beginning of the year, when the force of herbs is in them
fully contained. This is the making thereof. viz.

then reserve it. Note that this oil is good, as well for wounds as Ulcers,

What meates are to be used as touching diet in Vlcered bodies.
GALENE saith, that in the curing of Ulcers, Lib. de partibus artis medic. ca.1
Et lib. experiment. cap. vltimo
(which have their beginning of other matters or humours) there be three
principal ways viz. Diet, aide of medicines, and operatio of the hand. Apho.
1. 1. de ratione victus in acut. morbis.
And since diet is the most noble, and excellent instrument among the rest
(as Galene supposes) I have accounted it worthy the labour, only in this
treatise or part, to set forth the only order of diet, to be used in
curation of Ulcers: but amongst those things whereof our bodies do chance
necessarily to be altered, (as Galene saith) and wherein also the whole way,
Lib. 3. artis medicinalis.
or consideration of diet doth consist is (especially) the air which doth
environ and compass us about. Whereto also Galene adding saith, that which
doth compass and environ us, 3. method. curat. ca. 8.
is that without the which, neither ye disease can be taken away, nor the
health be kept and preserved, 1. De tueda sanitate
further he saith also, that there is no small strength or force of preserving
the health by choosing the good air, and for this cause it is meet, first to
show what air the body corrupt with Ulcers, doth require. It is worthy to be
noted howe the disease is driven away by the changing of the air to the
sick body, and that is by changing to an other kind of temperature in the
air, which the dissease (which is driven away by his contrary) doth aptly
require, as if the disease be of nature cold, the air must be hoate: and
somewhat more, that is to wit, of a greater inequality of the temperature of
the air, to the property of ye disease, whereby it may the more easily be
driven away (as for example.)

If the disease be cold in two degrees moist in one, Mayor inequalitas a^ris
ad proprietat. ^nor.
the air must be of greater heate then of two degrees, and of more drienes
then one degree. But howe shall we be able to know, or discern exquisitely
this proportion or excess in degrees, since Galene hath said, that the
certain quatitie of the thing, can neither be written with pen, nor
pronounced with the tongue. The Surgeon must therefore endeavour to find it
forth by conjecture, for it suffices to the driving away of the disease, if
the propulsatiue cause of the disease do obtain a certain proportion of a
greater inequality then the disease or fore. Therefore, it is good for them
that are vexed with ulcers, to inhabit y^ hoate air, both because the
naughty humours are made ready thereby, to breath forth by the pores of the
skin, also because the sine we members, which suffer much damage by Ulcers,
do take strength by heate. As Hyppocrates and Galene affirms. Aphor. 5. tepr.
comment. 18.
Yet let not the heate be vnmoderated, or to much inequality, least the
putrefaction be thereby burned, and the disease made more sharpe and fearce,
and also least the body fall the more readily into distillation, coming by
dissolving of the strong heate, into the which distillation that body doth
chieflye decline, from the which distillation also, inflammations may easily
grow, and heap together. Let the air therefore convenient to him, be more
dry, that the Ulcers superfluities and moist excrementes, may the more easily
be consumed, and let him therefore eschew the cold and moist temperature of the
air, since the disease doth proceed of such like vntemperature, as by Galene
plainly appears The affected bodies therefore shall live better in places
where Hills and Moutaines are, (though not in the highest of them.) 3. Artis
medicin.
But worst of al, Gal. 5. metho-curatiuae.
in lowe, fenny, or plain countries, in which places moisture doth abound,
but in the other drienes. Avoid therefore such places as be cloudy, misty.
c. by reason of pooles and marrishes which be there at hand, for that air is
corrupt, and increases superfluous moisture, whereby the Ulcers are nourished
and maintained, whereby they oft purchase payne in the head, and increase
distillations, which fall to the lower parts, which is most familiar to
Ulcers. Therefore where the profitable air can not naturally be had, let it be
prepared by art in the mansio, or abiding place of the party, for if the
place and air be not only disagreeing to him, but also the constitution of
the time, let him use gentle perfuminges with spices, because their head is
also commonly replete with evil and vicious humours, as saith Hypocrates, 5.
Aphor. 18.
and if the affected body do feel hurt by receiving the fumes of sweet
spices, then let it suffice, that he behold or have them present by him, for
the breath or savour of them, is a safeguard to all cold diseases. But when as
in the winter season, Galen. 5. Apho. comment. 18.
the fire shall be agreeable to it, then burn therein ye wood of Rosemarie,
Juniper, Laurel, or of the wood called Terebinthus, or of the Larche tree, or
ye Pineaple tree. Furthermore, let ye party cover his head moderately with
hoate things, for an extrinsicall heat is hurtful unto him, both of those
things wherewith the head is defended and covered, as also of the air which
is about it, for superfluities do issue forth from it, to the members below,
by a certain dissolutio, by the which Ulcers are not only nourished, but also
stirred and exiccated. The bread which doth little nourish, I suppose to be
profitable for Ulcered bodies, and not their meat to be equal to their
appetite, for the concoctiue faculty being weakened in them by to much
repletion, many superfluities are engendered, greatly hurtful unto them, let
their bread be such as makes the belly soft, whereby the inner parts may
be cleansed, and deiection made of the naughty humours. Therefore let the bread
be much brannie, the finest meal bolted forth, which is proved fittest for
such, 1. De poten. alimetoru. cap. 2
as Galene witnesses, further, let not their bread be to much leuened, for
the tartnes thereof is hurtful to the brain, and to the sinews, which suffer
much damage and anoiaunce of the Ulcers, and yet let not the bread be utterly
without leaven, for Galene saith, in the same place rehearsed, that that bread
which is altogether without leaven, shall not be meet or fit for any body.

Of the wine which Vlcered bodies ought to frequent.
OF this opinion is Galene, L^de s^nitatis tu^la.
that all excess is to be eschewed especially, that which brings damage,
both to the body and mind. Wherefore, since wine doth engender to small damage
to Ulcered bodies: I suppose it best, not only to counsel them to drink but
one draught, but utterly to refrain all sorts of wine, for wine hurts the
body, in so much that it sends gross vapours to the head, which being
afterward expelled by the painful travail of the brain, doth ruinously fall
into the lower parts, much hinder and damage the healing or curation of the
Ulcered. And also for because the nature of the members is much delighting in
wine, and therefore do draw it covetously to them before it be concocted,
which then wonderfully doth increase superfluities in ye body, the which
superfluous abundance, nature (not being able to redress or amend) expulseth
them to the outward members so plenteously, that in short space they engender
Ulcers of one kind or other. I therefore unfeignedly do suppose, that Hidromel
ex decoctione Hisopi, Betonicae, should be a meet and convenient drink for
the, the operation whereof is hoate and dry, diminishing cold, gross, moist
humours, and aptly strengthening the power of brain saith Galene, and
whosoever reads Galene in his first book De tuenda sanitate, Li. 8. Simplic.
medicament.
and in his book Exhortationis ad bonas arts, and in his third book De
temperaturis, shall plainly see the hurt that is received by drinking of
wine. But in Ulcered bodies, where doubt is also of dropsy, and in those, who
(through vehement appetite and breach of custom by the Physicians counsel)
do wax sick for the taste of wine, to such (I say) we must be compelled to
pardon them for the drinking of a little, or as need requires. The wine that
is white in colour, is least hurtful for them, the fuming force thereof being
delayed, so saith Galene, Gal. lib. 1. de tuenda sanita. Et li. 5. de loc.
affect. ca. 5.
for such wine doth not only little send to the head, but also makes the
stomach strong and forcible, but strong wine or vndelaide, doth the contrary.

Of the flesh meates which they ought to eat.
Flesh meates which in continuance of time, do get to them the nature of
earthy food, substance or nourishment, are very evil for those that be
troubled with Ulcers, Galen. 3. De potentijs alimentorum.
because they engender a grosser blood then is convenient, so saith Galene, for
that their nourishement is rebellious and stubborn, not stregthening the
virtues in the body, as the flesh of Beef, Stags, Rams, and old beasts
that be gealte, neither is Swines flesh altogether convenient for such meates do
grieve the stomach, engedring a gross nourishement saith Galene, Gal. lib. 7.
Meth. curat. cap. 6.
and nothing assistant to nature in digestion. Those meates therefore are
very fit which be hoate and dry in temperature, for in the first beginning
the causes of Ulcers, are judged to proceed of cold and moisture, and if any
sudden heate chance thereto, it is thought to be through putrefaction lying
aloft. As by Galene we are plainly taught. Gal. in lib. de curatione per
sanguine. missionem.
Wherefore the Thrush, Owsell, wood Plouers, and al that get their living in
dry places, are most of others convenient. Also domestic birds, as Capons,
Hens, and household Doves, are nothing unmeet, but greatly alowable, and
together with these ye Fesaunt, Partridge, Quails, and such like, are much
agreeing. The meat of four footed beasts which is alloweable to Ulcered
bodies, are these and such like. viz. Young Conies, yonge Hares, which with
their moist nourishement do cherish sustain the natural heate, increasing
also the strength of the whole body, which is a true mean to restore the
health of the body, wherefore by this it follows consequently, Vlceribus
infest^ aquatiles minim prosunt.
that all waterfoules by their moist temperature and hardness of digestion, are
to bodies thus affected, most hurtful unprofitable. viz. Gese, Ducks, c.
Neither is it doubtful to any man, that the flesh of Lambs is hurtful to
those, and that because they engender a substance to moist, for so we be
taught by Galene. Galen. de cibis boni mal. suc. Galen. 12. De temp. med.
sec^dum locos
Let them also which be affected, beware of to much pouldred meat, for Galene
saith, that salt is noisome, especially to Ulcers in the head.

Of Fish.
BEcause Fysshe of their own propre nature exceadeth in abundance of
moisture, Gal. 6. us. part. cap. 9
which (saith Galene) is rebellious to Ulcers, they are to be eschewed, both
because they augmet the cause of the Ulcer, and also for that they be harde of
digestion, most chiefly (saith the same author) those which are full of
excrements, Gal. 3. De fac. alimet, cap. 24.
of the which sort are the fish of Lakes, Marrishes, Muddy pooles, and
stinking Ponds, for their meat is so excremetal, and so slimy, that thereby
filling all the pores of the body, empaireth the strength of the members, and
grieves or deprives their functions, whereupon, payne, lothesomenes,
rottennes, and corruption of humours are engendered. But those fishes, which are
engendered in Land floods, and are nourished in harde stony and grauellie
waters, especially in quick streams, are less hurtful, the meat therefore of
those fishes which swim in the pure and clean sea, is very little hurtful
to them, chiefly being taken when the sea is at a full water, and tossed with a
quick wind, as manifestly it is to be found in Galene. 3. De pot, aliment.
cap. 24.
For by so much the fish is the worse, by howe much it is less exercised
tossed, and troubled. Let them also beware of pouldred fishes, as I said even
now of pouldred flesh. And we prohibit generally al kind of fish, by what
means soever they be taken or kept, for by their slimines they corrupt the
humours, being very harde in passing, and difficult in digestion, and the more
slimy the worse.

Of Eggs.
GAlene says, Galen. li. 3 De potent. aliment. cap. 21.
that the Eggs of creatures do engendre good and perfect blood, as the Eggs
of Hens. c. For by the reason of the equality of their teperature, they are
judged convenient and agreeable to all bodies, as well diseased as sound, for
they do not only engender good humours and commedable juice, but also are of
light digestion, easy passage, grieving very little the natural strength, as
is euidet in Galene. Lib. 3. De fac. alimet. cap. 21.
But let the eggs be new laid, or else they be rebellious to the nature of
man, and be evil to digest, engendering sundry accidents and evil
dispositions. Let their Eggs also be boiled in water, for the roasted are
harder of nourishement. c Furthermore, it shall be best only to eat the yolke of
the Egg, because the white is of cold and moist temperature. Let the Eggs
also boiled, be rear, for they be of swift transiture, engedring the best
juice, and stregthening the faculties of the body. But as Galene Gal. 3. De
fac. alimet. cap. ^1.
saith, the Eggs which are fried, of all other are most pernicious, and
harde of digestion, wherefore all meates fried with Eggs, are utterly to be
eschewed of bodies affected with Ulcers.

Of Milk.
BOth Milk, and what meat soever is compounded or made of Milk, are very
rebellious to Ulcered bodies, for the ^uming to the head, whereby gross humours
are engedred. 5. Aph. 64.
For Hypocrates saith that Milk to those affected with pain, causes ache in
the head, and is evil both to fevers and pain in the belly. Also Galene Gal.
comment. 60.
saith, that Milk well boiled, doth nourish well, and engedre good humours, ^t
in affected persons doth touche the head, it is daugerous, enducing the
dropsey in Ulcered bodies, therefore all forces of meates made with Milk, must
be of such persons eschewed.

Of Cheese.
TO al that be affected with Ulcers, we forbydde the eating of Cheese, both
for the abundant slimines, which is thereby engendered in humours, as also for
that it makes them slowly to digest. Lib. 3. De fac. alimet. cap. 16.
Galene being witness, whereby saith he, the members (by the passage of those
slimy humours) are altered, Lib. 2. artis medici.
and makes oft solution of continuitie, causing pain in such persons, and
that so much the more, by howe much the chese is more salt, and older,
Galen. 3. De potentijs alimen toru. ca. 16.
for thereby it is tarter, and therefore harder to digest, and makes worse
nourishment. And note that although Chese be of a diminishing faculty of
gross humours yet is it unprofitable, for by y^ naugh tines of the juice
boiling heate, it brings more inconvenience, then the attenuation of gross
humours can profit. Since therefore there is a common fault to all kinds of
Cheese, let persons thus affected, ab stain from it.

Of Fruits.
OF Fruits (saith Galene) which men do eat, Li^ 2. fac. aliment. cap. ^.
which the ancient writers call Horarios, for because they spring in the
hour of the year, which hour of the year Galene calls that time, in the
midst whereof the star (whereof the Caniculer days be named) appears.
Of the which some are called fruits of the earth, of which sort are
Gourdes, Pompions, Citrons, Mellons, Coucumers^ c. Which because they are of a
moist nature, and endowed with large humidity, they do not only engender a
moist nourishement, but a slender humidity, and that which is easily purged
forth of the body. Galene saith also, Lib. 2. De pot. alimeto. cap. 2.
that that fruit both cotaine a naughty juice, increasing the disease, and
weakening the members, almost depriving their functions, wherefore to be taken
as an usual service in Ulcered bodies we must flatly deem. And those fruits
which Galene calls arboreous, 2. De pot. aliment. cap. 7.
are those growing upon trees. viz. Figs, Pears, Apples, Peaches,
Mulberies, together with the fruit which the Italians call Armelini, being a
fruit accounted among the Peaches, and Cherries, Plummes, c. Whose substance is
soft and moist, not only engendering the like nourishment, but also by their
wyndines do attribute no small hurt and pain to the affected bodies, and
therefore are altogether to be forbidden. But if the body affected do fervently
desire and earnestly (as it were) long after fruit, then may we permit him
to eat Figs that be well ripened, as things less hurtful, less
engendering evil humours the the Autumn fruits, although they be not
altogether void of fault, for so they be not (says Galene) Notwithstanding
as is aforesaid, 2. De pot. aliment. cap. 8.
they be less hurtful then al the rest, yet now and then, an Apple roste^
under embres may be pardoned, for the fire diminishes the moist juice
thereof, and abates the wyndines. Whereby otherwise it comes to pass that
the eaters of fruits, do oft suffer pains torments in the belly, viz. such
as Quinces, Orenges, Medlars, Sorbes, Nuts such like, which are not only slow
in passage, but also being gross, gluie, do engendre astringent iuyces,
retaining the naughtiness of humours. Notwithstanding, we account not sweet
Almondes unprofitable, sith in them is contained no binding force, for y^ they
do make clean and extenuate, and therefore probably allowed in Ulcered
bodies. 2. Fac. aliment. cap. 29.
And Galene also affirms that Almondes do purge the bowels, whereby it comes
to pass that virious humours (being propulsed to ye skin, and forbidden to
abide in the inner parts) are driven out by the pores of the skin, as it were
by breathing, whereby pains of the belly and other exterior inconveniences are
prevented: wherefore sweet Almondes are a convenient fit meat for affected
bodies.

But Filberdes and Walnuts, because of their binding strength, and the cause
aforeshewed, are most unprofitable, and very vnholsome for Ulcered bodies.

Of herbs to be used in brothes. c.
Herbs fit for such bodies, are those which be hoate and dry. viz.
Hysope, Calamint, Watermint, Fenill, Sage, Betonie. c. And when herbs that do
attenuate and make soft, be with these compounded, then do they easily
cleanse and expuise al gross and slymie humours, and therefore must needs be
granted comodious for such persons, the herbs of contrary temperature.
viz. cold and moist, are as much hurtful, such as Lettuse, Endiue, Mallowes,
Spinache, and such like, which by their cold nature, do compact and heap
together naughty humours in thinner parts of the body, hindering their passage
or expulsion, for which cause the depth of the body is not purged, but the
disease more augmented and a great deal the more when the patient through
fond and greedy desire, shall have eaten herbs cold and dry, with astringent
faculty, which to the pacients are most obnoxious, of which sort be
these. viz. Plantain, Sorrel, Nightshade and of like sort.

Of Onions, Garlic, Musheromes, or Toad stools. c.
ONions, Garlyke, Scalians, Leekes, for their sharpe and biting tartnes
together with the obscurity of their substance both more damage to the body
the their force of extenuating can pleasure again. Of the earth also
proceadeth funges, or Todestoles, which any way prepared, are to be eschewed,
since they are not only of evil juice, but their nutriment is cold and
phlegmatic, and to all accidents and dispositions (proceeding of Ulcers) most
hurtful. Of that mind is Galene, saying further, for as much as Toadestooles
can not dry, 2. De pot. aliment. cap. 60. li. de cibis boni mali succi.
it is a manifest token that in them is evil contained. And Auicen saith, that
prefocation happens to them which use to eat Toadstoles.

Of Pulse.
SInce there is no Pulse endowed with good perfect pleasure, but do greatly
fill the body, with wind, by which means pains in the body, may arise to
Ulcered bodies, therefore vnneedefull: I do not without cause account them
unprofitable ( Galene being author) of which sort be these. viz. 1. De potent.
alimetorum.
Beans, Fitches, Rise, and such like, let us straightly command the Ulcered
patients, clearly to eschew these kind of grains in what order soever they
be altered: but to an immoderate appetite, the broth of red Rice, may
indifferently be permitted, for that doth attenuate and cleanse gross and
clammie humours open the obstructed ways, which means are much assistaut to
the healing of Ulcers.

Of motion and rest.
Understanding by Galene, De tueda sanitate.
that reasonable motion is not only helthfull to the body, but also makes
the said body of a good form, and habit, and kepeth it in healthful
plight. It shall be most expedient that the person affected, do moderately
frequent the motion and exercise of his body. But yet (saith Galene) I would
not have him to use it when he is full, for endamaging or hurting the head with
vapours, which by much motion may arise from the meat newly taken, and
vndigested. Exercise is good before meat, for the it increases the force and
stregthe of the body (saith Galene,) and thereby purges the pores of the
body, 6. De loc. affec. ca. 6.
and expels the excrementes. Galene therefore affirmed it profitable, 2. De
sanitat. tutela.
to use exercises before meat: yet it is convenient also to use exercises
sometime after meat, not always, but (as Galene says) when the meat is
entered into the second digestio, 2. De tueda sanit.
and the time of eating is at hand again. But if either before or after that
time, the exercise be used, it either fills the body with raw
superfluities, or else hastens the coming of Melancholy. For (says Galene)
if the exercise after meat be not gentle and easy, 2. De tueda sanitate
it hastens down the meat from the stomach before it be digested. Wherefore
the exercises before meat, must be more hasty and quick, to the end that the
superfluities which lurks in the hollow places of the body, may more easily
be expulsed, nature being assisted by exercise.

Of sleep and vvatching.
GAlene saith, that sleep and watching, doth come on every side, 2. Aphor.
comment. 1.
according to the motions of unconstant heate, sleep to the inner parts, and
watching to the outward. The natural heate being moved foreward, for the
which cause, when as in much sleep the natural heate (being called to the
inner parts) a great quantity of vapours doth rise up to the head (whereby
fluxions do distill to the members below, I think it expediet that the
Ulcered body refrain from much sleep, least superfluities multiplied by
reason of sleep, should heap and gather to much to the members, which lie
and rest. Day sleeps must be altogether forbidden. For in watching, the
breathings may be moved from the heart to the outward parts, they do
attenuate and dissolve the gross and clammie humours engendered in the members
(natural heate being adjoined) For the which thing, it is expedient for ye
party to use watching for ye longer distace of time. And when daily sleep
would possess an accustomed order, let it be shaken of and lost by little and
little, according to the precept of Galene.

Of Joy or Mirth.
GAlene saith, ^De sim^, causis
that mirth proceadeth by motion of the mind to the outward parts of the
body. For the breath being gathered at the hart at the going forth, doth
yield a comfortable heate to all the members, whereby all phlegmatic
superfluities in them hid, is scattered and put forth, therefore profitable
to Ulcered bodies. But by sadness (by reason) comes the contrary, for that
reuoketh al the spirits and heate unto the heart, so that the outward parts
are utterly destitute of heate, therefore greatly moving and augmenting the
cause of Ulcers, wherefore use mirth, and avoid sadness.

Of repletion and Inanition.
REpletion, whether it be of meat, or of evil humours, filling the vessels of
the body, it is evil, and straightly to be reproved (as says Galene). For
when the vessels be filled above mean or measure with meates and drinks, 1.
Aphor. comment. 3.
the parties are in jeopardy of burstnes, obstruction of natural heate. c. I
counsel therefore all those that be infected with Ulcers, to flee from
vnmoderate filling of their bodies, (according to ye causes rehearsed) for that
thereby all pains, anguish, and perturbations with evil disposition,
accompanying the Ulcers, may be incited. Let the patients therefore use a
slender kind of diet, and yet not an vnmoderate kind and excessive form,
spare feeding, since such may easily engeder the falling sickness, which
when the stomach shall be inordinately emptied, hath rediest access, for so saith
Galene. In lib. de ven^. sec. cotra Erasi^trat.
But a thin diet (by moderate use observed) resists ye same. Galene
therefore hath this sentence, a mean moderate diet usually kept, Li. de
attenuante vict. ratione.
doth safely cure young folks of the falling sickness newly begone, doth meetly
assist them, though they be old, and the disease inueterated.

De Coitu.
FOr as much as generally all Ulcers do proceed of intemperature, with cold
and weakness of natural heate, and that nothing more augments the malice of
such affects, nor increases their continuance, then exercises decaying
natural heate, thuse of things that weaken, cool and dry the body. And
again since nature in such parties is sufficiently busied in strengtheninge
and sending due nourishement to the affected parts, it must needs be great
damage to the patient, and hindrance of the curation, to use Coiture, which
(as Galene affirms) doth make the body more weak, Li. de san. tuenda. 3.
slack, cold and dry, which sure is needeles in Ulcered bodies, who are
commoly given to be of that intemperature. And Paulus Aegineta, Li. 1. art.
med. ca. 7.
saith that Coiture hurts bodies sound, that be of cold and dry complexion.
Wherefore to affected bodies, which have nothing in them natural that may be
wanted, we ought without pardon, to prohibit the use of venery.

A Table of Simples
AND since I have so narrowely touched the curatio of Ulcers in ye former
treatises, I think it more expedient then vnneedeful, and more worthy the
labour, then out of the way, to set forth in order the natural temperatures,

opportunity of time, has collected and drawn out of diverse worthy and

The properties of degrees, and what effect is contained in every degree, with
examples of simple medicines for each degree.
1 The first degree, doth alter change sensibly. 2 The second, induces and
infers some labour. 3 The third, works with great efficacy and much
labour. 4 The fourth degree, banishes puts forth ye sense by his exceeding
temperature.
Temperate medicines be such, as do neither manifestly heate, cool,
moisten, nor dry.

These be vnteperate medicines, which are plainly to be called hoate or cold,
chiefly such as be of the first, second, third or fourth degree.

Medicines hoate in the first degree.

Thus far is sufficient for example sake of the hot intemperature of simples,
fro the first to the fourth degree, and after as orderly as I can, shall ensue
the cold, moist, and dry entemperatures, with like order of their natural
degrees, and first of such simple medicines as he cold in the first degree.

Which are poison clean extinguyshing natural heate, as water puts
outfier.

Of the dry inteperature with the degrees exceeding. Of those therefore which
^e dry in the first degree.

The first degree makes y^ body strong and lusty. viz.
