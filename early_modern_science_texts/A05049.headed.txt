A most excellent and LEARNED VVOORKE OF CHIrurgerie, called Chirurgia parua
Lanfranci, Lanfranke of Mylayne his brief: reduced from divers translations to
our vulgar or usual frase, and now first published in the Englyshe prynte by
Iohn Halle Chirurgien. Who hath thereunto necessarily annexed.

A Table, as well of the names of diseases and simples with their virtues, as
also of all other terms of the art opened. Very profitable for the better
understanding of the same, or other like works.

And in the end a compendious work of Anatomy, more vtile and profitable,
then any here tofore in the Englyshe tongue published.

AN HISTORIALL EXPOSTVLATION also against the beastly abusers, both of
Chyrurgerie and Physic in our time: With a goodly doctrine, and instruction,
necessary to be marked and followed of all true Chirurgies.

All these faithfully gathered, and diligently set forth, by the said Iohn
Halle.

Imprinted at London in Flete streate, nyghe unto saint Dunstan church, by
Thomas Marsh. AN. 1565.

The books verdict.
AS some delight most to behold,
Each new deuyse and guise,
So some in works of fathers old,
Their studies exercise.
Perusing with All diligence,
Books written long before:
Wherein they learn experience,
To heal both sick and sore.
Which I allow in dede and word,
In those that understand:
For otherwise it is a sword,
Put in a mad mans hand.
Let Idiotes and betles blind,
Therefore lay me apart:
Lest contrary mine authors mind,
They rudly me peruerte.
For as he be doth honey take,
From every goodly flower,
And spyders of the same do make,
Uenim that will devour:
So all that learned men and wise,
To good purpose can use,
The rude that knowledge do despise,
Will ever more abuse.
Wherefore all those that use me right,
I shall increase their fame:
And vile abusers all my might,
Shall be to do them shame.
UNTO THE VVORSHIPFVL the masters, VVardens, and consequently to all the whole
company and brotherhod of Chirurgiens of London, Iohn Halle, one of the lest
of them, sends hearty and loving salutation.
Since the almighty Creator of all things, of his merciful goodness, only for
love that he had to mankynd (who fell by disobedience out of Paradise into
misery) hath created medicine out of the earth for man his utility and help
in the time of his sickness, as the wise man says, Eccl. 38. And hath ordained
ministers of the same medicine, by a true and perfect order of art, But of
this division look more in my preface to the Reader.
divided now into two parts, as the phisicien for inward infirmities, and
the chirurgien or handeworker for outward griefs: It should seem unto me
that they which despise the said art, despise God his gracious gifts, even
as they which profess either part thereof abusing the same, abuse God his
merciful benefits.

And for as much as such despisers and abusers, are as well offenders to God,
as a detrimente to his creatures: It should seem a thing not vain or void of
profit, to reprehend and warn men of such vices: specially where they are
so frequented, that some by feeling, and some by understanding and saying, daily
cry out with grievous clamores, of the incommodious success of such wicked
facts.

First the despisers thereof oftetymes (as we se) suffer them selves (thorough
hate that they bear to these excellent parts and the ministers thereof) by
negligence to run to extreme desolation: and therefore many times worthily
perish, as a just reward for their contempt of God his ordained remedies.

And yet truly I can not but confess, that the abusers of those things are
the chief cause, of these so great euels and mischiefs: for the experience of
their wicked doings, and the ouerthwarte success of the same, causes the
ignorant to be at defiace with that which was made for their own help and
succour: so that they often perish, because they fear to seek remedy: they
are so often beaten with the painful rod of hateful abusers.

And alas, where as there is one in Englande, almost throughout al the realm,
that is indeed a true minister of this art, there are ten abominable
abusers of the same. Where as there is one Chirurgien, that was apprentice to
his art, or one phisicien* that hath travailed in the true study, and
exercise of phisique: There are ten, that are presumptuous smearers,
smaterers, or abusers of the same: yea, Smythes, Cutlers, Carters, Coblars,
Copers, Coriars leather, Carpenters, and a great rabble of women: Which (as the
most excellent Galen feared to happen) forsake their handiecraftes, and for
filthy lucre abuse physic, and chirurgerie. The cause whereof the said Galen
wisely recites: for he says, if these sciences had no coligance with other
needful learnings, that those inconveniences would thereof ensue.

I would to God therefore my dere masters and brethren, that there might no
fault be found in us, cocerning these things: For truly if we wear such men
of science, as we ought to be, those false abusers would be more fearful to
meddle as they do. For what a shame were it, that such an abuser in talking
with a chirurgien in dede, shall apere more perfect in the knowledge of the
anatomy, and the natures of simples, or the complexion of man his body, then
he that hath ben apprentice to his art? Surely me thinks this were a great
occasion, not only to cause these abusers more to presume: but I fear me also
that such things have been the cause, that such abusers have ben defended,
of those which of right should have subdued them.

Hear me my masters and brethren, is there any philosopher so ignorant in
philosophie, that he wants knowledge, to defend that which he doth
profess, against his contrary? doth he worthily bear the name of a
Platoniste, that is ignorant in Plato his works? or is he worthy the name of a
Musicia, that hath learned to singe or play a few songs upon an instrument,
without the knowledge of the principles and rules of music? I am sure ye will
answer no. If this be true in dede, as I think none can deny: Howe can we
for shame call our selves Chirurgiens, if we be not able to defend the same
art, to the confutation of the abusers thereof. And I suppose verily, that
Galen would not have thought him self a true Phisicien, if he had not been able
to confute the error of Thessalus and ye empirickes of his time, that falsely
abused the excellent art of medicine: whereof Chirurgerie is the most aunciet
and worthy part, as Cornelius Celsus witnesses: what so ever in the abusiue
division is otherwise pretended.

Saying therefore that it lies not in us to extinct, put down to silence, or
subuerte these abusers: would God that we might at the least, (through our
excellentie) cause them as they are to seem execrable. So that thereby, they
which have power to redress these things, shall of their own motion, seeing
these abuses subuerte them: I mean that we our selves might grow to such
perfection, that the works and knowledge of us might appear so immaculate,
that by our iustnes, their falshode may be scene or known, by our cleanes their
fowlnes, by our knowledge their ignorance, by our certain* and true use: their
abusion and uncertain adventures: As each thing is known by his contrary.
So that at the last, they the selves (as Iannes and Iambres, the charmers of
Aegipte, although for a while they deceived the king, by counterfeiting the
miracles of of Moises and Aaron the servants of God, yet at the last
confessed, that their own deeds wear done by deceit, and the miracles of
Moyses by the finger of God) shall confess them selves also to be abusers, and
we workers by true science. And so at the last I doubt not, but all me shall
abhor them. And as abuse grows into hate and cotempt, so the right use
shall obtain love and credit: so that the good endeavour of us I trust, shall
be the fall both of the abusers, and the haters, of our excellent art.

For truly my masters and brethern, I can not a little commend your late good
indeuoures in this behalf. For I presently see a number of diligent hearts,
endeuouryng them selves by all means to excelle in all kind of studies,
belonging to their art and profession: and as it already appears unto me, so
shall it shortly to all men, even as choke pears to our adversaries. If we
may but have the favourable defence of you our masters, as we have had
encouragement thereto, by your diligence in repairing our worshipful halle, and
ye order thereof: to the increasement of al kind of knowledge, belonging to our
profession.

I therefore, as preparative to the rest that shall follow, dedicate this my
simple labour, in setting forth this excellent compendious work, called
Chirurgia parua Lanfranci, under your aid, help, succour, tuition, and
defence: which was translated out of French into the old Saxony english,
about two hundred years past. Which I have now not only reduced to our
usual speech, by changyng or new translating such words, as now be
inveterate, and grown out of knowledge by process of time, but also conferred
my labours in this behalf with other copies, both in French and latin: namely
with master Bacter, for his latin copy, and Symon Hudie for his frech copy,
and other English copies: of the which I had one of Iohn Chamber, an other of
Iohn Yates, both very ancient, with other mo: whose good help hath not a
little farthered me in these things, to the intent that it might perfectly come
forth to a public profit, which to do I was constreigned, not only because
I would not trust to much to mine own rude judgements: but also that by the
authority of divers men of knowledge, this excellent work (as it is worthy)
may ye more effectually be allowed and accepted.

And this dedication have I made unto you, rather then (as the common use is)
to noble men and princes, because ye being fathers and ancient masters of
the same, are better able by persuasion and instruction of doctrine, to defend
the same, to the satisfying of all men, then the only name of any prince, or
magistrate, which defence I do not desire, because I think the most
excellent Lanfranke, to lack authority of truth, to defend him self, but
only that mine own imbesilitie and faintness of name, in setting forth of this
work, may by your worshipful aide, succour, and help, be fortefied. And thus
doing, ye shall not only encourage me for my part, to enterprise other things
vtile and needful, but other also, with whom I have conferred my studies,
both have done and do intende the like, to the increase of the name, fame,
and worship, of our excellent art, and the company or brotherhod of the
same.

Unto this work also is added a brief Anatomy, necessary for all
Chirurgiens, and a table of the interpretation, as well of all manner of strange
words, as also of all manner of simples, by any occasion treated of in this
profitable work: By me collected, according to mine own experience and the
meaning of good authors, as well ye auncietes as the new writers.

The which thing, if it be well approved of you, it will be (as the goodness
thereof deserves) The better accepted and received of all others, the which
thing to see, wear to me for this my good will, a sufficient recompense. And
what profit or commodity, this work shall be, (being now set forth
vulgarly) to all estates of this realm, the excellecie thereof will shortly so
prove it by evident experience, that we need not for that cause here to waste
the time with words. Therefore that it may so come to pass, that our endeavours
in general, as well the masters as the rest of the company, may proceed as
it is begone, to the edificatio and building up of good science, to the
subuertion of all haters and abusers of the same: I shall not cease, not only
to pray to God for help therein, who is captain and author of al goodness:
but also with such poor weapon, as the forsaid captain hath lent me, I will
not cease while breath is in my body, to lay on with both hands till this
battle be won, our adversaries convinced and vanquished: which although as I
said before, they are x. to one, yet truth being our weapon, and good science
our armour, with our general the high author of them, we need not to doubt,
but that one shall be good enough for a thousand, not so strongly armed, but naked
men and bare of all knowledge.

And in the mean time, till we bring forth our mayne battle, let this worthy
Lanfranke skirmish with the, as I. Vigo other have done. And also let not us
be oblivious, in geuyng thanks to such, good men, as have in these things not
a little furthered our knowledges: as doctor Record, for his Vrinale of
physic, which he dedicated unto us: and also doctor Turner, who compiled
his english her^ale, as he affirms for our sakes* which most learned and
worthy work ought of us to be honourably esteemed: rather then as it hath been
of some most spitfully despised, for the fault of the lewd and negligent
prynters: wherewith they seem most shamlesly to charge the author* where as
according to his desire, they ought rather for their own profitable use to
amend the same* that by their good receiving and well using of it, he may be
animated, to finish al ye rest of that work, according to his former
intents: the which to do if he be discouraged by our ingratitude, how much
the common weal shall lack that commodity, let the wise and learned judge. I
trust I shall not need to bid you be thankful to master VVylliam
Cunningham doctor of physic, for his so many learned lectures which he red
unto you in our halle, to your great commodity, if the fault be not in your
selves: of the which to be partaker with you, my froward fortune and distance
of place (to my no small grief) would not suffer me. And besides these, diverse
other: which (to abreuiate the time) I pass over without the rehearsal of
their names, whose diligence of late hath been (as unto you at this day it is
not unknown) to profit the common weal: whose names therefore among us ought
thereby to flourish, and their fame never to die or decay. And then let us make
a general proclamation, that who so ever hath professed the noble art of
chirurgerie, and will fight against the despisers and abusers of the same: let
them come under the baner of good authors, now sent among them, by our
general the creator of medicine: arming them selves well with knowledge and
good science, and go forth to battle against these deceivers, and their
captain filthy lucre. And their wages shall be well paid them: namely good
fame and living in this life, and eternal life after this vale of misery.
The which he grant us all, that dearly hath redeemed us with his precious
blood, Amen.

W. CVNINGHAM DOCTOR in Phisique, unto the professors of Chirurgerie
salutations.
IT hath ever ben observed fro the first creation, that nature (by divine
providence) hath in all ages brought forth excellent, and heroical persons: to
the great comfort of posterity following. For as the Adamat naturally ceasith
not to attracte draw to it iron and steel: no more have these ceased, from
the invention of such things, as were needful to mans use. Which at the
first like as tender and small sedes (by times reuolutio) have grovvne to high
and mighty trees of small beginnings, by travels of noble and ingenious
persons, fro age to age, have sprog so many sundry sciences* arts, and
professios, as we see at this day. But for that in all times the number of
these have been most small, the multitude infinite of those that follow
ignorance: prouidet nature, being yet fruteful, hath brought forth in this old
feeble age of the world, as well as in times past, divine wits: by whose
labours, the treasures of science and knowledge, unto this present got,
should be preserved and defended from perishing, maugre the force of doultishe
ignorance, and cancard oblivion. Neither in my opinion are they less worthy
honour and praise, whose famous acts maintain, and cause freshly to floryshe
the precious monuments of forworne age: then the authors them selves. For as
we owe to the one the excellent invention: so are we debtors to the other, for
the diligent propagatio thereof to us their posterity. Neither are we more
beholden to Apollo, for the first invention of the nature and use of herbs:
then unto Hippocrates, who first separating phisique fro philosophie, made of
his elders traditions, and his own divine observations a noble art. And yet
doth Galen merit no less honour immortal fame then either of them. For he
hath largely uttered, that which Hippocrates did briefly set out: opening
plainly, that which was obscurely writ, adding that which seemed to want: and
commendinge their acts unto those that should succeed. what grateful minds we
are of duty constrained to show to those, that in this our age travel in
divinity, phisique mathematicalles, law, historiographie, poetry
Agriculture, and other profitable studies: not only the professors, but all
Christian public weals being tasters of the commodities (though I be silent)
can truly report. And omitting that herein might be said, I torn my pen
only to you, the worshipful brotherhode of Surgeons in London. what praise
and worthy fame, chiefly of you, and then of those which have need of
chirurgerie, Iohn Halle one of your fellowship have deserved: these his
labours do apparatly show. For where as for want of good authors in your own
native tongue, chirurgerie have not a little decayed: she is now again by his
painful travels not a little restored. And for as much as in all studies it
greatly doth profit to have first brief and compendious introductions: he
hath translated a short Isagoge of that noble Surgeon Lanfranke of Milla,
named Lanfranke his brief. In which, whether Lanfranke owes more to him for
the restoring of his decayed work, or he to Lanfranke, for the immortal fame
hereby obtained: I can not easily judge. But this I dare boldly affirm, that
Lanfranke before being corrupted, and of small use: is now by the labours of
my friend Iohn Halle, purged and made pure so that henceforth, I may rightly
call it Halles Lanfranke. In which is set out copendiously the curation of
wounds, tumores against nature (Lanfranke names them aposteme^) ulcers,
luxatios, fractures, and of certain griefs and diseases of the eyes, with a
chirurgicall antidotarie. But for because brief treatises want not obscurity,
especially to the younger students: Iohn Halle hath made an expositiue table,
setting plainly out as well the perfect natures of those simple medicines
mentioned of Lanfranke, as also of all the terms belonging to the art. And
where as the precepts of the art or approved medicines, can little profit the
body of man in all his parts not exactly known, he hath also added a
compendious Anatomy, in which thou may easily without great labour,
learn that is herein requisite: which book of al the rest, would not only be
first red, but also committed to memory. This good halle yet seizes not, nor
suffers his private gain to call him away: but with pity beholding decayed
surgery, to be daily defaced by a rabble of ronagates, hath made against them
an historical Expostulation: in which he shows the difference betwixt the
chirurgien, and the ronagate abuser. Al which his works, being set out to your
great increase in knowledge, requires not only present thakes: but a
perpetual memory to be made among you of him for ever. This author also hath
finished an other work inuaying against vice, and therefore named the court of
virtue: being now in the Printers hands. Taking these therefore his travels
in good part, he frely and gladly offers them to you, you shall both eschew
the suspicion of ungrateful Momus, and give him occasion to attempt greater
things, to your commodity and gain. Fare heartily well,

at my hows in Colmastrete, this.xviii. day of April. Anno, M.D.lxv.
Thomas Gale master in Chirurgerie, unto his well-beloved friend Iohn Halle,
sends greting.
FOr as much as translation is the mother of patefaction, and a virtue most
commendable of al me, because it vncouereth ignorace, and illustrateth the
knowledge of many notable matters unto the vulgar people: I thought it most
mete and expediet therefore, with some consolation to comfort you well-beloved
friend Halle, which peradventure being somewhat astonished and afraid of the common
peoples judgment, would detract that laudable and most worthy enterprise,
which you have finished: neither would according unto your vocatio and office
publish your travel, containing in it most profitable fruit, by ye which
the public wealth might be releued, and also your assigned office discharged.
I am certainly assured that you will object unto me, how that you shall suffer
the reprehensio of many, in alleging unto you, that you are worthy rather of
contumely and reproach then fame and renown, for your exercise and labour:
Because that every ladleper vagabond thereby shall be made an artist. I put the
case that many should inueye these allegations against you, will you therefore be
discouraged, neither wold you fearing their rude judgment, proffit your native
country? Let me never see such causes I beseech you (being of no force) move
you to faint: for if they allege any such thing against you (as you suppose)
it will at the length (as when it comes to the ears of the wise) redound
unto their own reproach. They can not for mere shame and impudency say, that
you in the publishing of your book, will make every private person an artiste:
specially when as herein they incur mendacitie and falsifiyng the truth,
then the which vice nothing can be more detestable and worthy of ignominy.
For the most part of men do know, (specially those which are wise and
discrete) that you have not taken upon you this translation into the vulgar
tongue to the end every man thereby might be made an artiste: (which thing
could not be brought to pass, if that you meant the desolation of the art:)
but that you do it only for this end and purpose, that the tyrons and diligent
students of the noble art, might have some knowledge to led them, as it wear
by a light, unto more perfection. Therefore if you mind the profit of your
country, let not such allegations dismay your enterprise, but publish it
with speed: For the sooner it appears, the sooner our brethren which are but
yet contending to obtain ye knowledge of chirurgerie our noble art, shall have
thereof profit utility. And though one of those ignorant Idiotes which seek not
to profit their country, but allege such cauilations as are before
mentioned, do contemn both it and you also, yet will a hundred other for one
of those, both contemn them in their bestial despite, and commend you in
your good indeuoures, which tends I doubt not to nothing else but the profit
of the common wealth. Furthermore in publishing of your book, you shall
purchase the favour and benevolence of many men, and specially of such as
travel in the knowledge of our art: also you shall be counted herein not only a
profitable member of the public wealth, but also a diligent imitator of your
predecessors which did translate out of other togues our famous art into their
own proper languages that to diligent students ye art might be made manifest.
Of this sort of men many I could resit, but for brevity I will name but one
or two: as for example, Galen that famous artist translated our art out of many
tongues, as the Scithian, Persian, Egyptian and other more, into his own
native tongue only, to the end that the studets might the more easily get ye
profit of the same. Auice also that excellent Arabian prince, having a like
regard unto his country, collected both out of Hippocrates and Galens works,
the effect of our art, and translated it into his mother tongue, that the
knowledge of it might remain unto his posterity. And doubt you not as these
men for their great pains taken of love to their country, in the furtherance
of this our art, have had and ever shall have memorial renown, but that you
intending none other shall obtain the same. Aspire therefore and take breath unto
you, let no vain and friuolus opinion ouercomme you, for I see no cause
wherefore you should ex^ruciate your self. Every wise man will accept your
endeavours, except those which neither mind their office, neither the
utility of ye public wealth: every good ma will embrase and with great
gladness revolve over your book as soon as it is published, and will at the first
sight of your good travel have you in more estimation then ever they had. And
why? because you set forth the most famous and excellent art of medicine: then
the which (as I suppose) there can be none more profitable, and specially unto
all men, as well emperors kings, as other men of lower estats: For though
other arts do profit and are most fit for a common wealth? yet for all that
the profit of this all men do know to be more vberius. For without it
pleasures were but painful, riches unprofitable, company annoyance, strength
febelnes, beauty lothsumnes, senses dispersed, and finally all things in the
world wear unpleasant. wherefore lest tediousness may take place in this my
writing unto you. I will here seas to trouble you any further: looking shortly
for the publishing of your works. Fare you well,

at my house in London, the.14. day of May. Anno. 1565.
To the loving Readers.
IF they which have illustrated,
The noble art of medicine,
Have had unto them ministered,
Both mortal praises and divine:
Then shall not Halle that frutfull tree,
Have like reward and grateful thanks,
(As those that have of such been free,)
which hath uncovered ignorance.
O Chirons let me never know,
such famous men as by their payne,
Have opened the buds that blovve,
vvante fame, their well deserved gain.
You know not what fertility,
Henceforth may unto you redound,
No what imps of chirurgeri
By him may spring within your ground.
Therefore be not in praises slow,
You chirons that by him may have,
In those your gardens knowledge grow,
whereby you may the grieved save.
For why by your encouragement,
This tree may more sweet blossoms bloom:
And where it hath you one out sent,
Sundry may spring and that right soon.
Consider what by courage grovves,
And what fruit to men it doth bring:
No hart (I think) can well suppose,
what gain always by it doth spring.
But seeing that your mind I see,
And also your intent and fact,
To encourage this odorous tree,
My pen here shall his race detract.
I. H. To the loving Readers greting in our eternal Lord, the author of all
knowledge.
AS oft as I consider, the diligent care of the quncient authors, to be
perfect and exquisite in their art, not only in their own handy work, while
they were living on this earth, but also to put the same in writing, to the
behove of all that should come after: I can not a little marvel at the
stubberne disdainful ignorance of many, in this our wretched age, wherein the
noble art of Chirurgerie is as it were fallen into ruin.

For where as in time paste there were few Chirurgiens, they very cunning,
learned, and exper^s whereby they were accepted as precious jewels or honourable
treasures of the common weal: There are now many, and the most part
ignorant, whereby they are found rather hurtful then profitable: yea very
caterpyllers to the public orders. So that in this case, the time present,
being compared with the time past, may be likened to such people as would
pluck down in a realm, a hundred castles or strong defensed fortes which
were made for the faulregarde of the country: and in stead thereof build a
thousand cotages, more like hogges^yes then houses. Were not this think you a
goodly change (...) a few number for the greater?

What was the cause that Lanfranke wrote so earnestly to his disciple, that he
should keep his work from the sight of ignorant^ and vnwyse people: But that
he feared that by such means a time migh^ come, that through the abusion of so
many insipient and such rustical professiors of that art, it would at the
last come to ruin and extreme decay: so that whatsoever therein was ordained
to the profit of men and their help in necessite, should now through such
beasts abusing the same, be the next way to perdition of life and members?

Did not Galen here as it were plainly prophecy in his time: which was about a
thousand.iii. hundred, and.lxxx. years past; (for he was famous, and floryshed
in this life, about the year of Christ.178. in the time of Marcus Aurelius
Antonius emperor of Rome.) For he plainly said, (when he wrote against
Thessains:) if physic were not vnitted, with other learnynges, that all manner
of vile ocupaciens, would leave their labour, and become phisitiens: Which is
come to pass at this day. Which doubtless hath chanced, not because the
medicinal art, may now better want those worthy points of learning then in
times paste it might: But rather it hath chanced, both through want of laws
for the prohibition of the same, and executios of them that are: and also (yea
chiefly) by the slothful negligence of the professors of the same. So that to
a number, they have been and are so worn out of mind, that howe profitable
(yea and what they are) it is unknown.

Ioannes Fernellius (a right learned writer) divides (as also others do) his
manner of instruction, (...)
(and that for the whole art of medicine) into three principal parts: namely
Physiologia. ^. de rerum naturis disputatio: that is a disputatio of the
natures of things comprehending the discriptions of the Anatomy, of the
elements, of the temperamentes, of the spirits and natural heate, of the
animal faculties, of the humores and natural functions, and of the sede and
procreation: (...)
pathologia, i. causarum symptoma tumque inquisitio: Which is the inquisition
of causes and accidents: consistinge of the descriptions of diseases of their
causes and accidents, and signs of the vrines, of fevers, c. Of all diseases
both exterior and interior: and Therapeutica, (...).
hoc est medendi ratio, that is the methode or way of curation: containing the
manner of purging, of phlebotomye, and all other ways of curations.

And as these.iij. are together (as most necessary parts of one body) so
jointly united, that neither the last can any thing profit without the first
and second, nor the first he perfect and vtile without the second and
third, c. So doubtless can the professor of neither part lack any portion
of them, without so great imperfection as is his lack.

What shall we then say of the like defect in any of the three instruments
of the curatiue part? (...)
namely Diatetice, Pharmaceutice, and Cheirurgiee: (...)
which have been and yet remain divided, into (as it wear) three destincted
and several arts, and they so far the one from the other, as though they
had never been together: as the common term of surgery is, (...)
it is a solution of continuitie: and is come to a necessity, Solution of
continuitie.
that diverse men must profess those diverse parts particularly, even so as
will lists to limit them: which bounds also they may not pass without
farther peril.

But howefarre the mind and opinion of Galen was from this, it is manifest.
For which of his books is not stuffed with manifold precepts belonging to
Chirurgerie? And chiefly his books entitled de Methodo medendi, de art
curatiua ad Glauconem, Though in dede it should seem by Cornelio Celso, that it
was not then among all the vsers of the same vndeuided: which began says he
about the times of Herophilus and Erasistratus. who in the beginning of his
seventh book calling Chirurgia the third part of medicine, says. Ea quidem
medicamenta atque victus rationem non omittit.

Scribonius Largus also in his book de compositionibus saith thus. Implicitas
medicinae parts, inter se ita connexas esse constat: vt nullo modo didu^i
(sine totius professionis detrimento) possint^ Ex eo intelligitur quod neque
chirurgia sine diaetetica, neque hac sine chirurgia (id est sine ea part quae
medicamentorum vtilium vsum habet) perfici possunt. Sed aliae ab alijs
adiuuantur, quasi consumantur, That is to say.

It is manifest that the entermedled parts of medicine are so connexed
together, that they can in no wise be separated, without the detrimente of the
whole medicinal profession. Whereby it is gathered that neither chirurgerie
without the dietetike part, nor this without chirurgerie, (that is without
that part that hath the use of profitable medicines) can be accomplished: But
one is helped and (as it were) finished by the other. These words also doth
Philiatros report.

But why should I rest here resiting many authorities about a matter so
evident? saying that to wise men it needs not, as to the folyshe it boots
not. But let the present time be judge therein, howe much hurt the same
causes. For the persons professing either of these parts are so in hate with
the other parts, that they think it a dishonour to be acquainted one with an
other: For as the said Philiatros says, the phisiciens or professors of the
dieterike part, abhor chirurgerie, as a thing to vile for their profession.
And they that are chirurgiens, estemynge their profession to be only one part
of physic, and that for the exterior parts of man body, regard not to
be learned. thinking that it is not needful to their art. And likewyse the
pharmaceutike part, trusting to the learning of the Phisiciens and
chirurgiens, think it no boot to be learned them selves: In so much that old
women must gather their herbs, unto whom they trust for the truth of
things, rather then to their own knowledge. And the Phisiciens having only
learning, trust to the Chirurgiens and Apothecaries for experience: and yet in
the mean season hatynge either of both, if they meddle in the dietetike part:
so that between trusting hating one an other, they are all void and destitute
of perfection.

But it can not be gathered that Galen, nor yet Hippocrates, which was before
Galen, about.640. years, for Hippocrates lived. from the time of Artaxerxes
Longimanus, unto Artaxerxes Ochus, that is to say, 104. years: in the which
season he healed king Perdicas of his disease. Which Perdicas reigned in
Macedonie eight years, which was before Galen his time.634. years. It can not I
say be found, that any of these two most excellent men did in their time
thus use physic, for it may be proved (as it is before plain enough) that
they played the Apothecaries, and as well made, as devised their own medi^ines,
and also used in their own persons chirurgeris or the handye work of
physic. For otherwise they could not have written such perfect books thereof?
neither would they have taken such peyne in any art, wherein they had not
much delyted: or the same greatly esteemed.

But our pernicious division hath as I lately said, brought all to confusion:
so that neither part is now used only of the expert professors thereof, but
rather of every smearer, that lists to abuse them. For as the phisiciens
think their learning sufficient, without practise or experience: so the
chirurgien for the most part having experience and practise, thinks it
vnnedefull to have any learning at all, which also hath bold^ed every ignorant,
rustical, ye and foolish woman, to think them selves sufficient to profess
and work, in so noble and worthy an art.

We find also by the testimony of Galen in lib. xiiii. de methodo medendi,
that Cheirurgia, hath principally.iii. operations: That is to say, (...)
to dissolve the thing contained, to knit or conjoin the thing separated, and
to separate and take away such things as are superfluous or unnatural. To
dissolve the thing contained, to as well done by evacuation of corrupted
humours, by profitable purgations and good diet: as by blood letting, which
the Greeks cell phlebotomian, (...)
and ventosynge, scarification, incisions, ^au^eries, opening of apostemes. c.
To knyt the thing separate, is as well done by stytchyng and convenient
byndinges, whereby the separate borders of wounds be joined together with
medicines incarnatiues, conglutinatiues, and cicatrizatiues: as also in
restoring of dislocations, and fractures: that is to say, displaced ioynetes
or broken bones. To take away superfluous things, is to mundifie unclean
sores, from their fylthy eschares or cores, superfluous and rotten flesh,
corrupted bones sliuers, arowheades, pellets, or any other unnatural thing:
And also, separatyng from the body, d^ade and mortified members whether they be
legs, feet, toes, arms, hands, fingers, wennes, wartes, or any other
vnprofytable, emineces, that either payne, annoy, or disfygure the body. Of
these also hath every indiscreet personage snached a piece, in such wise, that
they run about and through the country, and each coast of the same, like
peddlers, tynkers, ratte katchers, and very vacabundes, some only to set bones,
some to draw teeth, some to let blood, some to cut ruptures, and take out
stones: but all this, rather (under such colour) to maynteyne an Idle and
theuyshe life, then to profit the common weal, to the great vprobrie of all
the whole profession of medicine.

If (as the learned interpret) this word chirurgia, doth signify a medicinal
operation or working with the hand, which is to be done upon the most excellent
of living creatures, man his body, yea in his tender flesh, among his sensible
sinews, lively ar^eties, and delicate veins: how vnmete is it, that every
vncunnyng vnexercised creature, shall be suffered (be they never so vnmete) to
occupy so excellent an art, playing as it were the merchant venterers, not for
gain or loss of goods and riches, but for life and death, upon the body of
man.

If as (Guido saith) the first point of a Chirurgien is to be learned: how
happens it then, that every ignorant vnlerned ass, yea very enemies to all
learning and knowledge, be suffered to work, yea and prove the strange maistries
of their fond fantasies, upon the body of man.

If (as Auen^oar witnesses) a Chirurgien ought to be expert, to have scene
other masters work, before he venture or enterprise ^o work him self, and that
he must first learn and know, then after to work and use experience: how is it
then, that all men and women, without either lernyng or experience, or any
kind of knowledge: yea only standing in their own conceit, may work and
practise what they will, and that without interruption or punyshment for their
abusion, upon the body of man?

If as (Haly affirms) a chirurgien ought to be a man of good discretion, and
no fool nor vnwyttie, nor of rude understanding: but of good memory, good
judgment, and good diligence: why is every rude rustic, braynsick beast, fond
fool, indiscreet idiot, yea every bedle^ bawd, and scolding drab,
suffered thus (without all order) to abuse this worthy art upon the body of
man?

What avails the goodly orders, taken by our forefathers and ancient
authors, that none should be admitted to the art of surgery, that are
miscreate or deformed of body: Properties of a Chirurgien
as goggle or skwynte eyed, vnperfecte of sight, vnhelthy of body, imperfect of
mind, not hole in his members, boisterous fingers or shaking hands. But
contrarywyse, that all that should be admytted to that art, should be of
clear and perfect sight, well formed in person, hole of mind and of members,
sclender and tender fingered, having a soft and steadfast hand: or as the
common sentence is, a chirurgien should have three divers properties in his
person. That is to say, a heart as the heart of a lyo, his eyes like the eyes
of an hawke, and his hands as the hands of a woman? What avails this order
I say, sith the contrary in all points is put daily in use, and that almost
without hope of redress?

Saying also, that those ancient authors had not only his regard to the form
of the body, but also and as well to the bewere or ornament of the mind,
honest conversation of him that should be admitted to surgery, Condicios of
a Chirurgien
as are these: He ought to be well manered, of good audacity and bold where he
may work surely, and contrariwyse, doubtful and fearful, in things that be
dangerous and desperate.

He must be gentle to his pacients, wit^y in prognosticatios and forseyng of
dangers, apt and reasonable to answer disolue all doubts and questions
belonging to his work. He must also be chaste, sober, meke, and merciful, no
extorcioner, but so to accomplish his reward at the hands of the rich, to
maintain his science and necessary lyuynges, that he may help the poor for
the only sake of God: what means it I say (these things considered) that so
many sheep heads, vnwytty, unlearned, unchaste, ribaudes, lecheours,
fornicators, dronkardes, belygoddes, beastly gluttons, wrathful, envious, and
euell manered, shall thus miserably be suffered to abuse so noble an art? yea
that they shall also be maintained, (in despyghte of those that are men of
science indeed,) preferred to lyuinges for that profession, contrary to the
ordinances and laws of a city, being a carpenter, a cobbler, or a corier of
leather, or whatsoever he be: The wyttye, the learned, the man of knowledge, the
citizen, and the free man, in the mean season wanting preferrement and living?

Well, I beseech god that there may be some occasion give, to procure a
redress, yt none may work without knowledge joined to experience: which no
doubt were the way to have perfect men in this art: where as now it is not
like that ever there shall be many. For who will set his son to school with
cost and great charge, and then put him to such an art wherein is neither
gain nor hope of preferment? And is not this a wondrous case, that the art of
medicine is so free for all men to use that will: That the very rustians, and
common barators do use the same as a common shift, whereby to obtain their
wicked purposes with the less suspicion? Under which colour they also ^ary in
towns and cities, having their filthy company resorting unto them, without
danger of the laws: so that this noble art is become (for lack of order) a
covert unto all filthynes and vyc^ as well theft and murder, as also most
fylthy whoredom. To all other wicked persons also, which despising all laws
and order, do under the pretence of this professio, flete flee from town to
town, from shere to shere. Through the which there are such filthy vices
maintained, and enormities suffered, as no honest ear would gladly here it:
And therefore I blush to remember it, and shame to write it. Which euels
could never have been done under that covert, i^ none but the learned and
expert might have wrought, and they also admitted by the bishop: as it hath in
times paste been holsom^lye ordained in this Realm. Which law, if every
bishop would witsaue to execute in his dioces: there should (I believe) be a
greater quietness in the common weal then there is.

But if by this li^tle any man might be stirred with zele, to procure a
redress in these things, truly I should reckon my self among the number of
them that are happy. Alas there are goodly orders taken, and profitable laws
made, for making of clothe, tannyng of leather. making of shoes many other
external things: The abuse whereof is but a dearth or disprofite of the purse:
and shall there not be a redress had for the true use of a science, whereupon
depends the health of mans body? without which, what is mans life but a very
misery or wretched werines? The abuse of which science is not only a
disprofite to the purse, but of a far greater charge: That is to say, the
loss of health and life.

I wish therefore, in gods behalf, that a staye may be had in these things,
as well as in other, yet not except man his life health excells all other
earthly commodities: And as man his life excedeth in vain all other possessions
of this world: that there might likewyse be the more care and diligence for
the preservation thereof, then for any other thing. For although chirurgiens
from henceforth, teach their science to none but to such as be learned: yet
if all that will may use it without exception, though they were never traded up
in the practyse of the same, there shall remain styll a great disorder.

I am not ignorant, that some men will think, that this book (being
published) will be an occasion for such men to be the bolder to abuse the same
science. But I know and am sure, that they shall not learn in this book any
thing wherewith to hurt: neither have I published the same for them. And
farther if any abuser of surgery read this book, he shall (I trust) so find
himself rubbed on the gall, that he shall be moved (if he have any shame) to
leave his vice, rather then more to use it. But what needed we to doubt to set
worth all science in englyshe, if by the laws (as is aforesaid) none might use
the same, but such as (being expert) are first approved, and then laufully
admitted?

Let all young men therefore, that profess or intende to learn this worthy art,
first learn perfectly their anatomy, then the natures and complexions of their
patients, and then the propreties of their medicines: which they shall never
do, unless they study consequentely to know the virtues and temperamentes of
symples: as herbs, seeds, roots, gummes, trees, fruits, veins of the
earth, stones, metals, beasts, fyshes, and fowls: of which are made the
medicines, wherewith the Chirurgien must work. This is the true way to be a
perfect chirurgien, and otherwise not to be atteined, as Lanfranke him self
the author of this book, (as thou shalt rede) affirms: who flourished.268.
years paste, in the time of Edward the first king of England, and Philyp the
fair reigned then in France.

I wish therefore, that this book and such like, should be red of al estates,
that they may understand how this laudable science is builded upon reason, and
how far from the trade of true science, these abhorfull abusers be: which
take upon them to work in Surgery, by thee only reading of a book or
books, not being traded up in the true practise and experience thereof. For as
good doctor Record in the Preface to his urinal of Phisyke saith, what is
learning vnlerned? or knowledge unknown? any thing else but a vayn name?
learning then increases most (saith he) when it is studied of most: and
learning then triumphs most, when it hath most favourers and folowers: and
then doth ignorance (learnings enemy) rejoice most, when learning reygneth in
fewest, and blyndnes rules most: so that then is lernyng most profaned,
contemned and hated, when she hath most enemies: That is to say, when most men
are ignorant. For that old saying shall always be true, learning hath none
enemy but the ignorant.

O that this worthy sentence were so weighed and followed, that the Chirurgiens
should not work upon any part of man his body, unless they can by reason
prove and certify their patients, that such kind of working is behooveful
for their health. For he that hath none other reason, but thus have I done, or
this or thus have I scene my master work, is not worthy to work upon the body
of ma. But if it were come to this isue, that all men so knew the reason of
this art, that they would suffer none to minister to their diseases, but such
as could prove their work to be good, by reason and true order of science,
these hateful abusers could no longer have place.

This notable brief work of Lanfranke may satisfy those curious katchers,
that find fault with Vigo, for his great copositonis (which they call
superfluous) and ample doctrine (which they term tediousness.) For here have
they a brief doctrine of right good effect, and small compositions of
sufficient virtues. Which he wrote unto his friend, as an introductio to a greater
work: and that performed he afterward in effect, in the year of Christ.1296.
Which also may be an ensample to all masters unto their disciples, yt in
these days use this art, specially to such as rather hyde their science from
their seruates (because perhaps their own store is not great) then teach them
truly. There be to few examples of english chirurgiens that have written books
to instruct their disciples: Though these days (gods holy name be glorified
therefore) may thereof less complain then many years past. I must needs therefore
counsel all yonge me (since now they have so good helps) to be diligent to
learn, and not to spare the very stealing of cunning: that is to say that
they will be so vigilant as to obtain it, although it be hidden from them.

For truly there are many, that take servants and apprentises, not for to
teach them science, but only to be their drudge, and to do their toil and
labore: which is the cause, that so many come out of their years so ignorant.
For their intent is to have servants to do the toil in their house, and not
to make them cunning men: yea and some will refuse a yonge man that is learned,
and apt to understand to have an ignorant slave, to bear the water tankard,
s^owre pa^ed such a one (as the common proverb is) that will never do man of
science harm unless he steal away his dinner.

And yet will such a one brag and boast, at seven years end, as though he
had all the learning and cunning under the son, although in very dede, the
most knowledge that he hath is, to poule, or sh^ue, draw a tooth, or dress a
broken pate. Alas is not this a great pytye, that such a noble art shall thus
be abused every way, through the filthy lucre avaricious minds of men? Is it
not a shame to use such roberie? do ye not steal like robers the service of
your apprentyses, when contrary to your covenants, ye hyde your science from
your servants, to whom ye are bound: to teach it? and yet (in the mean
season) receive the labour of their bodies, more like slanes then men? beside
the great dishonour that thereby you do to your own profession, God grant that
I may see this amended, as I trust I shall.

In the mean season my counsel shall be, that all yonge men b^ynge servants
spare to take no kind of payne, so that science may be that way atayned. But
have a good regard that ye have your (...) for your penny: that is to say, that
ye may learn cunning for your ^auel: when time conveniently serves look
study in good (...) of the which let this Lanfranke be one. Wherein ye may
learn in a small time, in other long time to be sought and not found: for
(...) for my part I must confess, that in so few words I never read so (...)
perfect science contained, as is in this pleasant copendious work. (...) for as
much as I know, that diverse yonge men have need of (...) commodities as well
as my self, I thought it a dede more com^dable, to set it forth to a public
profit, then to keep it ^ own private commodity. Wherein what soever I ^ounde
^ ^atin copy, being yet any thing helpful to the same, I have put in a
smaller letter.

But one thing yet I must warn all young men of, that will profit in such
study as I have instructed, which is in one point to refrain and descent
from the most part of young men: that is to say, from games and spending the
time in play: for in my fantasy, who so ever is adicte to play games shall
never profit in this art. For thou shalt find it time little enough for thy
study, if thou occupy all thy leysour from thy masters or thine own business
at thy book, that as thou workest or see thy master work: so thou may
therewith understand the reason how, and howe much such work is profytable.

And hereof assure thy self, that if thou have not as great desire to thy
book, as the greatest gamner hath to his game, thou shalt never worthily be
called cunning in this art. For thou must think and esteem all time of leisure
from thy work and busynes, even lost and evil bestowed, in which thou hast
not profyted somewhat at thy book. Let thy book therefore, I say, be thy pastime
and game which (if thou love it as thou ought) will so delight thee, that
thou shalt think no time so well bestowed as at it. Yea thou must desire it
as the child doth his mothers pap: and so will it nourish thee, that thou
shalt worthily grow and increace to a worshipful fame of cunning and
learning.

And now whatsoever unto this work is added by me, as the Expositiue Table,
and the natomie: I most hartyly desire al the good Readers to interpret it to
the best, regarding the good will of the worker, rather then thexcellency of
the work, which I confess to be very faint: trusting that all such as in
those things are my masters and betters, will rather seek the redress and
amedement of such things as to them shall seem faulty, then disdaynfully to
reprehend my good will, in setting forth of this work. But as I fear it not
in any godly or charitable personage: so am I past care, what be said of such
disdayners as speak euel of the doings of all men, and yet will do nothing
that good is them selves. Not considering that a humane creature is not borne
into this world, only to profit himself, but much rather to gratify his
friends and country (as Cicero saith) besides Christian charity, which
binds us to profit all men. And our saviour Christ warns us, that no man
hyde his talent. Thus (wyshyng to the gentle readers their hearts desire, that
travail for the perfectness of this art, even as unto my self in my most
weighty affairs:) I end this my simple Preface.

Unto his faithful friend and disciple Bernard: Lanfranke of Milayne, wishes
increase of wisdom, and cunning.
I VVYLL thee to understand, my dere and loving friend, that (through the grace
of God, the author of all goodness: I purpose to make a book here after,
wherein I will give to thee an ample and large doctrine, sufficyente for thy
fulle instruction, in the most excellent Art of Surgery.

For in this present little work: I intend to give thee but few things and
light, but true proved, the which allbeit that they be short, yet are they of
great commodity and profit.

Set them not at nought: but dispose thy self, fully to trust in them: for
principally, according to thy purpose, I have written proved medicines, with
the manner of curing wounds, Apostemes, Ulcers, and Fistules, with a little of
Algebra, and some curations for the eyes, after the manner, as reason taught me
to work, and by experiment of a lunge time, has been by me roborate and
strengthened.

Trusting so much to the subtilty of thine intellection, that by thy wit,
with these few things, thou shalt gather sufficient understanding, to
comprehend the knowledge of a greater work, and that thou shalt thereby obtain
the name of a great and renowned Chirurgien.

Wherefore as thou fear and love GOD, and as thou tenderest thine own
worship and honesty: I require thee that thou deliver it, to no rustical
Fools or Idiotes, least by the ignorance of such, and by their rude and
vncunninge ministration, this my work (made for thy love, to a common
vtilitye:) might redownde to some personnes hurt or annoyance.

The first part of this work, treating of wounds, contains.ix. Chapiters
Of the Intention of a Chirurgien in general.
The first Chapiter.
AMONG AL OTHER things, it is expediet that a good Chirurgien in every work,
determine a certain Intention in generalle, Intention of a Chirurgien
namelye in wounds, whereof we intend first to treat, then to use such things,
as may conveniently help him to his Intent.

First therefore in wounds to be healed, Consolidatio
the Intention is a true Consolidation or knitting together, which only is
done in a simple wound made in the flesh. For other Consimilare members, (as
bones, sinews, gristles, pannicles, the skin) be not restored by true
Restoration or consolidation. Spermatike members.
For the first matter of them was Sperm in the parents, and therefore are
called Spermatike.

Howe be it, when solution of continuitye cha^uceth in such members: there is
a certain mean, where by the void place of that which is lost is filled
again: yet there are diverse opinions among men, For some say, that Nerues
veins, and Arteries, receive true Consolidation, some say nay, they be
otherwise restored: But certainly I say if the cuttings or departinges be
great, they are never restored by true Consolidation: though sometimes in
small wounds they are, yet that very seldom.

Notwythstandinge, Flesh a sanguine member
the flesh whereof the first matter is blood, and is therefore called Sanguine,
is every day generate, or made in the body; thereof receives very
restoration. Wherefore, in every wound made in the flesh, let thine intent
always be to consolidate it, except any of these vii. things following, be there
unto a let or hinderance. The first is, Seven things hinderig cosolidation.
if there be any Puncture in the sinews, the second if the wound extend to the
bone, the third if with the would be any Aposteme. The fourth if there be any
euel distemperaunce. The fifth is, Pyscrasia.
if there be any holownesse in the wound The sixth if the wound be made with
contution. The seventh, is if the wound be made with any vememous beast for any
of these, of necessity leads the Chirurgien to an other intention. As I will
hereafter express, beginning first at a simple wound, that wateth all the.vii.
things aforesaid.

Of a Simple wound. Cap ii.
BE therefore in assurance, whether ye wound be made with the point of any
instrument, whether it be knife, spear, or arowe, or any other like. For they
of all other are soonest conjoined, if it touche no Sinew, Chord, Panicle, nor
the Muscles yt cover the bone, (which thou may know, by that it is without
all payne and ache,) It shall be sufficient, that thou only put in a tent,
enfused in Oil of Roses warm, which necessarily shall for one day hold the
skin open: make the patient rest from all manner of exercise of the wounded
member. And then if it be without al ache and swelling: thou maiste suffer the
wound to close. Provided always, that the patient rest.ii. or.iii. days, and
he shallbe whole: but if there in be any aching or pain, it is a sign of ye
hurt of a Sinew, Muscle, Panicle, or Chord. And then it shall be convenient,
to iniunde or pour into the whole wound, oil of Roses what, make a tent,
not to great nor to loge, and yt it be such as constreigne not the sinew,
least that there by pain should be induced, and dip the same in Oil of
Roses, and the yolke of an egg warmed, laying there on a Repercussiue of ye
same medicine, and annoynte the member all about, with a medicine made, ex Olei
Rosati Vncia Una, aceti Vnciis. ii. Boli armoni Vnciae dimidio, use this until
the pain be slaked, that the wound yield Saniem, Sanies.
for then it is sure from Apostemation and Spasme. After that put in a dry tent
of lint, made of soft linne cloth, and upon that a mundificatiue, made after
ye ordinance hereafter following. A mundificatiue.
Rec. Mellis Rosacei colati Vncias tres, farine Hordei subtilissimae unci^. i.
Terebinthinae lotae Vnciae semisse. Boil them a little together to the
perfectness of an emplaster: and note that the Terebinthine ought not to be
boiled with the reast, but should be added in the end of the boiling, so at
the end he shall be healed. But if the pain cease not, by the infusion of the
Oil of Roses, defence of Bole Armeniacke before said. Then let the patient
blood (if he be strong,) on the contrary side, but if he be weak, make
scarification, or box him, daily provoking the duty of the womb by a
Clyster or suppository if need require, enjoining him a straight and sclender
diet, till the pain of the aposteme and the inflammation be assuaged, and
annoynt it al about with the ointment made, de Bolo armeno, Oleo Rosato, aceto
continuing still as I have taught. Provided always that for inflammation of the
pricking of a sinew, ye administer there to, no manner of plaster, made of
herbs and grease, nor Maturatiues, and for the ache of the meber, see that
thou suffer no hot water to touche ye same: for all these are causes of
putrefaction and perdition, which is desolation and loss of the member.

Of wounds cut after the length of the members. Chap. iii.
ANd if the wound be made with a swore, or any other cutting thing after the
length, and being so small yt only a roll a bolster, may hold together the
parts conjoined: It shall suffice, yt you bind the parts together, laying
there upon a bowlster, or pressure of tow wet in the white of an egg, bind it
with convenient bonds, so shalt thou need no other medicine. But if it be so
great, The manner of stitchynge wounds.
that binding only suffyceth not: then stytch the wound with a square nedle,
and an even thread wexed. And always let the stitches be odd, if it be
possible, beginning first at the one end of the wound, then at the other end,
after that in the midst: Then on each side of the middle stytch, make as many
mo as shall be tredeful observing that between each stitch be left the space of
an vnche, Or as we say an inch consisting amesure of three barlye corns in
length for so is vncia here taken as you se, and not the Geometrical vnch being
as some write, a mesure of three finger thick.
that is the breadth of the little finger, or the middle finger, leaving in the
inferior or dependant part of the wound, an open Orifice, wherein thou may
put a tent, by the which the wound may be expurged. And upon the seam, lay
powder made, de Una part thuris, duabus partibus Sanguinis Draconis, tribus
partibus calcis Vi^ae, and sometime Calx Viva alone shall serve your need.
Upon the powder lay a fine clothe, dipped in the white of an Egg, bindinge
it with convenient ligature, and boulsters, that the seam may be conserved.
And so let it be anointed, and changed, that finallye it may be
consolidate. But if in this time, the wound be altered by the aer, and do
give Saniem, the stitches also losing their hold: then mundifye it with a
medicine, made ex Una part farine Tritici, Mellis partibus.ii. Aqua
partibus.iii. boiled together in form of a Cataplasma, in the end lay upon
the wound stupes of tow, wet in warm Wine.

Of the wounds of synewes, cut for the most part overthwart the member.
Cha. iiii.
IF the Sinews of the arm, Wounds made after ye bredthe.
hand, or foot, or any other like member be cut ouerthwarte, (all be it yt
Theodoricus diverse others say the contrary): Theodoricus.
yet I say that it is good and profitable, to stitch the sinews with a
needle, when thou sowest the borders or lips of the wound, taking such
hold of the heads or ends of the sinews that be cut, that thou may
justly draw them together. The manner of stytchynge sinews together.
And upon such manner of stitchinge of the Sinews, put Olium Rosarum,
wherein has been sodden Vermes terrectres proprie lumbrici dicti, and
conserve the stitchinge, as well to consounde the Sinews, as the outward
borders or lips of the wound. For by this manner of stitchinge, is made the
more noble Consolidation, and perfecter reparation, so that sometime, and
especially in the bodies of children, by such manner of stitchinge, the mouinge
of the member is recovered, to the which, the Sinews that were cut did
serve, which never could have been restored, unless the sinew had been
stitched, and have no fear of any ache or payne, that is said to come by the
pricking of the sinew in the stitching with the needle, for that is aswaged,
and immediately helped with the aforesaid Oil, nor the pain hereof can
induce no Spasme, for so much as the whole sinew was all ready cut a
sunder.

Annotations Upon this present chapter.
Co^er^inge the stitchinge of sinews: mentioned here in this Chapiter by the
author, I wish no man to stay there on, as an infallible ground, for it
seems much against reason, and the judgement of most learned men.
Notwithstanding many things are tolerable in yonge children, that may not
be done to old men: and other reasons may be made, as we^e to defend this
opinion, as the contrary. But hereafter if God send leisure, thou shalt have
farther instruction in this, and other like matters. In the mean season have
this good opinion of Lanfranke, yt the lucky success, of some profes made in
that case, caused him so to write, for we may not judge that such learned men
would publish, (to the disgrace of all their whole work,) that which they
thought not perfectly true.

issuing from a vein or artery, do let thee in observing this ordinance,
thou may restreigne it thus. Rec. thuris parts du^s aloes part Vnam, and
make it into poulder, and meddle all together, cum albumine oui, to the
thickness of honey, pilos leporis, cut as small as may be possible, and so
temper all together, and put thy finger in the place from whence the blood
issues, and touche the pulse, holding it so the space of an hour,
administering thy medicine in great quantity, and in the time of chaunginge,
have good foresight, that thou take it not away by violence. But if it clean
fast to the place, lay on more of the said medicine in a more liquid form,
upon the old medicine, till it fall fro the wound alone without violence,
then shall the veins and arteries be knit and healed, and to this medicine
there is none like in restreigning of blood, knitting the vein.

Of wounds, with breaking of the bone within the Flesh. Cap. Vi.
VUhen with a wound in the Flesh, there is also a wound in ye bone, it
behooves not to heal ye woude of the flesh, Restauratio.
before the Restoration of the bone, I say Restoration, because the bone is
never consounded with a true Consolidation: but in stead thereof, grows a
hard Callouse substance of flesh, called Porus Sarcoides, or Caro Poroides,
Porus Sarcodes.
serving in place of ye bone lacking, which reparation must be looked for,
before the wound in the flesh be healed, Caro poroides
for otherwise there may be no rep^ration, because the moistness of the flesh
will let it. For so much as there can be no reparation, unless the place be
dried to the vttermooste: For the bones are most dry, and the nourishment of
bones, is the matter reparinge them, which is naturally dry: for to nurishe
is none other thing, but to assimulate nurishmente with that which is
nurished. Nutrition.
Wherefore Nutrition is done by the like, as Diminution Diminution.
is done by the contrary.

And now for as much as of all wounds of bones, those of the head are most
perilous: I think it most meet to begin first with them, for if the wound
in the head where cranion or the brain pan is broken, should be healed in
the flesh before the bones be repared, it would surely cause death: both by
reason of ye brains Dilicasie, and nobleness, and also that worse accidents
follow thereof, then of the breaking of any other bone.

Of the wound in the head, with breaking of Cranion. Chapi. Vii.
VUhen the wound is made in the head with breaking of the Sculle: Wounds in
the head.
consider whether it be broken unto the inward parts or no, that is to say to
duram matrem* which thou maiste know by diverse means and ways, partly by
perseverance, and partly by infallible experiments, Signs of brekynge of the
sculle.
the signs be these. The feeling of great pain, vomiting, tears of the
eyes, crokednesse of the sight, inflammation or rowlinge of the eyes. c. the
experiments are these: take a strong thread double twisted, Experiment^
and wereit, and let the patient hold it strongly in his teethe, and begin
thou at the mouth of him, and with thy nailes stretch and streigne out the
thread, till thou come at the other end of the same, holding it straight a
cubit length from the teeth, and make a sound upon the thread with thy
nail, and do so often times. If the patient may sustain the sound,
without feelynge of peine, then is not the sculle broken to the Dura matter.
for if it be broken, he may in no wise sustain nor suffer the harping of the
nails upon the thread, or else thou may also take and smite his head, with a
small dry wand of wylowe or of ye Pine tree, hold thine ear to his head. And
if the sculle be whole, But because neither this, nor the former way is always
certain, the best is to lern also other men's ways, that when we know all, we
may chose and use the best,
it will make an hole sound: but if it be cut or broken, it will make a
dumme noise, after the comparison of a broken Bell and a whole. And have no
trust in the well eating drinking, sleeping, going to the stool of yt
patient ( such like: of the which both Roladus Rogerus do speak, for they
are deceyuable. But soetime it is evident enough to perceive ye breaking of
the sculle, by the only sight, or touching of the same. Therefore when thou
art certain that the sculle is broken, mark if the wound in the skin be
less then the fracture of the sculle. If it be, make it wyder, if thou se no
token of death. But if thou se any token of death, it wear not good to
enterprise any new thing. And when this woude is enlarged, uncover as behooves)
al ye breach of the sculle, and mark whether the broken part be entered under
the whole bone: or if there be any broken pieces or shivers, which might
prycke or hurt the Dura matter: for in these two cases thou must remove the
part of the bone vnderputte by the breach, and with instruments convenient
utterly take away the little broken pieces: which thing to do follow this
ordinance. Mark where the under part joins with the sculle, for there it
will be somewhat deted, and sometime the whole circumference or cumpasse
about, will be depressed or put down. Then for a day or two pour in to
all the broken sculle Oil of Roses warm: and in the wound above the sculle*
lay small Plegetes of ^we, or little pieces of old clothe, infused in Oil of
Roses, and the yolke of an egg whotte. In the second or third day; labour
gently with Instruments to remove the bone: removing all that is to be
removed, by most tender, and delicate workinge: that thou touche not Duram
matrem, or the beginning of any sinew. And remove in like manner; the little
shiver that grieves the Du^ matter, if there be (...).

When the bone is taken away, loke that thou have a fine linen cloth, wet in
Mellis Rosati colati, part Una, Ole^ Rosati, partibibus duabus warmed:
conueyinge it very tenderly and warily, between the bone and duram matre. and
fylle all the wound of the sculle tederlye with such clothes wet in the same
manner. And in the wound of the flesh lay tow or ly^te, wet in Oleo Rosato,
cum Vitellooui admisto: and after that have a subtle Plegete made of Tow, that
may comprehend all the wound of the skin, wet in the same medicine. And
last of all lay on great boulsters or pressures of tow, wet in the somer
time in cold water, and in the winter in wh^tte water, and well wrong, and
spread over with the medicine made ex Olei Rosati Vnciis duabus, aceti Vnciae
dimidio, Boli Armeni Vncia Una, the which boulsters lay over all.

Provided that the head be shaven before, and so do still continually, till
the wound show abundant quiture. And then begin to put upon Duram matrem,
of the most subtille poulder of Licence that may pass through a cearse: and
upon that po^lder a fine cloth, wet in Mell Rosato, and Oil of Roses whote:
and dress the clothe even and smothe, and fille all the wound in the bone
there with: fyllinge also the wound of the skin with dry linte, so fulle, that
thou suffer not the flesh in ye wound to cover the bone, until the
reparation of the fracture be made. And upon the woundeof the skyn, lay the
mundificatiue above said of Mel Rosarum and Barlye flower, so much as may
fylle the wound, and the bredthe of thy finger round about the same: and
evermore about the same a defesiue de Bolo Armeno, and in the end administer a
consolidative, or a cicatrizative, the which I will describe in the end of
this worcke.

And in all other cracks and breaking of the sculle, whereas be none of the
causes above said, it shall suffyce thee to adminyster to the broken bone, a
sovereign medicine of Mel Rosarum, and Oil of Roses warmed: and fill all the
wound of the skin, with Oil of Roses hot, and the yolke of an egg, till
quitture be engendered: and then upon the wound, and about the same, a
defensive of Bole Armeniake, and when thou haste made matter, lay on the scull a
fine clothe wet in thy Mel Rosarum and Oil of Roses, and fill the wound of
the skyn with dry linte, and upon the wound, a mundificatiue of Mel Rosarum,
and barlye meal, and about the same a defensative of Bole Armeniake, and thus
do till it be perfectly cured and healed.

Of the governance of all wounds, without breaking of Cranion, whether they
be Apostemate, Dyscrasiate, Concouate, or made by contution. Cha. viij.
THe governance of all other wounds, without breaking of cal^la may be
done by stitchinge, and poulder made of calx Viva, as it is said in the third
Chapiter. and ye must not use Mell Rosarum strained with oil of Roses, but
only Oil of Roses and the yolke of an egg, Sanies.
till Sanies or quitture be dulye engendered: and after that use a
mundificatiue of Honey, of Roses, and barley flower, and a defensative of Bole
Armeny about the wound, A defensive.
for truly a defensive of Bole Armeny, is excedinge profitable in all wounds
of the body, to prevent and eschew Apostemations. For nothing is more
profitable to the patient, nor more to the worship of the Chirurgien, then to
keep the wounded members from swelling and Apostemation. c. for an Aposteme
coming upon the wound of the head, is cause of alienation and of death.
And if it happen unto some sinewy member, it causes the Spasme of repletion,
mortification, or corruption of the meber, and of death. And the way to
prevent or eschew such Apostemations, stands in good diet and governance
of life. Wherefore in this place I will set a diet, as a common doctrine for all
wounded persons, both in the head and Sinewys members.

First, A general diet for wouds
let this be as a special diet, the croomes of bread washed in winter.v.
times in warm water, and after the last washinge, put thereon white sugar
Roset, and in the Summer, let it be washed only in cold water: and now and
then make the potage with barlye, but let the Barlye first be soked, and after
beaten and hulled, then sodden, and seasoned with Penidies, or Sugar Roset, or
with Almonde milk, in all manner of wounds save only of the head. Almondes
to be refused in wounds of the head.
Wherein I approve not Almondes, for they have a manner of fumous property,
noisome to the head, and if the patient be very weak, or have naturally a
feeble stomach, he may take small chickens sauced with Agresta, and the flesh
of a yonge Kid, the fete of Hogs, all seasoned with Agresta, or with wine
of sour Pomegranates, and let their drink be wine of Pomegranates: and
especially for men wooded in ye head, and sinewye members, geuinge.x. parts of
water with one part of wine, I think Sirupus de Agresta, is here to be
vnderstaded.
or Agresta with clear cold water, and one part of wine. Or this excellent
drink folowinge, which comfort the stomach, and defends the vapours to
assende, it quenches heate, and makes not costive: Rec. Hordeimundi, Vncias
duas, micarum panis, Sacchari Rosati, Granoriam Granatorum, Singulorum, Vncia
Vnam, Primoru siccorum, numero december. Let all these sethe in.x. pound of
water, till half he consumed, and then cleanse it, and keep it in a vessel of
glass, and let it be administered cold. And let nothing be given
actuallye hot, but if the patient be yonge and Sanguine, and have bled but
little at his wound, Phle^otomye for the wounded.
if also be he strong, let him blood on the contrary side, but if he be feeble,
let him be ven^osed. And see that every day once, the duty of the belly
be provoked, by a suppositarye if need be, as when it comes not of it self
naturally. For these things aforesaid, with a defensive of Bole Armeniacke,
defends the wounded member from receauynge of superfluites. For when every
course of humores is ceased, then art thou sure that there shall none Aposteme
come upon thee.

And after this by little and little, and not suddenly, permit thy patyente to
a larger diet, and also to the use of wine, Wine to be eschewed in wounds of
the head.
save only to men wounded in the head, or in the synewye members: and unto
those give no license to drink wine, except for necessity of faintness of
the stomach, or lake of strength. And then let it be lyghte wine, sour,
well watered. For there is nothing that doth so much damage unto the head,
and sinews as doth wine. And therefore in those manner of woudes it is not
good to grant drincking of wine, but only at the end of the cure. And when
a wound chances in other bones, those bones broken: thou shalt heal them
after the cure of Algebra: the which thou shalt read in a partycular
Chapiter of the same.

But if the wound be apostemate, either for that the Chirurgien knew not how
to defend it, Of wounds apostemate.
or that because the tent is to great, or the vnguente put in extreamelye
whotte, or by alteration of the aer, or debility of the member receauinge: for
surely if it chance, notwythstadinge the necessary application of due
remedies: it is the a very evell sign. Namely that the hurt member is
greatly weakened. Nevertheless if such an aposteme be done in a nervous
member, the cure thereof is al ready ta^ghte. But if it be in a fleshye
member, make a Cataplasma, de quatuor partibus Aquae, Una part Ol^i Oliuarum
maturarum, farinae triticeae, partibus duabus. and lay it upon the aposteme
made with the wound, applying it so lunge, till the swelling and payne be
gone, and that the wound caste out matter abundantly. And then lay thereto
a mundificatiue of honey, meal, and water, till it be perfectly modified. For
a wound where in there is an aposteme, neither can nor ought to be
consolidate* for all consolidatiues are there unto hurtfulle: except it be
first ryped, and the pain aswaged, and then expertly modified, and last of
all consounded.

Also if there be in the woude any distemperance, Of wouds with Dyscrasia.
first let it be cured with his contrary: as cold with heate, and heate with
cold, and so of other* and when this distemperance is removed: then turn
again to thy principal cure.

Moreover if there be in the wound any concauitye, Wounds with concauyte or
^olownesse.
or holownesse, it shall first be replenished again with due flesh: for if
it wear healed above and holowe under neathe: of very necessity there
should remain in the concauity fylthe and corruptyon. The which would
putrefye the place, and constreigne the Chirurgien to open the wound again:
and so the last labour should be more then the first. Replenish it first
therefore with the above said mundificatyve, laid on the wound: with the
poulder of Licence put therein: or with some other incarnatyue, or regeneratyue
vnguente, such as shallbe written in the end of this book* and then in the
end let it be healed up.

Also if a wound be made with contusion, Of a wound made by contusion.
or bruising, as by a fall, by the stroke of a stone, or a staff, or any
other thing that is not sharpe: thou shalt not at the first administer thereto
a consolidatiue: for in everye brusure, the Flesh and the Sinews are of
necessity smitten together, (if the member be Sinewye:) and needs will
putrefye. Then would consolidatiues constreigne the fylthe to tarry with in
the member, and so all the member should be corrupted, or else constreigne thee
to open the wound again: which should be dowble pain and labour, both
unto thee, and to thy patyente. For lunge feblenesse of any member in^u^eth
all the body to corruptyon.

Therefore it is first to be Or rather digested.
riped, secondly to be modified, thirdly (if there abide any holownesse,) to
regenenerate and incarne it, fourthlye and last of all to consolidate it.
Four intentions to be noted and observed.
Saving only that if the bruise be but little, it will then be soon healed,
by annoyntinge the place about the wound with Oil of Roses, and upon the
iuncture strew poulder of Myrtles, and mundifye the wound with a
mundificatiue of Mel, and then conveniently heal it up.

Of wounds made with venomous Beasts, as of the bytinge of a mad Dog, or
otherwise. Chapiter ix.
IF the wound be made with the bytinge of a mad dog, Wounds venomous.
(which thou may know by this, a Hen will not eat the bread that is
infused or infected in the wound, Experiment to know^ venomous wound.
and if she eat it, she dies thereof) my counsel is, that no Chirurgien go
about to heal or consound such a wound at the first, but keep it open.xl.
days at the least, and in places where no danger is of such work to be doe^,
it is good to make an actual cautery, and put there to hot medicines: as
Salt and Musterde, mixed with Honey, and make Phisicalle remedies, of the which
this under written is the best. Rec. de Cinere cancrorum fluuialium adustoru,
Physical remedies,
parts quinque, Gentianae, parts tres, terra sigi^latae, parts sex. All
these together make in fine poulder, give the patient every day to drink.
drach. ii. the space of a month, with the water wherein Crabs or Crefishes
are sodden: and after.xl. days, make Consolidation effectually. this
understand likewise of al venomous wouds.

All these things considered, thou maiste surely proceed in the cures of
woudes: I leave the rest to thine own discreation.

Thus ends the first part of this work.

The second part of this work ensues, which treats of Apostemes, and
contains xv. Chapiters.
Of the causes of Apostemes in generalle.
The first Chapiter.
OF Apostemes, understand that the causes of them be double: Cause of
Apostemes.
that is to say, of an outward cause, or of an inward cause. Of an outward
cause, Cause Procatar^tike, or primitiue.
as of a stroke, or of a fall, or of a wound altered by the aer, or other
like. Of an inward cause, as of aboundace of inward superfluities. Cause intern
or antecedent
The cause materialle is in.vi. manners: for either it is Humoralis, namelye
Sanguine, Cholerirke, Phlegmaticke, or Melancholic, or else watery or windye:
and that also either simple or copounde: although an Aposteme be most rarelye
engendered of one only humour, as I will here in order express: beginning
first at a Sanguine Aposteme, and so after of the rest.

Of sanguine Apostemes. Cap. ii.
IF blood abound over all the body, Apostemes Sanguine.
inflaminge and heatinge the heart, and so the body, and yet not defiled:
there is engendered a continual Fever, called Sinocha, Synocha.
but if it be defiled: then is the Fever a continual Sinochus. Synoch^s.
but if it occupy not all the body, but only some particular member, the
blood being most thin in substance, and flowynge in quality: it makes a
red inflammation dispersed abroad in all the outward face of the member,
Erysipelas nothum.
which is called Herisipila notha: because it is made of blood reduced like
to the nature of choler. But if the blood be gros^er naturally in substance,
and hot in quality: Carbunculus.
then it makes Carbunculum. Which is swarte in colours, and hard in felinge,
in the uppermost part, of colour like ashes: which comes of adustion. But
if the blood be to much in quantitye, and yet natural: then it makes
Flegmonem. Phlegmone.
The signs whereof is redishnesse in sight, because of the similitude of the
humore: hardness, for the lightness: a deep swelling caused by the matter in
the depenesse of the member, (that is: contained in the flesh): pulsatyon, or
beating, by flowinges, which are caused by heate, working in the matter:
inflammation by the presence of heate multiplied: and sumtime is made the fever
Effimera: Ephemera.
specially about the br^dinge of the matter, or quytture. At which time all
the foresaid accidents are more grenous, then when the matter is corrupted, and
fully ryped.

Of Choleric Apostemes. Cha. iii.
IF choler bear rule, or have domination in the body, Apostemes Choleric.
(as sometime it hath:) either it is putrefied and defiled, or not: Icterus.
If that which is not putrefied be in all the body, it makes Icteritiam.
Serpigo.
If it be in one only place, it makes Serpiginem, Tyria.
or Thiriam. And when it is defiled, being among the veins, Tertiana
continua.
and continuing in all the veins: it makes a continual tertian. But if it
be specially about the heart, Causon.
or the mouth of ye stomach: it makes a Causon. Tertiana iter ^nittens.
If without the veins. It causes a tertian interpolate. Erysipelas Verum.
But if any such Choler not putrefied Destitute, left, or forsaken.
destytute of nature, be gathered in any outewarde member ^ it makes
Herisipilam Veram, the signs whereof are these. A red colour myxed with
yelownesse, according to the similitude of the matter: a swelling which is
caused of the fiery lightness of the matter which ascends: hardness it hath,
caused by the dryness thereof: with a prickynge heate, greuynge the hand that
touches it, which comes by the reason of the sharpness of the matter.

Of Phlegmaticke Apostemes. Cha iiii.
PHlegm^, Apostemes Phlegmatiue
having domination in the body, either it is defiled, or undefiled. If it be
defiled: it is either within the vessels of the body, and makes Anfimerinam
continuam sin^ rigore: Amphemerina conti^a.
or else without the vessels and makes an interpolate quotidian, ^.
with rigour. Also if it be not putrefied, it i^ either over all the body, and
makes (...) (...).
which is one of the kinds of Hydropsye or else in one only place, and
makes in Aposteme, called (...) O^dema.
or Vnd^nia. The signs whereof are these. witness, of the likeness of the
matter softness, as when a man thrusts in his finger, there remains a
pitto, which is caused of mouistnesse: cold in the feeling, because the (...)
whereof it proceeds is colds: with little ache or none, because there is no
assault of heate. Nevertheless this aposte^e is much more painfulle when it
is fully putrefied, then it was before because every aposteme, though it come
of cold matter, after the fulle putrefaction, receaueth a strange heat* and by
this reason is every exiture, Exiture what it is.
(that is every famous apost^me), judged to be whotte, although it come of a
cold cause. As the quotidian and quartain fevers, are judged hot sicknesses:
and yet they come of a cold matter.

Of Melancholic Apostemes. Chap. v.
NOw melancholy superabounding, either it is putrefied, or not putrefied: and
being putrefied, either it (...) all the body, or one place. If it occupy all
the body, Lepra.
either it is externallye, and makes Lepran: or else inwardly. Quartana
cont^.
And then, either the matter is within the veins, makes a continual quartain:
or else without the veins, Quartana Intermittens.
and makes a quartain interpolate: or else in one place only, and makes
Cancrm^. Cancer.


But if it be not putrefied: either it is over all the body and makes
Melanchiron, Melanchiron scirrhus.
that is the black Jaundies: or else in one place, and makes a harde
Aposteme, called Sclirosin. Whereof these are ye signs, hardness because of ye
dryness and grosenesse of the humour: without pain, because heate is absent,
for that an insensible comparion of matter occupies the place: and the colour
is like the colour^ of the body, or inclininge somewhat to leadinesse. for
although Melancholy be black, yet because it is ponderous or heavy, the
colour thereof is not presented to the utter part of the body or skin. and
in these signs it differs from the Cancer. Signs.
for a Cacer which comes of putrefied Melancholy, because it hath gotten unto
it a heate: doth ache and burn, by reason before showed, and the veins that
are about it are diverse. for though the humour be melancholic whereof it
proceeds: yet in the putrefaction thereof, it receives a strange lightness
and heate. Whereof the veins comprehendinge the Cancer be of diverse colours,
so that they do assimulate or show the likeness of the disease. and for this
cause was it called Cancer, for that it represents the form and shape of a
sea Crab, which is round, and has many feet.

Of watery Apostemes. Cha. vi.
THe watery Aposteme comes of abundance of cold upon the liver, Apostemes
watery.
ingenderinge much waterinesse: and is of the nature of Yposarca:
Nevertheless this waterinesse, Hyposarca.
is sometime gathered together in one only place of the body, and that
chieflye about the navel: the signs and tokens whereof are these. The colour
is like the colour of all the body: in so much that if thou felest it with
the.ii. fingers of thy.ii. hands, putting the one finger a good distance from
the other, thou shalt feel a a floude under thy fingers, so that thy one finger
shall put away the water under the other: and it is ponderous, and heavy,
without any akinge. I have healed such an Aposteme with incision, and dryinge
of the water, in a woman that had it about the navel* which was as great as
two pound weight of bread.

Of wyndye Apostemes. Cha. vii.
THe wyndy Aposteme is engendered of a vapor or wind, Apostemes wyndie.
resolved by the working of feeble disoluing heate, not of power to consume it,
which vapor is set between the coats of the members, and especially in the
region of the mouth of the stomach, and in the gryndes, so that many believe
it to be a Rupture. yt signs whereof be these. It is harde, with stiffenesse
against thy finger when thou touch it, and like a bladder it is full of
wind, and if thou smite thereon it foundeth, and the colour of the place is
not changed from the colour of the body, and know that this Aposteme, is
much likened to the hard Aposteme made of pure Melancholy before specified.
But he that ca decern the difference of ye hardness of a stone, from the
hardness of a hogs bladder full of wind: or between a harde thing, and a
thing extended or stretched, may soon know how to discern the difference,
between these.ii. Apostemes. And it is also likened to the waterye Aposteme:
but the waterinesse which is in the waterye Aposteme, and the absence of water
in ye windy Aposteme, shows difference enough between them.

Of the Aposteme called Botium. Cha. viii.
THere is also another cold Aposteme, Botium.
called Botium, which is often placed in the throat, and it is made in two
manners. That is: either by matter ingedered of hot apostemes, or of diversity
of putrefied Phlegm. Of which some have matter within, like curded chese, some
like clay, and some like dregs of Oil, some thick like potage, and some
other all grainy, and full of gobbets, of which some be movable in the upper
part^ of the member, onlys under the skyn: and other vnmouable, and infyred in
the bothome of the member, and yet have no colour.

Of Apostemes of compound humores. Chapi. x.
BY these things that are written of simple Apostemes, Apostemes of compound
humores.
the knowledge may be had of those that are compound. For if Choler be
compound with blood, in the ingenderynge of Apostemes: the more part being
blood, Phlegmone erysipelatodes
it is called Flegmon Herisipilades. But if there be more part of choler, then
of blood: then is it called Herisipila Flegmonides, Erysipelas Phlegmonodes
and they are known by signs above specifyed. There is sometime compound
together, blood, choler, and melancholy: and then they make Anthracem.
Anthrax.
The signs whereof be these, hardness, diversity of colour in the circuit:
and that thing it has common with the Cancer. But yet there is difference:
for in this thing is more inflammation and feblenesse of heart: sometime
swoundynge, and trembling of the heart, with profundity, or depenesse of
sleep: yet not true sleep, but abusedlye so called. And in the upper part is
a manner if bladder, ash coloured: which seems to be drawn down to the lower
parts, as if it were drawn with a thr^e. And thou may well know^, that it
is made of divers humores, if thou mark the diversity of the matter, which
shallbe purged after the maturation, in the time of mundification. For thou
shalt find in the mydest of ye tough matter a harde gross substance, which
is (of the common sort) called the foot or core of the disease, the which
being taken away, there remains an holowe place: after the which, it
neadeth nothing but regeneration of the flesh, and healinge up of the Ulcer.
And this aposteme is malicious, by the reason of the admi^tion of contrary
things. Also if Melancholy be copounde with Phlegm, Phlegm having the
upper hand: it ingendereth Glandules. Glandulae.
But if Melancholy overcome the Phlegm, Scrophulae.
it ingendereth Scrophules. The signs whereof are these: absence of colour and
in feshyon like an Almonde. also they move as it wear in swimming, and are
many together of one colour. And commonly they come under the arm holes, in
the throat, and in the grindes. And what so ever is all ready spoken of
Apostemes, is spoke of those that be made of natural humores.

Of Apostemes of unnatural humores. Capi x.
IT remains now yt we speak of apostemes yt come of humores unnatural, of
the which some be very euel and perilous. And who that would know perfectly
the nature of apostemes, which come of unnatural humores: let him endeavour
him self to know the generation of humores in the body, as well those that be
natural, as those that be unnatural: And frequentlye mark the Apostemes that
come of the same, with the fashion and colours of them. And the accidents that
follow of them, with also the matters that proceed from them. And so by good
Theoricalle knowledge, and long experience: he shall obtain the
understanding thereof, and otherwise not. And having this, let him give praise
to almighty God, who is the author and geuer of all good knowledge and
cunning. And here it would be very necessary, to speak of the generation of
humores, both natural and unnatural: teaching how they be generate, and of
their matter and substance. But that we here omit, because the intention of
this work is brevity, and is but a forerunner to a greater work: which by
the grace of God, hereafter shall be set forth.

Understand therefore, that of Apostemes made of unnatural humours: some be
hot, and some be cold. The cold: are knots, and knobs, which are
round in form, which are oftetimes in the forehead, in the back of the hands,
and of the fete, and in the joints: and their matter is glasy Phlegm,
destitute of heat. And soetyme there is mingled a sweet Phlegm, with
Scrophules Scrophules.
Glandules, whereof mention is made before. Th^re are also made Glandules, and
Scrophules: Scrophulae
which when they come to rypenesse, are called Squamos, the mundification
whereof is harde and difficille. Squamosae.


Of Apostemes made of Choler and Melancholy aduste. Cha. xi.
OF Choler aduste, and of Melancholy aduste, and of the admistion of them
together: are caused diverse Apostemes, after the diversity of the quantity of
the humores. and they are according to the diversity of the place, and the
variety of the strength, and feblenesse of the member receiving to be feared,
the danger or peril whereof is more or less: according to the nobility, or
ignobilitie of the member, and specially in the legs: of Auicene they are
called Can^renae. If they occupy the depest or lowest part of the member,
Gangrena.
although not all the meber, it is called of Auicene Ascachilos. But if it
occupy al the member it is called Herpes, Aschachilos.
this Herpes is made of euel ulcers, Herpes.
whereto much corrupt and venomous matter descends. And it may also come (as
Auicene says, and as I have scene,) by opening of any feeble or inflated
member in the cold aer: for by yt means the extreme parts are mortified,
because the lively heate may not come there at. So that those mortified
extremities corrupt the member, except it be restreigned: so that sometime of
very necessity, the foot must be cut off even to the joint to save the
leg. Sometime there are also made by the admixtion of the said corrupted
humores, Bladders, Formica, Miliaris, Prima, called Ignis persicus. The which
are all diverse, after the diversity of their coposytion. And of these names is
much diversity among authors: for which diversity thou need not care,
but only have respect to their colours and accidents. For almost to them
all belongs one manner of cure: as thou shalt perceive hereafter.
Nevertheless, these bladders are made of the foresaid matter: sharpe, light,
and seking way outward to the skin, by reason of the lightness. This Formica,
Formica.
is also a pustule, but is deper in the flesh, and soon turns to vlceration.
Miliaris, Miliaris.
is made of the same matter: but it is more ashy, because of adustion: and it
makes many small pustules like the sede of Milium, with great heate and
itch. Prima.
Primae: are also Pustules, swarte, and hard, having about them a citrine
colour: which are made of yt more part of choler aduste, and the less part
of aduste Melancholy.

Of the cure of Apostemes made of an outward cause. Chapi. xii.
Now that we have brieflye declared, Apostemes the cure of them.
the differences of apostemes: it is mete that we resort to our purpose, that
is to say to the cure of them: followynge the doctrine of good authors, and
our lunge experience. The cure of an aposteme comming^ ^f an outward cause,
if it be of a wound: is all ready taught. But if it be of a bruise, a stroke,
or of a fall, the stroke of a staff, or of a stone: the best curation is, (if
he that is hurt be yonge strong:) to let him blood on the contrary side:
but if he be weak to ventose him, To this medicine in other copies is added
pul^s corticis fraxim^.
and annoynt the place with warm Oil of Roses: strewinge thereon, when it is
newly anointed, powder of Mirtilles, for this manner of cure establishes, and
stays the place: except it be to great a bruise. But if the place be not
defended from apostemation by this medicine, but comes to exiture: namelye
the generatyon of quitture: let it be ryped, and soon opened, where the matter
most depends: and mundify the place with a mundificatiue, made ex Farina
tritici, aqua, Mell, after let it be regenerate with flesh, and then let it
be confounded with incarnatiues and consolidatiues. Putting always about the
hurt place, a defensive de Bolo Armeno, Oleo Rosacto, Aceto, Vnguentu
defensi^m.
to the conservation of the whole parts: least they be also corrupted. Of
those consolidatiues, and incarnatiues thou shalt read in the antidotary.

Of the cure of Apostemes, coming of an Inward cause. Chapi. xiii.
OF apostemes that come of an inward cause, it is to be noted, that either
they are resolved, (if they will be put back,) or Indurate: or else they co^e
to Saniem, or to putrefaction. although resolution is soetymes made by
repercussio, as is also sometimes maturation, yet is neither the one nor the
other done properly, but unproperly. And if it behooved to note exactlye, the
cures of these apostemes: It wear nedefulle now to amplifye our matter, and
to describe the cures of them, each particulerlye.

But for as much as I have purposed, and promised, to write the most notab^
and shortest cures, in the most shortest manner, for the breuitye of this book:
I intend not now to delay the time in words. Therefore know this, that thou
may reduce the cures of all apostemes, unto one brief division, A whotte
aposteme.
namelye to the cure of whotte Apostemes and cold. It is the property of an
hot Aposteme, either to be repercussed, resolved, or maturate. And the
property of the cold, is to be maturate, to be resolved, and indurate by
exterior heate. A cold aposteme.
For it is seldom seen that cold Apostemes be repercussed. Begin therefore
in the cure of hot Apostemes, with Plebotomye on the contrary side, if he be
strong, and that in the beginning of the aposteme, before the confyrmation:
For after the cofirmation, Phlebotomye is to be done on the same side where the
aposteme is. Or if he be feeble with ventosynge: enioyninge him a straight and
cold diet, according to his strengthes: for all apostemes that come of an
inward cause are with repletion.

After the foresaid euacuations: begin to repercusse the matter, and to
comfort the member, that it receive no superfluities* except one of
these.vii. things following let thee, Seven things contrary to repercussio
of aposteme^.
which be hinderable to repe^ssyon. The first is if the aposteme be in a
child. The second is, if it be in an old manne. The third is in a man new
recovering from some disease or sycknesse. The fourth if the matter be much.
The fyueth is, great contagion. The syxte is, if it be in the emunctoryes, as
in the neck or the throat, in the arm hole, or in the grynde. The seuenthe is
if the Aposteme be made by way of Derivation: As when the member that
expels, is nobler then the member that receaueth. But if none of these seven
things appear in thy way, then repercusse the matter, with the juice of some
could Herbs, as of Solanum (which repercusseth with preuye Resolution. Or
cum Succo Portulacae Slluestris, Vel Vmbilici Veneris: cum Oleo Rosato, pauco
aceto, pauco Bolo Armeno: or with some one of the good repercussiue vnguentes,
to be mencyoned in the end.

If the matter by these means be not repercussed: either because it inclyneth
to some quantitye, or that it be somewhat gross: When thou haste first purged
the body, begin to dyssolue it: administrynge a little honey with the a
foresaid repercussiue medicine, after resolve strogly, according as thou see
the course of the matter to sea^e, and the payne and the sharpness waste away,
with some of the resolutiue medicynes, written in the antidotarye. But if the
matter enclyne to Saniem, in the time of Repercussyon, (which sometime is made
by means of accidents, not properly,) or in the time of resolution: Then
hasten maturation with maturatiues. And being fully riped, loke for the
ripest, for the most dependente place, and there open it: making great
openynges in great exitures, and small openinges in small exitures: and
thrust out all the matter softly, except it be very much: for then it is
not good to thrust out all at one time, but by leisoure, especially when the
patient is feeble. And when the place is open, and the matter voided, in part
or in whole: mundifye the foresaid place with mundificatiues that hereafter
shall be written, and then incarne the flesh: and after consolidate it, with
medicines for the same purpose, described in the antidotary. But beware thou
make none incisyon, till the matter be fully riped: except it be nigh the
noble members, or the fundament, or yt joints: or if the matter be ready to
corrupt the members. For in these cases it is necessary to make incision
before the ripnesse, laying thereto such plasters as may not only mundifye,
but also maturate the rest that is not ripe. And see that in no case in the
time of resolution, maturation, and mundification, that the Emplasters
resolutiues, maturatiues, and mundificatiues: be not of to whotte nature, nor
to harde, but temperate. For sometime such things make the aposteme furious.

And know that whotte sanguine apostemes, need little repercussyon, and much
resolutyon: and choleric apostemes, neade much repercussyon and little
resolutyon* and as in this case Phlebotomye belongs to sanguine men, even so
to choleric men, belongs the purgynge of choler in the body. And those
apostemes that are made of aduste humores, need only repercussyon before the
vlceration thereof: and after the vlceration lay no cold things in the
vlcerate. But lay about it a defensive of ^ole Armeniake, to defend the
ambulation and corrosion.

Of the Anthrax and Carbunculus.
ANthrax, Carbunculus, because one is made of diverse humores, and the other of
gross blood, as is aforesaid: do require (after Phlebotomye and purgations)
emplasters, and meates and drinckes, comfortynge the heart, because of their
malice: especially the Anthrax, which is common with all other venomous
Apostemes. Give therefore to the patient, a cold and straight diet: as
Pomegranates, Apples, Pears, Quinces, and wine of Pomegranates, with.x. parts of
could water: and let him abstain from all kinds of Flesh, if it may be: If
not, permit him the Flesh of Chickens, dressed with Agresta, or wine of
Pomegranates. Unto such also may Theriacamaior be profitablye given. But if
they have Stuporem Stup^r.
called also S^c^pen, (...).
and commonly swoundynge: Of this matter, loke farther in my table at (...).
let them be raised, with the great sowndes, of trompetes, and timpanies:
Calling them very loudly, by their proper names. And lay upon the heart a
could emplaster, made, ex Rosarum rubrarum, Sandali citrint, ana Vncia Una,
F^rinae Hordeace^ Vnciis duabus, Caphurae, drachmis duabus. Tempered together
cum aqua Rosacea, Velsucco pomorum Agrestium. But if the sore be in the former
part, about the mamilles, or the breast: let the same emplaster be laid
between the shoulder blades.

But some peradventure may me^uaile at the giving of Theriacamaior, (...).
because it is whotte: but although it b^s^me not the breuitye of this work,
to dispute of every thing: yet because there has been, and yet now is
amongst the auncientes, diverse opinions: and because some have, do approve it,
and some not: Thou shalt understand although triacle he whotte: yet by his
nobility, and most profitable composition, there resulteth a most worthy
spiryte, and friendly to man his coplexion. And therefore we have found it
valiente against venom, both whotte and cold: and against venimes, that are
contrary to man his nature of the whole kind. It is found also to move the
belly, and to staye the flux: and therefore I surely say, that as every
thing, emonge things engendering a common complexion, Complexio elementalis.
(which is called Complexio elementalis), has morouer a proper hid nature,
which is of the whole kind* of has Theriaca, beside and above the
elementary complexion, in yt doing and suffering of things, enteringe
together his composition, a hid property, against all kinds of venom, to man
his body contrary. And therefore it profits against every venomous a
posteme: for the example and profit whereof I say farther, that there came to
me in the City of Milaine, a yonge man, (brought by an Apothecary his
friend,) having Anthracem in the parts of the face, whose malice was so
excedinglye increased, that the whole head, face, and neck, was incrediblye
inflated: and the sick man was even now in the signs of death. For he had
no pulse, and also he sounded: In so much that I willed the Apothecary to
lead him home to his house, for he is a dead man. And the Apothecary said,
is there then none other remedy with him? Then I a little bethinkynge my self,
said. Truly if thou had of the best Triacle, and gave it him in great
quantity, perhaps he might yet live: but I believe it not, otherwise then very
doubtfully.

The apothecary then led him to his house, (scante able to go), and gave to
him, of approved Triacle about ii. drachmes, and laid him in a bed,
covering him, and immediately he fell into a sweat, which began about the
head, and diseased place. And within a while he sweat over all: and lo his
pulse returned, and he was comforted. And when his sweat was dried up, the
apothecary (of his own motion), gave to him the same day one drachme more of
the same Triacle, and so was he healed: saving that there remained on him a
certain bladerye Ulcer, which after was easily cured. And surely I never
saw any other man escape, after swoundinge, tremblinge of the heart, and
(which was the greatest maruelle) without pulse. But I have scene an infynite
sort, that (speaking and fealinge as it wear no grefe,) wear by me judged to
dye, and have died: to the great marvel of their friends, at the
Prognostication.

And thus much have I said to thee of Triacle* that thou may perchance
through these words, deliver some man from death. And I beseech the
omnipotente God, whose name be praised for ever, to grant me synfulle man
through his mercy, that this my little book may be to his honour, and the
profit of his creatures. But now to our purpose.

After the comfortinge of the heart, and evacuation of the matter: the
Carbuncle, and Anthrax, shall be ryped, with their proper maturatiues, whereof I
will make mention in the end of this work. By the which remedies, all other
furiouse apost^mes may be cured: namelye, by comfortinge the heart and the
member. And after vlceration, proceed with the curations that shall be given
thee in the Chapiter of ulcers.

Of cold Apostemes. Chapi.xv.
Cold apostemes are healed with the purging of the body: to the which,
Trocis^us de Turb^t^ is a specialle medicine. Which w^s of our master, as we
will show in the antidotarye. after the body is purged make resolution, or
maturation, (if r^so^ution can not be made^) And in the antidotary thou shalt
read resoluti^s, and maturatines for these apostemes, Scrophules, Glandules
and Nodes. And also mundificatiues for the apostemes, called Botia.

The third part of this work, contains three Chapiters, namelye of
Ulcers, the Cancer, and the Fistula.
Of Ulcers in generalle. Chapi.i.
VLcus, and Vulnus, do manifestly differ* for Vulnus is a wound or a cut
newly made: and an ulcer is a sore, corrupt, or old. Although in Physic
it be sometimes found, Art of medicine.
that an old sore is of some named Vulnus: Vulnus.
but there Vulnus is taken for Plaga, Plaga.
and not properly. An Ulcer also differs from the Cancer, and Fistula, eve as
That is ye general from the special, or the kind fro the form.
Genus aspecie. For every Fistula is an Ulcer, and so is every vlcered Cancer:
but not contrariwise. and hereby shall the error of Rogerius, Rolandus, (...)
Rolandus their errores
be manifested: (who say, that every wound remaining uncured, ii. or.iii.
months, is not then Vulnus: but is called Cancer, or Fistula.) For all sores,
coming of vlceratyng Pustules, or of the coldness of the aer, or of any
corruptyon, or (properlye speaking) by the incision of an aposteme: and also
all filthy, and putrefied sores, are ulcers: And yet are they properlye
neither Fistules, nor Cancers. For the Cancer, and Fistula, have their proper
differences: where in they varye from ulcers, as it shall appear. In Ulcers
therefore, there is some virulencye, with much liquid corruption: and that
corruption, if it have a colour tendinge to citrine, or red: let it be
washed with could, and stipticke lotions: as the water wherein Alumen has
been resolved, and with aqua Hordei Lenticularum Bal^istiorum, both composed
simple. But if it be not coloured, let it be washed with Aqua Mellis: and if
the member be could enough, cum Mell Vino, which lotions thou shalt put
into the ulcer. Or if it be hollow, cast them in with a s^ring: continuing the
same, until they come forth again, as fair as they were put in. But now
if the ulcer should be crustye, or should have corrupt flesh, or flesh
myred cum Sani^: Then ought it to be modified, ^ Vnguento apostolorum,
Vnguento Viri^, which all shall be prescribed to thee in the end. But if the
ulcer be fraudulent: or corrosive: let the contagion be repressed, by laying
about it, the medicine of Bole, often before showed. And upon it some
stiptike corrosive, such as shall hereafter be given thee. After a perfect
mundification, made with the emplasters mundificatiues that are showed and to
be showed: regenerate the flesh, and cicatrize the ulcer, with medicynes for
the same: whereof thou shalt have plenty, But mark this well, that the
purging of the body by vomyte, healpeth much, if the euell ulcers be in the
ne^her parts: and by a laxatyue medicine, if they be in the upper parts. For
this is a way most sure, because the matter that ran to the ulcers, is
turned from the vlcer^ (...), and goes away: whereby the ulcer is the better
mundifyed.

Of the Cancer. Chapi. ii.
Understand that a Cancer is either vlcerate or not. Cancer.
A Cancer not vlcerate, either is mad^ by growing even from the beginnynge of
putrefied melancholy, as we have said in the Chapiter of melancholic
Apostemes: At which time it begins to show like a Lupyne, and sometime it
grows like a great Melon: or else it is made by conuertion of a harde
aposteme, coming of naturalle melancholy not corrupted, by laying to it
emplasters that are made of hot inflamynge things: or by things to much
atractiue, inducinge humores to yt place. And this being Ulcered, is then
called a Cancer vlcerate: which also may come ^f wounds vndiscretlye healed.
A Cancer not vlcerate, in the beginning thereof, is not easy to be known:
Notwythstandinge the perfect signs thereof are all ready declared. But the
signs of a Cancer being vlcerate be these. First the brimnies thereof be
gross, harde, reversed, and curn^ly within: and it ^tinketh much. And also
this is thereof an infallible sign: If thou wash it with lye, For the which
loke more in an annotation, set at the end of the. 4. part
there will come out superfluityes like slimy spittle. The first general
rule in the cure of a Cacer, is, that it is never perfectly healed, unless it
be utterly extirped, with all his roots. And therefore of this rule springs
a second necessary rule, that it ought not to be cured by cauteryes, either
actua^le or potentialle: except it be in such a place where it may utterly
be had away. If therefore the Cancer not vlcerate, be in a place replet^ with
veins, s^ewes, muscles and arteries, as in yt neck, or in the mammilles, or
such like: see then that thou enterprise not to ripe it, nor break it, nor
cut it, nor cauteryze it: but purge the body with some medicine, that
purges choler aduste. And give him a temperate governance of life, forbiddinge
all meates, ingrossinge and burning the blood: as Lentils, Cole wortes,
Chese, Beef, Hares flesh, Goose flesh, Ducks flesh, and Pepper: and al
other sharp things. And anoynte the place, and about the same, with this
Unguente folowinge: which will alaye and aswage the malice, and defend it
from vlceration. Rec. Tutiae lauatae, Cerussae: Ana, parts equals.
Incorporate these, cum Oleo Rosato, succo portulac^, or of some other cold
herb. Incorporate this medicine in a mortar of lead, putting in now of the
Oil of Roses, and now of the Juice, till the oyntmente be perfectly made: And
anoynte therwyth the place. But if it be in such a place that it may be taken
utterly away: Then cut it away roots and all: letting it blede largelye,
and thruslynge the blo^de out of the corrupted veins, that thereby the
melancholy blood may be clean wasted. And then canterize it with a whotte
Iron, or a burning medicine. Laying to it after that, a Cataplasma de Succo
Apii, Mell, Farina Tritice^, till it be modified. After the which, regenerate
the flesh, and consounde it. But if the Ulcerate Cancer be in any place
nourished, so that it may not utterly be taken away: Then is it not best to
cure it with a whotte iron, or a caustike medicine. But it may be palliated by
anointing it with the vnguente of Tatiae and the diet aforesaid: and so may
the patyentes life be prolor^ged.

Of a Fistula. Chapi. iii.
AFistula Fistula.
is a deep ulcer, whose orifice is straight and the bothome large: having a
callous ha^dnesse in the circ^ite inwardly, like the quill of a bird: And in
this thing it differs from an holowe ulcer. For a holowe ulcer that Rogerus,
Rolandus, and a great many mo, do now a days call a Fistula: has no
inward callous, hardness, as a fistula hath. And because of that hardness, a
Fistule is not perfectly modified by Lotions and Iniections, as is a holowe
ulcer: but requires (after the Lotions written in the cure of Ulcers:) that
the callous hardness within be removed and modified by cauteries, either
actualle or potentialle. After the which thou shalt adminyster vnctuous
things: as Butter, and other such like as will supple and lose, the hard
eschare or core, that was made by the Iron, or caustike medicine. And after
that, mundify it with iniections, and Emplasters mundificatiues. And then let
it be incarned, with incarnatiues: and at the last consounde it with
consolidatiues, and Cicatrizatiues.

Nevertheless note this for a common remedy, as well in Fistules, as in
holowe Ulcers, which is also good in a new wound: namelye, that thou induce
the matter to the place most dependente, if it may be possible, that the
venomous superfluitye of the said Wound, Fistule, or or holowe ulcer, may
the more competentlye be dried up, or else prepare the member so, that the
Orifice may be always dependente. Of cauteryes or corrosive medicynes, to
corrode and cauterize the Fistule, and Cancer: And also the vnctuous medicines
to make the eschare fall (made by the,) thou shalt read in the antidotarye.
And note that the said eschare, made by the cauterie or sharpe medicine, ought
not to be had away by violence, but must be suffered: Laying to the sore,
the foresaid medicynes: till it fall away gently, without compulsion.

The fourth part of this work, treats of Algebra, or Restoration. And
contains ii. Chapiters, the first of Dislocation, the other of a Fracture.
Of Dyslocation. Chapi. i.
THe Intention of Algebra, Algebra.
is the restorynge of Dislocation, Dislocation.
or breaking of bones. R^storation
Dislocatio called Laxatio, is the remouynge of the bone out of his natural
pla^e. Know therefore that almighty God, Conexion of bones.
(whose name be euerlastinglye glorified; and praised,) hath made many bones
in the body of manne, for diverse necessary wor^kes, and operatyons. Whereby
necessarilye one member in the body of manne, moves without another. Know
therefore that the conjunction of one bone with another, is in. a. x. manners.
One manner is by way of insertion of one with another, like as two saws were
joined together, the teeth of the one saw, fillinge the voidnesse of the other,
as do sometimes carvers of tables, and as the bones of the head do join, which
are.vi. b. An other manner, is the appodiation, or congregation (that is to say
the gathering together) of one bone to another, Sterron.
as do the.vii. bones of the breast. The third manner is, the fixion of one
bone into another, as are the teeth into the Jawe bones. The fourth manner is
the conjunction of one bone with another, by ligamentes going between: As in
the joint of the shoulder bone, with the ad^utorio: and so in all other
joints. For in yt joints is made a conjunction of one bone with another, by
the mediation of a harde body, insensible, and flexible: which passing out
of the extremity of the one bone, enters into the other: bindinge the bones
together. But yet the flexibilitye thereof, obeys to the lacertes that move
the member: so that the member may be bowed, as it is accordante to the same,
to do his convenient, and proper office. And as for all other manners of
coniunctions of bones, there is in them no natural, nor voluntary mouinges:
Therefore Dislocations be only made in joints. Notwithstanding certain
openinges, remouinges, diss^uerings, or departings, may other while be made in
the coniunctions of other bones. Saying then that dislocatio is made only in
joints* First join thou bone with been, as they were at their naturalle
beginning. And when thou haste so done, take a great linen cloth, and wet it
in a medicine made de Farina Cicerum, Vel Volatica Farin: Tritici, disteperata
cum (...), and bind it with gentle bonds, holding the place stedfaste in his
joint. And do not as many do now a da^es in the time of reduction: for they
foment the member with warm water, which is most hurtfulle. For thereby the
meber is eff^blished, rarefied, prepared to receive superfluityes, namely
apostemation. But it thou fear peynes* anoynte the place, cum Oleo Rosato
calido. But if thou wear not with him at the beginnynge, and that it has
now remained certain days displaced, and that so, the place be grown to
hardness, the humores also ceasynge their naturalle course: Then that the
member may be the better restored, it is good that thou fomente the place, not
with whotte water only: but cum Aqua Calida decoctionis Chamaemeli,
Fenograeci, Seminis Lini, Mal^e Bisimaluae: that by these things the place
may be the better restored.

Annotations upon this Chapiter.
a. Whereas Lanfraneus hear speaks of.^. manners of loyninges, describes but.
iiii. read for thy larger contetation: the first chapyter of my first
treatise of Anatomye: where thou shalt learn, as well the names, as the forms,
or all manner of ioyninges of bones.

b. Because here also, he names the.vi. bones of the head, to prove this
manner of conexion of bones: thou ma^ste not gather thereof, that all those.vi.
bones are so joined together, for that wear false. As by reading the third
chapiter, in the first part, of the third tr^tite* of my Anotamye, thou
may perceive.

Of a Fracture. Chapi. ii.
IF any bone be broken, first reduce him into his place: and then wet a
lynnen clothe in Oleo Rosato, Fractura.
and lay it about the member. And then lay over and about that, an other
clothe, Broke bones
wet in the forsaide medicine, written in the Chapiter of Dislocation. And
upon that clothe, lay small boulsters of tow, wet in Album^e oui, and over
that tow, bind splintes with cords. And see that the splintes be made
according to the figure and quantitye of the member: bindinge it so that it
remove not, least the remouynge of the member hinder the restoration. lettinge
it not to be opened until the.x. day: except one of these.iii. things
following, constreigne thee to open it. That is to wet, much payne, caused

gathering to an aposteme: or great Itch. If pain and ache, or the flux of
humores be ye cause: unbind it and anoynte the place cum Oleo Rosato, and
let him blood on the contrary side. And restreigne the patients diet:
taryinge so till the flux of humores be ceased, and then bind it up again.
But if Itch be the cause: then unbind it, and wash it with warm water, then
bind it up again: Letting it so continue till it be consounded. I will also
write among other consolidatiue medicynes, in the antidotarye: a medicine that
is best in Fractures, and in Dislocations. But note this, that in every
worcke of Chirurgerye, it is nedefulle and necessary, that then endeavour thy
self to work, above and beyond that which thou find written in books, and
especially in Algebra. For every science that depends upon working by the
hand, is much fortified by experiment and practise.

An Annotation upon the. ii. Chapiter of the third part.
Ba^e Viscose are the words of Lanfranke, about the which I was somewhat
troubled: for Ba^e is a word out of use among the learned, and therefore not
to a few of them unknown. Howe be it I thinking (because Lanfrancus was of
Milayne,) that it might perhaps be some Italian word: thought good to
confer the same with some learned Italians, of whom I received this
interpretation: Ba^e say they is the dr^uling spitlle of suckynge children. And
therefore have I englished Ba^e Viscose slimy spittle, which though I
thought I might safely so do, ye^ do I willingly abide the censures of the
learned.

The fifth part of this work ensues, containing.viii. Chapiters, and
treats of the diseases of the eyes.
Of the Composition of the eyes, and the diseases of the same.
The first Chapiter.
THERE is no disease, in any officialle member of the body, so hardly known
of the Chirurgien: as are the diseases of the eyes. And that for the subtiltye
of arts composition in them. For the eye is meruailouslye composed, of.iii.
humores, and.vii. coats. Which all do serve to the composition thereof, and
are bodies most subtille, and to syghte as it wear incomprehensible: but by
understanding, they are very well comprehended, with also their composition
and vtilities.

Unto the eyes (thus nobly composed,) do come certain veins, bringing to
them their nurishment: and also arteries bringing life unto them, both so
small, and fine: that they are to the sight almost insensible. And from the
first coniugation, of the.vii. paier of sinews of ye brain, in the fore
part of the head, comes.ii. sinews, passing out of the brain, by the
fore part of the sculle: which payer do make one hollow conjunction, before
they pass the sculle, after this manner. X. and as they pass the sculle, are
again divided in.ii. which do bear the visible spirit to the Crystalline
humore, which is the Instrument of sight. And yet is helped in the visible
action, of ye humores Albugineus, and Vitreus, and also of the.vii. coats
Other Anatomistes judge the (...), to be but guardones, or as it wear several
(...) to ye humores and no workers in the visible action.
. One of which coats called Vuea, is through persed, which percinge is
called Pupilla: whereby the proper colours, forms, and figures, are sent to
the visible spirit, through a clear aer. There are also made outwardly eye
lids, having lacertes to move them, which by their closinge, defend the
eyes from outward hurts, and also rest them from labours: and by a small
passage do work their actions, which are to se things visible. It were
very profytable in this place, to multiply words upon the declaratyon of the
Anatomye of the eyes, and exactlye to notify all diseases, that might happen
unto them, the which are very many. But if I should do so, I should pass
yt boudes of this little book. But I will give thee here the cures of
infirmities, which come to the hands of Chirurgiens, although not all, but
some that are common best known, as Obtal^nia, Pruritus, Lachrima, Scabies,
Vlcera, Maculae, Catoracta. c. which all do oft come to yt hands of ye
Chirurgien.

Of a disease in the eye, called Obtalmia. Cha. ii.
OBtalmia is an aposteme or inflation, (...).
or a course of humores to the eyes, which sometime is little, sometime great,
sometime very great euel, that which is little, is made of small humores, and
sotime only of an euel whote coplexion, or of the heate of the sun, of dust,
of smoke, or of much watching, which will soon be dissolved, made whole, with
tempera^er of diet, and the white of an egg beaten skummed, and so laid to
the eyes. This medicine is good for burning heat, and redness of the eyes,
when it is but little: unto many other infirmities, which comme of heat,
because ye white of an egg is cold, washing apt for collyries, having a
certain gl^ines being applied to ye eyes, which is not found in other simple
medicines. The great Obtalmia, is when the eye aketh. The Coniunctiua, being
red, and the eye vexed with heat, sharpnes, tears.

The greatest and worst Obtalmia, is that wherein there appears no part of
the Coniunctiua, but is covered over with a great red fleshinesse: the whole
eye being inflated, and also the eye lids, which are as it wear reversed:
this doth soon vlcerate ye eye. In the greater, greatest kinds, it is
necessary (according to their quantities) to draw blood from the Cephalica
vein, and also to purge whotte humores: geuinge him lastly a diet so
sclender, as the patient may continue with: geuinge him also all his meates
actuallye cold, and in like manner what so ever is put into the eye: which
when it waxes whotte, must be removed. You may also for this purpose, lay
to the eye Collyrium Album, distemperatum cum lacte mulieris puella nutrientis.
And emplaster the eye (until the inflammation be removed,) with an emplaster
made, ex Rosarum Albarum Santali Rubriana Vncia Una, Farinae Hordeaceae Vnciis
duabus. Caphurae, drachma Una, distemperatis cum Aqua Rosacea. And when the
course of humores, and the payne is ceased: make fometation cum aqua
decoctionis Rosarum, pauco Sale. But if this help not, it is nedefulle to
aplye thereto Collyrium de Thure, to maturate it, after that Puluerem Citrinum,
to mudify it.

If after the Obtalmia, or by the same, there be made an ulcer in the eye:
(whereof these are the signs, that in Coiunctiua there is a red point, and
in the cornea is a white point. (Then use again collyrio Albo, to aswage the
peine, or if the Ulcer be so great, that thou feareste the going out of
Vuca, or that the disease called Bothor should ensue, (which is a certain
eminence, appearinge in the eye, resembling the grain of a grape:) then
shall Heles^r be necessary, which is to say Penetratiuum. But if thou fear
not this, and would heal the ulcer, use collyrio de plumbo. If farthermore
after consolidation of the ulcer, there do remain Albula id est Cicatrix, you
may cure the same, cum collyrio de Stercore Lacerti.

Collyrium Album.

it be very well wrought on a marble stone, and after make it up in small
pelletes, like lentilles, which at your times of need, you may temper with the
milk of a woman that nourishes a maid child, and administer it with a
feather.

Of Itch in the eyes.
Pruritus, called in English Itch, being in the eye: is cured by washinge
the eye, evening and morning with white wine, wherein has lyne Aloe
Succotrina, poudered, enclosed in a piece of linen clothe.

Of Scabs in the eye.
Scabies, englished scabes, if they be light and new, are cured by washinge
the eye with white wine, wherein has been disolued Coperosa, sieve Vitriolum

Of Tears.
Lacrymae, or tears, are cured cu collyrio de Mirobalanis, whose composition
follows.

Collyries. Use one of these, disolued in Aqua Rutae, Vel Foeniculi, or else ye
may put in the powder dry.

Of the web in the eye.
Vngula, may in the beginning, be cured with a Collyrie, which is also
common to the old scabbe of the eye, the inuersion of the eye lids, thus
made.

Rec. Floris aeris drach. iii. Vitrioli Romani Vsti, drach. v. Auripigmenti

Dissolve the Sal Ammoniake in Succo Rutae, therewith corporate the rest being
poudered, and make Collyries, whereof dissolve one with white wine, and
administer it to the eye.

But if it be great and confirmed, take away then, what so ever may with
Instruments be taken away, and after cure it with a Collyrie.

Of the disease of the eye, called Cataracta. Chapi. viii.
A Cataracte confirmed, Cataracta
is not helped, but only by hady work, and to do that, it is needful a
Chirurgien do first learn, and se it done, of a cunning man, that can well
remove, and put it away, with an instrument made like a nedle, which must be
pressed into Coniunctiua, fixing it inward Transueraslie, till the nedle (which
the workman shall still behold, as it passes under Cornea,) shall come to
the water, which is placed before the hole of Pupilla, which doth prohibit
the sight. And then thou maiste put it dowen till the patient may see: and after
that put him.x. days in a dark house, in sylence, without noise and bind
upon the eye an Emplaster, de Bolo armeno, distemperato, cum albuinine oui, put
between.ii. pieces of linen cloth. But note well, that this cure is deceivable:
for it is seldom scene, that it turns not again. But yet I have scene some
not turn again. But if the Cataracte be not confirmed, it is healed with
often purging of the head, cum pilulis chochiis, Pichra.
Picra: and with abstinence from strong wine, and such things as cause fumes
in the head, provocations to vomit, and indigestion, and with a Collyrie of
Galls, which is made as follows. Rec. Fellis aquilae, Vel alterius
Cuiuslibet auis, Collyriu de Fellibus.
seu auium, ex rapina Viuentium, drachmas december, let them be dried. Euforbii,

juice of Fenell croppes.

But see that thou loke not, for a fulle doctrine of all diseases chauncynge to
the eyes, in this little book, which it conteyneth not: yet haste thou therein
certain good documents, which shall in their cases be proffitable. But if
thou desire a fulle and perfect doctrine: tarry thou for the end of the
treatice, which I purpose by Gods grace to perform. In the mean time,
(besechinge God to grant me time, place, to fulfil my purpose,) fear not to
work after these present doctrines.

And now take in good part, this proffitable Antidorye, promised in many
places of this book, conteinynge not only such medicynes, as are by any
thing treated of therein necessarily required: But also their commodious uses.
Which though they be few, yet are they such, as I have often proved.

As Repercussyues, Resolutyues, Maturatyues, Mollificatyues, Mundificatyues,
Conglutinatyues, Consolidatyues, Regeneratyues, Mollificatyues of stiff or
hardened joints. Ruptures, Corosyues, and Caustike medicines, with the making
of Oils.

The Antidotarie conteinynge. xi. Chapiters.
Of Repercussiues. Cap. i.
AS often as thou would Repercusse, it shall be good to purge the body: as
to evacuate whotte matter, by Phlebotomye if thy patient be strong: or with
Scarification if he be weak, and to pourge the womb by this sure medicine.

Recipe. Prunorum numero december. Violarum siccarum drachmam vnam.
Which must be added in the end of the Dccoctyon, which must be done, by
boiling these in one pound of water, till half be wasted. Then add
thereunto.

Thamarindorum Mannae. Medullae Cassiae Sing. vnciae dimidium.
And so let it boyle. ii. walmes. Then strain them out, pressynge them
strongly with thy hands. To the which straining, add in the evening.

Corticum Mirobalanorum Citrearum. Pistaciarum in puluere ana drach dimi.
Lettinge it stand so all night, and in the morning rathe, strain it
again, and so administer it warm, or else with Pills, which are made as
follows.

Recipe Mirobalanorum Citrearum. Rosarum rubearum ana drach vnam. Aloes
succotrinae, drachmas duas. Scammonii, drachmam semissem.
Fiant pillulae, whose dose is.iii. at one time.

The matter thus being evacuated, or at the least diminished, use thy medicines
Repercussiues, either symples or compounds, as cause requires.

Simple Repercussiues, without stoppinge the pores are these, Oleum Rosarum,
Solatrum.

Repercussiues that stop the pores, are such.

Portulaca domestica. Cucurbita.s. caro eius. Semper viuum. Crassula mayor.
Fabaria.
Simple Repercussiues, with little stoppyng of yt pores.

Cotyledon. Crassula minor. Intubum. Cichorium. Dipsacum.
Repercussiues, which are also Stupefactiues, are such as follow, but they
are not to be used, but in great necessity of intolerable payne.

Succus. Lactucae hortensis. Mandragorae. Papaueris. Hyosciami.
Opium.
Of things that are to be powdered, these following are good repercussiues.

Rosa. Santali omnes. Spodium. Gleba armeniae. Terra sigillata.
Of these simples, thou may make and use copounds, but if thou use iuises of
herbs, and would make them more penetratiue: ^dde unto them a little
vinegar.

Thus also may thou make a good compound repercussiue. Rec. De succo
alicuius Herbae de praedictis drachmas duas. Olei Rosati, vnciam vnam. Aceti,
drachmas quatuor.


Or thus: Rec. Olei Rosacei, vncias duas. Boli Armeni, drach semissem Aceti,
vnciae dimidium.
But if thou shalt fear the corruption of the member, add thereunto.

Terrae sigillatae, drach duas.
And this may thou apply (as a good Repercussyue, and proffitable
defensive) to any member: whereunto thou fear any course of the matter to
resort.

But if it be now come to the place, and so grown an Aposteme confirmed, or
the place be vlcerate, thou shalt then lay no Repercussyue thereon. But about
it, nyghe to the beginnynge of the payne, or place thereof. As for example* if
the payne be about the joint of the foot, lay thy medicine upon the same
joint, extendynge it somewhat upwards on the leg.

Of Repercussiues, and Defensines, if thou desire a fuller doctrine: read the
sacrade book of Rasis, de ^unct^ais, or else tarry for the finishing of our
book that is to come.

Could matter properlye is never repercussed, but sometimes the collection of
such humores, may be prohibited in the beginning, by evacuation of the
matter, and comfortinge the member. Whereunto doth much avail the exhibition
of Trocisces, of our master of famous memory, Guilbelmus de Saliceto, whose
composition is thus.

Rec. Turbith albi carnosi Gummosi. Diazingiberis ana drachmam vnam.
Hermodactilorum alborum, drach semis.
Of these make one Trocisce cum pauco Sirupo Violarum.

This Diazingiber, wherewith this present Trocisce is made is good to be taken
symplye every morning.

For a preparative to consume the residue of the matter, to whose composition is
required this order.

Comfortalyues, comfortynge and deffendynge the meber, that it receive not
could matter are these.

Absynthium. Schoenanthum. Abrotonum Spica Mastiche.
Rosa Oleum eiusdem, because it cale^yeth could members, (unless they be
vnmesurablye could,) and coleth whotte mebers. Boyle these things, cum Oleo
in diploma. And with the oil anoynte the member, or else thou may boyle them
in wine, and make an Emplaster, otherwise they may be made in powder, and
tempered with Oil, to make Epithema, and let this suffice for repercussiues.

Of Resolutiues, and Mollificatiues. Capi. ii.
ALlthoughe it be evident, that Resolutyues with Maturatyues, have great
affinitye in their qualities, (for they are temperatlye whotte:) yet herein
they differ, that Resolutyues have their substance heate. temperate, with
subtility. And therefore they open ye pores and draw the matter moderatlye.
They also comfort Radicalle heate, and help nature to expelle.

Now be it if they find much and gross matter, so that the pores suffice not,
(for their smallness,) to the excluding of the same, they do sometime
maturate.

Maturatyues have (beside their moderate heate,) a viscouse substance, whereby
in stoppinge the pores, they conserve natural heate in the place, and so do
they maturate. But if they find matter little in quantitye, and subtille of
substance, they resolve it. Wherefore it is found, that one, and the same
plaster, doth sometimes resolve, sometimes maturate.

Resolutyues simple are these.

Chamaemelum, which resolves, comfortynge also the member.

Melilotum flos eius. Oleum Anethinum seem eius. Malua siluestris. Parietaria
Sulphur Pinguedo Anseris, Anatis, Gasmae, And all fatnesses more or less.

And lay it all night in water, after boyle it well, and press it out, from

resolutiue.

Let all these be boiled together, till the substance incorporate, become
harder then an Unguente, and softer then an Emplaster.

Yet it is to be noted, that sometimes, although by resoluynge the matter, it
be also deminyshed: the residue nevertheless, is over much indurate. And then
thou must mollifye it, which thou may very well do* by washinge the
member lightly and softly, cum Aqua calida, until it ware red, and after
by anoyntinge it with an Unguen^e made, ex Olei Veteris, partibus quatuor,
Cerae part Una.

Another Resolutiue, very profitable for this purpose, which mollifies
Scrophules and Glandules, and prepares them to resolution, made thus.

Rec. Olei veteris, libras duas.
And put it in a glass cum radicibus Altheae, Cucumeris asinini mundatis, ana
Vnclam Vn^. and put the Glass, w^th the Oil and roots, in an other vessel
of Water, su^e-sufferynge it so to boyle, by the seethynge of the water, until
the rotes be somewhat fried. After strain it, adding to that straining, Cerae,
Vncias tres, in summer: but in Winter duas. and so shalt thou have a very
good Mollificatyue, wherwyth thou shalt mollifye, one, or.ii. or.iii. days,
and an other day thou shalt resolve, or as to thee it shall seem necessary.
And if thou put thereto, one tenth part of Euforbium: it shallbe very good
for the Spasme.

Of Maturatyues. Capi. iii.
MAturatyues are these.

Malua Hortensis, Pinguis radix Altheae Radix rumecis acuti. Radix Lilii albi.
Alium. Cepa. Rapa. Baucia
With also many other roots and herbs, and also

Foenumgraecum. Semen Lini. Medulla Tritici. Fermentum. Axungia porci.
And all compounds having temperate heate, with slymines.

A very good Maturatyue.
Which maturateth Sanguine Apostemes, and all Apostemes mixed with heat, and
also such as are prepared to quitture.

Rec. Foliorum maluae Hortensis. Violariae ana,.M. vnum. Altheae Radices duas.
After thou haste boiled these perfectly in water, strain them, and stamp
them finelye, and of the decoction strained, reserve one pound. Then take.

Olei veteris, vel axungiae veteris porcinae, non salitae, vncias tres. Farinae
seminis Lini. Farinae seminis Foenugraeci, ana vnciam vnam. Farinae Tritici
subtilissimae, vncias duas.
Incorporate all these, with the herbs and rotes, in the reserved decoction,
thereof make up an emplaster, meanly thick and liquid.

But note this, that it behooves thee not, to putt Foeman^ graecum therein, if
thou fear the inflammatyon of the matter.

Cold maters, thou shalt maturate with this Emplaster.

Rec. Cepam vnam. Alii, restam vnam, Oua duo.
All roasted under whotte ashes, and stamp them finely, whereunto add Fermenti
Acerimi, pondus omnium Ceterorum, and so tempering all together cum Oleo
Veteri, make an Emplaster.

For as much as Anthrax, and Carbunculus, are made of gross matter, (as is
aforesaid,) and are both, harde to touche, and ready to receive inflammation
of the matter: They will not other wise be maturate, but with a medicine of
incisyue nature, with maturation. Which is found in no one simple medicine, but
in Fermento, which (for as much as it is sweet, sharpe, and viscous,)
maturateth, by virtue of his swetnesse, and s^nynesse, and also cutteth and
sondereth the matter, by his sharpness so that it equally maturateth. Wherefore
in every harde matter, it is the fundamente and substance of Emplasters.

Take also this profitable compound plaster, which aggregateth these
intentions, (namelye maturation, and incision, to Carbunculum and Anthracem.

are, the nigher the rope, the fyner and smaller.) Being bruised with Axungia,
doth (as I have a thousand times proved) meruailouslye maturate Anthracem
Carbunculum.

Of Mundificatyues. Cap. iiii.
OF Mundificatyues, some do mundifye, with maturatien of the remanentes, and
they are very necessary, when we are constrained to open the apos^me, before
perfect maturity. Also when the matter is partly thynne, and soon maturateth,
and partly gross and disobediente to maturation: as in Scrophulis, Clandulis,
Bubonibus. And there are other simply mundificatyues.

To Apostemes well maturated, and to new Ulcers, thou may comodiously
apply this mundificatiue, which doth mundifye, incarne and aswage peine.

Rec. Vitellos Ouorum crudos, and incorporate them, cu subtili Farina Triticea,
in the manner of a Cataplasma, and spread it on a clothe, laying thereupon an
other, de Mell farina, mixed by equalle porcions.

If thou would have it more desiccatyue, put Farin^m Hordei in place of
Farina Tritici.

An other very good, and general mundificatiue, which mundifieth, with
maturation and opening of the pores, specially mete for apostemes opened
before due time: And is proper principally, to the mundification of the
Anthrax, and Carbunculus, and of all ulcers.

Rec. Mellis Albi boni. Farinae Triticeae subtilissimae, ana vncias duas.
Temper them first together, after add thereto.

Succi Apii vncias quatuor.
Then boyle them on a soft fire, stirring it continually till it come to
perfection.

And if thou would mundifye fraudulente Ulcers, whose malice thou feareste.
and their mutation into a Cacer: Then supply the place of Succus Apii, cum
succo Absinthii.

But if thou would maturate hardness, as in Scrophulis, Bubonibus, add
unto yt medicine de apio, half so much as that whole recepte. de Cepa, Lilio
Albo boiled in water, and well stamped.

A good mundificatyue, with comfortation of the place made, ex Melli Rosati
colati, Vnciis tribus. Farinae Hordeaceae subtilissimae, Vncia Una.

And if thou need this mundificatiue, for wounds in sinewye places, add
thereto Terebinthinae lotae, quartam totius partem.

Again, if thou would it should mundify more stroglye, adioyne therewyth
Sarcocollae, myrhae sextam totius partem.

And note, that the medicynes regeneratiues, here to be mentioned, are not
without some mundifyinge facultye. But yet are they more desiccatiue.

Vnguentum Apostolorum.
Which mundifyeth mortified Fistules, and Crustous ulcers, and allmoste all
old ulcers, whose confection is this.

that put them in a Calderon, melting also therwyth your wax, and resin in

triable things, and stir it strongly with a Spatula.

As medicines aggregatiues, Conglutinatyues, (which are al one:) do differ from
regeneratiues, and incarnatiues (which are both one:) So also, both the one,
the other, do differ from Consolidatyues, Citrikatiues, and Sigillatiues,
which are all one, and the same.

Of Conglutinatiues. Cap v.
First therefore, medicines Conglutinatyues, are such as gather together the
lips of woudes, wherein there is no loss of substance: and they are
desiccatiues, with a manner of Conglutinosity, without Abstersion. And there are
certain symples, which do this meruailouslye, as.

Calx. Folia Segetis syluestris Folia Liliialbi. Folia Plantaginis. Folia
Malorum. Folia Cypressi.
With many other.

Of Compound medicynes, there is one made de Calce, before described, in the
cure of wounds.

of wounds.

Rec. Rasurae panni linei veteris albissimi, ad Libitum.
Then take Oleum Rosatum, and infuse therein.

Parum Galbant.
And with these incorporate thy ^nte, in form of an vnguente, and it will
work the stronglier, if thou add parum corticum Thuris.

Of medicynes Regeneratiues. Cap. vi.
MEdicynes Regeneratyues, or incarnatyues, it behooves to have Abstersion, with
Exiccation, namelye to scour away gross superfluityes, to exiccate the
subtler: which ii. kinds are the gross superfluityes of the third
digestion: which are of necessity engendered, in every holowe wound. But
this do they differentlye. For in wounds of moist bodies, as of women,
children, E^chus.
evnuches, or of such as are naturally fat, medicines of little dryinge,
are necessary as. Thus. Vernix. Foenumgraecum. Litargirum. Mastiche. Aloe.
Farina Fabarum.
And such like.

But wounds of dry bodies, will of consequence require dryinge medicynes. As
are these.

Aristolochia. Iris. Farina orobi. Farina Lupinorum.
And these are much the dryer, if they be burned.

And farther if the wound have much quitture, it neadeth the stronger
oxiccation, but if it be little, less is required.

Of Compound regeneratyues, this powder is very good.

Rec. Thuris, vnciam vnam. Vernicis. Foenograeci, ana vncias duas.
Make of these a most fine powder, and put thereof into the wound abundantlye.

Litargirium nutritum also, ingendereth excellently good flesh, corrodeth the
euel, and removes the scabbe of the eye lid, and is nurished thus.

Reci. Litargirium, ad libitum, in very fine powder, and put thereto first,
de Oleo Rosato, and after de Aceto, by little and little, beatynge it continually
in a mortar, until it be much augmented, and has received the force of an
Unguente, and this rectefyeth, whott veterate Ulcers.

Of the symples aforsayde, thou may also make an Unguente, by adjoining,
Vnciam Vnam de puluere pradictoru. Olei Vncias quatuor Cerae Vnciam Vnam in
Semmer, or Vnciae dimidium in Winter.

Of Consolidatyue medicines. Cap. vii.
MEdicynes Consolidatyues, Sigillatiues, and Ci^atrizatiues, which engender
skyn are these, and such like. Litargirium. Cetaurium minus Ossa Combusta.
Cerussa Cortices pini. Resina sicca. Abrotonum assatum. Cortices Olibani.
Gallae. Nuces Cupressi. Curcuma. Balaustia
And many others.

Of compounds, the best in Summer, is Vnguentum Rasis de Cerussa, which is
good to ingeder skin, for burning of fire, whotte water and Oil. For all
excoriations, all whotte vlceratynge Pustules. To the alteration of any part
into heate, with many other. And thus may you make it.

Rec Olei Rosati, vncias quatuor. Cerussae. Cerae, ana vnciam vnam.
Incorporate all together, adding in the end.

Albumina ouorum duo, Caphurae drachmam vnam.
Another good Consoliditatyue.
Rec. Resina Albam, and boyle it in ^ceto acerimo, and power it out all
together, into a basin of could water, through a strainer. Then malaxe and
labour it, with hands first anointed, cum Oleo Rosato: until it be white,
and reserve it to your use. But in the Summer adioyne Cerae, partis dimidi.

Of the said simple medicines, if one part be take well powdered: and de Cera
resina ana pars media, de Oleo Rosato, parts quatuor, a good sigillatyue
vnguente may be made.

A very good Consolidatyue medicine, which consoudeth broken bones, and
confirms luxations, being reduced by cunning hand.

Rec. Farinae Cicerum, vel volaticae Molendini, librae semissem. Mastiches.
Tragacanthae. Gummi Arabici, ana vnciam vnam. Mummiae. Armeniae glebae, ana
vnciae dimidium.
Make them in fine powder, and mix them with the fine meal, incorporatynge
them altogether, cum albumine Oui, to the thickness of honey.

Of medicynes, supplynge stiff members. Chapi. viii.
WHen in any member being healed, (after fracture, luxation, or vlceration,
there remain harde, or stiff moving: then shall such medicynes be
proffitable, as have power to mollifye, to comfort the sinews, and to consume
the matter, received and contained, in and among the synewes. Whereof this
ensuing, is a very good one, which I have often used.

Rec. Bdelii. Opopanacis, ana vnciam vnam vel sem.
Mollifye them in Vino, and melt it at the fire. Pinguedinis. Porci, vncias
tres. Anseris. Anatis. Galinae, ana vnciam vnam.



So mixinge with them the Gummes. Or otherwise this. Rec. Terebinthinae. Cerae,
ana vnciam vnam,
adding thereto. Farinae foenograeci. Farinae seminis lini, ana vnciam vnam.
Mastiches. Thuris, sing* drachmas quatuor.


Vnguentu de adipibus also, is very good to mollify the hardness, and helps
Phthisin, Tussim aridam, if the breast be anointed therewith, and is thus made.

Rec. Pinguedinis. Anseris. Anatis. Galinae, Porci, omnium recentium
insalitarum Cerae Citrinae, ana.

Melt them all and strain them, which being coled, will be a good
resumptyue vnguente, profytable for many things.

Radices Altheae, Cucumeris asinini.
Also boiled, cum partibus tribus Olei, part Una Cerae, will make a good
mollificatyue. And if thou add Euforbii part duodecimam, it will be a
profitable vnguente, for a Spasmate member, and this of Mollificatiues
suffices.

But note this, that as often as thou wilt mollify, with these vnguentes: Thou
must first foment the member, cum aqua Calida, decoctionis.

Radicum Bismaluae. Foliorum Maluae. Florum Chamaemeli. Foenograeci, Seminis
Lini.
And after use the vnguentes.

Of medicynes vlceratiues. Cap. ix,
Simple medicines vlceratiues, and Cauteries are these. Cortices viticellae.
Apiu Haemorhoydarum Pes milui. Thapsia, Cantarides, Alliu mundatu, Cepa,
Scilla, Mel anacardi, Alumen fecum, Realgar, Calx viva, Vitriolum, Virideaes,
Flamula, Apium risus.
and many other.

Of compound medicines, that open apostemes, without instruments. Note these
insuynge.

Rec. Mellis anacardi. Picis naualis, ana parts aequales.
If thou have not Mel anacardi, thou maiste thus make it. If thou wilt put
Anacardos, into a whotte payer of smiths tongues, and bind them: There will
sweat out of them a honey, which is a Cauterye. Or else.

Rec. Saponis nigri liquidi, and corporate it, cum Calce Viva, and thou shalt
have a ruptorie vnguente.

Also incorporate Ventres Cantaridum, cum fermento, pauco aceto, so shalt thou
have a good vlceratiue medicine.

An other medicine, which valientlye, (but not violently,) corrodeth and
wastes superfluous flesh. Rec. Hermodactilorum. Floris aeris. Aristolochiae
rotnndae, ana.
Make them in powder.

An other stronger Corrosive medicine, and is very profitable in veterate
crustous Ulcers, and Fistules, and in some Cancers.

Rec. Succi Asphodeli, vnc sex. Calcis viuae vncias duas. Auripigmenti, vnciam
vnam.
Of these make Trochisces, and dry them in the shadow. The best time of making
them, is in August to be kept.

And when need is, to mundifye putrefied flesh, or crustous ulcers: break one
of them to poulder, and apply it to the ulcer.

And note, that as often as thou uses these medicynes, they ought not to be
removed: but suffered until it, with also the eschare thereby made, do of it
self lose, and fall away. And farther, if all the corrupted flesh be taken
away, or the Orifice sufficiently enlarged: it is well and may be mundifyed.

But if thy medicine, have not at full wrought thy will, in manner aforsaid:
Then Iterate thine Intention, so that thy later medicine, be less forcible, or
of less quatity, then the former.

Although we know, many other medicynes of this kind, and also of other
sorts above said: yet sparynge to lengthen time, now we omit them:
putting here but few light, and only proved things, according to my
promise, in the beginning of this work.

Of supplyng or losing medicynes. Cap. x.
MEdicines symples, to be laid on the eschare, made by Cauteries, actual or
potenciall, to souple or lose the same, are these.

Axungia Vetera porcina. Butirum insalitum. Lardum.
And all manner of vnctuouse things.

Compound medicynes of this kind are made, ex Brass^ca Rubea, baked cum
axungia Vetera, and also Cataplasmata, made ex Oleo, pinguedine, aqua.

Allbeit that this last written, of supplynge or losing medicines as well as
the Chapiter of Oils folowinge, be not found, in the common prynted Latin
books: yet because I have found the in other written copies, both English and
Latin. I thought it not good to omit them: namelye the former, because it
is promised before, in the Chapiter of the Fistula, that following, for the
necessary vtilitye thereof: which I translated out of a Latin written copy,
(lent to me, by my very good and benign friend, master Bacter as follows.

The manner of making Oils. Cap xi.
THe manner of making generalle oils, is variable, for they are of diverse
sorts, as Oleum de Ligno, Oleu de Fructibus, Oleu de Semi^ibus, and Oleum de
Floribus, c.

And first Oleum de Ligno, is thus made. Cut your wodde in pieces somewhat
small, and get you a pot, made fulle of holes, in the bothome, and fille it
full with your wodde so cut. Then get you an other whole pot, and set it
so deep into the earth, that the other pot which contains the wodde,
being set right upon it, may be with his upper part, even with the earth.
Then cover your uppermost pot, as close as you can, cum luto Figuli: and
then make a great fire over them, upon the clay, continuing the same, by the
space of a day, or a night. This done, take up your pots, reseruinge to
your use, all that you find in the lower pot.

Oleum de Floribus.
You may make thus.

Rec. Florum, vncias quatuor. Olei libram vnam.
Boyle them together a lunge time, in duplice Vase, then strain them through
a clothe, and put your Oil in a glass, adding thereto new flowers, as
many as before. Then set it in the Sun, the space of.xl. days. And farther,
if you would have your oil, could oil, you must put to it a little water of
a strong spring: and so let it stand a lunge time in the Sun.

Oleum de fructibus: vel de Baccis.
May be made sunderye ways, whereof this is one.

Take a good quantitye of berries, and bruise them well, putting them in Aqua
Tepida, and make them soft with your hands, put then your water and beries,
together in a Caulderne, and boyle them a lunge time: after strain all
through a cloth, into a broad vessel, and flete that clean off, which
swims above, kepinge it for your use.

Oleum de Seminibus
Is otherwise made thus.

Rec. Seminis Sinapii, or of some other sedes a good quantitye. Bruise them
small, laying them in a vessel, between ii. clothes, the space of.ix. days,
then put them in a little bag, and let the Oil be strained out.

Of the manner of making specialle Oils, take these few examples.

Oleum Laurinum.
Is good for the vehement could of Fevers, if you annoynte the patient
therwyth, on the reins of the back and other exteriore parts of the body
against a fire, whether it be the Oil of it self, or of the beryes, which
is otherwise made as thus.

Gather first your beryes, boyle them in Tribus libris Vini, then strain out
your liquore of beryes and wine, and put thereto Olei libras tres, letting it
boyle together again, till the wine be consumed.

Oleum Sabinae.
Rec. Sabinae, librastres.
Bruise it small and boyle it, in libris Tribus Olei, till a third part be
wasted, and that the Oil wax grene: Then strain it through a clothe and
reserve it.

Oleum de Absinthio.
Is a sovereign Oil, as well for fevers as all other doloures, and pains.

Rec. Absinthii mundissimi optimi, libra vnam.
Bruise it, and put it into as much Oil, as by reason you think sufficient,
make it up, as in Oleo Sabinae is said.

Oleum ex Ruta.
Which is good for peynes of the ears, also for peine and ache of the head,
and is made as is Oleum Sabinae.

Oleum Sinapis.
Is good ad Paralisn, and such other maladies.

Rec. Sinapii, libram vnam,
Bruise it, and infuse it.iii. days in libris duabus Olei, after boyle it well
and strain it. c.

Oleum Hederae.
Which is profitable ad Phrenitidem, and for the hedache. Take the beries
thereof bruise them, boyle them in sufficient quantity of oil effectually, and
strain it. c.

Oleum ex ouis Formicarum.
An oil very profytable against deafness, and payne in the ears.

Rec. Ouorum Formicarum, ad libitum.
Put them in a glass, cum Oleo, ad quantitatem sufficientem: lettinge it so
stand the space of.ix. days. After that set an other vessel over the fire
with water, into which water when it is what, put in your glass of oil, yt
by the boilynge of the water in the greater vessel, the Oil in the glass
may also boyle: and this is called Diploma, id est Was duplex, and of some
Balneum Mariae. When they have thus boiled, a sufficient space, strain your
oil from the eggs, through a clothe.

Thus ends the Antidotary.
The Conclusion.
WIth good will therefore, take in good part this little work, and by the
doctrine therein written, do thou surely work. For in it are contained,
(allthough it be short,) many good, sure, proffitable, and aproued things. But
if thou desire to obtain the perfection of this science, learn the principles
of Phisike, as ye knowledge of things naturalle, things not natural, and
things against nature. Learn also the Anatomy: which teaches the forms and
natures of compositions, In all the body, of all the members of the same, and
also of their helps: namelye the offices which they have in the body, and to
what vtilitye almighty God created them such, and so. And moreover frequent the
multitude of sick persons, and of their diseases, and meditate diligently,
the exquisite works of men learned, and expert. Note also, the causes and the
ends of diseases: with also their accidents, in the beginnynge, state, and
declination. And so by good reason, and lunge experimente, thou may at the
last, become a worthy Chirurgien, otherwise not: except allmightye God work
it, by pouringe on thee, his special grace. Whom I beseech to give thee his
grace, and me the forgeuenesse of my sins: to whom be all honour, and glory,
eternally. Amen.

Here ends the Table.
An expositiue table after the order of the Alphabet, wherein is declared all
strange words; with also the names and natures of diseases and symples, by
any occasion treated of in this work of Lanfranke, gathered by Ihon Halle
Chirurgien Very commodious to the use of all professors of the medicinal Art,
and especially to the Apothecaries that are desirous of perfect knowledge in
symples.

If reason may the justice be,
Of this my mind, the truth to try:
Howe can there be, despair in me,
No truth sith reason, can deny.
Happy it is, when men esteem:
All one in truth, the same to tell.
Let no man void, of reason deem:
Lest he against the truth rebel.
A Proheme to the Readers of this Table.
Although it has been the use of authors, to declare in the end of their
books, such strange terms and dark words, as may seem to some obscure: I
think it should not be needful always so to do, but that there is such
slackness in men, and negligence to learn, that they remain as vnperfecte as
a dull boy: who for lack of capacity could never proceed farther then his
cross row.

Alas is it not necessary that we grow from strength to strength, till we
come to a full perfection? Why should we persuade our selves, to stand at
that staye, with that sect of Phisiciens, which have called them selves
Empiricos, or as we call them practisers: not because they help their art
first grounded on learning and reason, by practisinge of any new thing
them selves: but because they only observe that which they have seen others
do, be it never so base or slender, without any farther consideration: even
as some also at this day think one salve sufficient for all sores, or with
one water to heal or cure all diseases, which is as possible, as one shoe to
serve justly every man foot. Or should we not rather solow the learned
sect named Dogmatici: sekinge still for learning, and using the same by
reason, till we have perfect knowledge? And what is more coducible to
perfection, then the knowledge of symples, with their names and natures: in
such wise that knowing the nature of the infirmity, there may thereby,
through natural reason, (ye though there were no practice,) be procured a
spedy remedy? Oh that ever we should call our selves men of science, and yet
as though there were no science, we be ignorant of those things that we
should chieflye know, being planted amongst us.

In this case we are like the cock, that Esope speaks of, which in a dung
heap found a precious stone, and only wondering thereat, wished rather for a
barlye corn, to satisfy his hunger: what is a man the better for a Jewel, of
the which he understands not the virtue, nor knows the value? Let us
therefore endeavour our selves to know the symples, specially herbs, with
their virtues, that we need not seek for strange drouges, of far countries:
For truly I think, nature here in our natural country hath not brought us
forth, leaving us destitute of necessary medicines to help our diseases, but
rather has created here amongst us, more apt things for our bodies, then
strange drouges fet so far fro strange nations: which err they come here,
have sustained so many wethers, abide so many markets, that they are through
age withered to dust. Therefore, as in this little book of Lanfranke, there be
excellent medicynes, to cure diseases with small composityons and light cost,
and that chieflye with symples: so for the necessary knowledge of the natures
and names of those symples, I have made this table, after the order of the
Alphebet, that any such as shall happen to be doubted of, may easily be
found: so that considering the natures of the symples, natural reason may
persuade the mind, of the noble and assured virtues of the medicines. For the
good Chirurgien knows by the natures of the symples, whether it stand with
reason, the medicine to cure the disease it was ordained for or not: therefore,
among all other, it is a most laudable study, to know the natures of
symples. And in this work ye shall perceive that (in diverse things) I differ
from the common opinion, which many times erroniously uses one thing for an
other: even as the Apothecaries also (for lack of knowledge) do oft sell one
thing for an other: as by occasion in this table, ye shall find the same by
the truth confuted.

For though some may note it a kind of presumption, to vary from the common
opinion: yet may I answer with Aristotle, that Plato is my friend and so is
Socrates, but the truth before them both. And as mine opinion agrees with
the truth, I wish it only accepted, and where it will not stand with reason
and truth, to be rejected as an vntruthe, and a thing not worthy of credit.

For as Plato that divine Philosopher says: if men in reasoning, as much
desired the truth of the thing it self, as they do the maintenance of their
own opinions, glory of their wits, there should not breed so much hatred as
there doth, nor half so many matters be left vnconcluded. And as seems to me
this worthy sentence of good Doctor Record, (in the.iiii. book of his castle
of knowledge, in the 129. page), may serve well in the like sense.

Often have I red in Galen (saith he,) and more often have I scene it by
experience, yt better it is for men to want all art of reasoning clean, then
to have such confidence in a mean knowledge thereof, as may cause them to
deceive them selves, and to seduce other. As truth therefore with reason will
approve these judgements, I only wish them to be credited of the studious
reader, and otherwise not. For as I would gladly my self embrace the most
truth, so wold I desire my doings to be considered with most true authors,
without partialitye.

But saying I have moved here, the study concerning the knowledge of herbs,
I think it good to remember, the scornynge ignorance of some, which because
they are not expert in the knowledge of symples, scorn the diligence of all
other that travel therein: as though it were a thing without fruit or
profit, thinking thereby to cover their neglygence, while they upbraid with
opprobry the diligence of other men.

For as (in the year of our Lord a thousand five hundred fifty and seven,) I
came through Bucklersbury: lo a certain woman came to sell herbs, to the
Apothecaries: and asked if they would buy maiden hear. And they desieringe
to see it, she showed to them an herb.

Nothing agreinge with that which she named: But only that it had round
leaves, standing in good order on each side the stalk, as maiden hear has:
but it had little flowers like belles, somewhat redishe, mixed with white, with
a grene stalk, and thick leues full of iuse: and in all points most
agreinge in likeness to Nummularia, otherwise called Centum Morbia, and in
English two penny grass: saving that it was many parts less, and almost as
small in deed as Trichomanes, which we call in English maiden hear.

Because I never saw it before, I toke a small part thereof, bare it with me, if
happily I might meet with any, that knew it, and so to attain the name
thereof. And truly, before that hour were fully at an end, I fortuned
(through the societye of my reverend friend master Gale Chirurgien of London,)
to come into the company of a Phisicien a stranger borne: whom (after diverse
communications,) I desired to show me his opinion of that herb: which when he
had well viewed and also tasted, he answered, yt he knew it not. And because he
esteemed it a dishonour unto him without some excuse or cauilation, he said it
made no matter to be so precise in the knowledge of herbs: for said he, what
need I occupy many herbs in a medicine, whereas one will serve? or what need
I confecte together Solanum, Papauer, Hiosiamus, Mandragora, and Lactuca, when
only Hiosiamus, or only Papauer will serve my turn? unto whom I thus
answered. Sir (under your correction) I grant it to be true, that many
symples need not be put together, where one will serve the turn, and affirm
farthermore that it ought not: for as much as Galen him self gives counsel
never to use compounds, where symples will serve. But how shall I know that
Mandragora will serve the turn of Papauer, or Lactuca of Solanum, or Hiosiamus
of any of them, if I first know them not all? doth not diverse regions bring
forth diverse herbs, according to the diversities of soils, and natures of
heavenly climates? some place brings forth Hiosiamum and none of the other
that ye named: and an other place, an other, without the rest. If now I know
not the natures of all, I shall sometime think that it is unpossible to do a
thing, because I lack there mine old practise. As for example. I would do
it with Malua, and none grows there: whereas yet the earth brings forth
herbs of the same nature in an other form: which nevertheless serves not
my want, and that because I know them not. Wherefore I conclude, that although
diseases may be cured with never so few, yet is it necessary to know them all.
And though he could not deny this, yet he fell in rebuking of Uigo, because
in his medicines he uses such great composityons, and said plainly that
Uigo in that point was a fool: so grossly master doctor termed him. But I
perceive what procured master Phissicien to be offended with Uigo, he plays
the Phisicien so much in all his works: for in the most part of diseases
that he writes of, he describes an order of life, and also purgation, to take
away the original cause: Happy was he, that he dwelled amongst the Phisitiens
of Rome and Italye: for if he had dwelled in this region, he must not have put
his own knowledge in use, but have left that to our doctores. Well the time
would not then serve us any more to reason, but here will I say somewhat in
Uigo his defence. Whereas ye call Uigo fool, because of his great
compositions costly medicynes, I answer. Then was Galen also a fool, so was
Auicen and Mesues, with diverse other, who devised the great compositions of
Theriaca and Mithridatium: which (for all your wisdom) in your most weighty
affairs ye are constreigned to use, for your gain and worship. Or why may
not any man put in wrytinge a great composition, wherein he hath found
utility, that other after him may do the like by his example? But if any man
can ^oe the like, with any one or two, the symples chosen out of so many: what
hinderace is the composition to the simple medicine? But I say, that in the
most part of medicines, ye must of necessity use compositions, for
otherwise truly the wisest may fortune to err and work folishly, and that
specially in inward medicines, namelye purgations: for as Mesues saith, there is
no simple purging medicine that can be taken, that leaves not behind it some
hurt in the body. For the which cause, it is necessary to compose with them,
such things as have power to defend the body from the said hurts, by
qualifyfying the hurtful proprety of the medicine.

It may please you therefore, to leave your blamyinge of Uigo: or elsse if his
doings like you not, set your pen to the book, and make a more perfect
work: So shall the common wea^ give you thanks. Otherwise we must
necessarily judge, that ye speak such vprobrious words against Uigo, out of
the mouth of envy.

In the mean season, Jexhort all my brethren Chirurgiens, that they (after due
travels taken in the former parts) most diligently study, the knowledge of
symples and the natures of them, from the most to the least, so shall you have
perfect knowledge how to work: whether it be with symples or compounds, many
or few.

For though Diogines threw away his drinking dish as a superfluous thing,
when he saw an other poor man drink in his bare hand, yet is it not euell a
man to have in his house pots and glasses, yea goblets of silver cups of
gould: for his hand is never the farther from him, wherein he may drink if he
lift, or when need constreigneth him, for lack of an other vessel. What if
Diogenes had seen a man lye along by a river side, drinking of the water
only with his mouth as doth a beast, would he also (trow ye) have thrown
away his hand?

The laboring man, the poor plough man, lives as long in good health, with
martelmasse beffe, bakon, homely cheese, course bread and ^hin drink: as the
richest noble man, withal his deintye fare he can devise. Is it necessary
that princes and noble men therefore, shallbe driven to that fare, because pore
men can so live? There are diverse barbarous nations of people, that live only
with herbs roots, is it necessary therefore, that we shall leave our flesh,
and fish, and wholesome bread? It is an old saying, that store is no sore, and
plety no deinty. Is it not better to know so much, that I may take and leave,
then to know so little, that I shall many times lack?

Hinder not the diligent minds therefore, of such as wold learn: for though
some think it a thing vnmete for their age to learn, yet wherefore should they
discourage youg me, for whose estate and age, it is most meet to seek for
knowledge? For which cause Aristotle councelled men in their youth to learn,
ye (says he) allthough it be painful for it is less peyne for a man to
learn in his youth, then in age to be vncunninge.

Oh worthy saying. This sentence of Aristotle, I wish rather to be weighed and
followed, then that any man mind should be removed from study and diligence
to learn, with fond persuasions. Some will say, I am an old man, and have
done great cures, and never knew so much: and my master before me was an
ancient man, and was never so curious.

Surely science at some time flourishes, which in time to come is darkened
again by ignorance: so that time makes all things old, and after brings
forth that old things again, causing them to be called new.

The frutefull books of Dioscorides, Hippocrates, Galen, and Plini, are old
and ancient things: ye they were counted so old, that some of them with most
men were worn out of mind, and the goodly doctrines also contained in them.
Yet time bringing forth the same things again in other men, they are called
new learning, ye of some new fagles: though it be the very same ancient
things, no thing elsse. Such an enemy unto knowledge is ignorance, evermore
murmuring and grudging thereat, with heinous reproach.

Therefore let all men, that mind to have perfection of any good science, arm
them selves with patience and constacy, and regard not such vain jangling: but
go forth to your business, not caring for their bablinge, even as you may see
the very great and stout horses, showing the like example: which pass forth
on their way, not once regarding the barking of cures, nor showing any token
of reuengment: for even such jangling will time wear and wast, and consume
also such envious disdain. Accept my good will therefore I most heartily
desire you, all ye that love, to learn: for as I loke at your hands to find
good report and love (which is the fruit of a good gentle inclination: (so I
loke at the hands of the envious ignorant for none other, but the fruit of
their beastly nature. So that in fine it seems that of them I may thus justly
conclude.

LIke as the fly, that fedeth styll,
In vile corrupt degre:
Doth still despise and hate as ill,
All herbs that wholesome be.
And as the man, whose trade was aye:
To scour the fylthye gonge,
Of spicers shops was wont to say:
They stinked very strong.
Or as the swynes filthy desire:
Doth flee each wholesome place,
And for to walow in the mire,
More gladly doth embrace.
In wicked men so wickedness,
Will always have a sway:
Dispraising still, through hatefulness,
Each good and perfect way.
Fare ye well.
Thomas Halle to the gentle Readers, that thirst for science, wishes the
increase of knowledge in good things, and as to him self a Christian
felicity.
Seeing that (dere brethren) to publish these gestes, to the prospect and
judgment of the rude multitude (from whose face then it can not be kept,) is
an enterprise no less dangerous, then to commit a skiff or small whirey
charged, to horrible tempests on the raging seas: howe great cause hath my
brother had, to detract or delay the time of publishing the same? yea how
little marvel had it been, if when it was finyshed, he had never done it? So it
might otherwise have ioinde to our hands: for whose sakes he both took the
pains, and is content to bear the bitter wounds of scornful sclaunders
darts, shot always by the arm of ignorance. Not doubting thy good nature
to be ever pressed, to think and say the best, and to take all things
tolerable in good part, whereby thou may render to him his hearts desire:
which is also no more then duty, for of mere good will I ensure thee he
has done it. Though perhaps it may more please some man to judge with less
love, yt vain glory was hereof the efficient cause. to whom I say, that
vain in dede are all men and their thoughts: nether is there any thing as
the Apostle says, wherein we should rejoice, or whereof we should boast,
but only the cross of Christ: yt is, his paciet death guiltless sufferace,
for us wretches. In respect whereof all other things are very vain. And Gloria
saith Seneca, vanu volatile quidda est, aura^ mobilius. That is glory is a vain
and fletyng thing, and more wavering then the wind. Which vain glory in
deed (as he also notes in an other Epistle, couplinge it with ambition,)
has doubtless caused diverse high potentates to attempt many dangerous, yea
and sometime most wicked enterpryces. And is no doubt at this day one vice
cleauinge almost in every man bosom: so large is follies reign.

But as like Parasites with frivolous adulatyons, to rock such fools a
sleep (to whom it wear much more meet with bitter taunts to bridle their
endless arrogancye,) it is not a womanly folly, but a very wickedness, yea
more then bestial: so to withhold good report, (which is Vera virtutis
gloria,) from any that hath of mere good will (by any virtuous travel)
profited the common weal, or (which is worse) in stead thereof to calumniate,
is a heathenish injury: (but I might more rightly say an injury, which ought
among ye godlesse heathen rather to be sought, but alas which is now among us
christians much more frequent.) For who plants a vyneyarde, tastes not of
the fruit? who fedeth a flock, and cateth not of the milk?

Of this glory (as contrary to the former as light unto darkness) Seneca
speaking in Epistola. 80. ad Lucilium says, Gloria vmbra virtutis est, etiam
inuitos comitabitur. Sed quemadmodum aliquan do vmbra antecedit, aliquando
sequitur, vel a tergo est: Ita gloria aliquando ante nos est, visendamque se
praebet, aliquando in averso est, maiorque quo serior, vbi inuidia secessit.
That is: glory is the shadow of virtue, and will accompany even such as are
not desirous of her, or covet her not. But as the shadow goes sometimes
before, and sometime follows, or is behind: even so is glory sometime before
us, and offers her self to be scene and sometimes after or behind us. And the
later, the greater it is, when envy has given plac^.

Hereof also Cicero in Laelio saith, Praestantes viri nunquam tanta conati
essent, quae ad posteritatis memoriam pertinerent, ni animo vidissent
posteritatem ad se pertinere posse. Nonne melius multo fuisset, otio sam
aetatem quietam sine vllo labore contentione traducere? Worthy men says he,
would never attempt so great things, that might continue unto posterity,
unless they did foresee that the posterity might belong unto them: For
wear it not elsse much better to lead an idle and quiet life, without any
labour or contention?

And who so will from time to time, mark the conditions of all ages: shall
scant find one, that for his labours taken, and perils sustained, Cicero
proarch poeta.
desires not glory as a reward for his deeds. For the Philosophers them
selves, even in the books that they wrote in the contempt of glory, have
written their own names: so that wherein they despise fame, and nobility, yet
would they have them selves named, made famoue.

And again he says. Nullam virtus aliam mercedem laborum, periculorumque
desiderat, praeter laudis gloria: Qua quidem de tracta, quid est (...) in hoc
tam exiguo vitae curriculo, tam breui, tantis nos in laboribus exerceamus? To
say, virtue desires none other recompense of her labours and perils, but
praise and glory: which being taken away, what is there, for the which we
should in so small and short a course of life, vex our selves with so great
labours. A like saying he has in his Philippicis.

Nullam mercedem tanta virtus, praeter hanc laudis et gloria de siderat: qua
etiam si careat, tamen est seipsa contenta. Quanquam in memoria gratoru hoim,
tanquam in luce posita letetur. which is, Virtue only desires none other
reward, but laud glory: which truly if she lack, yet is she contented:
although she rejoice in the memory of thankful men, as placed in the light.
Lo hear see you that true glory or honest fame, is the good report of just
men, for virtuous travels, and honest deserts: a debt which the benefyte
receivers ought most willingly to pay, though not of the deservers to be
over busilye craved, seeing that as of the wicked, (whose love is envy, and his
praise sclaunder,) it can not be had: so of the virtuous, who is never
vnthakfull, it can not be wythholden.

And whether I may in my brother his behalf, require this at your hands, as a
well deserved duty, let the thing it self with his fruit be judge (least I
should say more then me besemeth.) Is first in traslating, and reducing to
perfection, Lanfrancus his little work of surgery, (not the worst writer
of that age, as his so much profytable doctrine, in such brevity, doth right
will declare.) Then for his exposityue table thereof, which he has gathered
and adjoined thereto. And lastly for his Anatomy in the end: both the which,
he has (at my suit partly) decked with the Greek, as well as the Latin names,
of symples, diseases, members. c. as the purpose of teachinge the youger sort
gave occasion: that such as are as well as I, desirous of knowledge in both
the tongues, might layntlye receive some vtilitye, (or at least delight)
thereby: Trusting that others will fauorablye permit the same, as a thing to
them though not delightful, yet no impediment.

In reading all the which, I trust you will not repent your pains, for truly
these for the most part are not his, but (as ye may easily see,) the
authorities of the most worthy, and best approved wryters, wherein if you shall
find any thing, (whether it be his own, or among the authorities,) to be
misliked: Examine it first with reason, vpryghte judgment, and like
authorities. By all the which if it be found faulty: Consider, that hominis
est errare, (neither has any man as I suppose in humane sciences, otherwise
written,) and that much better it is to err, with the learned and under
correction, then singularly of self will or stubberne opinyon.

But opinyon is now a days so beloved, that men had much rather with tooth
nail defend the same (yea though truth be thereby utterly defaced,) the to give
over to reason or good authority. which thing right well notes Seneca saying.
Inter cetera mortalltatis incommoda, haec est caligo metiu, nec tantu
necessitas errandi, sed erro^u amor. That is among other discommedities of
mortal men, this is the darkness of minds: not only the necessity of
errynge, but also the love of the same.

Whom therefore shall I judge more happy and wise, then him that is free from
error, or at least no slave to opinion: Then the which there is not a greater
enemy to truth and perfect knowledge. Both the which loving brethren, I
beseech the eternal God to plant in us, to his endless glory, and the
profit of his creatures, and to the utter banishment of that ugly monster
Ignorance.

Valet.
LIke as an artiste base and rude,
All men do him repute:
who knows not the instruments,
wherewith to execute.
The parts belonging to his art:
Even so of right good skill
A perfect artist must them know
And use them at his will.
But if base arts do this thing crave,
As that most needful is:
What shall surgerye then think you?
Has she no need of this?
Yes yes, none more, if ye do mark,
That without instrument,
The surgyen can not use his art,
Nor compass his intent.
Then if to know the instruments,
It is so great again:
How are we bound with thankful minds,
To recompense their pain:
who by great labours do attempt,
Those instruments to show?
Among whom Ihon Hall lately did
His diligence bestow.
Setting out to his country men,
That surgerye profess,
The medicinal instruments,
with their true use doutlesse.
As herbs, roots, seades, flowers and iuse,
Gum, bark, fruit, and eke wood,
with sondry earths and mineralles,
And stones with metalles good.
what earth or water forth do bring,
To serve the surgiens need,
Exactly penned in this book
Most easily you may rede.
Be thankful to this Halle therefore,
Or elsse be thou silent.
Harpocrates be, let Momus
From thee be far absent.
Ihon Yates Chirurgien.

SInce now dere reader for thy sake,
Such profitable fruit to find,
Thy friend refused no pains to take,
Show not thy self to him unkind.
For nothing else doth he desire,
But honest fame and glory true:
Which virtuous travels do require,
A recompense as small as due.
But envy and vain pride so flovves,
That no man may so well do ought,
That scorn and sclander shall not know,
Though his good will else what have bought.
The Preface
But one thing yet I must warn all young men of, that will profit in such
study as I have instructed, which is in one point to refrain and descent
from the most part of young men: that is to say, from games and spending the
time in play: for in my fantasy, who so ever is adicte to play games shall
never profit in this art. For thou shalt find it time little enough for thy
study, if thou occupy all thy leysour from thy masters or thine own business
at thy book, that as thou workest or see thy master work: so thou may
therewith understand the reason how, and howe much such work is profytable.

And hereof assure thy self, that if thou have not as great desire to thy
book, as the greatest gamner hath to his game, thou shalt never worthily be
called cunning in this art. For thou must think and esteem all time of leisure
from thy work and busynes, even lost and evil bestowed, in which thou hast
not profyted somewhat at thy book. Let thy book therefore, I say, be thy pastime
and game: which (if thou love it as thou ought) will so delight thee, that
thou shalt think no time so well bestowed as at it. Yea thou must desire it
as the child doth his mothers pap: and so will it nourish thee, that thou
shalt worthily grow and increace to a worshipful same of cunning and
learning.

And now whatsoever unto this work is added by me, as the Expositiue Table,
and the natomie: I most hartyly desire al the good Readers to interpret it to
the best, regarding the good will of the worker, rather then thexcellency of
the work, which I confess to be very faint: trusting that all such as in
those things are my masters and betters, will rather seek the redress and
amedement of such things as to them shall seem faulty, then disdaynfully to
reprehend my good will, in setting forth of this work. But as I fear it not
in any godly or charitable personage: so am I past care, what be said of such
disdayners as speak euel of the doings of all men, and yet will do nothing
that good is them selves. Not considering that a humane creature is not borne
into this world, only to profit himself, but much rather to gratify his
friends and country (as Cicero saith) besides Christian charity, which
binds us to profy^e all men. And our saviour Christ warns us, that no man
hyde his talent. Thus (wyshyng to the gentle readers their hearts desire, that
travail for the perfectness of this art, even as unto my self in my most
weighty affairs:) I end this my simple Preface.

Unto his faithful friend and disciple Bernard: Lanfranke of Milayne, wishes
increase of wisdom, and cunning.
I VVYLL thee to understand, my dere and loving friend, that (through the grace
of God, the author of all goodness:) I purpose to make a book here after,
wherein I will give to thee an ample and large doctrine, sufficyente for thy
fulle instruction, in the most excellent Art of Surgery.

For in this present little work: I intend to give thee but few things and
light, but true proved, the which allbeit that they be short, yet are they of
great commodity and profit.

Set them not at nought: but dispose thy self, fully to trust in them: for
principally, according to thy purpose, I have written proved medicines, with
the manner of curing wounds, Apostemes, Ulcers, and Fistules, with a little of
Algebra, and some curations for the eyes, after the manner, as reason taught me
to work, and by experiment of a lunge time, has been by me roborate and
strengthened.

Trusting so much to the subtilty of thine intellection, that by thy wit,
with these few things, thou shalt gather sufficient understanding, to
comprehend the knowledge of a greater work, and that thou shalt thereby obtain
the name of a great and renowned Chirurgien.

(...) don, Kent, and Essexe. The third is Santonicum, so called of Santonia,
Absinthium Santonicum.
(a region in France named now Xantongue,) and therefore in English not
vnaptlye French Wormwode. The best of these to be put in inward medicines, is
the Potike or Roman Wormwode: neither ought any other kind to be used in
stead thereof: though none of them be without their singular virtues. Pontike
Wormwode, (saith Galen) is less what then all the rest, De sym. med. facul.
li. 6.
having much adstriction, but no less drying. Santonicu is next in faculties,
but somewhat weaker then Scriphio: in heating, drying, and extenuation.
Scriphium is colder then Abrotono, but whotter then Pontico, and enemy to the
stomach: for that it has (with his bitterness:) a certain saltness, and
also some adstriction, though but little: so are also Abrotonum, and
Santonicum: only Ponticum is acceptable to the stomach, and of teperament
what in the first degre, and dry in the third.

Acacia.
MEn use commonly the juice of Sloes for Acacia, which is not so* for Acacia is
a thorny tree, growing in Egipt, having white sedes closed in coddes, wherowte
is pressed a juice: which being dried is occupied in medicines, De sym. med.
facul. li. 6.
under this name Acacia. It dries after Galen in yt third degree, and cools
(being washed) in the second: but vnwashed in the first, (for by washinge it
loses his sharpness:) and is of an earthly substance, having therewith watery,
and also whotte and thin parts. Where it is laid, it leaves the place dried
contracted. The gum of this tree is the true gum Arabike.

Acanthus.
BRanca Vrsina: Acantha.
(which is called in Greek (...), in latin Acanthus, Paederota.
and Paederota,) is called in English bears breche, and not bears foot, as
some abusiuely both say and use, despysinge such as would reform their
accustomed error. Dioscorides appoints to Acantho leaves like letuce, but
larger, longer, and indented as Eruca: whereby it is evident, that it can not be
bearefote.

Bears breche grows in gardines, the leaves whereof (saith Galen) obtain a
moderate digestinge faculty. Li. 6. de sym. medi. facul.
The root is desiccatiue, and lightly incisiue, consisting of thin or tether
parts, and is one of the.iiii. principal mollificatiues.

Accidentia.
ACcidens generally, betokens things chancing, or belonging to substances,
which they may have or lack, without corruption of the same. But accidets
are Phisicallye of Galen thus defined, in the end of his first book. De
methodo medendi.

Those things, that do necessarilye follow that constitution, from whence
grows an action: in us being whole are named Accidentia: Symptomata. (...).
id est in cursus concursus, uelcasus.
but if we be sick (...). Yet are accidents notes also of griefs, after his
mind, li. i. de locis affectis, saying. Ex propriis accidentibus etiam
innotescit affectus locus: nam ore Ventriculi affecto, f^tidium infestat. That
is a place affected is known by his proper accidents: as the mouth of the
stomach affected, lothsomnesse infesteth the same. And these are termed of
our English Phisike wryters, to falls, or wythfalles.

Acetum.
CAlled in Greek (...), Oxos. Galenus de sym. med. fac. li. 8. de copositione
medicametoru se cudu loca li. 3.
consists of substances, both whotte and cold, and they both of tender
parts, (wherein yet cold has the masterye,) and dries in the third degree,
and has Repercussyue, Tenuatynge, and discussyue virtues. But yet dyffereth
it in faculties, according to the temperamente of the Wine, whereof it is made.
As if it be made of small wynes, if coleth effectually inflammations, and
repells whotte colerike swellinges, as in Oxicrato.

Acorus.
Which the Grecians call (...), Acoron. Galenus de symp, medi. lib. 6.
has a root somewhat bitter, and of pleasant odour, and is whotte and dry
in the third degree, and of subtille consistence: and therefore moves urine,
dissolveth indurate splenes, extenuateth, and wypeth away the hardness of the
panicle Ceratocides: For the panicle Ceratocides look in rain Anamye.
whereunto ye juice serves best. And because it is thought not to grow with
us, we may after the minds of some, substitute for it Calamum odoratum: or as
Galen wills, Radicem Asari. For truly they err very much, Calamus
adoratus.
that use Gladiolo luteo for Acoro. But Doctor Turner takes rather Galangam
maiorem for divers reasons to be Acorum, Radix asari.
then Calamum aromaticum, as divers have thought. Galanga mayor


Adeps.
FOr yt better understanding of these words Adeps, Oxyngion.
S^uum, Axungia, S^uum.
(called in Greek (...)) and Pinguedo, (named in Greek (...)) and their
differeces: Pimele.
I refferre you to my Anatomye a place for that most mete. All the which are
in compositions of medicines (though the Interpretors of Galen do much
frequent this word adeps,) without precise difference used for such
greases, suets, or fattines as are tried from the bodies of beasts. c.

Of the which Adeps Leoninus, (saith Galen) doth most valientlye as well
heate as digest. Galenus li. 4 5. et. ii. de symp. med. facultatib.
Whereunto adeps pardi, has the next place, which mollifyeth moderately. The
power of adeps anserinus, is less heatynge and digestynge, but somewhat more
mollifyinge, and consists of subtille parts, as doth the fat of all
birds. A little differynge from this is adeps galinaceus, ac li. 7. de comp
medi. secundum gnera.
consistinge as in a mean: and is a most familiar medicine, for inflammations.
Adeps suillus, is of all other fattes, the softest, moystest and weakest and
therefore is convenient for tender bodies. Now Adeps Capraru, Boum: how much
the stroger they are, then adeps porci: so much the more fyttlye agree they,
with bodies of harder, or stroger nature, unto scirhous hardnesses. c. The
fattes morouer of masculyne beasts are always the whotter and dryer: of the
female contrary, and of ye male gelded, it is ever like to that of the female.

Adustio.
ADustion, is as well the burning of medicynes, by materialle fire, as of
humores in the body, by the excessive distemperature, of potencialle heate
therein: Whereof they are called aduste, or burned humores.

Aerugo.
LOke for it at Flos aris, and at Viride as.

Aes vstum.
BUrned brass is of a desiccatyue, and vehement scouringe faculty: but
whotter, and more abstersiue, Dioscoride^ li. 5.
then burned lead. It binds, dries, represses, thinneth, and draws. It
purges also and heals ulcers, amends the faults of the eyes, cosumeth
fleshye excrescentes: and restreigneth crepinge, and corrodinge ulcers.

Aggregatiua medicamenta.
MEdicines aggregatiues, are such as have virtue to gather, or bring
together, the brims of a wound, or ulcer. Which is to be done after perfect
mundification and Incarnation.

Agresta.
Although Agresta which the Grecians call (...): Omphacium.
be properlye the liquor of unripe grapes, Latin etiam.
pressed out, Omphacion.
(which some have ignorantly interpreted the juice of Sorrel.) I think the
juice of Crabs, which we call commoly veriuce, may be safely, or without
great error, used for Agresta. And that the rather, because Lanfrancus in the
cure of Carbunculi. Wills Succum pomorum Agrestium, to be taken in such
sort as he often before had done Agrestam.

Ueriuce is of cold and dry facultye, whereby it aswageth and represses, the
inflammations of ardent humours, and sharpe, whereby it cutteth and thinneth
gross, tough Phlegm. And is much praised, in comforting the weakness of the
hart, and in swooning. The Crab tree is named in Latin Malus Syluestris.
Malus Syluestris.


Albula.
THat whytnesse of yt Puppill, or utter part of the eye, which Lanfranke
calls Albulam, interpretyng it Cicatricem, is called of others Albugo, and of
some Panus, accomptyng thereof Albugo.
. ii. sorts: namely Albugotenuis, called in Greek (...) id est Nubecula,
Nephelion.
that is a little cloud, and Albugo Crassa, which is thought to be called in
Greek (...), Argema.
wherein the black of the eye is white, and the white of the same red.
Argemos.


Algebra,
THis Araby word Algebra sygnifyeth as well fractures: Fractura aut
restauratio ei^s.
(as of bones, c.) as sometime the restauratyon of the same.

Allium.
ALlium domesticum uel Satiuum, Scorodon (...).
which the Greeks call (...), heats and dries by the sentence of Gale in
the. iiii. excess, Ophioscorodon.
wherein (...), (id est Allium Agreste, Scorodon Agrion.
that is wild Garlic) is the more potente.

Aloe.
ALo^ is commonly numbered (among wryters) of two kinds only, although there be
found among the Apothecaries in common practice three sorts to be sold: namely,
Aloe Succotrina.
Succotrina, Hepatica, Cabalina. But who so reads Dioscoridem, Aloe Hepatica.
and other ancient wryters, shall perceive that they knew but of two sorts,
as one fine and pure, which some call Aloen Hepaticam. The other, which
(because it is full of dross and sand) seems to be the bothome or refuse of
the pure juice, they name Aloen Cabalinan, Aloe Cab^lina
because (as I suppose) it not being mete for man his body, was only used to
heal the diseases of horses. But of yt purest I judge there is none other
difference, but that the same which one author calls Hepaticam, another
calls Succotrinam, which also moved Iacobus Syluius to report that
Dioscorides and Haliabbas praise Aloen Hepaticam: but Auicenna and Mesues Aloen
Succotrinam. It is the juice of an herb, called in Greek (...): and in Latin
semper Viuum Marinum: In English herb Aloes, or sea Aigren: whose juice is
brought to us fro Indi^ (for there grows the best,) is a proffitable medicin
for many things, Galenus, de sym. med. li. 6
through the drying that it has, without corrosion. It binds moderatlye,
but is very bitter, and therefore loses the belly. It dries in the third
degre, heats strongly in the first, or lightly in the second: and is
grateful to the stomach. It glueth together holowe places, and heals ulcers
harde to be cured: Maxim quae in ano pudendis simt, and stieped in water,
healpeth the inflammatyons in them, and also in the mouth and Eyes. In sum*

issuing from a vein or artery, do let thee in observing this ordinance,
thou may restreigne it thus. Rec. thuris parts duas alo^s pa^te Vnam, and
make it into poulder, and meddle all together, cum albumine oui, to the
thickness of honey, pilos leporis, cut as small as may be possible, and so
temper all together, and put thy finger in the place from whence the blood
issues, and touche the pulse, holding it so the space of an hour,
administering thy medicine in great quantity, and in the time of chaunginge,
have good foresight, that thou take it not away by violence. But if it cleave
fast to the place, lay on more of the said medicine in a more liquid form,
upon the old medicine, till it fall fro the wound alone without violence,
then shall the veins and arteries be knit and healed, and to this medicine
there is none like in restreigning of blood, knitting the vein.

Of wounds, with breaking of the bone within the Flesh. Cap. Vi.
VUhen with a wound in the Flesh, there is also a wound in yt bone, it
behooves not to heal yt woude of the flesh, Restauratio.
before the Restoration of the bone, I say Restoration, because the bone is
never consounded with a true Consolidation: but in stead thereof, grows a
hard Callouse substance of flesh, called Porus Sarcoides, or Caro Poroides,
Porus Sarcodes.
serving in place of ye bone lacking, which reparation must be looked for,
before the wound in the flesh be healed, Caro poroides
for otherwise there may be no reparation. because the moistness of the flesh
will let it. For so much as there can be no reparation, unless the place be
dried to the vttermooste: For the bones are most dry, and the nourishment of
bones, is the matter reparinge them, which is naturally dry: for to nurishe
is none other thing, but to assimulate nurishmente with that which is
nurished. Nutrition.
Wherefore Nutrition is done by the like, Diminution
as Diminution is done by the contrary.

And now for as much as of all wounds of bones, those of the head are most
perilous: I think it most meet to begin first with them, for if the wound
in the head where cranion or the brain pan is broken, should be healed in
the flesh before the bones be repared, it would surely cause death: both by
reason of ye brains Dilicasie, and nobleness, and also that worse accidents
follow thereof, then of the breaking of any other bone.

Of the wound in the head, with breaking of Cranion. Chapi. Vii.
VUhen the wound is made in the head with breaking of the Sculle: consider

that is to say to duram matrem: which thou maiste know by diverse means and

strong thread double twisted, and wereit, and let the patient hold it
strongly in his teethe, and begin thou at the mouth of him, and with thy
nailes stretch and streigne out the thread, till thou come at the other end
of the same, holding it straight a cubit length from the teeth, and make a
sound upon the thread with thy nail, and do so often times. If the pattente
may sustain the sound, without feelynge of peine, then is not the sculle
broken to the Dura matter. for if it be broken, he may in no wise sustain nor
suffer the harping of the nails upon the thread, or else thou may also take
and smite his head, with a small dry wand of (...) moniacon, Ammos.
of (...), which is sand. This shrubbe, with his root and fruit, Agasyllis
de copositione med. secun. generali. 6.
is called (...). Galen says, that Hammoniacum in mollyfyinge obteineth the
principalitye, and digests meanlye.

Amygdala.
IN Greek (...). Amygdala.
Of Almondes, that sort which for their bitterness are called Amara, Amara.
in Greek (...): have tenuating faculty, Picra.
whereby they purge, both out of ye belly and the breast by excreations, Dioscori.
li. i. Galen, de alimentis, lib. 2. de symp. med. li. 6.
gross and tough humores: help obstructions, sprung of gross and viscous
juice. They also help the pains of the side, of the spleen, of Colon, of the
reins, coming of the same. Howbeit they move not the belly, neither do they
nourish much. The sweet Almondes, though (in the virtues abouesayde) the
weaker: yet are they moderately what, mete for meates. They also move urine, and
amend the moist vices of the stomach.

Amylum
WHich we corruptly call Amidian: is that which yt Grecians have auncientlye
called Amelon, and is nothing else, but the milk or juice, of wheat certain
days steped in water, and then pressed out, which for his myldnes, is
usually put in ^llyries, as a most apt medicine for maladies of the eyes. For
being exactlye washed, it hath saith Galen, De com. med. ii. loca, lib. 4.
neither sharpness, nor adstriction: neither beating nor cooling.

Anacardus.
OR after Ruellius anacardiu: is the fruit of a tree, growing in Sicilia, and
Apulia, called vulgarly, Pediculus Elephantis. The juice whereof is called Mel
Anacardi: Pediculus Elephantis.
which is a ruptory medicine. Anacardiu (saith Ruelltus) of yt later Grecians,
(for ye aucients make thereof no metion,) Mel Anacardi
is a familiar tree among the Indians, grows also in the villes of Sicilia, yt
throw out flames of fire: Aetna.
with a fruit like a birds heart, (whereof it is thought to have his name,)
having therein a red or bloody juice, which flows out like blood.

Anatomia.
(...)* Anatome.
is the dissection or cutting up of man his body, or the bodies of beasts:
whereby knowledge may be attained, by discerning, and considering the parts
thereof, with their forms, offices, processes, and colligations, one with an
other: Whereby certeintye is had, as well howe warily to work, as wisely to
Prognosticate.

Anethum.
DIlle: Anethon.
which the Greeks name (...), heats either sowhat beyond yt second degre,
Galenus de symp. li. 6.
or within the third: dries either in the end of the first degre, or in the
beginning of the second. And therefore being boiled in Oil, it divides,
asswageth pain, causes sleep, digests raw humores.

Antimonium.
CAlled also Stibium and Sti^i, Stibium.
is a vein of earth found in silver mines, Stimmi.
like in colour unto lead, but it differs from lead which will melt not be
pouldered. Antimoniu will be pouldered but rather will it burn, the melt
otherwise the by a certain art, then not easily as lead will.

It hath saith Galen with his desiccatiue facultye (being vnwashed) a mighty
adstriction, Galen de sym, li. 9. de comp. med. secura^ loca. li. 4.
which by washing is made well ne'er utterly without biting, it is necessarily
used with medicines for the eyes, for his virtues therein, obtained to he called
(...), Platyophthalmon.
because it opens the eyes.

Anthrax.
ALthough many have ignoratly divided Anthrace, from Carbunculo: Carbunculus.
as though they were sondry and several tumores: it is most evident that it is
one thing: that (...), is the same in greek, whereof Carbunculus, is yt name in
Latyne* and signifyeth a burning cole, which this tumore doth very much
resemble (in the augmentation,) both in colour and nature, having also in the
declination a black crustons eschare, made by adu^ion, representinge a
quenched cole, which euidentlye shows, howe excessyue heat, joined for the
most part with venomous matter, is cause of this tumore.

Yet is it notwythstandynge, divided into kinds: whereof the greatest and most
dangerous sort, In lib. det^imoribus praeter naturam.
appears commonly in the time of Pestilent infection: and consists (as
says Galen,) of melancholy aduste. The other sort (being not so fearfulle,
In lib. de differentiis Febrium. Cap. iii.
and coming at other times,) is made of whotte boiling or burned blood*
which seems to be made, or turned into Melancholy, or as he saith in an other
place, of whotte blood, turned by adustion into the nature of Melancholy. And
surely thus is Lanfrancus, and other wryters of his time to be understanded,
when they speak of Anthrax, or Carbunculus, for so shall they in the rest
agree with Galen, and other ancient wryters.

Apium. Palustre. Risus Haemorrhoidum.

APium is of diverse kinds. But where Apium is found in Receptes or otherwise,
Namelye in the ancient and most learned wryters.
without any other addition in the name, it is only mente of Persly: though
Smalache have abusiuelye been used for it. And for the better understanding of
Apium his kinds: take this note.

(...). Selinon Cepaeon.
Apium Hortense. Persley, or garden persley

(...). Selinon Agrio
Apium Syluestre. Wild Persley.

(...). Oreoselinon.
Apium Motanum, uel Montapium. Mountain Perslye.

(...). Elcoselinon.
Apium Palustre, Paludapium Sieve, Apium Rusticum. Smalache, Marche, or Marsh
Persley.

(...). Hydroselinon
Apium Aquaticu, Water Persley.

(...) Apiu Saxatile, Petroselinon.
uel Saxeu. Saxapiu, aut Petrapium. Stone Persley.

(...). Hipposelinon
Apium equinum. Equapium sieve. Olus atrum. Alexanders, or great Persley.

(...) Apium sepis, Selinon Phragmites.
uel Apium sepiculare Hedge Persley.


And whersoeuer thou fyndest any kind of Apium, disagreinge, (whether in
sense or Interpretatio) to this order, hold it for false.

As for Apium Haemorrhoidum, and Apium Risus: It is but an abuse and confusion,
to reckon them emonge the kinds of Apium: among whom, (either in form or
faculties,) they can have no place. Batrachion.
But are kinds of Ranunculus, called in Greek (...), in English Crowfote, and
Frogmarche whereof also there are very many kinds, and all of whotte and
blistering property: whereof loke more in Fl^nula.

Apium says Galen, De sym. med. fac. li. 8.
is so whotte: Vt Vrinam menses c^eat. It breaks wind, but that doth the
sede, more then the herb, and is to the mouth of the stomach most
acceptable. The seade of Oreoselinum, and Hipposelinum, are of like virtues,
but Oreoselinum is the stronger, hitherto Galen. Apium is whotte in the second
degre, and dry in the midst of the third.

Apostema.
AS (...). Apostema.
Hoc est Spatium, sieve interuallum, which signifyeth distance or space,
Abscessus.
is the same which the Latines caul Abscessum, Di^uctio particularum.
of Abscedo. And Galen calls it Particularum diductionem, and are certain
dispositions, wherein such bodies as before touched together, Li. de tumori
praeter natura.
are now distant, and severed one from an other. Whereof (says Galen,) De
art curatiu. ad Glaucorem lib. ii. Cap. 6.
there must needs be made a void space, contening some substance, either
flatuous, or moyste, or compound of both. Which (if it hang, or tarry lunge
therein,) receives diverse alterations. Whereof the greater, is usually called
Apostema, Pustula.
and the less Pustula. So is for Exitura, in Lafranke and others of that age,
Exitnra. li. 4. fen. 3. tractacu. 1
and also of a Auicenna, to be vnderstaded Tumor suppuratus: that is a
suppurate aposteme, or riped tumore. But of these I need here make the less
declaration, for so much as master Gale, has so worthily, and most
exquisitely in his Institution of a Chirurgien, opened these things at large.
Where thou may, both in this many other maters, be right sufficiently
satisfied.

Aqua.
WAter is of temperament cold, contrary to fire: and of all other things
(saith Galen) the moistest: lib. 1. de compositione medicamentoru lib. 1. de
symp. med. facul. ca. 8.. 5
and that, as it is utterly without qualities, (as without taste, without
savor, and most clear,) so is it most pure: And as it bedeth from this, so
receives it qualities, to heat or cool, according to the things, therewith
mixed.

Aristolochia.
(...) is of.iii. kinds, as Dioscorides saith: obteineth that name, of the
precious help that women receive thereby, in their hard labours of children:
which doctor Turner has therefore most aptly called in English Birthworte.
The first is called Aristolochia rotunda. The second Aristolochia longa. The
third Clematitis: bisyde these Plinius adds a fourth kind, Pistolochia.
called (...).

The Apothecaries have of lunge time erred, in sellinge Holoworte for
Aristolochia rotunda: but some of late, have in the selves reformed this euel,
do sell the true thing. But surely many women midwives do err much more
grievously in my judgment, who plat in their gardens, use in women's labours.
Bistort.
Bistort in the stead of Aristolochia: calling it Astrologia: which is of a
coolynge and very astringente nature, therefore causes rather retention, the
expulsion: I advertise all good women therefore, that are willing to help them
selves and others, to seek for the true thing, which they may be sure to
obtain, by the advise of some learned Phisicien, or expert Chirurgien, at the
trusty Apothecaries hand. It grows plentiouslye in Italye, and Aristolochia
longa, or at the leasre Clematitis: grows now in diverse gardens in
Englande, as in London: in a garden of master Holande, late Chirurgien to the
Quenes highness: of whom I had rotes, which grow now in my guard at
Maidstone. Of Aristolochia and his kinds, read more in master Turners
Herballe. And for Bistort read Fuchsius, Galenus de symplicibus lib. 6.
de historia Stirpium. The rote says Galen is bitter and somewhat sharpe, but
the round is the subtlest. Of the other.ii. Clematitis smells sweetest, but
yet is the weaker. The lunge is so subtille as the round, and has heatinge,
and scouringe power, degesting, and scouring away, less then the round: but
heats rather more then less.

Aschachilos.
Even as Aschachilos: In libro de tumoribus praeter naturam.
(which Galenus calls (...), and Syderatione,) is (says he) an universal
corruption of solid or massive bodies, not sparing the very bones: So is
Gangrena, Sphacelos.
the mortification of such solide bodies, without corrupting the bone,
Syderatio.
follows great inflammations. Gangrena.


Asphodelus.
CAlled also Albucum, Albucum.
and Hastula regia, and of the Apothecaries Affodillus: Hastula regia
Asphodelos.
is called in Greek (...) and in English Affodill. And this doubtless it is,
that Lanfranke means: Libro secundo
whose virtues, (as by Dioscorides it is evident), do most exactly serve to
that intent* and not the herbs that we cal Affodils, Narcissus.
or Daffodils: which are no kinds of Albuci, but rather of Narcissi.

Au ripigmentum.
IS called in Greek (...), Arsenicon.
and in English Orpiment. It has power or facultye to gnaw, to bind, to
repress, to corrode, to excoriate, and to raise blysters, even like fire, Lib.
5.. 6. Sandaracha.
and is found: as says Dioscorides, in such mines of metalles, as Sandaracha
is.

Axungia.
Loke in Adeps.

Balaustium.
(...) is after Dioscorides the flower of the wild Pomegranate, Cytinos.
as (...), Sid^on.
Latin Cytinus is of the tame: and (...). Mali Corium.
Latin Sidium uel Malicorium is the rough rynde or shelle of the same fruit,
all the which do mightilye cool and dry: and therefore says Galen, li. 6. de
symplicium facultatibus. They Cicatrize ulcers, and are used of all men in
medicynes for reiections of blood, flux of the belie, and Dysenteria.

Baucia.
THat which the Apothecaries call commonly Baucias, Elaphoboscon agrion.
is cauled in English wild Persnippe, in Greek (...), Elaphoboscu Syluestre.
in Latin Elaphoboscum Siluestre, and of the Herbaries Branca Leonia. It is of
temperament after Fuchsius, Braca leonina
like to Elaphoboscum Satiuum, saving that by reason of a certain
bitterness, and light Abstertion that it has it is dryer.

Baurach.
Whether it wear the mind of Lanfrancus, or of some other that has since
corrupted his work, to interpret Baurach, (so called of the Arabians) Sal
gemmae, it is somewhat doubtfulle: but by the old learned wryters, it seems
far otherwise, for Baurach, as by them it is euidet is (...), id est spuma
Nitri, that is the spume or scum of Nitrum. Aphronitron.
It is by the testemonies of Galen and Mesues: of the facultye and nature of
Nitrum, Sp^na Nitri.
though somewhat weaker. What Sal Gem^ is, you shall find at Sal.

Bdellium.
(...), Bdellion.
which (as saith Dioscorides) some call (...), and others (...): Bolchon.
Is the tears, or gum of a tree, which should be bitter in taste,
Madelchon.
shining like glue, fat within, easily meltynge, without wode or
filthiness, and smells being burned like a hove: De com. med. secundum
locos, li. 8.
It heats, and, mollifyeth hardness, moves urine, breaks stones. c. It
mollifies says Galen sufficiently, digests, and discusseth moderatelye.

Bolus Armenus.
TErra, Libro. 9. de sympli^m medicamen. facultatibus.
Lapis, Gleba, or Bolus Armenus, after the sentence of Galen, is of colour
pale. And cocerning substance, most apt to be resolved into an equal
smothnesse, as lime, and is of a mighty drying power: and therefore is
precious, for the Dysenteria, the flux of the womb, spittinge of blood,
Catarhes, and putrefyinge ulcers of the mouth. Howbeit ye kind thereof, which
is commonly used in exterior gre^es: as it is much more gross, the this here
of Galen described, so is it in each point, of much less virtue, or efficacy.

Bothor.
Though this Araby name Bothor, he (after the mind of diverse learned,) take
for Pustula generally: yet is it taken of Lanfrancus, Guido de Cauliaco, others
of yt ag^ more straightly for a kind of pustule, or exiture, growing in ye
eye: which is of Iesu Hali, thus described. Bothor (saith he) is a certain
eminence, or little Aposteme, as they call it, which comes of moisture,
Staphyloma*
gathered between the rindes of Comea: whereof saith he there are.iiii. Galen in
his definitions, calling it (...), (id est Vua uel acinus Vua) saith, that it
rises in part of the pupille, like the grain of a grape. And is made, when
through peyne and inflammation, the pupille is raised upon high, showing the
figure, of a grain of a grape, as before.

Botium.
About this Aposteme, Bronchocele Tumor gutturis.
called in greek (...), hoc est Tumor gutturis. Lanfrancus, and others about
that time, (though they agree of his place,) do vary in the substance, and
matter thereof. For Guido says, it is an aposteme growing out of the neck,
engendered of humores, turned into euel matter. Brunus, and Theodoricus, say it
is a fleshye aposteme, engendered in the throat: Which happens chiefly to
women, and is of colour like their skin. and Lanfrancus in his greater work,
(agreing well with nether of them:) saith it is made of corrupt humores, chiefly
of Phlegm corrupted: But often of what Aposteme, corrupted by lunge retention
of the matter, in the place affected. Howe be it we ought not to be astonished, at
this varietye: since neither of them, is thereof a true description: But rather
do severally serve, to several kinds thereof. Which are of Celsus severally
described.

Brassica.
IN Greek (...), Crambe.
is of.iii. kinds. Esculenta, Agrestis, Marina, but Esculenta, or Satiua
Brassica, (which is our common garden Cole,) is that which Lanfranke
mentyoneth: as well forbidding the use thereof, in the diet of those yt have
Cancrum, (because it ingendereth gross, and melacholike juice:) as also
teachinge proffitablye to use the same, in resolution. It is of temperamente
what and dry in the first degre. It has by the testimony of Galen dryinge
power, both eaten and outwardly applied, but is not very sharpe. It cures
Erysipelata, Phlegmonnasque, that are indurate and harde to heal.

Bubo
(...) (id est tumor lingi^inaribus), Boubon.
(...), Bubo, Phyma, and Phygethlon, says Ga^enus, are affects of the
Glandules. Bubo being only an inflammation of them. Libro. i. cap. i. de art
curatiua, ad Glauconem.
Phyma, is that which forthwith augments, and hastes to supuration. And
Phygethlon is either Erysipelas in them with inflammation: or inflammatio with
Erysipelate. But Guido (alledginge Auicenne in the end) takes it three ways
thus. Phyma.


First says he, Phygethlon.
Bubo is properlye a sole Aposteme, lurkinge in the arm holes, as doth the
Owl in the walls of houses. Otherwise it is more larglye taken, for the
Aposteme, For the em^e ^orye places, loke in mine Anatomye.
that ingendereth in any of the emunctorye places. And thirdly for all
apostemes (generally,) that grow in glandulous mebers. Theodoricus also
defines it to be a great harde, and deep collection of matter, expelled from
the principalle members, to the places aforesaid: with heate and burning. But
hereof in Lanfranke I find no description. And note that as of Guido it may be
gathered, this tumore to have this name Bubo, of the Owl so called in Latin:
so is as well the herb Aster atticus, Aster atticus.
(of the curing Bubonem in the grindes,) Bubonium.
called Bubonium, as also those parts, it receiving Bubones.

Butyrum.
For the substance and nature of butter, loke under Lac.

Calx viva.
OR lime vnsleked: Gale. de sym. med. li. 8.. 9.
doth vehemently burn, and Cauterize. But being utterly extincted, it
removes the eschare: and in process of time, it will make no eschare:
although it heat and liquify the flesh. And being often washed, it dries much,
without biting. It is a kind of ashes, but of substance more subtle the the
ashes of wood. Titanos.
The Grecians call it (...).

Cancer.
OF the Aposteme Cancer,) which the Greeks call (...),) Carcinoma.
with his causes, signs, and cure: hath Lanfrancus so largely and sufficiently
spoken, that here needs no more thereof be said.

but only to advertise men of understanding, rather to believe, not only
Lanfranke, but also Galen: then by foal hardiness, (standing to much in
their own conceits,) to deceive them selves and others, by taking on them
things uncurable.

(...), Carcinos.
id est Cancer fluuiatilis. The river Crab, as it is a specialle medicine
against venom, Galenus de Theriaca, ad Pisonem.
and the hurts made by virolente beasts: so is it of power to draw out
thorns, and sliuers in the flesh.

Cantharis.
(...), Galenus, libro de theriaca ad Pisonem.
is a certain fly, of a grene colour. Which being given with other mete
diuretike medicines, doth purge the renes, and helps the difficulty of
pissing: otherwise it doth as well exulcerate the blader inwardly, as burn and
blister the skin, whersoeuer it be applied outwardly.

Caphura.
OF Camphora, there is varietye of opinyon, because the ancient Greeks write
not thereof, neither any save only the Arabians. For Platearius denies it
flatly to be the gum of a tree, affirming it to be the juice of an herb,
cold and dry in the fourth degre. But Pandacta^rius and Antonius Musa,
Brasauolus, alledginge Auicerma and Serapionem, say it is the gum of a tree, or
rather says Brasauolus, the pith of the same, cold and dry in the third
degre: of a red and spotty colour. And is by sublimation (as by the heate of
the sun, or of fire,) made white, err it come to us: taking the name Camfor
Camfor.
among the Arabians, of Pa^zor the place where it grows. Or otherwise,
because it will hardly be kept. It coleth inflammations, stays the fluxes
of blood, of the hellye, and of the eyes. And heals what ulcers, comfort
the senses, and takes away watchfulness.

And because it colynge (as before) in the third degre: yet is easily set on
fire, and yields a clear flame: and also because nothing is more
odoriferous: Pandactarius moved belike with the common principle, that every
odoriferous thing is also whotte, accounted it a miracle: contrary to the
mind of Galen, De sym. med. fac. li. 2. cap. 3
who judges them to err, that guess the faculties of medicynes by their
odores. For neither is every thing whotte, (says he,) that smells well:
neither doth every thing smell well, that is whotte. Neither yet ought any
man to pronounce, every thing that stinks could: nor every cold thing,
to have a stynckinge sauore.

Carbunculus.
Loke for it under this word Anthrax

Cardamomum.
CArdamomum, is of the later wryters distingued into ii. kinds, Maius Minus.
Antonius Musa Brasauolus reconeth.iii. sedes to be among the Apotheries under
that name extant, but neither of them as he also notes, agrees with
Cardamomo-Dioscoridis, Dioscorides.
who having first showed from whence it is brought, says thus. It ought to
be chosen which is fulle, libro. 1.
fastened, and harde or tough to be broken, (for that which is not so is
judged old,) sharpe in taste and bitterish, whose odor grieves the head. With
this says Brasauolus agrees justly both in descriptyon and faculties
Cardumeni Serapionis: but so do none of the former of the Apothecaries, and
therefore men think we have it not. libro. 7. de symp. medi. facultatibus.
Galenus measuringe the qualities of Cardamomum, with the temperamente of
Nasturtii says, howe much the more sweet, and fragrant it is, then
Nasturtio. So much the weaker is his facultye of heate: neither is it mete to
vlcerate* yet has it therewyth adjoined a certain bitterness: whereby it
kills worms, and with vinegar, mundifieth scabs strongly. Loke more for
this in Grana-paradisi.

Carnes variae.
THe ingenderinge of flesh, and what it is: you may read in the nynthe
Chapiter, of the first treatice, of mine Anatomy. Flesh (says Galen,) being
well sod, De alimentis. li. iii.
makes good blood: namelye if it be flesh of good juice. Of al meates Caro
Suum nourishes most. Carobubula also gives not a little nourishment, Hogs
flesh Beef.
but is harde to put over, bredeth blood to gross, apt to cause melacholike
affects. And as to young men in good habit of body, the flesh of a grown
hog, is better then a pig: so is veale better then beffe, and kids flesh,
better then gotes flesh: which are much better easier concocted. Lambs
flesh is very moist Phlegmatike: but mutton makes worse juice, and more
excrementes. The gotes flesh hath a sharpe vicious juice. The he gotes Flesh.
Kids flesh is not euel for old persons. Caro hircorum is both of juice and
concoction the worst. The like may be said of beffe or rams flesh: but of
all these the gelded are the better: as the old flesh is worse. Hares flesh
bredeth gross blood, but better juice then beffe. Hearts flesh or bucks
flesh, is hard to concoct. And make as euel juice as any of the rest: De
sanitate tu^nda. li. 5.
therefore are Hearts flesh, Gotes flesh and beffe, profitable neither for old
nor young. To young men mutton is admitted, though to old men it be not
commodious: and much less lambs flesh.

Every kind of flying foul, gives very little nouryshment, in respect of
beasts. The flesh of souls is easy to concoct, chiefly of yt bird called
Attagen, (which some think is the woodcoke.) The flesh of the black bird,
the owsel the small sparrows, are harder: but harder then they, is the flesh of
the turtle dove, the wood dove, the duck. But to conclude. De sym. li. 11.
Cum Cibis etiam a^alium mutantur carnes. That is ye flesh of beasts fowls
are altered, by their fedinge. And therefore are the birds allowed, that are
conversant on the sweet hills, in the wholesome grauelly woods, and pleasant
groves as such as live in marshes, or ^ennes, and fed in the water, are
utterly eschued.

Caryophilli.
Loke at Garyophilli.

Causon.
(...), id est febris ardens: is one of the continual fevers, and hath to name
Tertiana continua: caused of yelowe choler, putrefied in the veins, (none
otherwise then Quotidiana cotinua, comes of putrefied phlegm and Quartana
cotinua of corrupted melancholy,) and differs from Tertiani intermittente,
for that therein the choleric humour is carried over all the body. But in
Ardent febre, it is together with the blood, contained in the vessels: De
symptomatum causis li. ii. ac de tremore, palpitatione, conuultione, et rigore
causing much payne burning. Whereunto (saith Galen,) if rigour at any time
chance: the Fever is thereby disolued.

Yet some nevertheless, make a certain obscure differes between Causon
Tertianam continuam: affirming the cause thereof, to be contained nigher about
the hart. And his accession to have no rest, or at the most very little in the
morning, (as in Synocho,) and that rather of the cold teperature of that time,
then of his own nature.

Casia.
CAsia Fistularis, or Cassia Syringa, is (by the testimony of Auicen and
Mesues,) mean between whotte and cold. But inclining rather, to heat and
moisture in ye first degre. It is the fruit of a tree, brought forth in hard
black coddes. Whose inward pulpe, is resolutiue, and lenityue, cleanses the
blood, and purges gently Choler Phlegm. And this out of the Arabians, for
among the old Grecias it is not found: who yet have their Cassiam fistularem,
which is of some taken for our Cinamome.

Cataplasma.
(...), quasi figmetum Crassum: Is that gross kind of Plaster form, that is
made of sodden herbs, Oils Meals, poulders. c.

Cepa.
CAlled in greek (...), Crommyon.
is of diverse kinds, as this our common Onion, called Cepa Escalonia, and
winter onion called Holekes, in greek (...), Id est Cepa fissilis. Siues also
are thought to be a kind of Omons. c. Onyons are of gross substance, what and
dry in the fourth degre. They do maturate, attract, inflame, being laid
to, they open the Hemorrhoides, and sharpen the syghte made dull by gross
humores.

Cera.
WEre: Tyrhenica cera. uel potica. Li. 4. 7.. 9. de sym. med. fac. li. 8. de
com. med. secu genera.
(whereof Galen praises that for the best, which is called Tyrhenica, or
Potica:) is of it self amongst things concoctine, but weak. Yet has it a
certain whotte, and digestiue power, leaning to the nature of Honey. And
being put with other medicynes, both liquid and dry, it is to them as a
body: or common receptory substance.

Cerussa.
IS of cooling, dryinge, and astringente faculty, called in Greek (...), and
is made of Lead: by hanging plates of the same over the bapor of vinegar,
Psimmythion. Gale. li. 9. de sym. med. fac. li. 1. de co. med. secun. genera.
Sandyx.
close covered. It is used with profit, and good effect, against what
inflamed ulcers. Cerussa burned till it become in colour like Sandaracha, is
thereof called (...), is thereby the more subtle, but heats not: so (...)
kepeth the coldness of Cerussae but lacks the subtiltye thereof.

Chamaemelum.
CAmomille is called in Greek (...). Anthemis.
There be sher of three kinds. Leucathemo.
That is to say (...), id est Chamaemelum Album, Chrysathemo Heranthemo.
(...). hoc est Chamaemelum Luteum. (...), Chamaemelum Purpurcum. The first
having white flowers. The second yelow^. The third Purple. They are whotte
and dry in the first degree, Galenus de sym. li. 6.
consisting of tender parts, and have tenuatyng, losing, and digesting
facultye.

Chelidonium.
CAlled in English Salendine, Chelidonion.
or Swallow Wurte, in Greek (...), hoc est Hirundinaria, Hirundinaria.
(so called either because it blows, about the return of swallows in the
spring, and withers again at their departure: or else as Plinius writes,
because the Swallows did first find and use the same, to restore again their
birds to syghte, being made blind:) is of heatinge, and scouringe
properties. calenus li. 8. de sym. medi. facultatibus.
His root is given (in Vino albo cum aniso,) to the Jaundies that come of the
liver obstructed: and being chawed, helps the tothake. The juice of the
herb is used in the eye, to sharpen the sight. And thus much of Chelidonium
Maius. For there is also Chelidonium Minus: which (as it is sharper then the
greater,) doth swiftly exulcerate. And the juice thereof purges the head by the
nostrils. It heats and dries in the beginning of the fourth degree,
the greater only in the third. Wherefore that the herb called of the Latin
wryters and apothecaries Ficaria, Ficaria.
Scrofularia minor, Scrofularia minor.
in English Pyle wort, (whose Picture is usually put, and that not of the
worst Herbal wryters for this:) is not Chelidonium Minus, it is evident. Whose
temperamentes, (though the description of Chelidonium in Diosecoride
Dioscorides libro secundo.
will suffer it in form to agree:) are one to an other clean contraries.

Surgery.
(...) is said of every art, (...)
whose function consists, in manualle action or handye operation. But here is
it to say Curatio manualis: that is manualle or handy curing.

Cicatrizatiua med.
CIcatrix is the scarre or token, where a wound, ulcer. c. has been, Whereof
comes Cicatrizo, id est ad Cicatricem perduco, to heal or bring to askarre.
And thereof rises Medicamina cicatrizatius, Cicatrisinge, consounding, or skin
bringing medicynes.

Cicer.
IS a flatuous pulse, of great nurishment, mouynge the womb, apt to engender
milk, and to provoke urine Menses. E^ebinthos.
Called in Greek (...), and is after Dioscorides of.iii. kinds: Diosco. lib.
ii. Cicer satiuu. Cicer arietinu Cicer syluestre.
namelye Satiuum, whereof before. Aretinum, whose decoction breaks ye stone in
the reins, (which is also of.iii. sorts,) and Syluestre. They are all whotte,
moderatlye dry, and partners of bitterness. Whereby they purge the spleen, the
liver, and the reins. They mundifye scabs, Galenus, li. 6. de sym. med. fac.
and lepryes. They also discuss the hardness of ye stones, and Apostemes
under the ears, and do heal in composition, maligne ulcers. Though Cicer
agreste, be so much the whotter and the dryer then Domestico: as it is (then
it) sharper, and bitterer.

Cichorium.
IT is plain by Dioscorides and others, Seris.
that this Greek word (...), Picris.
is a name common and indifferent, both to Cichorium, Dioscori. li. 2. cum
Galeno li. 8. de symp. ^nedi. facultatibus. li. 8. de compositione medicanie
torum secundum locos.
(which is also called (...),) and to Intubum, with also al their kinds. They
are cold, somewhat bitter, and moderately astringente: and therefore most
comodious for the stomach, and convenient in chief for the heat of the
liver. Being eaten with vinegar, they stay the belly. Intubum domesticum is
colder then Agreste, which is cold and dry in the second degre, and bitterer
then the tame, (and is surely the right Cichorium,) and therefore not at
each point so commodious to the stomach. They are (in Cataplasmatibus,) good
medicynes for the gowte of the feet, and the inflaminations of the eyes. Their
iuyces cum Cerussa, aceto, are for all griefs profitable, that need coling.
And yet that doth it so moderately, that even to cold distemperatures it
hurts not.

Colla de corio.
LAnfranke means hear by Colla de Corio, that glewe that some (says
Dioscorides) caul (...), Xylocolla.
and others (...), Tamocolla.
hoc est Glute, Vel Glutinum taurinum, Gluten, Glutim^m taurinum.
made of Bullocks hydes. The best is white, and shining through, but the
blacker it is, the worse. It resolved in Aceto, delivers the skin of ring
worms, and lepryes. Burned blisters, are by washing them in the decoction
thereof kept from breaking. And Cum Mell aut aceto, It is profitable for
wounds, and consoundeth them.

And as this being made of the skins and ears of divers beasts, is of
diverse sorts, and may so varye in name: so is there glewe made of diverse
sorts of Fyshes, which is generally called (...), and may in names
particularly vary as the other.

They have all drying faculty, but do vary in heatynge and cooling, as the
substances whereof they are made.

Colocynthis.
(...), Cucurbita Syluestris, Diosco. li. 4. Galenus de sym. med. faculta. li.
7.
called in Latin Cucurbita Syluestris, and of the Apothecaries Coloquintida,
is what and dry in the third degre. It purges vehemently, and aswageth the
pain of the teeth: being plastred to the navel, it kills worms. And the
juice thereof grene, helps the Ischiada pain.

Concauitas.
Holownesse.

Conglutinatiua medicamina.
ARe medicynes that conjoin, and fasten together the sides, or borders of
wounds, ulcers. c. Which comes of Conglutino, that is to fasten, or join
together, as with glewe.

Contusio.
Contusion is here bruising, of Contundo, to beat or bruise.

Consolidatiuae medicinae.
COnsolidatyue medicynes, of Consolido, to make fyrme and found. Lanfranke
saith, that they are all one with Cicatrizasiues, because their effects do so
well accorde, in finishing the cure of wounds, ulcers, fistules. c. which
says Galen they do, De symp, li. 5
not by drawing and liquyfyinge the flesh: but by hardeninge and dryinge the
same.

Coperosa.
It is by Lanfranke all one with Vitriolo. Vitriolum.
Loke there.

Corallium.
Which some have called (...), Dioscor. li. 5. Lithodr^dron
seems (saith Dioscorides) to be a shrubbe of the sea, which being drawn out
from the depth: as soon as it comes into the aer, doth by and by congeyle
and harden. But Brasa^oius notes it to obtain the second degre in heate, for
it is bitter says he, and hath a certain sharpness.
It grows in Syracusa, about the Promontory Pachyno. It is of diverse colours,
(other say kinds,) whereof the red is the best. It coleth and binds
moderately, it takes away the scars of the eyes, and fills holowe ulcers
and wounds. It is against reiections of blood, very efficacious and helps
the difficulty of urine: drunk also with water, it wastes the spleen. The
black coralle (which resembles a bushy tree,) called (...), Antipathes.
agrees in virtues with the former, and is thought to differ only in Specie.

Corrosiua medicamina.
MEdicines that eat and consume such parts as they are applied unto, inducing
an eschare thereon: comes of Corrodo, properlye to eat or gnaw about.

Corrigiola.
SO called of the Apothecaries, and of the French men Corrigiole, is our
common knottgrasse, called in Greek (...), Polygonon.
in Latin Seminalis, and Polygonum mas. For (...) Centum nodia, Seminalis.
Sanguinaria, or Proserpinaca, Dioscorides and Galen make only two kinds, as
Mas Femina. Though Pl^tius and other later wryters have more. Pylogonum after
Galen is of such a watery coldness, that it cools in the second excess,
Galenus li. 8. de sym. med. fac. Cum Dioscoride. li. 4.
or in the beginning of the third: And therefore being applied cold, is a
remedy for whotte burning stomaches, for the tumor Erysipelas, and whotte
inflammations. And farther it stays all sinxions, by the which reason it
seems to have drying power, and therefore is a good remedy to Ulcers, and
Teters, and glueth together bloody wounds. But the male saith he (aledginge
Dioscorides,) is in all these the more potente.

Cortex pini.
Loke at Pini Cortex.

Cortex Olibani.
Loke at Olibanum.

Cotonea malus
COtonea malus, Cydomos ^lea.
in Greek (...) is the Quince tree. Ouinces called Cotonea Mala, or Cydonia,
are profitable to ye stomach, move urine: but yt being roasted more gently.
Dioscor. lib.
They are good for ye Dysenteria, for ye flux of the belly, for rotten coughs:
that chiefly being raw. And ye juice of the infused is given to the fluxions of
the stomach belly. Being boiled with honey they are the more pleasant, both to
the mouth and stomach, but then they thycken less. They are put raw in
Cataplasmatis, to restreigne the belie, for heate of the stomach, vomits,
inflammatyons, and harde Splenes.

Cotyledon.
VMbilicus Veneris, (called in Greek (...), in Latin of some Acetabulum,
Acetabulum.
and in English Penyworte.) Is could of temperamente, somewhat moyste, and
fulle of juice. Li. 7. de sym. med. fac.
It grows on stone walls, and has after Galen, a light bitterness, and also
a certain obscure adstringente facultye. Whereby it doth cool, repercusse,
scour away, and discuss. And therefore heals well Erisipelatous inflammations,
Phlegmonus Erysipelata, and is to a whotte stomach in a Cataplasma most
commodious. Cotyledon aquaticum.
An other kind of this herb there is growing in marshes, which is called
Cotyledon Aquaticum, and is of nature very whotte, like to the whottest kinds
of Ranunculus.

Crassula.
IS among the Apothecaries of two kinds: Mayor for the which look in
Fabaria, and Minor which you shall find at semper Viuum.

Crocus
SAffron called in Greek (...), Crocos.
doth heate in the second degree, Dioscori. li. 1. Galenus de sym. med. fac.
li. 7. de com, med. secun. loca. Li. 2. 6..9.
and dry in the first. Whereof the yelowest, and most odorifferous is best. It
mollifyeth and digests, namelye Erysipelatous inflammations, raw humores, and
virulent affects. It moves urine and makes a good colour. being drunk cum
Passo, it defends surfetynge: and applied with woman's milk, restrains the
fluxions of the eyes. Howe be it the continualle use thereof, and the smelling
thereto, hurts the head.

Cubebe.
THe thin odoriferous fruit, Galenus de simplici. lib. 7
(tasted like the roots of Phu,) which the Arabians call Cubebas: is that
which Galen calls Carpesium, as Auicen, Aetius, Actuarius, Ruellius, write,
(which yet Leonicenus denies, and others make thereof a doubt.) And is says
Scrapio, the fruit of a tree, growing beyond the seas, whose leaves are
sharpe like a spear. The fruit is found among the leaves, round and somewhat
flat. Whi^he when it is ripe, is of colour redishe. Wherein is found a
trianguled grain. But this is by the judgement of Antonius Musa, the
description of Myrtus Syluestris, and the fruit of the same doth Scrapio call
Cubebas, Carpesium.
which differ from our vulgar Cucubis. Carpesium, saith Galen is like to
Ualerian, both in taste and faculties, but has more subtiltye, and therefore
cleanses, and scours more, the obstructions of the bowels, moves vryne, and
purges the renes, pained with stones.

Cucumis asininus.
Though there be diverse kinds of Cucumers, S^cys Agrios, Dioscorides li. 4.
Galenus, li. 8. desym. med. facultatibus.
( they not without their singular, eximious virtues:) we have here only to
speak of the wild, or leaping Cucumer, called (...), of the Apothecaries
Cucumis as^inus. It is very bitter, and being laid to with Barlye flower,
breaks every old cough. The juice of the leaves, instilled into the ears,
helps their pains: and being applied with Terebinthin resin, it breaks
small Apostemes. It eases also the gowte, the totheache, the Ischiada pain.

The root thereof is of abstersiue and mollificatyue faculties. The juice
whereof and the rynde, (which dries more strongly,) given together do purge
Choler and Phlegm chiefly in Hydropicis, and puts forth deiections, without
hurting the stomach.

Out of the fruit saith Dioscorides, is prepared a juice, (or else pressed out
of the rotes leaves saith Galen,) Elaterium.
called Elaterium: what in the second degree, and marvelous bitter. And
therefore digests, moves vryne, and heals pains of the head. And finallye
it doth all, that the herb, rote or fruit doth, and that more strongly.

Cucurbita.
Called in greek (...), Colochitha. Dioscor. li. 2. Galenus li. ^. de sym.
medi. fa^ultatibus.
is a fruit apt to be eat raw, and is of diverse sorts, differing rather in
form then in faculty. It is cold moist in the second degre, therefore stays
thirst. The juice of gourds, mixed with the juice of roses, is profitable to ye
pains of ye ears, caused of inflamatio. The slyces or pieces thereof, are laid
to the nodle of children, Syriasis.
against the vehement heate of their heads, called Syriasis. They cool also
the inflammations of the eyes, and the gowte of the fete: and do help
moreover, the adustion of the skin, and the vehement heat of fevers. The juice
also drunk, cum Mell Nitro, doth easily loose the belly.

Cupressus.
Cyprus is a tree called in Greek (...), Cyparissos.
in Latyne Cupressus, and of the Apothecaries Cypressus. It cools and dries
as Dioscorides says. Libro. 1. The leaves and nuts thereof, are used for
those purposes in medicynes. The leaves, branches, and young tender nuts of
Cypres do dry (says Galen) without great sharpnes or heate, De sympli. 7.
and heal great ulcers in harde bodies.

Curcuma.
AS says Syluius upon Mesuen, is that with the Arabian, swhiche the Grecians
call (...), the Latines Rubiam and Rubeam tinctorum, Erythrodano.
and we Mader: Rubia.
Though some apply that name to Chelidonio, and others corruptly to Saffron.
And as this his assertion hath many learned fautores, and therefore seems
most true: so is it very like to be that which Lanfranke means, for that
it agrees with his purpose, (Who puts it among his consolidatiues,) which
the other do not.

The root of Rubia is sharpe, and bitter: and therefore expurgeth the Liver the
spleen: Galemis de sym. li. 6.
Provokes much gross, and sometime bloudye vrines, and scours meanlye. And
therefore helps Morbum Regium, Diosco. lib. 3.
or the yelowe Jaundyse. The Ischiada payne also, and loosed members.

Defensiuae medicinae.
Defensive medicynes (of Defendo to guarde, defend and prohibit.) Are of no
small profit to the Chirurgien his work, whose use and vtilityes may by the
circumstances (where so ever they are mentioned) be easily gathered.

Desiccatiua medicamina.
DRying medicines (which comes of Desicco to dry up) serve often the office
of Cicatrizatiues, loke there.

Diminutio.
Diminution or abatemente.

Dipsacum.
DIpsacum called also Labrum Veneris, Labrum Veneris.
and of the Apothecaries Carduus Fullonam, is called in Greek (...), and in
English Teasell. Dipsacos.
There are two kinds thereof. The one the shermen occupy: The other which is
called Dipsacum album, serves after the mind of some,) chiefly for medicines.

Radix dipsaci (says Galen) dries in the second degree, Galenus de sym. li.
6.
and has not a little abstersion. It heals (by the testimony of
Dioscorides,) Dioscori. li. 3.
fistules, and chappes of the fundamente, being bruised and boiled with wine,
till it be as thycke as were. And further is thought to be a remedy, for
ryngwormes, and hanging wartes.

Dyscrasia.
(...), De symptomatum causis li. 2.
id est Intemperies, (that is distemperance) is after Galen Aequalis, which is
without payne, because there is in the place affected, a desired nature, (for no
body is by his own nature infested) or Inaqualis, which is when a body is
troubled both with heate and cold at once, or with dryness and moisture, De
methodo medendi, li. 7. 8.. 9.
more then to nature is convenient. Which sometimes chances, though it
seem unlike: and howe great so ever it be, so much doth it molest. These
are eight in number, and may severally chance, to the eyghte simple members:
requiring also, so many differences of curation. De art curatiua, li. 2.
And are either simple, which may be. iiii. ways, what, cold, dry, or
moist, and may be cured by their contraries: or compound as many ways, as
what and dry, whotte and moyste. c. With these dispositions one part, or more,
or the whole body may be affected.

Embrocatio.
(...). Embroche.
i. Infusio, Irrigatio, Inspersio, uelliquor e sublime defusus: a pouringe on,
waterynge, sprinklynge of Oil. c. or lettynge it fall, on the affected part.
The late learned wryters call it in Latin Embrocha, whereof comes
Embrocation, as we call it.

Ephemera.
Which (by changinge.^. into.i.) has accustomablye been written Ephimera: De
differetiis sebriu, li. 1. 2.
Is a fever happeninge chieflye to melancholic persons, De methodo medendi,
li. 8. 9. ac. 10.
though sometime it chance of rawnesse, to biuous temperamentes: springing
of a procatarctike cause, (which is thereof an inseparable token, yet thereto not
proper:) De art curatiua ad Glauconem.
as weariness, drunkenness, wrath, fury, sorrow, and such other vehement
affects of the mind: and sometime of blood inflamed, or of the tumor Bubo:
contynueth with a sweet or pleasant heate, and inclyneth with some sweet dew
or good vapor: after ye which comes health. The naturalle time of
continuance, is one naturalie day: wherein it is apt to be resolved, and
therefore is called Febris diaria, Pyretos Ephemeros, Febris diaria,
and in Greek (...). But this end it takes, by good governance in the
beginning: which if it pass, it sometime changes both name and nature, and
sometime only the name reserving the nature. And this state of Ephemera I
judge Lanfranke to mean where he speaks of Ephemera continua.

Erysipelas.
(...): Galenus, de atrabile, de tumoribus praeternatur^ de meth. med. li. 14.
de art curatiua. li. 2.
Is properlye an affect of the skyn, sprung of pure choler (being made
what;) of colour yelow, or pale, or of both mixedly consisting: much whotter
then Phlegmone, and is therefore called Ignis sacer, uel S. Antonii, and of
some Ignis persicus. which names I think in dede may all be applied, to it or
his kinds.

And as for Erysipelas n^thunt, which Lanfranke mencioneth, Erysipelas Nothum.
I take rather by his own narration, to be Inflammationem Erysipelatosa. For
Erysipelas nothum, may come.iii. ways, by receiving into it self by
admixtion, any of the other three humores in less quantitye: and has to
name (...), Erysipelas Phlegmon^des.
hoc est Erysipelas Phlegmonosum, uel inflammationis particeps* if blood be
therwyth mixed: (...) quasi Erysipelas pituitosum, ^el oedematis particeps,
Erysipelas oedema^des Erysipelas (...).
when Phlegm has a part. Or (...), idest Erysipelas indurantum, aut
duritiei consors, because it is harde, through the felowshyp of Melancholy
therwyth.

Euphorbium.
(...): Euphorbion.
Is the gum or tears of a tree, called Euphorbia, growing in Lybia, Galen.
ibro. 3. de symp. li. 6. de co^ned. secum. genera li. 3. de comp^med. secum.
loca. li. 1.
found out (by the testimony of Dioscorides,) in ye time of ^uba: and was
called by that name, (as saith Ruellius) of his Phisicien. It hath a vehement
whotte, and burning facultye and profits very much against the Spasme,
caused by the pricking of tendones. But for that ought it not to be used to
new, (which is of colour clear white,) for the vehement heate thereof*
Neither to old, (which then wareth yelow or pale,) because it is numbered among
such symples, as do soon lose their heat and virtues. And yet continues
it.vi. years.

Eunuchus.
A man is called (...), Eunouchos.
idest Castratus, when he is gelded, and therthrough becomes foggy or fat.

Excoriatio
Excoriation: is a taking off ye skin, by ^aing, or blistering, which comes
of Excorio, to flea, or take away the skyn.

Exitura.
Go to Apostema.

Faba.
CAlled in Greek (...) coleth dries meanelye. Cyamos.
Yet has the meal thereof, some abstertion, as also the hulles have not a
little adstringente facultye. To be eaten they are flatulet, though they be
never so much sodden: harde to be concocted, and cause spittinges out of the
breast, Dioscorid. li. 2. Galenus de sym. med. li. 7.
lunges: but they nurish much. In medicynes outwardly, they dry vnhurtfullye:
and being boiled in water, were often used of Galen, cum adipi suillo, to the
goutes of the fete. The meal is incarnatyue, and is put to bruses, and in
wounds of sinews, cum Oxi^ilite, and to inflammations cum Polenta. And is in
Cataplasmatis most apt, for swellinges of the paps and stones.

And although many learned men by diverse reasos (which I omit) moved of late,
do doubt whether our Bean may be taken for Faba, Phasiolus.
or for Phasiolo, or otherwise howe: Yet need no man doubt (in my judgment)
that Lanfranke as well as many other wryters both before him, and long time
since: have for Faba understanded the Bean.

Fabaria.
THat which the Italians call Fabariam, is thought of some to be Telephium,
Telephium.
and called of others Cymbalion, but neither of both truly. Cymbalion.
The later wryters call it Crassulam maiorem, Crassula mayor.
Licobus Manlius with divers other, Fabam grossam, we (and also the French
men,) cal it Orpin, and anciently Lempke. whereunto some have added, (as a kind
thereof,) the herb that D. Turner, thinks to be Caepea of Dioscorides,
calling it Fabaria minor, or Fabaria aquatica, and englishly brooke Lempke.
Crassula minor.
But Crassula minor, is (by the common consent, of almost all the learned,)
that kind of stone crop, that grows commoly upon stone walls or houses,
as Sedum doth, having round blunt leaves, like puddings or little worms,
full of juice, called also of the form aforsayde, Ver^icularis, in English
Wormegrasse: whereof more at Semper Viuum.

The later wryters, (for the old make thereof no mention,) do praise their
Crassulam maiorem, for the great efficacy that it has, incurynge wounds, in
stoppynge of blood, chieflye for inward wounds and ulcers: and for the
mernailous profit it gives, in healinge ruptures.

Farina Volatica.
THe flying meal of the mylle, commonly called mill stuff: being not one,
but the meal commonly of many grains together, must needs possess such
faculties, Galenus de alimentis. li. ^. ac de atenuan te Victus ratione.
as the composition makes: (As wheat is of temperament what in the first
degre, but neither moisteth nor dries manifestly: And barlye cold and dry in
the first degree. Yet doth wheat flower manifestly moist, as also Barley meal
doth, somewhat more then the grain: though Polenta do dry much more.) But
Farina Volatica, is commonly cold and dry of complexion, and therefore is
conveniently put into restrictiues, and consolidatiues.

Felles auium.
CHoler naturalle, Chole.
or the gaul, called in Latyne Fell, and Bilis, in Greek (...): Is of all
iuyces in every living thing the whottest. Whose heate is yet variable,
Galenus de symp. med. li. 10.
according to the creatures their temperamentes. For as the gaul of the Hog,
is of al other beasts the coldest: so is the gaul of the sheep, of the got,
of the Bull. c. every one in their degrees whotter.

But the gaules of fowls, (which only Lanfranke hath, are both sharper and
dryer, then of.iiii. foted beasts. Of the which also, the galls of Hens
and Pertriches, are most allowed in medicynes: The gaules of the Rite, of the
Egle and such like are (...) dinge sharpe and biting: yea of a grene col^es,
and sometime s^rte. And therefore Galen doth warn the same, that Lanfranke
neglects not: That is; to put unto any of them the juice of Fenell, Mel, and
Opobalsamum: whenever you use them to the eyes.

Fermentum.
CAlled in Greek (...): Zyme.
is meanlye, what, consistinge of subtille parts coparcioner of a certain
cold sharpness, Galenus de sym li. 6. de comp. med. secun. gen. ra. li. 3.
and also of heate, sprung of putrefaction: and has in common, both the
nature of salt and meal.

Wherefore leven, especially if it be old draws from the depth gross
spirits and superfluous humores, and dygesteth them. But what needs here thus
much, when Lanfranke has so (...) spoken thereof in his antidotarye.

Ficus.
THe Fig (and also the tree,) Syce.
is called in Greek (...). The dry Figs have a certain subtiltye, Galenus
de symp. li. 8.
and do heate in the first degre, or in the beginnynge of the second:
wherefore as well they, as their decoction, do concocte, and digest hard
swellinges. But where concoction is chiefly required, they ought to be (...)
with (...) And where rather digestion, Hor^acea. Fat figs have the more
concoctiue power, and sour Figs do both scour more, and digest. Grene
figs are weaker, yet do both ye moist, (which hurt the stomach) the dry,
purge the belly. But the flux by them moved, is (...) stayed.

Fistula.
FIstula says Galen, (in his book of tumores against nature,) Sinus est
angustus longus. c. A fistule is a straight and long bosom, like to other
bosoms, which is much drawn together, and after also again opened.

That cave or holowe room in the flesh, Sinus.
which I have Englished a bosom, is there also of Galen thus defyned. When
rotten matter, doth excoriate bodies, and deuyde the conteniynge from the
contained, or subiect^: And farther, it being emptied howe so ever, the parts
d^dente one from an other, can not recover their pristinate constitution: this
affect is called Sinus. Which (if it be not with speed cured) doth gather to
it self Callum, and in time be comes harde: and then can not be adglued to
his parts subject. c. And then doubtless it is no longer Sinus, but Fistula.

Flammula.
FLammula: is one of the kinds of Ranuculus, (whereof there are very many,) as
are also the herbs, called of Lanfranke and others, Apium risus, and Apium
Haemorrhoidit, and also Pes milui (as above under Apium:) and has so exceeding
burning, and blisteringe power: (as have also all the rest,) that it
exulcerateth, the e^raelles, but chiefly the ly^er: and therefore is most
pernicious for sheep, and other beasts feeding thereon. Lanc^ola.
It is called also of some Lanccola, and in Englyshe spear work, for that the
leaves thereof, have the form of a spear head.

Flos aeris.
IS called in Greek (...): Chal^uanthos.
some men saith Dioscorides have called it Clauorum Veterum, psegma, that is
the scraping, rubbish, or dust of old brass nailes, or rivers. But a little
after showing the making thereof, he says it comes of melted brass, by
pouring cold water thereon, forth with as it runs by certain conducts, out of
the fornace. Whereby this Flos aris breaks forth, and congeals in many
small parts, which of their forms, some have called little grains. De symp,
li. 9
It is by the sentence of Galen, of more subtle substance, then aes Vstum, or
Squama aeris: doth vehemently scour, also bites much. Wherefore with collyries
made thereof, the great roughi^esse or ruggedness of the eye brows are taken
away, other superfluous excr^scentes.

And although it be (as you see) most evident, that Aeris go and Flos aeris
are two things: yet may the one in some cases, be circumspectly used for the
other: after the minds of diverse learned. Loke more at Viride aes.

Foeniculum.
FEnell, Marathron. Galenus de sym. med. li. 7
which the Grecians call (...), doothe heate in the first degre, and dry in
the second, which eaten, or the seade drunk with barley water, sylleth the
paps with milk: Whose juice also heals the web in the eye, and sharpens
the sight most commodiously. The root and seade of Hippomarathrian do dry
more then Foeniculum domesticu: Dioscorides. li. 3.
and therefore seem to stay the belly, and also are able to break the stone,
and to heal the ^aundies.

Foenum graecum.
IS called in Greek (...). Telis. Dioscor. li. 6. de sym. li. 8. dt com. med.
secu. gen. li. 7 de com. med. secun. locos, li. 4.
The seade whereof being well sodden, discusseth and mollifyeth, chieflye with
some kind of fatness. The dicoction thereof hath discussyue, and moderate
heatinge property, and therefore loses, and maturateth: and is wont to
mitigate many pains. It is whotte says Galen in the second degre, and dry
in the first: Whereby it kyndleth, and augments inflammatyons. For the which
cause Lanfranke hath frendlye warned us, to eschew the laying of Fenigreke,
to whotte inflamed members. Yet doth it by his dividing power, heal such
inflammations, as are more hard then whotte.

Formica.
OF this tumore called in Greek (...), My^mecia. li. 4. fen. 3.
Aulce^a, (of whom Lanfranke seems to take his definition thereof,) Primi
tractatus.
says* it is a pustule, that comes out, and causes a pure aposteme, and is
ambolatyue, Which perhaps vlcerateth, or else will be resolved: having a
substance, Li. 4. De methodo mededi.
round like a little wart, inflamed, and of colour somewhat citrine. But
Galen (rekening it with Veruca, Acrochordine, and other like affects of the
(kin,) teaches how with a holowe quille to pluck it out. Affirming also,
that some men at Rome in his time, used to byte them away with their teeth.
Neither of the which ways, can in any wise be mete for pure apostemes, either
ulcerated, or apt to be resolved.

Of the little Ante or pismire, Myr^ne^.
called (...) doth this tumor take his name, both in Greek and Latin. Of whose
eggs Lanfranke makes an oil, whose use and utility: there may you find.

Fraxinus.
IT should seem that Lanfranke, takes the rynde of ash, to be of virtue like
unto myrtils, in driyng up the bruised places, keeping the same from
putrefaction: If it be not added by some other, for I have perused some copies,
which have it not. But Ash is virtuous against the swollen spleen, and hath
diverse properties, agreing with the Mirte tree, Melia.
as in learned authors ye may farther read both old and new wryters.
Fraxinus.
The Ash tree is called in Greek (...), and in Latin Fraxinus.

Furfur.
BRan hath qualities variable, De symp. med. sac. lib. 5.
after the kind of grain that it comes of. Howe be it, Furfur is commonly
taken for bran of wheat: which is says Galen, not so whotte, but dries
more then the meal, and doth somewhat scour.

Galbanum.
GAlbanum, or as some write Chalbanum, after the Greek, which is (...)*
Chalbane.
is saith Dioscorides, the liquor of a tree, called Metopiu, of a country in
Syria, where it grows. Which name doth the Gum also sometimes obtain: For
the vnguente Metopion is so called, of the admirtio of Galbanum therewith. And
he says that it is adulterate with hulled beans, resin, ammoniake. De symp.
li. 8 De com. med. secun. genera. lib. 3. 5.. 7.
Diosc. lib. 1. cap. 6. lib. ^. cap. 79.

It ought to have Similitudinem Thuris, uel Ammoniaci. It takes his name ab
Albedine (says Antonius Musa Brasanolus:) and therefore the whiter it is the
better, and contrariwyse, the worse. Wherefore the Galbanum that we commoly
have, may well be judged adulterate, or else the dregs dross of right
Galbanum. It heats after Galen, in the end of the second degree, or in the
beginning of the third, and dries in the beginning of the second. Whereby it
hath comforting, mollifiyng, and degestiue power, aswageth pain, and is put in
maturatiues: and in the pricks or hurts of sinews, it helps not a little to
mitigate payne, if the nerues be not bare, for it hath (as have all other
multificatiues) some putrefiyng property.

Gallae.
GAlla (says Dioscorides.) is a fructe of the Oak, whereof the less is
rugged, without holes, and as it wear but half grown, called (...), and is
the best: The other (which is greater) is plain, light, pierced through with
holes. They are to us well known: as well by the use of perfect Galls, which
we receive from other regios, as also that we see the yearly growing
plentifully in Kent: (which are there of ye como sort called oak appuls.) Though
they be never indurate. And whether there be several kinds of oaks, whereof (as
master Turner reasons,) some bear Galls, and some not, I can not say: For
with us, few oaks for the most years are without.

Howe be it, of master D. Cunningham I am (through his most friendly
conference) informed, that he hath by observation found on oaks growing about
Norwich, (where they are in certain woods very plentiful,) three kinds of
fructes: the Acorn, the Oak appull, and the Gall: All the which I have also
by obseruatio found in Kent. The Acorn, and the Appull, growing on the
sprigs or branches, but the Gall, on the leaves of the tree. The Gall
(says he) waxes harde, and the outward covering wrynkled, and hath been by
trial proved good (beside the native adstringent^ virtue,) to make ink, and
black colours. Affirming also, that the appul is harde in Julie, but hath
growing on it a soft substance, not unlike to moss, inwardly more massy, very
stiptike: within the which also are those things found, that are in the Gall.
Whereof also some old expert husbandmen of Kent, have no small opinio to judge
by them the sequel of the year. For they breaking them about their time of
withering, do find in them some living thing. As sometime an Ante, whereof
they judge plenty of grain: sometime a white worm like a gentill, whereof they
prognosticate morreine in of beasts: And sometime a spider, whereof they
presage the pestilence, or some other like sickness, to follow among men. Which
thing also the learned have not omitted to note, though not in the same order.
For Matthiolus upon Dioscorides hath these words.

Illud sibi peculiar maiores Gallae vendicauere, In prim^. Dioscori^i^. lib.
Cap. Vero. 124. (...).1. Galla.
ut quota^is aut annone fertilitatem, aut sterilitatem, aut pestilentem auram
praenucient: Nam si rumpantur integrae ( quae perforatae non sunt,) aut muscam,
aut araneum, aut uermiculum exponent. Si ruiscauolat la belli, si repit
uermiculus, (...) penuriae: si currit araneus, pesulenti^ morborum praesaguim
est. Neque cuiquam mirum uideatur, quod ex omnibus Gallis ista oriantur
animalcula: eterim ego huius rei saepius feci periculum, nullamque unquam sum
cosequutus prius no perforatam, quae ex tribus animalibus unum intrase non
contineret. Nam foramine conspecto facile iudicium sumi potest, jam animal
exiisse. Dicamus igitur licet, quaercum fructum, animal gignere. Cuius rei haud
ignari ueteres illi patres, non sine causa quercum dixerut Ioui summo esse
dicata. Which may in effect thus be Englished. This thing have the greatter
Galls challenged peculiar to the selves that they can yearly forshewe, either
plenty or scarcity of victualle, or a pestilential air: for if they be
broken in sond^e, namely those that are not already through pierced. They
confeine either a fly, a spider, or a worm. If a fly be food, it is a
prognostication of war to follow: if a crepyng worm, of the scarcity of
victual: but if a runnynge spider, of pestilent sicknesses. Neither let any
man marvel, that out of Galls those little living things should appear: for
this thing have I often proved, neither did I ever find any, (being not before
pierced with holes,) which contained not within it self one of the fornamed
animalles: for the hole being scene, it is easy to judge that they are now gone
forth. Wherefore we may say, that the oak brings forth fruit, and living
things. Of the which, the old fathers not being ignorant, have said (not
without cause) that the oak was ^edicated to the high Jupiter.

Galla (says Galen) which is called Omphacitis, De simpliciu facultatibus
lib. 7.
is a sower medicine and of substance for the most part earthy cold: whereby it
dries and repercusseth fluxions, constreyneth fastens lose and feeble parts.
It coleth in the second degree, and dries in the third. The other (which is
great, yelow, and soft) dries also, but that so much the less as it hath
less sower or sharpe qualities.

Gangraena.
GAngraenae says Galen, De tumo. praeter not. de art curatiua. lib. 2.
are such mortifications not yet absolute, as are made by the greatness of
inflammations: and are raised when blood boiling whotte, annexed to
inflammations, burns the skin. Look more at Aschachilos.

Garyophilli.
GAryophylli, (...).
(others write Caryophylli,) in Greek (...): so called, saith Paulus Aegi neta,
quasi folia nucis habentes, that is, having the leaves of nut trees,
odoriferous, and of very good taste. This hath neither Dioscorides nor Galen:
but Plinie makes metion thereof, saying. There is a fruit in India called
Garyophilon, like a pepper grain, but greater and britler, of colour reddishe
upon black, headed like a nail, with four denticles spread like a star:
within the which lies bowlyng out a little round button. The tree is of
height three cubits, having little thick leaves, a broad woody root.

Cloves are whotte and dry in the third degree, very aromatike, and have
almost the virtue of pepper, but do hurt the stomach less, are good
against poison. In lynimentes they have virtue to consume, dissolve, comfort
sinews, and assuage payne, specially coming of cold matter.

Gentiana.
GEntian is an herb: Gentiane, lib. 3.
called of the Grecians (...), whose first invention as fayeth Dioscorides, is
assigned to Gentius king of Illiria. The root thereof is what and dry, Galenus
De simp. med. li. 6
as the adstringencie and extreme bitterness thereof witnesses: And therefore
doth most effectually purge, extenuate, and scour away. Whereby it helps
obstructions, and is drunk In Vino, cum ruta pipere against the danger of
venomous wounds: and is sometimes put into fistules, and hollow ulcers, to
enlarge their orifice.

Gingiber.
Gingiber is written otherwise Zingiber, look there.

Glandulae.
GAlenus in lib. 13.. 14. De methodo medendi, defines Glandules their natures
double, saying. Some Glandules there are, placed in the midst of the
vessels, and of their branches, to defend their strength, whose use is not
great. Other there are (whose use is greater,) made to receive, and make
spitle, milk, seade, c. (as thou may farther see in mine anatomy, neither
are they otherwise cured, when they are affected Cum scirrho, then other parts
of the body: But the other require the part, with also the corruption to be
taken utterly away. They are parts most apt to receive fluxions, as well for
their weakness and losen^s of substance, as also because among all other parts,
they have (except the alteratiue) almost no natural faculty: and therefore are
most swiftly taken, of the tumores Bubones.

Gl^ndulae in Lanfranke, are to be understanded of the first sort of Glandules
contained in the vessels, being affected of Phygethlo^r* Scrophula.
but chiefly after his mind, of humores phlegmatike. Str^a.
For if by melacholy they become scirrhous, he calls them Scrophulas,
Cbo^ras.
but Galen names them Strumas, and in Greek (...).

Glycyrrhiza.
(...), which is Radix dulcis, and we call it liquerice, Galenus De simp. med.
li. 6
After the Apothecaries who call it Liqueriti^, is endued with a certain
warming property, and yet more cold then man his nature: and must needs
also be moderatlye moyste, as it is moderately sweet. And therefore to staye
thyrste it is most mete, Diosc. lib. 3.
and smotheth or softens the roughnes or ruggednes, as well of the bladder,
as of the sharpe artery. It is convenient for the heate of the breast,
stomach, and liver: And drunk Cum passo, heals the p^ines of the renes. The
powder of the root also dried, heals says Dioscorides, the web of the
eye.

Grana paradisi.
GRana paradisi, are commonly taken for Cardamomo, and are so usually sold of
the Apothecaries. Cardamomu.
Not withstanding others emog the learned, think the common little grains,
to be Grana paradisi.

It is a spice of whotte dry nature, odoriserous of smell. Which I could never
find so perfectly descrybed of any man, as of Rychard Eden, where he writes
of the two first viages* of our Englyshemen to Guinea: saiynge that our men
might have lade their ships with those grains, by the river Se^o. These
Grains (says he,) grow and come forth, in a fruit much like a fig*
which (when they are gathered,) are as red as blood. They grow not paste a
foot and a half, or two foot from the ground: And as the fig hath in it
many grains, so has this fruit. Through the which the inhabitants there
make holes, wherein they put strings, and so hang them to dry, that the said
Grains may he the more easily taken out: as all seades and grains, may most
aptly be taken from their coddes vessicles or ears, when they be very dry.
These last have been taken for Cardamamo minori, and the former sold commonly
for Granis paradisi,) for Cardim^o maiori. And this is the opinion of the later
Phisitiens: for Brasauolus notes three sorts of seeds, which have been of
old among the Apothecaries, Meligetta. Nigell^ trina.
under this name Cardamomum. The one is the trianguled grain, which they sell
as is above said, bath for Cardam^mo, and (...) p^ralisi. The second he
calls Meligettan. The third (says he is Nigella Cirrina.

But it is the opinion of some learned men, grounded upon diverse reasons, that
Cardamomum of the auncientes, is to us utterly unknown.

Gummi Arabicum.
GVmmi Arabicum found (and also so called) of the Arabi^ns, because it is
there most plentiful, and also Bi^ilonicum S^rasenicum, upon like reason, is
ye tears of the thorn^ tree called Acacia Spina Aegyptia, described before in
ye letter A) and therefore may it be called Gummi Acaciae, or Gummi Spinae
Aegyptiae, Though the Gum that is under that name commonly sold, be the
gum sometime of the bitter almonde tree, which is next of goodness to the
best, sometime of the Cherry or prime trees, and sometime of the Elm: and
this is the cause why it is food of so diverse colours. It is (as the tree
whereof it comes) of cooling and drying faculty, without sharpness or biting:
And therefore a commodious lenitive medicine, for the grefes and peines of the
eyes.

Hammoniacum.
Is to be sought at Ammoniacum.

Haematites.
(...), idest lapis sanguinaria, in English the blood stone* So called l^yeth
Galen, of the likeness in colour that it hath with blood: Gal. De symp. lib.
9.
being of so much coldness, as it has adstriction. Wherefore it is found a
medicine profitable to the eyes: and may be used alone, to the roughnes of the
eye brows, if it come of inflammatio. And thus much of his faculties
efficient, which are by reason known. For the faculties that it hath after
the property of the whole substance, are neither known by reason, nor
methode, but only by experience. Whereby it stays the flure of blood, the
wound being only touched therewith. It is convenient for all ulcers, and the
poulder thereof represses excrescentes.

Hedera.
IUye (of the Grecians (...),) is after Dioscorides of.iii. kinds, Cissos,
lib. 2.
namely Candida (which Plinie calls foemina,) Nigra, (of Plinie mas,) and
Helix. Whereof the white rejoices in watery places, the black to grow upon
walls or trees, and Helix barenly crepeth on the ground.

It consists (by the sentence of Galen) of contrary qualities: De symp. lib.
7.
as of a certain adstryngente substance, which is cold and earthy, having
also some sharpnes: which to be whotte even the taste proves. And farther if
it be grene, it obteineth a warm and watery substance.

The grene leaves therefore boiled in wine, do glewe together and bring to
healynge, great and maligne ulcers, and ulcers made with fire: though by
experience, we see them also attractive, and apt to keep long open, such
sores as we would not have healed. And being boiled with vyneger, they help
the sick of the spleen. The tears or gum thereof kills nittes, and makes
bald, and is so whotte, that it privily burns. Which yet I have found, to
be a marvelous desiccatiue, and with oil to assuage peyne.

Hermodactylus.
THough that kind of (...), Ephemeron.
(so called because it kills in one day him that eats the root thereof)
that is also called (...), Colchicon.
(of the country Colchis, where it did plentifully grow) have among many
learned men, borne the name of Hermodactylus, and may be one of the worst or
nocyue kinds of the same, according to the descriptios of A^iicenna, Serapio,
Mesues, other Arabias: yet it is not the Hermodactylus that is sold of the
Apothecaries. First because the root of this is round on al parts, black or
reddyshe, and when it is dry rugged, or wrynkled: whose stalk goes forth at
a rifte or creaste, in the upper or smallest end. That of the Apothecaries is
round on the one side, and flat on the other: white, and smothe, and without
rifte: but hath on the flat side, a certain shalowe dint, as it wear a
clove cleauynge to the side of a stalk. Wherein it very well agrees, with
Hermodactylo, as Paulus Aegineta descrybeth it. The same also doth Cordus
infer, because Colchicum strangles, which Hermodactyli do not. Who
affirms Hermodactylus to grow in mowne meadows, and sonny places.

Mesues making two kinds of Hermodactili, says. It is the root of an herb
that grows on the hills, whereof the one is of a finger length, the other
round: and this is either white, red, or black. Among the which, that
which is white, both within and without, is the best: as the red and the
black are euell. Which (says Scrapio) do strangle, and therefore may one of
these be that kind of Colchicum, or wild saffron, that grows in certain
gardyns in Englande.

But who so would note more exactly, Mesues order of division of
Hermodactilus, may behold it thus gathered.

Of Hermodactilus there are two kinds. Long, as of a finger length. Roud
whereof the sorts are three, differyng in colours, as 1 White whereof ye 2
Red. 3 Black. Best is 1 Very white both within without. 2 Compact. 3 Mean
between harde and soft.
All others howe much so ever they want of the fornamed tokens, so much are
they inferior in goodness to the best. Both the which are euell.



It is whotte and dry in the begynninge of the second degree. whose moisture
is excrementous, fatulente, abhorfull, and hurts the stomach: chiefly when
the excrementes of other parts flow into the same. It draws principally
from the ioynctes gross phlegm: And therefore helps the gowte, and other
pains of the lymmes, either taken in, or laid to in Cataplasmate, Sperma
quoque auget.
cum uitellis ouorum, farina hordeacea, uel mica panis. It makes fat, and is
proffitable for ulcers: in that it consumes the putrefied flesh, and wypeth
away the filthines in the. Hermodactylos.
It is called (...), Quasi mercurii digitus, that is, Mercuries finger, or else
as others will Hermetis digitus.

Herpes.
(...), De methodo medendi. lib. 1. 2.. 4.
is one of the tumores against nature, that are referred to Erysipelas, and an
affect or exulceration of the skin, springing, (by the testimony of Galen)
of the same cause: as of bilious excrementes, setlyng in some place. Saving
that the humore thereof, is thinner and subtiler then of Erysipelas, wherein also
they differ. It is says he, of two kinds. De tumorib. praeter natura Herpes
exedens.
For when the substance is gross, it pierces through the skin with his
vlcerations, even to the flesh, and is called Herpes exedens: which ryghtly
in quality resembles the serpent, (whereof it hath his name) in crepyng, and
devouring the parts adjacent, and is of the kind of Erysipelas vlcerate. But
when it is engendered of choler not so whotte and sharpe, or (as to some it
seems not all without reason) mingled with some phlegm: It makes no ulcer,
but little pustules like the grains of Milium, and therefore is called Herpes
miliaris: Herpes miliaris.
Which yet within a while do degenerate into ulcers. And in his second book
De art curatiua, he mentions a third kind after Herpes exedens, saying.
But if the humores be thinner, and do only burn the upper part of the
skin: it also obteineth a name, and is symply called Herpes.

Hordeum.
BA^ley is called in Greek (...), and thereof are there diverse kinds. Crit^e.
As Hordeum distichum, wiche is our summer barley. Hordeum tetrastichon, big
barley. Hordeum polystichum, of some winter barley. Hordeum Hexastichu, which
D. Turner calls duche barley. Gy^ocritho.
(...).i. Hordeum nudum, uel corticis expers, naked barley, c. Which farther
to dilate, here is neither place nor need.

Barley coleth and dries (after Galen) in the first degree, De alimentis. lib.
1.
wherein it differs from wheat, and hath also a little abstersion, De sym.
medi. fac. lib. 7.
and in meates excells beans: because it is not wyndy. Barley bread
nourysheth less then wheat, but provokes the belly more: and is unto men of
small or no exercise, of large nuryshement. So is also Polenta, which is of
nature more dry: although Ptisana, do naturally moist. And in Libro de
attenuante uictus ratione, he says: that among all other breades, barley is
vnhurtefull to a sclender diet. Barley meal outwardly resolves, mollifies,
and maturateth, chiefly whotte affects, and choleric tumores.

Hyosciamus.
HEenbane is called in Greek (...), Hyosciamos.
in Latin Hiosciamus, Apollinaris, Faba suilla, Altercum: of Apuleus
Symphoniaca: of others also Fabulum, and Eabulonia: and of some Cassilago, or
Caniculata: of the Apothecaries Iusquiamus. Of Henbane there are three kinds:
the black, the yelowe, and the white. The black is our common kind: Whose
seade causes madness, and is not allowed. The yelowe grows in my garden, the
seade whereof was given me, of master Roger Lee Doctor of physic: which is
better then the black, but yet to be eschued as hurtful. That whose flower
and seade is white, I never saw as yet. It is only allowed wholesome, beymg
cold in the third degree, Galenus De st^p. med. li. 8
and is a narcotike, or stupefactiue medicine: asswagyng peyne, and represses
the inflammations of the eyes: helps the gowte, Diosc. lib. 4
and asswageth the swellynges of the breast and stones.

Hyposarca.
(...), Anasarca. Gale. De dignoscendis pulsibus. lib. 4.
called also Sarcites, Hyposarca, and Leucophlegmatias, is that kind of
Hydrops, which (spreadyng it self larglyer then the other two Ascites and
Tympanites,) possesses the whole habit of the body, with much moisture: De
pulsuum causis. lib. 4.
though the other two do yet send affects, to other parts then they
possess, which is the belie. As to the great arteries, Ascytes, colyng,
stretching and aggrauatyng them, and Tympanites, filling the with wind. Whose
coats Anasarca doth lose mollify. The Hydropsy comes diverse ways. As by
the obstruction and refrigeration of the liver, or by Scirrho therein: by the
faults of the breast the spleen and the renes, of the gut Pylorus and
Mesenterium, or of some one of the small guts: of the immoderate flux of the
Haemorrhoides, or of Menses, and of the suppression of the same: and sometime
of the vntymly drinking of cold water, coolyng the liver: Without some
unnatural affection whereof, there can spring no Hydropsie, says Galen. De
locis affectis. lib. 5. cap. 6.

Icteritia.
(...) (which takes that name of the yelowe bird Icterus, Icteros.
called also Galbula) is called in Latin Arquatus, Arquatus* Aurigo. Morbus
regius.

Lacertus.
LAcertus, or Lacerta, is a worm or little beast, having four feet, and
formed in body like our efte or ewght (which therefore some judge a kind of the
same,) of colour in germany ashye or black, and of a span or of a foot
length at the most. In Italy longer, of colour grene, venomous, but yet
most friendly to man, (whose face he delights to behold,) enemy to
serpents: and for man his cause, (whose spittle he will lycke when he finds
him fleaping, using it as a defence) he fights against serpents, and
therefore obteyneth worthily the name (...). Ophiomachos
Almanzoar, describinge the same medicine for the eyes, that Lanfranke doth,
hath Stercus magni lacerti, that is ye dung of the great Lizarde: For they are
of two kinds. As a greater now expressed, a less, which is called of some
Stellio, because it hath spots on the skin like to stars.

The dung of the Lizarde, is a medicine proffitable for the eyes, as to
sharpen the sight, to take away the itch, and the web in the same. The head
of the Lizarde, (as says Dioscorides) bruised and laid to, Lib. 1.
draws out all pricks or stynges fixed in the flesh, takes away spots,
and the wartes called Formicas, (...).i. Ver^ca pensilis.
and Acrochordonas. The liver of the same put into holowe teethe, takes away
their peynes. The Lizarde broken, and laid to the stroke of a Scorpion, eases
the same.

Lac muliebre.
Milk called in Greek (...), Gala.
(whose substance primitiue is blood:) is of temperament, mean between blood
and phlegm, consisting of three substances diverse, and in effects contrary.
Galenus De sanitate tu^da lib. 1.. 5.
Namely whayey, which is cold and moist, and loses the belly: Curdie, which
is tough, and binds the same: and fatty, whereof butter is made, and used
(says Galen, De ma^smo.
Lib. 3. De alimentis,) in cold contreis for oil. De methodo medendi, lib. ^
Of qualities as variable as the bodies are divers, wherein it is made: As cow
milk is most gross and fat, (which heals the Dysenteria.) De sym. med.
lib. 4.. 10.
Camels milk lean and most liquyde. But of all the thynnest and most whayey
is asses milk: De compo. secu^ loca. lib. 4
And therefore to dry affects is most convenient: The mean between these
holds goats milk: which taken without honey is perylous, De Theriaca ad
pisonem.
because if it congeyle in the stomach it suffocates. Galenus De Euchymia,
Cacochymia) Thicker then which is shepes milk, c.

Milk generally nurysheth, makes good juice, purges the belly moderately, is
profitable for the breast, and heals the ulcers of the lunges: but to the
head that is not very fyrme it is unprofitable, and the use thereof to the
teethe very hurtful. But of all other woman's milk, (as of the same nature) is
to us most familiar, and to physic persons an excellent medicine: convenient
also for sharpe and bytyng fluxions of the eyes, and inflammations of the same,
and to the ulcers of the panicle Cornea. It mitigateth the inflammations of the
mouth, throat, and Vuula, and eases the squincie: and is given as a help to
them that have taken corrodyng venyms.

The best milk is very white, and without sensible temperament: that is having
no odor or little, and the same pleasant: but having in taste some sweetness,
like wholesome blood. As that which is in any wise thereunto contrari, is always
euell.

Lactuca.
(...) is of kind first double, Thridax.
as Lactuca satiua, or Hortensis, yt is garden letuce: And Lactuca syluestris,
called grene Endyue. Of the first there are diverse kinds, (as there is also
of this:) Dios. lib. 2.
as Crispa, so called of his wryncled or curled leaves, Galen. de alimentis.
lib. 2.
Rotunda taking his name, of the round leaves. and Capitata: that is cabbege
letuce, of his headlike roudnes or Cabbeginge. De attenuate uictus ratioe.


Letuce cools and moisteth by the testimony of Galen, according to the
temperament, De locis affectis lib. 3. de symp. med. facul. li. 3. et. 6
of fountain water, and therefore is commodious to whotte inflammatios, and
Erysipelata of the worst kinds. It cools the stomach* and stays thyrste:
and therefore says Galen, that he used it in his youth to cool with, When
choler infested his stomach, And in age, as a help against wakfulnes: For the
seade provokes sleep, and stays Geniturae profluuium. The juice thereof
neither resists concoction, nor ^yndeth the belly: But the large drinking
thereof is very dangerous.

Laudanum.
LApdanum as we barbarously use to call it, is called of Dioscorides in Greek
(...), of Galen (...), and in Latin Ladanum: Lad^non.
but more commonly of the Apothecaries Laudanum. Cisthos.
Galen affirms Ladanum to be whotte beyond the first degree, De symp. me.
lib. 7.
of a subtyle substance: and has virtue to mollify, resolve moderately, to
digest, and concocte harde things, to amend the deformity of scars, to
disolue the duration of the matrixe, and to amend other vices thereof. It
stays the faulyng of hear, but yet is not able to heal Alop^ias, or
Opthalmia, which require stronger medicines. Being drunk with wine, it
stops the belly and provokes vryne. Dioscor. lib. 1. cap. 10.


It is the Gum of a certain shrubbe or bush, called Cistus, Ledon.
or (...), which master Turner called therefore Cistus ladanifera: and is
gathered by drawing ropes, or such like things, De com. med. secun. loca. li.
1
through the bushes: or else as saith Galen from the beards of gotes, which
they have gathered by feding among the same.

Laurus.
THe Laurel or Bay tree, Daphne.
is called in Greek (...), and in Latin Laurus. Dioscor. lib. 1.
The leaves whereof do vehemently heate dry, but the beries more vehemently:
and therefore do help the diseases of the lunges, caused of cold and
reumatyke matter, pains of the ears also, and deafnes. Galenus de symp. lib.
6.
The rynde of the root, is neither so sharpe nor so whotte, but more bitter,
and hath also some adstriction: and therefore is with sweet wine profitable to
the breast, and breaks the stone. The leaves do sensibly bind, offend the
stomach, and provoke vomit. Bruised and applied, they help the stingyng of
wasps or bees: And Cum polenta pane, assuage inflammations.

Other kinds of this there are, as Nerium, Laurus Alexandrina, and Daphnoides,
which we call laurialle: but because they are for the more part rare unto us,
and not serving to any thing written in this book: I here omit to speak any
more of them.

Lenticula.
(...), Phacos.
Latin, Lens Lenticula, and in Englyshe Lentilles, Phace.
Is a kind of pulse. whose grain says Fuchsius, Galen. de alimentis. lib.
1.. 2.
is of all other the least: of temperamente mean between whotte and cold,
but dry in the second degree. Of substance gross, earthly, austere, and
myghtly adstringet. Wherefore both their substance and second decoction,
Euchymia Cacochymia.
suppresses the flux of the belly, and comfort the stomach: though ye
juice yet be losing, De sym. lib. ^.
the first decoction do purge the same. It is of little juice, and of
nurishment gross and melancholyke, to melancholyke persons dangerous, and
bredeth on them Elephantiasim, Cancrum, and dulls the syghte.

Lepra.
LEpra says Auicen, is as it wear Cancer com^t^is toto corpori, that is a
Cancer common to al the body: wherein he shows him him self to mean,
Elephas. Elephantiasis Leontiasis. (...). i. Morbus foedus.
that lothly affect, which the Grecians call (...), and some (...), of the
greatness of the disease, making the skin lose, rugged, and of diverse colours
like the skin of the Elephante: and is of Galen thus described. Elephas
says he, is a melancholic affect, having his beginning of melancholic
blood: Lib. de tumor praeter natu. de sympto. causis. lib. 3. (...).
but in process of time, black choler superaboundeth that blood in quantity,
and then doth the body stink, and seems filthy, deformed, and the flesh
black, and sometimes is exulcerate. Of the same kind also is Lepra graecorum,
and comes of a like cause, but is more common to the skin, is not always
so universal: Which some (of the likeness and community of the one with the
other) have called (...), Psora.
id est scabiem, but not without confusion. Guido de Cauliaco, and others of
that age, have rekoned four kinds of Lepra, for the which resort to Serpigo.

Leucophlegmatia.
(...), is that kind of the Hydropsie that is called also Anasarca, Sarcites,
and commonly Hyposarca, look there.

Lilium.
(...), Crinos, Crino Leirion.
Latin Lilium, atque Rosa iunonis, whereof Dioscorides, Lib. 3. mentioned two
kinds: as Album, and Croceum. The leaves roots of the white lilyes (for that
chiefly is used in medicine,) do dry, digest, and moderately scour away: and
therefore Cum oleo rosato are good for burnynges of fire. The flowers thereof
consiste of a mixed temperament: as of a substance partly subtle, partly
earthy, partly watery, and that temperate. Whereof it follows the oil made of
them, to be of digestinge and mollifiyng faculty, without biting: and
therefore is most convenient, for the hardnesses of mother, inflammations of
the coddes, and apostemes.

Linum.
Flax, Linon.
which is named in Greek (...), (as well as the seade thereof called (...),
Linospermon.
id est semen lini,) is of temperament whotte in the first degree, and mean
between dry and moyste, obteininge the same faculties that Fenigreke hath,
and is in meat flatuous: yet doth it scatter and divide, and with boiled honey
mollyfieth both inwardly and outwardly harde inflammations: and being raw,
takes away the frecles and little swellynges of the face. Their broth leads
out excrementes, and profits as well against the gnawyng of the guts, as
also against inflammations and other diseases of the mother.

Lithargyrus.
DIoscorides in his fifte book and.62. Chapiter (treating of Lithargyros,)
notes three kinds thereof. One to be made of a certain lady sand in the
fornaces, an other of silver, and the third of lead. We of a common opinion
also reckon three sorts, as of lead, silver, of gold: which two last are
indeed both one thing: (though we have of a long time by reason of the name)
though Lithargyrum aureu to come only of gold. Lithurgyros,
For (...), is by common consent interpreted Spuma argenti, and comes thus:
as out of Brasauolus, and Matthiolus, I have gathered.

When the finers of metalles (having taken a mass of silver out of his own
vein,) would try it from the metalles, myxed therewith, (which are lead and
brass:) They put it into a certain fornace, being first wrapped in plates of
lead, or into much lead already melted, in the fornace or melting pit:
which is prepared of ashes after their manner. On the which (being melted
together) rises a certain spume, which is gathered together with an Iron
instrument, and is called Spuma argenti. And the same (if the greater store of
brass therein do give unto it a golden colour,) Chrysitis.
is called (...), and vulgarly in Latin, by the imitation of the greek,
Lithargyrum aurcum, and that only for the colour: and yet is it not to be
doubted, but that of goulde there rises also a Spume in the triyng, which I
think may most worthily be called Lithargyrum auri. An other frivolous
variety of opinions there is, about the sole or simple naming of the same: for
the common opinion is that Lithargyrum so written in receptes, without any
other addition of difference, ough to be taken for litarge of lead. Platearius
would have it taken for the litarge of goulde: but the ancient and true
interpretation, is above showed.

Lithargyros dries by the wytnesse of Galen, De symp. li. 9.
most moderately, De com. med. secun. genera. lib. 1.
consistynge in a certain measure, both of qualities and faculties: yet doth
it meanly bind and scour, and is by right as a mean among other metalles.
And therefore use we it, as the matter or substance of others: none otherwise
then wax, among things lyquide. It heals gaulynges or chafinges: and being
broken with wine, avails against ulcers, that are for their moisture harde
to heal, and that without gnawynge, if it be washed.

Lumbrici.
Look at Vermes terrestres.

Lupinus.
CAlled in Greek (...), Thermos. Galen. de sym. lib. 6.
is a kind of pulse, described of master Turner at large, (who calls it
fig been) whose immesurable bitterness shows it to be whotte and dry, and
hath virtue digestiue, and scowryng away. Being watered before, they lose their
bytternesse, and may be eaten: but they are of gross nuryshement. They kill
worines either laid to, or eaten: they purge also the liver and the spleen,
and draw out Menses foetum, cum myrrha mell. The meal of Lupines boiled in
vinegar Cum posca aut oxymelite, digests blew hurts, wennes, and scrofules:
and mondyfieth scabs, scalles of the head, and all maligne ulcers, without
mordication: and purges the skin of frecles, spots, and blew marks. And
thus much of Lupinus Satiua, for there is also Syluestris, which I have
growing in my garden at Maydstone. whose virtues are like the former, but they
do all these things more strongly.

Lycium.
IS the Juice of a thorny tree, growing chiefly in Capadocia and Lycia, of
three cubits height, (made by boylynge the infusion of the roots and
branches thereof, to the thycknes of honey,) Pyxa^ntha. Lycion.
called in Greek (...), and of Theophrastus (...), hoc est Buxus asininus,
O^opyxos, Dioscor. lib. 1.
which we may call an ass box tree: having leaves like the bore tree, with a
light, fast, and bitter fruit, like pepper: a pale coloured rynde, (not unlike
to washed Lycium,) and many crooked roots.

Lycium (that liquid medicine,) De symp. me. facult. lib. 7.
says Galen, digests, and dries in the second degree, heats moderately,
and consists of divers substances: as one of thin parts, whotte and
digestynge, an other earthly and cold.

Whereof it hath not a little adstriction, and is used to the blew marks of
bruses, to the inflammations of the mouth and fundamet, to exulcerations,
teters, rottennes, froward and stubbern ulcers, to chafinges, to sanious
runnynge ears, and to nail wheles and puts from the eyes, the dullness of
syghte. It is convenient both in drink and Clisters, for the flux of the
belly and Dysenteria: and is given for the cough, and spitting of blood. And
thus far of the true thing. For the Lycium that is now used and sold of the
Apothecaries, is of the learned judged conterfeite, deceivable: for that it is
not apt to burn, neither yields a red spume when it is quenched, as Lycium
should. And where Lycium should be black without, and red within It is
black both without and within.

An other kind of Lycium also doth Dioscorides mentio, called Lycium Indicum,
Lonchitis.
made of a plant called Lonchitis: which Dodonaeus affirms to be sold of the
Apothecaries, under the name of Sanguinis draconis, Sanguis draconis.
for the which look under the same title.

Malua.
(...), Malache.
so called of the Grecians (of (...), Id est mollire,) Fuchsius de historia
stirpiu.
because it mollifies the belly, (and Varro contedeth also it to be called
Maluam, quasi moluam, for the cause above said) is of Dioscorides and Galen
divided into two kinds: namely Hortensis, (for it is planted and grows in
gardines, (and Syluestris so called not because it grows in woods or rough
places, but wildly of it self in lay, and untilled grounds: And so of a
great number more. Hereof there are two kinds: whereunto some do also reken
Althaea, Dendromalache. Aristalthaea.
or Malua uiscus, called of Aetius (...), and of Galen (...): whereof under
Althaea.

Malua agrestis, De alim. li. 2.
(says Galen) hath some digestinge, and light mollifiyng faculty. De sym.
li. 7.
But Hortensis is apter to be eat, and friendly to the belly, but yet hurtful
to the stomach, and howe much the more it hath of watery moisture, so much
the weaker are the virtues thereof. So is the sede also so much the stronger,
as it is dryer, but Althaea doth of all other digest most effectuously. Of
temperamente he says it is whotte, which the Arabians seem to deny. Malowes
saith Dioscorides, both heals the stynging of bees and wasps, and
withstands the same, and is good for the griefs of the mother, the guts,
and the bladder: and being drunk in time, is a remedy against al venims.

Malum punicum.
THe pogranate is ye fruit of tree, Rhoea.
called in greek (...), Rhoa.
in Latin Malus punica, seu granata, and is of two sorts: as Satiua and
Syluestris, (whose flowers severally and their faculties, are touched under
Balaustium.) A third kind also there is, that kepeth a mean between the wild
and the tame: of whose temperametes Galenus lib. 8. De symp. med. fac. says
thus in effect. Every pomegranate hath some adstringent faculty, (...). i. est
ulcus quodd^ profundu uel foetidum.
but that surmounts not in all: for among them that are sharpe, some are more
sweet then sour: and by the reason of those their chief qualities, either the
one or the other is used for best. Their grains are of a driyng and byndyng
juice, (...). i. tuberculum subrubru multis radicibus sieve pedibus praedi^um.
so are also their flowers and ryndes: of them altogether may medicines be
made, very proffitable for ye stomach. Which in Li. 2. De com. med. secundum
loca. he affirms him self to have used, to the griefs of the nose called
Ozaena, Polypus. And in his book De attenuante uictus ratione, he disprayseth
the pomegranates of Pontus, (...). i. Oris u^triculi mordicatio.
as also he doth al other harde, and pontike fruit. But others says he, ye
may moderately use, for they are profitable to them that are grieved with
Cardialgia. lib. 2. De alimentorum facultatibus.

Malum.
Appuls are called (...), Melon. Malu.
and Mala, (as the apple tree is called (...), Melea.
and Malus) and are generally of two kinds: Hortense Syluestre, Malus.
(whereof somewhat at Agresta) other wise infinite, and of divers natures (as are
also their leaves and ryndes.) Galen. de alimentis. lib. 2.
The appuls that are adstringente, have a cold and earthy juice, and do cool
inflammations of heate and moisture. The sharpe ones are both cold and
subtle, and incysiue: of mean temperamente are the sweet ones, which do
incline to heate, as those that are watery and without taste do bend to
coldenes. De sym. lib. 7.
Of these used according to their qualities, may the distemperatures of the
stomach be cured: as with the meanly sharpe and with very tart appuls, you
may roborate the lose feynte stomach, glewe together wounds, and repercusse
the flux of great inflammations: but such as are more watery, do put away
less inflammations, (...). hoc est alui fluor.
that do but now begin.

They are generally of harde digestion and ill juice, but may be given after
meat to such as lack apetyte, and concocte slowly, (...). i. Viscerum
exulceratio.
to such also as are vexed with womyting, Diarrhoea, and Dysenteria. Whereunto
very tart appulles are most commodious.

Manna.
MAnna so called of the Arabians, is says Mesues the dew of a vapor, lifted
up and concocted in a temperate and fertille air, falling (in the twye lyghte
times says Matthiolus) through pleasant aspects upon certain plants and
stones, whereof there are two differences. That which falls upon stones, is
coagulated round like drops or sedes, which ought to be new, sweet,
whytyshe, or at least a citrinyshe colour. That which falls on plants,
both takes of them some quality, and hath myxed therewith some of their
leaves and flowers, though not much: whereof that which is new, and whytyshe
is best. Of this doubtless did Galen write, In Lib. 3. De alimentis: where he
says, that in the mount Libanus, men use yearly to spread skynnes on the
ground, and after they beat the trees, gathering up that which falls, and
fille pots with the honey: ^.
which they call (...), Hoc est mel roscidum, mel (...). Though Auerois
Cordubensis affirm (^ot without the opinion of divers great clerks of late
days) Manna to have ben unknown to Galen, and it to have comde in use since
his time, because in dede in all Galens works, there is no mention thereof
under that name Who mente by Manna (and also Dioscorides with other old
Grecians) a far other thing, as hereafter will appear. But Mesues procedynge
says, that it somewhat excedeth the mean in heate, scouteth and smotheth the
throat, the breast, and the stomach: purges choier gentilly, and quenches
thyrste: and mixed with strong medicines, it bettereth their actions. And thus
much of Manna Arabum, Theremiabin. Manna Th^ris De methodo medendi. li. 13.
(who call it also Thereniabin) uel Recentium, named also Manna Orientalis: for
Manna Graecorum, called also Manna Thuris, are certain fragmentes taken out of
pure frankincense, which Galen calls the dross of the same, affirming it to
be of the same nature, De com. med. secun. loca. li. 5
how be it somewhat more adstringent, by reason of the frankincense ryndes that
are somewhat mingled therewith, whereof also at Thus. somewhat more.

Mandragora.
(...), Mandragoras. (...).
is also called (...) (saith Fuchsius) a Circe, because it is thought to work
amorous affects, of Pythagoras Anthropomorphos, (...) humanam referens.
of the humane form, that the root seems somewhat to represent. About the
which the dotyng folly of some, and the guylfull knavery of others: have
Fuchsius and master doctor Turner (our countryman,) Mandragoras Candida.
rightwell detected. Hereof after Dioscorides, there are two kinds: as the
male, called Mandragoras mas, uel Candida, and also Mandragoras morion, which
is with us not very rare, And the female called Mandragoras foemina, uel
nigra, and (of the likeness that it hath with the leaves of Letuce) (...),
Thridacia.
unknown to us as yet.

It cools, De sym. med. facult. li. 7.
by the testimony of Galen, in the third excess, though saith he in the
appuls there is not a little heate and moisture: which therefore provoke deep
sleapes. The rynde of the root doth both cool and dry. The leaves of
mandrage are profitable, as says Dioscordies, for the inflammations and other
affects of the eyes, caused of ulcers in them, or in other parts howe so
ever: and mete to divide every harde tumore. It is of such mollifiynge
virtues, that Ivory (as some think) being boiled with the root thereof, may be
made soft, and apt to be wrought.

Massacunia.
MAssacunia, (for so find I it written in the prynted latin copy, and
interpreted the fylinge or scarpynge of earthen pots glased,) is written of
Almanzoar (who for Albula in oculo, makes the same recept) Masacuma, and
Pandactarius writes it Massicuma: Who says it is a colour wherewith earthen
vessels are nealed, and called also of them Petanum. Showing moreover the
opinion of diverse, as that some say it is the water of glasen vessels, and
others that it is glass not perfectly boiled, and is the matter whereof glass
is made, and vulgarly called Massacocta, c. Whose virtues, because the matter is
uncertain, and the autorities scant probable, (for in Galen, Dioscorides, and
other auncientes I find it not) I leave to silence.

Mastiche.
(...) commloy called Mastix, Dioscor. lib. 1.
and of Dioscorides Resina Lentiscina, for it is the gum or liquor of the
tree Lentiscus, (called also in Greek (...)) is of temperament whotte and dry
in the second degree: Whereof Galen makes two kinds, Galen. de sym. faculta.
lib. 7.
namely Candida, Nigra. The white mastike says he, (calling it also Mastiche
Chia, because the best and fairest grows plentifully in Chio) doth bind and
mollify: Chius is an Isle of the sea Aege^.
and therefore is proffitable, for the inflammations of the stomach, the belly,
the liver, and the bowels: To the old cough also, and as says Dioscorides
to the reiectios of blood. It is friendly to the stomach, but moves belchyng,
and is used to scour the teethe and the face.

The black mastike (called Mastiche Aegiptia) dries more but binds less,
therefore is the meter for such things as require stronger digestion, by
evaporation.

Maturatiua.
MAturatiua medicamenta, sieve pus mouentia, are rypyng medicines, De methodo
medend. li. 4.
or quitture breders. Which heate and moist says Galen, reducyng substaces of
divers kinds ad pus uel saniem, De sympt. causis. lib. 5.
that is to matter or quitture: and comes of Maturo, to maturate or make ripe.

Mel.
IS called of the Greekes (...), Meli.
which some think to be the humore of the air purging it self, for it is
sometimes found to cleave upon men's hear and apparel, that are abroad very
rathe. wherefore Plinie judges it the sweat of heaven, or else a certain
slymines or spittle of the stars. Mel Vernum.
And thereof are three kinds: as Melanthinii, uel Vernum, Mel (...).
which is gathered in the spring: Mel horaeum, ^ut aest^um, gathered in the
summer: Mel ^riceum.
and Friceum, which is smally esteemed, Erica.
for that it is gathered in Autumn, when Erica only blows in the woods.
Galenus de symp. medi. fac. li. 4.. 7
The best honey is gathered in summer, of Thyme and such other odiserus
plants, which heats and dries in the second degree, and mundifieth.
Others either allow or dispraise it, in respect of the place where it is
gathered: praysinge Mel atticum for the best, next to that Mel Siculum, and
chiefly that which is called Hybleum of Hybla, a city of Sicilia, and that
because of the plenty of Thyme growing there. But Mel Sardoum Ponticum, are
(as euell and hurtful) abiected.

Galenus. lib. 3. De alimentorum facultatibus, says that it is found on the
leaves of plants, but neither can it says he be said, either any juice,
fruit, or part of the same.

And here must you take Galen to speak of the primitiue matter, or first
substance thereof. For if there should not be granted to honey such a variety
of qualities, according to the plants whereon it is, As Mesues notes in Manna:
Why should, it have ben esteemed the worthier, or the viler, for the plants
whereon it is found.

Honey not well boiled, bredeth certain wyndes in the stomach and bowels: but
being well clarified, it is vnwyndie and moves vryne. It taken without the
admy^tion of water, nourysheth weakly, but empties the belly aptly, and eaten
largely it moves vomit: being boiled without water, it neither causes
vomit, nor loses the belly. To old and cold persons, it is most
commodious: In yonge and whotte persons it turns into choler.

Melanchiron.
OF Melanchiron I need not here say much, for Lanfranke interpretynge it
Icteritia nigra, shows him self to mean thereby that universal effusion of
melancholy, which we call the black iaundies.

The iaundies which the Greekes cal Icteron and the Latines Regiam arquatam
passionem, Icteros. Regia passio. Arquata passio.
is an universal effusion of choler, sometime yelowe from the gaul, and
sometimes black from the spleen, caused dyuersly, as by those members
inflamed, obstructed, weakened, c. as before at Icteritia.

Melilotus.
THe herb that we in Englande use for Melilote, lacks not in my judgment
the virtue that should (...) in Melilote: though it be not in dede the true
(...) (...), but rather a kind of Lotus syluestris, by the (...) master
Turner, (who takes it to be Mel frugum, (...) phrastus) and also of Dodonaeus,
who by reason of his (...) calls it Meliotum Germanicam, and Fuchsius Saxisr
(...) But the right Melilote grows in Italy, is therefore called Melilotus
Italica, and of some Sertula Campana, Coronaregia. De sympone. lib. 7.
It is whotte and dry in the first degree, Galen says it hath more heate
then cold, and is somewhat adstringent, but yet doth it digest and concocte:
And the emplaster called Melilotum, is potente in mollifiyng hardnesses, by the
testimony of Galenus and Mesues.

Mica panis.
CRommes of bread are generally resolutiue: but that doth it more or less,
according to the composition handlynge thereof. Galen. de alimentis. lib. 1.
For bread says Galen made of light corn, well leuened, and moderately baked,
is most easy to cococte, so is it of power outwardly to digest and deuyde:
and of consequence if it vary from these points, it is the unfitter for the
one and the other.

Miliaris.
THe opinion of Lanfrancus, and of many more about his time, concerning the
likeness of Miliaris with Formica, seems to come from Auicen: who also
teaches for them both almost like curations.

But howe far is it from the mind of Galen? Who numbereth Miliarem among
erysipelatous tumores, and Formicam among Scirrhous excrescentes.

Miliaris named also in Greek of that form (...), Cenchros.
is a tumore uttering certain little pustules like milet, coming of a
choleryck fluxion somewhat sharpe. Whereof locke more in Herpete. Herpes.


Mirobalani.
Go to the title Myrobalani.

Mumia.
OF Mumia (so called of the Arabians.) There is an vncerteine variety of
opinions, for diverse great learned men think it to be (...) Dioscoridis,
because that as Dioscorides says, Pissasphaltos is driven by land floods
from certain hills of Apolonia, called Ceraunii montes, and being after cast
up on the river banks: is by heate baked into Cloddes, which do smell like
pytche, myxed with Bitumine, Bitumen.
whereof it has that name. Even so and with the same words, hath Scrapio
descrybed his Mumiam. But differing from this is that which the most of the
Arabians do mention: who affirm it to resulte of the imbaumyng or spicery of
dead bodies at their burialles, as Ex Croco, Aloe, myrrha, Balsamo, being
coagulated grown together (with the fat and moisture of the corps) into a
body, and therefore called Mumia sepulcrorum.

But as this composition is very costly, and therefore used for the bodies of
the nobles: That which is don to dead bodies as with spices c. is called
imbalming though there be no Balsam therein.
so are men of some less reputation imbaulmed with Aloe, myrrh, and saffron:
neither of the which bodies are easily spoiled of their tombs and spicery,
namely by strangers. Howe be it the poorer sort, (which are the greatest
number, the opening also and remouyng of whose bodies is the more tolerable)
are enclosed with Pissaphalto only, because it is of less price: for they use
customably to imbaulme all bodies.

But that which is now among our Apothecaries extant, varies from all these
substances, and is the very flesh of mans body, as it wear burned to a cole:
for both whole arms and whole legs, have been here not rarely seen, being
dried as black as a cole. Wherefore it must needs be thought, that either the
merchantes bring from thence whole buried bodies, or very parts of the same:
or else that it becomes so, by that means that divers merchantes make report
of, (if it be worthy credit.) Who say, that in the farther parts of Aegypte,
great drifts of lyghte and most subtyle sand, are at certain times removed
(by the change of wyndes) from place unto place, and thereby rolled up into huge
heaps like great mountains: and that often times both men and beasts,
happening in the way, are violently swalowed up and buried therein: so
remaining until by a like tempest from the object coasts, it be again
turned over, and all such buried things are again uncovered: being by the
whotte and dry nature of the sand so dried, and preserved from putrefaction.
All the which howe true it is or may be, for the lack of experience I am not
able vndoubtfully to say, neither can I (through lykelyhodes) yield for the
same a better defence, then that baked or dried sand, hath been proved to
preserve fruit longtyme vnputrefied: wyshinge that some man of more experience
therein, would make the matter more manifest. But certainly it is mans flesh,
either thus or otherwise dried into a cole.

It is used as well in outward plasters, as inward drinks, to confound
broken bones and veins, and to disolue congeiled blood, and stays the flure
of the same. It helps Hemicraniam Paralism, and the peynes of the head that
come of cold without humores. For it is of heating and driyng faculty in the
second degre, as says Matthiolus: to whom I remitte the explication of all
other his eximiouse virtues.

Mundificatiua med.
MEdicinae mundificatiuae sieve abstergentes, are medicines that have power to
mudify, purify, scour, or clese woudes c. Which if they do meanly, they are
mete incarnatiues for ulcers. It comes of Mundifico, to mundifie or make
clean: Which also rises a munditie of, cleanes.

Myrobalanus.
THe etymology of this word (...), Myrobalanos.
requires it to be called Glans odorata, sieve unguentaria: though this name
Glans unguentaria be much more fitly applied to (...): Balanos myrepsice.
for from it differs Myrobalanos, in figure, Balanus myrepsica.
colour, and faculties, and ought rather says S^yluius, to be accounted of
the kind of appuls or prunes.

Of Myrobalanes there are five kinds. whereof these these three Citreae Nigrae,
Cepulae, are thought of some saith Mesues to be the fruit of one tree, whose
property is to bear twyse yearly: whose first fruit are Citreae, being
gathered vnrype, and Nigrae or Indae, gathered when they are ripe. The second
and last fruit are Cepulae. (These all are cold in the first degree, and
dry in the second.) But Andreas Marinus upon Mesue, says plainly that they
are.v. destincted fructes, of so many several trees, and hath lively painted
out three of them: which also many other have thought before, because they
vary in faculties. Lo so bountiful hath God ben unto this our age, as to open
mercifully unto us (with the lands so lunge unknown) many things, that to
the worthy fathers wear either unknown, or much in doubt: For so doth
Marmus confess him self to obtain this certeintie. They are benign or
gentill medicines, and do strengthen the heart, the stomach, the liver, and
the rest of the body.

1 Myrobalani Citreae (which are of colour inclining to grene, great, weighty,
massy, and within when they are broken, gummy,) do purge choler abone the
rest: and therefore are wholesome for whotte and bilious natures, cum omphacio,
uel aqua rosarum, uel succo foenicula they scour the eyes, and take away their
inflammations: their poulder also stays the flux of them, cum mastiche
dries ulcers.

2 Myrobalani Cepulae are blackishe, inclining to rednes, and are phlegm
purgers, namely fro the stomach, they stregthen also the same the spirits
rational, sharpen ye sight.

3 Myrobalani nigrae, are of colour black, great, flesshye, and gross, whose
virtues are to purge melancholy, and choler adust: and therefore are profitable
for trebling, pensiveness, leprosies, quartanes, and other melancholic
affectos. But they are all apt to breed obstructions.

4 Myrobalani Emblicae do cole sowhat, Empelica.
dry in ye first degree.

5 Myrobalani Bellericae are gentill, and do strengthen, of teperament like
the first three: They both do purge putrefied phlegm from the stomach, and
strengthen the same, The brain also, the heart, the liver, the synewes, and
relaxed parts. c.

Myrrha.
MYrrha, Smirna.
which the Greeks call (...), heats and dries in the second degree:
Galenus de symp. medi. lib. 8.
and therefore glueth fresh wounds, especially of the head: Having also much
bitterness, whereby it kills worms. It hath moreover a moderate abstertion: by
reason whereof, it is mixed with medicines made for the eyes, for the old cough,
for peinfull breathing. It hath also power to comfort and to defend from
putrefaction, and to expel superfluities. It mudifieth rotten ulcers, So was
mirth in Galen his time adulterate.
and provokes sleep. Howe be it the use of Myrrh is not altogether hurtles,
both for that the only smell thereof causes head ache: and also because in
the best myrrh is found Opocarpasum, De antidotis. lib. 1.
a thing says Galen, very hurtful and deadly, and hath killed many
vnwittynglye taking it with myrrh.

Myrrha is the tears or dropping of a free growing in Arabia, not unlike to
Spinae aegiptiae, whereof there are divers kinds. Pediasmos being fatty, from
the which being pressed, comes Stacte. Gabirea, which is most fat, and
sweateth out Stacten habundantly. Then Troglodytica, which is of a grenyshe
colour, shining and biting: which is the best and is also of two sorts. The
fourth is Cancalis, which is very old, black, and parched: And this is
thought of some to be it, that is commonly sold unto us. The fifth and worst
is Ergasima: And the sixth Aminea, not well approved. An other kind also there
is, called Myrrha Boeotica, because it comes from the root of a tree, growing
in Boeotia.

Myrtus.
MYrtles are of an earthly cold property, De symplici. lib. 8.
as Galen affirms, having yet some subtlety and heate, wherthrough they dry
myghtily: and therefore are very profitable to help the restoring of broken
bones, and streigned joints, and also to dry up bruses, keeping thereby the
places from putrefaction, and apostemations. The Mirte tree, Myrsine uel (...),
Myrhine.
is called in Greek (...), and in Latin Mirtus. The fruit or beries whereof,
do the Apothecaries call Myrcillos.

Nodi.
NOdus signifies a knot, and is here to be understanded of certain kinds
of tumores, which in roundness, (and sometime hardness,) resemble a knot: De
tumoribus praeter natur Atheroma.
coming principally of phlegm, and are chiefly referred to the three special
tumores, called of Galen (...), and (...), so called of the substances like a
white potagie confection (called Pulls) fat, Steatoma.
or honey, Meliceris.
contained in them. And sometime the nerues become knotty, De met. odo meden.
li. 14.
but that differs from Nodo says Auicen, in that it is not every way
mobyle or seperable.

Obtalmia.
Is showed at Ophthalmia*

Oedema.
OIdema, Galenus de tumoribus praeter naturam.
is one of the four chief and principal simple tumores against nature,
soft, lose, and without payne, spryngyng of thynne phlegm or vaporous
spirits, De methodo medendi. li. 1*
is the same that in the time of Lanfranke as well as before and since, was
called Vndimia. De art curatiua. lib. 2.
which (when it hath adjoined partly therewith, any of the other three) is
called either (...). i. Oedema phlegmonosum, uel Oedema inflammationis
particeps, of blood: (...). i. Oedema erysipelatosum, aut sacri ignis
particeps, if choler be his partener, or (...), hoc est oedema induratum, sieve
duritiei particeps, when melancholic is adjoined. More at Vndimia.

Oleum.
Oil which the Grecians cal (...), Elaon.
is the juice of Olyues named Oliuae, which are the fruit of the tree, Olea
in greek (...), Elaea.
cosisting of.iii. substaces (as doth milk,) as of gross dregs, called
Amurca, of an aerie essence, of a whayey substance. Oil is of temperamet mean
as it wear, between whotte and cold dry and moyste: yet doth it rather
incline to heate and moisture. But from this mean may it three ways vary, as
first Omphacinum (made of unripe Olives) is somewhat cold and adstringent: as
the oil of through ripe olyues (which they cal Drupas) doth moderately heate
and moyste. Drupas.
Secondly new oil is by comparation cold: so sweet oil kept vntyl it be
old, is whotte and euaporatyue. Thirdly it doth most aptly or readily receive
the qualities, of what so ever by art ^ with composed: be they whotte or
cold, c. And therefore says Galen, De symp. me. fac. li. 2.
is it worthily accounted, the matter of all other medicines.

It moves the belly: and the reddyshe wheye, being taken away (as by washing
or else howsoever) the rest is made whyter, and without biting. The vnctios
therewith are rather to be used to whole bodies the unto plethorikes, or to men
possessed with raw humores.

Olibanum.
OLibanum says Platearius, is whotte and dry in the second degree, and is
none other thing but Thus. Which Galen says, De sym. lib. 7.
dries but in the first. It is thought of divers men, Dioscor. lib. 1. (...).
quasi Thus stillicidiare.
(not without great reason, to be that round white droplyke gum, and within
fatty, which Dioscorides prefers for the best, calls Thus masculinum,
and in Greek Stagonias. Not far from this is Lanfranke his mind, who by
Cortice olibani means Corticem Thuris optimi. Cortex olibani


Ophthalmia.
(...), in Latin Lippitudo. Is the inflammation of that panicle that covers
all the other panicles parts of the eye, called Tunica adnata (of Galen
Agnata) and Coherens, and is of two sorts. Vera, coming of a cause
antecedent or interiore, as of fulness in all the body, of the influxion of
sharpe humores, or of gross and flatulente spirits: non uera, which comes
of a cause proca^arctyke or exterior, as of a stroke, dust, smoke, c. Such a
difference of Obtalmia (for so he calls it) makes Lanfrancus as thou see,
calling it Parua, magna, or maxima.

Opium.
(...), Opio^.
Id est lacrima papaueris, which is the juice of Papaueris nigri, De com. med.
secun. loca. li. 5
brought by art into a mass, must needs be like in temperament to the popye,
whereof it is made: and is says Galen the myghtiest among narcotike medicines,
De methodo medendi. li. 12.
and causes dead sleep, but ought rarely, in great extremities (and then
warly) to be used. For it strangles, and vehement pains are often eased
thereby (being used alone) for some small time: after the which it returns
more violently then before. But in every doubt of this and his use: let
master Turner be to you a sufficient satisfier.

Opopanax.
(...), Panaces heracleion.
Succus panace, that is the juice of the herb (...), or Panax heracleum: for
of Panax there are other two kinds, Asclepium Cheironium. It is an herb
(says Dioscorides) growing in Boeotia and Arcadia, Countries in Greece.
with rough her bycoloured leaves, lying on the ground, indented with five
divisions much like to fig leaves, a high stalk, as hath Ferula, which is
white through a certain mosines, and also beset with little leaves: having
moreover a top like dylle, a yellow flower, and a sede fervent and
odoriferous: with many roots also, springing fro one beginning, being white,
of heavy savour, thyck rynded, and bitter tasted. De sym. med. facultat. lib.
8.
Opopanax says Galen, doth both digest and mollyfie: and therein excells
Chalbanum. It heats in the third degree, De com. med. secundum genera. lib.
7.
and dries in the second, (as doth also the rynde of the root, though less
then the juice) and that without adstringencie: and therefore is used to
stuberne ulcers, and as an incarnatiue to broken bones.

Orificium.
ORificium, is the orifice, mouth, or entrance of any thing that is holowe.
Wherefore Orificium sinus, uel fistulae, is the orifice or entrance, of a
fistule or hollow ulcer. c.

Orobus.
SO called of the Apothecaries, following the Greek, (which is (...), Eruum.
and the Latin Eruum) is englyshed of D. Turner, a bitter fitche: who treats
thereof at large. Galenus De alimentis. lib. 1.
It is a certain pulse, and a food (for his vnpleasantnes) meter for bullocks
then for men, but are used in medicines that purge gross humores, De
attenuiate uictus ratione De symp. me. facult, lib. 8.
from the lunges and the breast. The white bitter fitches, are less
medicinable then the yelowe or the pale. Eruum dries in the third degree
fully, and heats in the first: and farther, howe bitter so ever it be, in the
same measure doth it cut insonder, scour, and open obstructions: being
twyse sodden, it loses his vnsauorines, and also his scouring and incisiue
power, and so dries without great bytternesse. It is diuretike and (copiously
taken) causes pyssyng of blood. Dioscorides says, that of them by parching
and gryndinge is made a meal, which with honey mundifieth ulcers, keeping
divers angry sorts of them, from crepyng and corrodyng: being made into paste
with wine, it heals venomous bytinges, and scowreth the skin of freckles
and spots.

Ossa combusta.
OF burned bones thus says Galen. De sym. med. facult. li. 11. (...) Morbus
comitialis.
They dry and digest, and chiefly as some say, the bones of a man. I have
known certain of our contreymen, that by geuyng mans bones burned in drink,
have cured in many Epilepsiam and Arthritin, all this Galen. A great
desiccatiue they must needs be, for that burning adds to the bone more
drynes, (...), i. articularis morbus.
which was before of his own nature cold and dry.

Oua.
Eggs saith Galen in his book last cited, Ouum.
are not parts of animals, but answer in proportion, to things superfluous or
more then needful. Galen. de alimentis, lib. 3.
They are made for propagation and perpetuity, and are profitable, as for
food. Whereunto the eggs of Phesantes and hens, are the best: As of the
Goose and the Ostriche, are the worst. Eggs that are meanly sodden, Oua
tremula, Ouum sor^ilium.
(called therefore Tremula) are for nourishment best of all other. Sorbilia oua
(which be sod in water till it be white) do nuryshe less, but are easier to
put down, De euchymia et cacochymia
and smothe the roughnes of the sharpe artery. Sodden eggs are of harde
concoction, of gross nourishment, and are hardly put over: but grosser and
more fumous juice do roasted eggs make, and tarry longer in the stomach. But
fried eggs are every way of worst nurishment, and do corrupt other meates
eaten with them. Lastly, eggs prepared with oil, wine, and the sauce Garo,
and after meanly baked or roasted, Oua suffocata
and called Oua suffocata, are better then sod eggs or roasted, and are
colder then the equal temperament.

The white of the egg is accounted of the number of medicines not biting,
Albumen ou^
and is used not only to the eyes, but also to all other things that require
gentle medicines: as ad Vlcera cotuinacia pudendoru ac^edis: so is also the
yolke, (which aswageth payne. ^
The whole egg is used Cum oleo Rosato, for inflammations: but in all these
things ought new eggs to be taken, and the old refused.

Oua formicarum.
SO unspeakable is the careful love of our merciful God towards his creatures,
that he makes ye little Ante her eggs, medicines for their health. They are
food for Bears, and their eggs (says Plinie) are to them a wholesome
medicine, when they are grieved.

Oxalis.
(...), so called as well of the Apothecaries as of the Grecians, Rumex.
of the sharpe taste that it hath, is one of the. iiii. kinds of Rumecis,
Lapathum.
or Lapathi in Dioscorides, called also of some (...), Anaxyris.
and commonly Acetosa, and is of two kinds, Mayor and Minor, the first known
to all, the other not so.

It cools with a pleasant sharpnes, and is therefore with us in great use. The
juice thereof cools represses choleric inflammatios of the stomach and the
liver, and preserves from pestilent infections if the leaves be chawed, and
the juice swallowed down: as have divers learned men of late practise written,
by whose judgment it is of teperament cold and dry in the second degree.

Papauer.
OF Popy with the Grecians called (...), Mecon emeros Mecon agrios Mecon rhoeas
Meco ceratitis Papauer cornutum. Mecon aphrodes. i. Papauer spumeum.
there are many kinds, as (...). i. satiuum, (...). i. syluestre, (...). i.
fluidum uelerraticum, (...) cornutum uel corniculatum, (...) Spumeum Herculeum:
of every of the which there are also diverse kinds, which here it were to
lunge to discuss. They do all cool.

The white seade of Papaueris Satiui, provokes sleep moderately, and therefore
it is eaten in bread and with honey. But of the wild ones, the seade of
Papaueris fluidi, called also Rhoeas, Galen. de sym. Lib. 7.
(because his flowers do suddenly fall,) doth cool more myghtyly, and
therefore can not be used alone without hurt. Galen. de alimentis. lib. 7.
That of the kind of Papaueris syluestri, or wild Popye, which hath a
sittynge bowl, has in the same a black medycinable seade, which cools
myghtylye: but the seade that is found in the lunge wild popye bowles, is of
all other the metest for medicine, somniferous, and stops such spyttinges,
as the cough brings from the lunges and the breast, and is convenient for
Catarrhes and thynne destillations from the head. It cools so much, that it
may induce both dead sleapes, and death also, vnwarly used: for it cools in
the fourth and last degree.

Parietaria.
VUlgarly Muralium, Muralium
because it deliteth to grow on stonewalles: Of some Vrceolaris, Vrceolaris
because it serves well to scour glasen vessels. It is called in Greek (...)
(says Fuchsius, He^.
of the rough scade thereof, which will hang on men's clothes, Perdition.
and (...), because the bird Perdix (which is englyshed the Partridge,
Perdici^s.
) deliteth to fed thereon. It constreigneth or binds strongly, and scours
away with cold moisture: Galer* de sym. Lib. 6.
and therefore heals whotte inflammations, from the beginning to the state,
and is also laid in Cataplasmatibus ad Phygethlon in the beginning. The juice
thereof dropped into the ears, helps their phlegmonous pains.

Passula.
CAlled also Vuapassa, Astaphis Staphis e^ros.
and in Greek (...), with us reysons, are grapes prepared by art as are
figs: and therefore (says Galen) have Vuae passae, Dried or prepared figs.
the same affinity with grapes, that Caricae have with figs. Galenus De
alimentis. lib. 2.
Which being made of tame or tilled grapes, have concoctiue, adstringente,
and mean digestiue faculty: but the wild are vehement sharpe, De atten^
uictus ratione
and therefore do purge and scour the head myghtyly. Grapes do not exquisitely
maturate in cold regions, much less reysons: Desymp. li. 6.
and as they being sweet, are the whotter, so are the sharpe ones colder,
which do roborate the stomach, and constipate the belly, and that, the
tarter the more: among the which, the reysons that are of a mean swetnes,
keep a mean constitution. In these as there is a moderatiue virtue, so have
they also a mean clensinge faculty: whereby they put away the small gnawynges
of the month of the stomach. If they be not adstryngent, they help not the
liver or ye spleen, but the affects of the breast lunges. Of reysons they are
best that are fat, and have a tender skin: which if they be cold are
made the better, by taking from them their grains, when they have been steped
in water. Though in Cilicia there do grow reysons, both full and small,
without grains.

Pes milui.
It is mentioned under the title Flamula.

Phlegmone.
(...), (...), enim sanguis est.
Id est inflammatio, uel collectio, (...), hoc esta sanguine dicta, written
most commoly hithervnto (with much rudeness) Flegmon, is properly a simple
tumore (as Galen says) and an affect of the fleshie parts, De tumoribus
praeter natura De methodo med. li. 5. 14.
coming of a greater flux of blood then they need, or can naturally
sustain. Which sweateth through the coats of the veins like a dew: wherein
they gather together to them selves a tumore, with heate, rednes, stretching,
resisting, and pulsatiue or beating payne: which is propre to great
inflammations. And thus much of the simple tumore. For when so ever it
chances to have some portion of any of the other three humerall tumores
adjoined therewith: there resulteth a compound name, such as the mixture
requires, as choler therewith cocurrent, makes the name (...), quasi
inflammatio ignis srcrae seu ignitae rubedinis particeps. Phlegm coupled
therewith, names it (...), id est inflammatio laxa, uel Oedmatis particeps: But
melancholy therewith, is called (...), in Latin inflammatio dura, sieve duritiei
consors, as of the rest.

Pili leporis.
Saying that hears (whose cause efficient as Galen witnesses, is of gross and
slymy superfluities) is colder drier then any other part of the body,
Demetho^ (...) li. 14
yea then the bones: By the minds of Aristotle, De temp. lib. ^.
Costantinus, Galenus, and Albertus Magnus: needs must the hears, of the Hare
be most cold and dry, (and therefore restraining and bynding) which is of
all other a beast most melancholic and timorous. For the which cause
(says Galen) is he and the Heart, Deusu partu^ lib. 1.
endued with swift bodies.

Pinguedo.
PInguedo, is with us the grease or oylye fat of bodies, of men or beasts,
for the which look more at Adeps.

Pini Cortex.
THe rynde of the Pine tree, (...).
(called in Greek (...), and in Latin Pinus,) bruised and laid to, is
profitable by the testimony of Dioscorides, Lib. ^.
for chafinges and ulcers that are over all the body: and also for burnynges
cum Manna Spuma argenti. Being used cum Serato myrtino, it heals such ulcers
of delicate persons as refuse sharpnes. Bruised cum atrimento sutorio, it
restrayneth crepyng ulcers: and in suffitu, partus secundas eiicit. The leaves
of the same bruised and applied, do mitigate and repress inflammatios. They
ease with vinegar the totheake: and a dragme weighte of the same drunk in
Mulsa, is profitable for me diseased in the liver. The ryndes of the appuls or
nuts of the Pine tree, do in drink as do the leaves. Wherefore Lanfrancus,
by Cortice pini, must be understanded to mean the rynde of the tree, whose
properties do best agree with his intent.

Piper.
OF the Grecians called (...), Peperi.
is of three kinds, beside Piper siluestre, as Longum, Album, Nigrum. Which all
(saith Galen) do heate and dry, De symplici. lib. 8.
and are used (as in Di^trion peperon,) to digest raw humores: and drunk Cum
Vino, do help the stomach cooled by cold alimentes. Black pepper is to be
chosen, that is neither sclender, rugged, nor having a gross rynde: which
two notes do also commend the white. De sanitate tuenda. lib. 4.
The long pepper ought to be sound, without holes, and that neither by bruising
nor stepping will be resolved, but will keep still the nature of pepper.

And where as the old wryters (led thereunto, as it should seem, rather by
heresaye then experience,) Esteem them al the fruit of one tree, gathered at
several seasons: The opinion of the later wryters, for diverse considerations
thereunto repugning: I refer you to Matthiolus, and to master D. Turner, his
worthy work, wherein he hath not only made hereof out of each sort large
demonstrations, but also most learnedly hath he explicated many doubts:
which unknown, might through ignorance have wrought many euels (as no
doubt) long time here tofore they have done.

Pira.
Of Pira I have written benethe at Pyrum.

Pistacia.
(...), so named both in Greek and Latin, and vulgarly Fistici, are the
fruit of a tree, growing (as says Dioscorides,) in Syria, like to Pine
nuts: which Doctor Turner describes also at large. They are after Galen,
friendly to the stomach, De sym. med. facultat. lib. 8.
subtle, bitteryshe, aromatike, and somewhat adstryngente: And therefore of
small nuryshment, mete for a sclender diet, good to comfort the liver, and to
open the obstructions of the same.

Pisum.
(...) (says Galen) doth in his whole substance resemble the bean, Pison.
(if I may so englyshe Faba, De alimentis. lib. 1.
) and are in like manner taken. They are not so wyndy and do in al things
excelle beans, De euchy^ria ^
save that they have not so much stowring power, and therefore do tarry longer
in the belly.

But to know howe Pisum, (whereof neither Dioscorides nor Galen have made
description.) may be our peason or no: have recourse as before to master D.
Turner. For to repeat that here, which an other has already so commodiously
said: would but make my book vnne^efully to swell, and with known things
satigate the reader.

Pix.
NAmed in Greek (...), Lib 3.
is after Dioscorides of three sorts, Piss^.
Liquida, Viscosa, and Arida. Pix liquida (says he,) is gathered out of the
fattest portions of the trees Picea and Pinus, ^
which of some was called (...), in Latin Teda, ^.
affirming it to be a vice or Canker of the trees before said: confoundyng the
vanity of some that have counted Teda a tree special. Teda.


Hereof the best is sincere lyghte, and shining, which by boylynge waxes
thycke, Palimpissa B^s^as.
and is called (...), Idest Spissa pix uel Pix bis cocta: whereof one part
waxes clammy, and is called (...), quasi pix Viscosa, the other is dry, and
named (...), Colophon^a Pix arida.
(of the city Colophon of Libia or Graecia, from whence it was wont to be
brought.) In Latin Pix Arida, and commonly Pix Graeca, which ought to be
pure, fat, odoriferous, resinous, of reddyshe colour, and heats and
dries, De sym. lib. 8.
by the sentence of Galen in the second degree: but doth more dry then heate.
The liquid contrarily doth more heate then dry, having also subtle parts,
and therefore helps asthmatike persons. They have abstersiue concoctiue, and
digestiue power, as in taste a light sharpnes and bitterness: so being mixed
with wax, they take away leprosy nails, and scour Lichenas. They also being
put in Cataplasmatis, do concocte harde tumores: and to all these is Pix
liquida the better, and fills up the holownes of ulcers: but the dry is more
apt to glewe together wounds.

But Peter Martyr, in his Decades of the Spanyardes their voyages and gestes in
the west Indies, shows of a harder and stronger kind of pyche: (and therefore
better for ships,) flowing out of a roche in Hispaniola. Which (or the like
thing) might be the cause of the name in that which we commonly call stone
pyche. In the which Isle says he, there is also pyche made of two several
trees: the one is the Pine tree, (commonly known,) the other is called in that
country language Copeia. Copeia.
The leaves whereof is a span broad, almost round, thicker then double
parchment, marvelous tough, and is apt to be written on with wires of metal
or wood, and that on both sides. And while the leaf is fresh and new, it
shows the letters white upon grene: but when it is old and dry, it
becomes harde and white, like writing tables of would, and the letters
yelowe: for it will never lose them, by washing or any other ways, save only
by fire.

Plaga.
PLaga, is taken as well for every ulcer or sore generally, but chiefly for
such as had their begynninge, Procatarctice that is from without, Vulnus.
Plaga nova.
as for every new woude or cut, strype or hurt. And so doth Lanfranke use
it, calling Vulnus Plagam nouam aut recentem: Vlcus. Plaga antiqua
and Vlcus he calls Plagam putridam, uell antiquam.

Plantago.
IS of the Grecians called (...), Arnoglossos uel arnoglosso
quasi agnina lingua, and is (though Dioscorides mention but two,) of divers
kinds, as Mayor, media, minor, Aquatica also and Marina: Whereof Plantago
mayor, Galenus De symp. me. facult. lib. 6.
which Lanfranke means, both cools and dries in the second excess, and
has some sowernes by reason of her earthly parts. The medicines that are
both cold and adstryngente, are mete for rebellious ulcers, rottenes, and
fluxions, and therefore for Dysenteriis: for they staye the flowynges of blood,
and cool things burned. They heal wounds, both new and old, and glue
together their holownes. But of all other such medicines planteyne is chief,
or at the least second to none, by reason of his mean and convenient
temperamente, for it is dry without bitynge, and cold without stupefaction.
The seade and the roots are of like faculties, saving that they are dryer, but
not so cold. The seade is subtle the root gross. The leaves also dried are
subtle, and of less coolyng. The roots are used for pains of the teethe.
The leaves also (but much more the seades) are given for the obstructions of
the liver and spleen.

Plumbum vstum.
Lead is called in Greek (...), Molybdos. Galenus de symp. medi. lib. 9.
and is of coolyng faculty, having moreover, not only much moist substance
congeyled by heate: but also some acry and earthy essence. It being burned and
after washed, helps to fylle up and heal ulcers, as well such as are
cancrous, as those that are called Chironii, but vnwashed it is a help for
froward ulcers.

Porus sarcodes.
THis Greek word (...), Poros.
permits divers interpretations, and is taken for a way, a passage, a
tract, a journey, a cave, a bosom, a covered hole, a vessel, (and (...)
plurally are small sweating holes,) for luere also, sometime for money, and
lastly, (which is nyghest our purpose) it is a stony hardness. And Tophus
articulorum, is called Poros, (for Tophus is also and that more proprely a
stone: Tophus, (...) stone which is apt to be resolved into sand.
which Uergill in his Georgikes terms Tophus Scaber.) Whereof Galen thus
says. When raw phlegmatike humores, by lying long hid in the lymmes or
joints, do become grosser and more viscous: De com. med. secun. loc. li. 10
there are of the engendered Tophi, and Calli. Wherefore this substance repletiue,
the work of nature, of the gross nu^shment of the bone (coming as a lygature
between the ends of the broken bones, De art medicinale.
of substance harde, but not britle) may well be called (...), Poros Sarcodes
Callus.
quasidurities Carnosus, as it is of Galen called Callus. Which also sometime
sygnifieth the circulare or quilly hardness of fistules, De methodo medendi. li.
6.
and is commoly taken for the hardness both of the palms of the hands, and
soles of the fete, engendered by labore or exercise.

Portulaca.
POrtulaca, Andrachne.
called in Greek (...), is of two kinds. Hortensis (which Lanfranke calls
Domestica), De symp. li. 6.
and Syluestris: and is after Galen, of a cold watery temperamente, and
coolyng in the third degree, and moystynge in the second: having also some
tartnes, and therefore stays whotte and bilious fluxions, and by a certain
clammynes that it hath without bytynge, it eases the teethe when they are on
edge. It helps greatly the burning beats of the belly, laid to the waste or
the mouth of the stomach, and that in hectike fevers. And (because it is
restryngente) is profitably given to Dysentericis, mulitbri profluuio, and to
reiections of blood: but to these the juice is much more efficacious then the
herb.

Another herb there is also, called Portulaca marina, only of the likeness that
the leaves thereof have with porcelain, which yet (in other points unlike) is
not to be numbered with these. Neither ought I here to overpass, that the
third little kind of Sedum, Illecebra.
called Illecebra is of some Grecians named (...). Andrachne.
Agria.


Pruna.
AVicenna. lib. 4. Fen. 3. tract. 1. describes Prunam, Ignis persicus.
and Ignem persicum, both in one chapiter, not without some confusion of the
one with the other, and both with Formica. First estemyng both the names, to
serve for every blysteryng, corrosive, and eschare making pustule. And a
little after he says, that Pruna is that, which makes the place black as a
cole, without moisture, having a small eminence like a lupine, sometime with a
pustule and sometime not: having itch over all. And sometime doth Ignis
persicus or Pruna, more larglye blister, and purge such a quitture, as a place
burned or cautrized doth. The place being ash coloured, black, or lady, and
compassed about with a vehement inflammation without perfect rednes. And
again, Ignis persicus is the more sharpe, and of the swyster apparition, and
motion: Pruna the slower, and lying deper. The beginning of both is of burned
choler myxed with melancholy, (and thereof comes the black eschare in both.)
Ignis persicus consisting of the vehementer choler, and Pruna of the mightier
melancholy. It they chance in the flesh, they are the sooner resolved: but if
in the sinews, they stick the faster, and resolve the slowlyer. Thus far
Auicen. And yet confessing after, that the name of either, may be given to
both: and affirms them often to come of a pestilential fever.

Now Pruna and Carbunculus, in the quality of names as you see differ not:
and howe much their efficient causes, signs, and propreties do vary: After
these descriptions thereof, by comparing them together, it is easy to see.

Prunum.
THe plumme tree or Damsen tree, called in Greek, (...), Coccymelos.
and Prunus is of many kinds, both tame and wild: whereof master Turner hath
egregiously written. Coccymelon.
The prune (called (...),) is a fructe says Galen, Galen. de alimentis. lib.
2.
of small nuryshment, but doth meanly moyste and cool the belly, and by his
moisture and stimines, subdues the same, De sym. lib. 7.
and that the better if it be boiled cum Melicrato: But this do the new
moist ones, more then the old and dry. The damascen prunes also, (which are
acounted best) less then the Spanysh prunes, which are praised next. The
best prunes are great lose, having some adstriction.

The wild prunes or plummes, are evidently adstringent, and therefore do staye
the belly, and are convenient, for the inflammations of Columella, and other
parts of the throat.

Pyrum.
Pears are called in Greek (...), Apion. i. pyru Apios pyrus. Galen. de
alimentis. lib. 2.
(as the tree is called (...),) and consiste of three parts, as an earthy, a
watery, (which are both cold,) and a temperate. Wherefore to be eaten, they
are friendly to the stomach, staye thirst, and nuryshe somewhat. Pears thynne
slyced, so dried, De symp. me. fac. li. 6.
and after boiled, are used in winter for meat.

Outwardly applied, they dry and cool moderatlye, and therefore do they glewe
together wounds. Achrades
Which to do the wild pears, (...). i. pyrum syluestre.
(called Pyra syluestria, in Greek (...)) because they are most adstringente,
are most mete.

Quartana febris.
THe quartain fever, is either interpolate, and named Quartana intermittens,
uel exquisita, or continual, thereof called Onartana continens, or continua.
The first is engendered of a melancholic humore putrefied, Galen. de
differetiis febrium. lib. 2.
or a splenatyke affect, whose rigour is in the beginning not vehement, but
like the cold that men commonly feel in most vehement frosts. De art
curatiua. lib. 1.
Which yet in process of time augments even to the state, with cold so
vehement, as if the bones would break, but not pungitiue as in the tertian.
The pulse is slow and rare: The augmentation, vigour, and moving of of heate,
are contrary to the tertian. The humore kyndleth slowly like to a stone, or
other like cold and dry thing, which is the cause of so much longer
intermission therein, then in the Quotidiane.

Quartana continua (which is rarely scene) is engendered of melancholy, De
morborum temporibus.
putrefied in the vessels, even as is Qnotidiana continens, or continua,
caused of phlegm in like manner putrefied wherein they both differ from the like
named intermittent fevers, and in that they are never without a feuerous
habit, vntyl they cease for all: though yet they have some remission between
every fit, and therein differ they from the fevers Synochis, wherein there is
no remission but continual burning.

Quotidiana febris.
Quotidiana uera, sieve exquisita, is described in the title Amphemerina febre,
and Quotidiana continua, immediately above at Quartana.

Rapa.
RApa or Rapum, Congylis.
is (of the round form that the root ^iath,) Gongyle.
called of the Greeks (...), ^uasi bolus rotundus, Galen. de sym. lib. 6.
in English a Rape, or Turnip: and is of temperament, whotte in the second
degree and moyste in the first: Dioscor. lib. 2.
and therefore may Lanfranke well place it with his maturatiues. The root of
the same sod doth nuryshe, but is harde to cococte, and engenders wind and
sede, troubles the stomach, sometime bites the same: Galenus De alimentis.
lib. 2.
and the more if it be raw. The decoction thereof is sometime applied to ye
gout. The root roasted under ashes cum cerato rosacco, is good for ulcerated
kybes. The tender stalks eaten, do move drine. The seade is put among
anodyne medicines, and is drunk as a helthfull medicine against venom. Condite
in brine, they nurishe the less, but increase appetite the more.

Realgar.
A Most vehement corrosive medicine, and is made (as is said In opere
pandactarum) ex sulphur, Calce uiua, auripigmento: which mortifies fistules,
corrodeth deplie. And is also called Soricoria, because it kills rats, as
it doth also the worms of horses.

But Brasauolus in examine suo symplicium, says, that they are deceived that
think the true Risagallum (for so is it more fitly named) a thing artificial,
for it is found says he, in the same mine with Auripigmento, and is of the
same kind: being in dede a medicine hurtful and venomous.

Regeneratiuae medicinae.
REgeneratiue medicines, are of nature like to intarnatiues, as in restoring or
renewing of flesh, bone. c. and comes of Regigno, to regender or breed
again.

Repercussiua medicamina.
CAlled also Repellentia, De com. med. secund. loca. lib. 3.
are after Galen things sharp, tart, and adstringent: having by the same
power to put away or drive back the fluxions of humores, and rises of
Repercutio or Repello, to constreygne or drive back.

Resina.
REsina, Rbet^.
which the Grecians call (...), signifies the oily tears of trees, which
will burn with fire, and easily be commired with oil, and most hardly with
water. As Gummi signifies the watery tears of the same: for in the fire it
will crackell, and will in water be easily disolued, but not so in oil.

Resines do al heate and dry. Dioscor. lib. ^.
Whereof Resina terebinthina, is of Dioscorides called the best: which also
Galen approves, beginning with Resina lentiscina, De sym. med. facultat. lib.
8.
and gives to it the first place, saying. Beside the little adstriction that
is therein, (whereby it is so commodious to the weakness and inflammations of the
stomach, the liver, and the belly,) it also dries without bytinge: for it is
very subtyle without sharpnes. Of Terebinthinae resinae he says, that it is
preferred to the rest: having a manifest adstriction, but not like to mastyke.
Howe be it, it hath adjoined a certain bitterness, and therefore digests more
then mastike, c. of divers other. But this word Resina, so written alone, is
always taken for our common Rosin.

Resolutiua medicamina.
MEdicynes resolutyues, are called also Discutientia, a Discutiendo, aut
resoluendo: That is of discussynge, dysoluynge, vnlosynge, dischargynge, or
wasting away.

Restauratio.
Restoration, vnition, or reparation, is the first and principal intention,
of the Chirurgien in every dyuorse of unity.

Rigour.
(...) is that swift and frequent motion, Rhigos, Palpitatio.
(contrary to Palpitationi,) whose motion is little, soft, rare, which Galen
calls compound, De sympto. causis. lib. 2.
as of a cause against nature and of a faculty animal (as of the virtue
expulsiue) procuring a sensible coldness, De palpitatione tree. co. rigore.
and an unequal and inuoluntary moving of the whole body, wherein it differs
from Horore (which is an universal affect of the skin only,) and from
Tremore which possesses sum one member, Horor.
and may by the will be resisted. Tremor.


But that rigour that is wont to come on sick persons, and called Rigour
morbosus, is by the opinion of Hippocrates, a certain peynfull coldness, De
Crisibus.
with an unequal mouinge or shaking of all the body. This may dyuersly
chance, even to whole bodies as of heate, or of cold, or of a viscouse
humore, (to the first coolyng is a remedy, to the second heate, to the third
concoction or evacuation, or both.) Sometime of the hearing or saying of horrible
and fearful syghtes, or noises, phlegm also bred without a fever by
idleness, ill order of diet, and entering the bathe after dinner: to the old
auncientes unknown. De differetiis febrium. lib. 2.
And though it be evident, it to come of a native heate, yet comes it also
dyuersly, as well of cold viscous phlegm as of whotte and sharpe humores, De
morborum temporibus.
and sometime of a juice myxed of heate and cold, as in quartanes, but in
mixed compound fevers, the rigour is never vehement. It to chance to a weak
body, in a continual fever is an evil sign: and also when it will not at all,
or hardly be put away.

Rosa.
IS named in greek of the pleasant savour thereof (...) quasi been olens,
Rhodon.
is divided into kinds diverse, whereof the auncientes have left no memory. The
power of roses consists says Galen of a whotte a watery substance together:
De sym. lib. 8.
And also of two other qualities, as bitterness and byndyng. The flowerwhereof
is more adstringent then it self is, and therefore desiccatyue. Mesues
appoints them the faculties of coolyng in the first degree, and driynge in
the second. The juice of Roses says he, which is severed from the earthy
substance thereof, heats nyghe to the first degree. It opens, mundifieth,
resolves: and purges gently by experience (says Syluius,) both choler and
water, though the old wryters say not so much. Like properties to these hath
Syrupus and Vnguentum rosarum. They strengthen the heart, the stomach, the
liver, and the retentyue faculty. They are good in bilious fevers, to cool
inflammations, to mitigate the pains made by the, and provoke sleep. They
move sternutatios, and are hurtful for catarrhous persons: but they bind and
strengthen the Vuula and the throat, and take away surfetyng. The white roses
do purge little or nothing, but do bind and strengthen more then the red.

Rumex acutus.
CAlled in Greek (...), Oxylapathon.
is one of the kinds of (...): Lapathon.
so called (...), quod uacuat uentrem, because the leaves of each kind thereof
do lose and empty the belly. The kinds of Rumex are four, Rumex acutus,
whereof here. Rumex satiuus, called for his greatness (...), Hippolapat^o
Anaxyris.
of other fondly Rhabarbarum. Rumex syluestris, called also (...), (...),
Oxalis.
whereof before. The fourth hath leaves like planten. About the which kinds,
because there is some controversy risen, in that Aetius describes his
Oxilapathon, otherwise their Dioscorides doth, appointing his sharpnes to
consiste rather in taste then in the harde and sharpe substance of the leafes
point: and that to speak of it here so largly as D. Turner hath done, would
vnnecessarily augment this brief work: I sendethe thither.

Of Rumex acutus, De symp. me. fac. li. 7.
Galen saith, that it doth (of a mixed temperament) both digest repercusse:
The seade whereof is of so manifest adstriction, that it stays ye Dysenteria,
the flux of the womb. De alimentis. lib. 2.
The rustical women, (lustyng when they are with child) and greedy boys, do
use now and then to eat it raw: which nurysheth but little more then
Lapatho. But that the root of Lapathi acuti doth maturate, I find not in any
other autentike author: and therefore is Lanfrakes experience only to be trusted
unto. Or else perhaps he might mean some other herb: but what, it is
doubtful. They praise it in the healing and driving away of divers apostemes:
Which to do it seems of them rather to be gathered by deuydinge, then by
maturation.

Ruta.
RUe is called in Greek (...), Peganon.
because by the great heate and drynes thereof, it coagulateth sede, for (...)
(id est coagulare, uel in glaciem cotrahere) signifies to congeyle or
coagulate, Teste Plutarcho. It is of two kinds, Hortensis syluestris: whereof
the one is as rare, as the other is common. Dioscor. lib. 3.
It is in taste both sharpe and bitter, kills worms, Galen. de sym. lib. 8.
and is of temperamente whotte in the third degree. The wild Rue in the
fourth, and dries myghtely: and therefore is of power to divide and cut
inso^der gross and tough humores, and to move brine. And is good for pains of
the joints, and the dropsy.

The juice thereof heated in a pom granite rynde, is put in to the ears to
ease their peynes: It also sharpens the eye sight. Eaten raw or condite
with salt, laid to cum mell succo foenicult, it puts away their dimnes:
and mittigateth their peynes, being laid to cum Polenta. It is morouer of
subtle parts, and destroys wyndes: and therefore pursues strongly the
inflammations of Colon, and other interior parts, restreyneth venereous
appetites: beside the incomparable virtue that it hath against poison, and all
venomous wounds.

Sabina.
SAuyn is that continual grene shrubbe, that is called in Greek (...),
Brathy. uel Brathys.
seu (...). And thereof are there two kinds after Dioscorides. The one with
leaves like to Cupresso, to us well known: The other resembles in form, the
leaves of the Tamariske tree, and is here rare.

It heats (by the sentence of Galen) and dries in the second degree, De
symplici. lib. 6.
Consisting of most subtle parts, of taste like the Cipers tree, but that it
hath more sharpnes, and less adstriction: And therefore is whotter, and doth
more myghtily digest. It stays spreadyng or eating sores, aswageth
inflammations, and breaks Carbuncles: But for his great heate and drynes, is
vnmete to heal woudes. Being drunk with wine: Menses, Vrinasque prouocat by
his subtle substance, and drives out even blood by the urine. Foetum etiam
uiuentem interficit, mortuum educit.

Saccharum.
SAccharum, Sal Indicus. Mel arundineu
is called of the most ancient Archigenes, and other old wryters Sal
Indicus, and Mel arundineum.

Dioscorides. lib. 2. Cap. 74. Having spoken of divers kinds of honey: says.
There is also an other kind of cocreted or hardened honey, Saccharon.
which they call (...), found in India Arabia felici, in the reds, coacted or
fastened like salt, and breaks between the teethe as salt doth. It is mete
for the belly, and profitable to the stomach, and helps the griefs of the
reins bladder: being laid to, it puts away ye causes of darkness or dimnes
of ye eye sight.

Galen in his.vii. book of the faculties of simple medicines, in the chapter of
Mel, saith. But Saccharon which is brought from India and Arabia Felice,
grows together or becomes harde on reds, and is a kind of honey: not so
sweet as ours, but of like virtues, in scouring digesting. And in that it is no
enemy to the stomach as is ours, nor causes thirst: so much differs it
fro our honey in substance. Plinie says, it is honey gathered together as big
as hasell nuts, white like gummes, of great use in medicine.

Alexander Aphrodisaeus says, that which the Indians cal Saccharum, is the
curdes or heavy parts of honey, the son thyckenyng or hardenyng the dews,
and conuertyng the into the swetnes of honey. By these and like authorities,
doth Fuchsius seem very learnedly to prove our sugar not to be Saccharum
Candum, or Salem Indum of the auncientes: affirming our sugar to be none other,
but the juice of a plant of a proper kind, well bruised and pressed out, (and
is then of colour, rather black or reddyshe, then white,) and by heate of the
fire, in boiling and purifiyng or scumming, it hardens and becomes sugar:
and the more it is boiled and purified, the whyter it is. Ioannes Manardus
says he, a man of most sharpe judgment. Lib. 2. Epistolarum suar^
medicinalium writes, that by the Portugales and Sicilians he knew the plant,
from the which sugar is pressed: and says that it is sowed of seade in moyste
places, and is outwardly like a great rede, but inwardly most unlike: as fnll
of pulpe, heavy, soft, and full of juice. A rede contrarywyse is harde, light
and empty.

Now saying that the sugar of the auncientes, came of a natural dew says
he, and the matter of honey, first made glewye by the cold of the night, and
after harde by the heate of the sun: white by nature, and breaking between
the teeth like salt, (Ours being soft, and may as honey be swalowed, Saccharum
Tabarzeth.
till by fire it be hardened.) That hanging upon reds, and after Galen,
should not move thyrste so much as honey, Candum. uel Candidum.
which ours doth: It can not be our sugar.

But contrary to this are the minds of Brasauolus and Matthiolus, who deny
Saccharum, of the auncientes to be any kind of honey, or to come of the air:
because what part of the air so ever (say they) doth coagulate by cold, the
same will by the heate of the sun not harden, but evaporate or vanyshe away,
as will Manna recentium: which never waxes so harde, that it will break
between the teethe like salt, but will rather be chawed as it were wax.

Who also judge that plant (about the which Fuchsius thus argues) to have
been of his exterior form called Harundo, Harundo Saccharifera.
though it be not holowe or empty as a rede, do cal it Harundine
Sacchariferam: confessing yet with Fuchsius, that our sugar is Factitium
la, non natural, and of the same juice made perfect by boylyng, as
before. But Sal Indus (say they) is of the same substance, and for very fulness
issues or sweateth out, at certain ryftes of the same, and chiefly about the
joints or knobs: where (say they) it is by the heate of the sun hardened
and whytened.

Claiming also herin Plinies former authority to lean with them, in that he
lykeneth it to gummes: Noting also that the auncientes did never say, that
their Saccharon did fasten or grow together on the leaves, as dews are most
apt to do.

Brasauolus also seems to prove, that the making of sugar of the juice of
Canes, and of the roots of the same, was in use before the times Galen and
Dioscorides, by the testimonies Marcus Varro, Statius Papinius, and Strabo: who
lived al before Galen. But Matthiolus allows not the sweet pressed out
liquores, which they mention, to be of necessity Saccharon: because the
Indians pressed out such iuyces from the roots of divers plants and trees,
as well as of Canes. Neither yet (though it be called Saccharum Tabarzeth or
Saccharum Candum) is it our sugar Candy: which is not brought from India. But
the Uenetians immitating nature as much as may be, do make it, by boylynge
our white sugar four or five times, putting reds therein, whereon it may
hang like lumps: And wrap it in cotton, as though it came from the easterly
regions. Neither know I any thing at this day extant with us, that may so
well be likened to Saccharum Arundineum, as may the whytest sugar Candy, that
we have amongst us: for the other is also not natural, but artificial: nor
white but yelowysh. And that judge I Lanfranke to mean by Saccharum rubrum.

Lo, thus do we se, how this our unfortunate and miserable age, is not only
bereft of this many other Jewels and commodities: but also (which worse is) so
drowned in oblivion of the same, that what they are or wear, we are either
utterly ignorant or very vncerteine.

Sal.
SAlt, generally called Sal, (whereof there are divers kinds, Hales ex libris
Galeni De symp. facult. li. 4. 9. 11.
) is also in Greek in like manner called (...), and is made partly by art, of
sea water in the baize, dried through the heate of the sun, and called
Marinus: and of certain salt lakes by boylyng (which is called Lacustris sieve
Stagneus: Sal Marinus.
and partly natural, dug out of the earth, and is therefore called Fossilis,
Sal Fossitius.
which do both alike dry mightyly, but differ in this. That Sal Fossilis is
of substance more compact, gross, and more adstringent: and being put in
water, will not disolue as the other two sorts will. They have also an obscure
adstriction, whereby they thycken and bind such flesh as is salted therewith:
for it wastes away moyste substances, and binds the solid parts. For the
which Sal Fossilis is best: next good to it is Sal Marinus. The third rome
holds ye salt that is made in the wells, salt pooles. Of all the which, we
have only the use of Salis Marini Lacustris. Howbeit, in some parts of
Calabria Germania, and in all Pannonia, Sal Fossitius is their usual salt.
For the which (says Brasauolus) they dig vndermyne certain hills, of two
miles in length, estemyng that for best which is white, fast, and shining:
but that which is most bright and glistering like to Crystal, do the
Apothecaries (following the Arabians) therefore (or else for the rareness of the
same) call Salem Gemmae. Which for a truhe Manardus doth avouch: affirming
him self to have scene in Pannonia divers lumps or cloddes of dug salt,
shynynge so bright, that such as saw it, thought it to have ben very
Crystal. This says Matthiolus, being cast into the fire, neither cracks
nor leaps out, as the other sorts will: but gloweth as Iron therein.

Salt says Dioscorides, doth bind, scour away, purge gently, scatter
abroad, repress, and extenuate. But in that, one more the an other as before.
It defends from putrefaction, and is put in medicynes that mundyfie scabs.
It represses ye excrescentes of the eyes, cosumeth the webs in the same, and
takes away other fleshye eminences. It put in Clyscers, loses tough and
glasye phlegm from the belly. Outwardly applied, it puts away werynes,
helps hydropicall tumores, and in fomentations doth mitigate pains: Cum
oleo aceto, it stays itch, eases the quincie, cum mell, aceto, oleo. It is
drunk cum Oximeli, after Opium and musheromes, to resist strangling: and is
profitable to all poisoned wounds, and venomous hurts.

Howbeit, Sal by Mesue, is divided into four principal or notable kinds, as
1. Sal panis, wherein are coteined al the former sorts, as Marinus, Stagneus,
(each of the which is called Factitius) and Fossitius (called also of Syluius,
Hammoniacus, Communis) which ought to be white, bright, not stony, thick, and
equal. Sal Geme^s is as you see a kind of Salis Fossitii or else must it vary
fro Sale Gemmeo Dioscoridis.
2. Sal Gemmae which will easily cut or rent, is like to the Crystal. 3. Sal
Naphthicus, of colour blackysh, and smells like Bitumen: and 4. Sal Indus.
Which is reddysh, or rather blackish, and is the strongest: next to it is
Naphthicus: Thirdly Gemmeus, and the weakest is Fossitius. Salt is whotte and
dry (says he) in the second degree, and howe bitter soever it be, so much
the whotter and drier it is.

Of Sal Naphthicus, Dioscorides makes no mention, but Galenus lib. 4.. 9. De
symp. says yt a certain salt called Sodominus, is made in ye sea of palestin
of Syria, called Mare mortuu, wherein much Bitumen is engendered: and Naphtha is
a kind of Bituminis, whereof ye said salt is called Sal Naphthicus: whereof also
in Plinie is almost a like sense. What the Arabians meant by Salem Indum, it is
hard to know. But what the Grecians meant thereby, is showed above under
Saccharum.

Salt consists of an carthye substance, bitter by adustion, and of an
unsavoury watery substance. Which two if they be equal, make a salt savour.
If the earthy substance be the stronger, it will be bitter: but if the watery,
it will have an easy saltnes.

Sal Ammoniacus.
(...), Hammoniacos Halos.
quasi Sal arenarius, so called because (as some write) it is by dyggyng found
in long pieces under sand, or else of his native place (as above of the Gum
Hammoniacum) is more commonly and most corruptly called Sal armoniacus, and is
of two sorts. Namely, the natural called Natiuus, Sal Ammoniacus natiuus.
which is thought to be contained under the sorts of Salis panis, and should
in colour be like Alumen Siston, and shining: being so salt, that it is of
unpleasant taste, but profitable in medicine.

Sal Ammoniacus is (says Dioscorides) peculiarly praised, Dioscor. lib. 5.
if it may be easily cut or clefte into straight flakes or sclyces, with us
both out of use and knowledge, though in time lunge since better known. Sal
Hammonia cu^ factitius.
The other which we have is artificall, and therefore called Factitius, and is
chiefly occupied of Goldsmythes: and ought not to be used in stead of the
true thing, otherwise then in much less quatitie. But Galen bids us
substitute in his place Salem Capadocum. Sal Capadocus
And divers other learned men, Salem Gemneum. His virtues are like the virtues
of salt.

Sal Nitrum.
ALbeit (as most true it is) that our Salt petre is not (...), Nitron.
of Dioscorides, Litron.
Galen, Plinie, and other ancient wryters, which is natural, coming of
certain waters in lakes: and should be light, rose coloured or white, cleauyng
or opening it self into many pores, like a spungy substance. But our Salt
peter (which is artificial) is glistering white, (if it be good) or else
blackyshe, (if it be not made perfect by boylyng) solide and weyghty.

Nitrum also is taken cum Lacerpitio, of such as feel not their meat
(whereunto salt peter is not the metest:) yet surely is it evident, that
Lanfranke and many others right learned, both of his time and long since, meant
according to the vulgar opinion, (though not without great errore,) that which
hath ben commoly called Sal petrae, When they wrote Sal Nitrum.

But Mesues says, The old translators use this Araby word (...). But let yt
be no prejudice to any truth.
that of Nitrum, there is one mineral or natural, and an other artificial
called Spuma Nitri, white, light, salt, and biting, and weaker then the
natural Nitrum. An other artificial Nitrum also there is says he, stroger
the Nitrum, and called Flos parietis uel salis. Hitherto Mesues. And this do I
with Syluius take to be Sal petrae, (if it may in any wise be found among the
auncientes) better known as it seems now, to the Apothecaries and to Guners,
then in old time to the ancient wryters.

Nitrum says Mesues, is dry in the third degree, and and whotte in the
beginning of the same: But after Auicen only in the second. De sym. lib. 9.
It is (saith Galen) of power mean between Aphronitrum Salem, and by burning
is more subtyle: and therefore draws the nygher Aphronitrum.

It dries and dygesteth, Dioscor. lib. ^.
and is put (says Dioscorides) into emplasters, yt draw out, discuss,
extenuate: scowreth away leprosies. Which (if it be taken inwardly) cutteth,
and thinneth, gross and tough humores, much stronglier then salt: and is
taken both raw and burned, against the suffocations of Musheromes.

Sambucus.
SAmbucus, which is called in Greek (...), seems says Fuchsius to be so
called of Sambix, the first fynder thereof, or of the musical instrument
Sabuca: and therefore (after Quintus Serenius) ought it rather to be called
Sabucus. There are of the Elder two kinds, the one a tree called symply, by
that general name Sambucus. The other a shrubby herb called Ebulus,
Chamaeacte.
and in Greek (...), Quasi Sambucus humilis, in Englyshe Wall wort, or
Daneworte. Which to have both heatyng and driyng faculty, the bitterness and
mean bynding thereof, doth sufficiently declare, according to the mind of
Galen: though some write that it cools. It dygesteth also glueth together.
Dioscorides says that they dry, draw out water, and hurt the stomach.

Their leaves sod and eaten, do purge choler and phlegm: and with wine, do
help the byte of the viper. It molly^ieth the mother, correctynge the affects
of the same. The fresh and tender leaves, applied cum polenta, mitigateth
inflammations, helps burnynges, and the bytinges of dogs, Sambucus montana
sieve syluesiris.
and glueth together deep and fistulous ulcers. Two kinds more hereof are of
ye late wryters mecioned as Syluestris, being a more shrubby tree with beries
always red: and Palustris growing always in ye fens.

Sanguis draconis.
Blood says Galen, Haema.
called in Greek (...), varies as the natures of the beasts, from whence it
flows. The blood of one being thin liquid, of an other dryer, an others
blood is whotter, but no blood is cold.

Sanguis draconis, sounds dragons blood: about the which there are not a few
opinions. Some judge it the juice of an herb, Cinnabaris.
others the gum or liquor of a tree, and Plinie calls it Cinnabarin. who
says that the Elephat, being in the conflict between him and the dragon,
(whose mutual hatred never cease,) strangled: falls with great weight on
the drago and dashes him in sonder. The blood of both the which running forth
together, Who reproves Plinie in many things
is after gathered made in a lump, dried and kept for medicine: and this
Leonicenus as well as diverse others, disapproueth not. But that Cinnabaris, is
Legitimus sanguis draconis, is far from truth, as here after shall appear.
First Dioscorides treats of Cinabaris, in his fifth book (as Galen also
doth,) among mineralles, (not speaking a word thereof in his second book, where
he treats of divers bloudes) saying: that some men esteemed it to be Sanguinem
draconis, because that such as then was, would scantly serve the painters to
vary a colour with. Secondly, ^.
Theophrastus makes it a metal, growing in Hiberia and Colchis. None
otherwise says Aucrois also, of Cinnabaris.

But that which we have commonly to be sold of the Apothecaries, But the ^son
of the name is hard to be known.
seems (not without the authority of diverse learned men) to be the tears or
gum of a tree growing in Aphrica, whose rynde may be scene in the lumps of the
same: which as Matthiolus judged, might be Ginnabaris Dioscoridis.

Scrapio also mencioneth a kind of Sanguinis draco^is, to be the juice of an
herb, which he describes both in form faculties, as Dioscorides doth ye
fourth kind of Sideritis, called Achillea Sideritis: which Brasauolus wishes
to be in use among the Apothecaries, rather then the gum that they have. Thus
do you se here three sorts of Sanguinis draconis, variyng each from other as
notably as may be.

Sanguis draconis says Platearius, hath byndyng and consolydatiue power, and
is profitable for the spyttyng of blood, bledyng at the nose or else where.
Vnde, menses cum Corrigiolasistit.

Sanies.
SAnies, is generally taken for that superfluous liquid substance that flows
from every ulcer, regularly or otherwise, of what kind or quality soever it
be, and as it differs in colour, substance, or qualities, so is it known
and called by several names, (as well as the ulcers from whence it flows,)
As by destinction a pure, Sanies purulens: a sorditie, Sanies sordida, or
filthy matter: a Viro ^irulens, or venomous. But thou shalt perceive Lanfranke
always (for the most part,) to mean by Saniem, the same quitture, white and
thick to behold, light to touche, and equal, or each way like to it self,
and not stinkyng: which Galen calls Pus laudabile, Lib. 1. de differentiis
(...) cap. 6.
and we good or well digested matter. But in apostemes otherwise as before.

Santalum sieve Sandalum.
OF the woods called Sanders (written commonly Sandali,) there is among the
old Grecians no mention found, unless their opinion should be of force, that
would have Santalum rubrum, Aspalathus.
to be Aspalathum Dioscoridis: which Serapio doth manifestly confute. For in
wrytyng of Santali, he yields no testimony of Dioscorides (as elsewhere he is
wont,) but the authorities of his own country men: writing also of Aspalathi
under the Arabic name Darsisaban. And farther Santalum is the woedde of a taule
straight tree, but Aspalathus is a lowe shrubbe, odoriferous, and bitter in
taste: neither of the which is found in Santalo rubro. Of the Arabians
therefore, was it first found and described.

Santalum (says Matthiolus) grows in certain great and thick woods of
both the Indies, and is of three kinds: whereof Santalum Pallidum or Citrinum
is best esteemed. The next place hath Santalum Album. The third and worst, is
Rubrum, which is without odor: but the other do smell well. They are cold
(by the testymonies of the Arabians) in the third degree, and dry in the
second, having byndyng, coolyng, and alteratiue virtue: And therefore are used
to mitigate thirst, and the whotte distemperance of the liver, and for
choleryke vomits. Santalum rubrum doth pryuatly resist defluxions, and is
profitably applied Ex succo solani, uel Sedi, uel portulacae, to vehement
inflammations, the gowte of the feet. Santalum Candidum atque pallidum laid
to the forehead, cum aqua Rosarum, do ease the peynes of the head: and being
drunk, do marvelously help whotte stomaches. They do (saith Auicen) most
effectually make glad, and strengthen the heart.

Sapo.
Soap, La sicut spatha incidit
which the Arabians cal Sabon, is of diverse kinds in opere pandactarum. As
Sapo Gallicus, Sapo muscatus, and Sapo Spatharenticus, so called of his
exceeding sharpnes and cutting, and is also called Mollis, niger, Iudaicus,
wherewith they wash sylke. Gutta uel (...) qua pri^a (...) ponariorum.
The soft or gray soap, is made of the strong lye called Capitellum, and
oil together. Hard soap hath in composition in the stead of oil, shepes
talowe. They are of a hot^e and composed exulceratiue operation, and do
scour, putrefy, and maturate, harde apostemes.

Sarcocolla.
IS the Gum or liquore of a tree growing in Persia, as wytnesseth
Dioscorides, Like the poulder of Frankynsence, red or pale, or as Mesues
says white, and bitter: and is called in Greek (...), id est glutinum
carnis, De sym. med. facultat. lib. 8.
because it glueth excellently flesh together. Galen says that it dries
without bytyng, and therefore is of power to adglutinate wounds, and to staye
the flux or running of the eyes. It heats after Mesue, in the second
degree, but dries less. It concocteth or maturateth, scours, opens, and
digests. Inwardly, it purges raw phlegm and other gross humores, fro the
brain chiefly, from the sinews, the joints, and the luges: And therefore is
profitable for old phlegmatike, asthmatike, and coughing persons, and pelpeth
Ophthalmia, and other diseases of the eyes.

Scabiosa pilosa.
SCabiosa, Psora.
which Actius calls (...), quasi scabiem Sanante, (because it heals
scabs) is an herb whereof ye grecias neither old nor late writers, have left
any light. Though Mathaeus Syluaticus, (as reports Iacobus Manlius) affirms
it to be (...) of the Grecias: Sto^be.
whose sentence hath few learned fautores,) Whereunto there are referred five
kinds: whereof the first two differ not but in greatness, for the one is much
less then the other. The third is called Scabiosa Ouina. The fourth Iacea
nigra, and vulgarly Materfilon. The fifth which Fuchsius (imitating a
certain old written herbal,) calls Succisam. Succisa.
The common sort (led by a most vain superstition, that the devil of
envy to mankynde his felicity, should have bit away, this precious root:)
have named Morsum diaboli, Morsus Diaboli.
quasi a diabolo praemorsa, in english devils bit, of some Matfelon, but
most aptly heary scabiose. This doth most justly agree, both in form virtues
with Scabiosa pilosa, that Lanfranke describes. For it is used says
Fuchstus, as a present remedy to maturate and heal Carbuncles, either bruised
grene and applied to the same, or the wine drunk wherein it was boiled: and is
now found to have discussiue, and incisi^e faculty, and used to dissolve
coagulated blood. This Succisa, hath ben thought of some to be Geum Plinii:
Which with greater reason, is more aptly applied to Caryophyllata. They are all
unmeasurable bitter, and therefore must needs be hot and dry, and are in
qualities like Succisa.

Of Scabiosa, in opere pandactarum, I find as follows. Men say that S. Urban
at the petitions of a certain asthmatike sister of his, (that used scabiose
continually,) sent to her the^e verses, of the virtues thereof.

Vrbanus pro se nescit pretium Scabiosae.
Nam purgat pectus quod comprimit aegra senectus.
Lenit pulmonem purgat laterum regionem.
Apostema frangit, si locum bibita tangit.
Tribus uncta foris anthracem liberat horis.
Which may with a few more words thus in verse be englyshed.

To Urbane him self, it is vncerteine.
Howe many virtues, in scabiose reygne:
But excellently it cleanses the breast,
Of sick aged folk, that there are opreste.
The pypes of the lunges, if rough they apere,
It makes them smothe, yea gentle and clear.
The roumes of the breast, that we the sides call,
It purges well, from incombrances all.
If it be drunk, so that it touche the place,
Apostemes it breaks, by peculiar grace.
Without to Carbuncles, if it laid be,
It doth lose and break them, within hours three.
Scammonium.
(...), Scammoni^ ^ Scammonia. or^um est.
so called Per Antonomasian, is the juice of the herb (...) prepared, called
them Diacridium. The Romains also do (after the place) name it Colophonium.

Scammonia, saith Dioscorides, puts forth gross, fat, many branches, fro
one root, of the length of three cubits, with the leaves of Helxinae (which
we call byndwede,) or of Juie: Dioscor. lib. 4.
but softer, rough, and triangled, a flower white, roude and holowe, like a
maund basket, or bell formed cup, of heavy smell. The root is very lunge,
of a cubit thycknes, and white, with a heavy savour, and a heavy juice.
Which is thus gathered.

The root (the head thereof being first cut of) is made holowe with a knife,
that the juice may run out into the holownes: which is taken in vessels,
and dryde. The scamonie is praised that is light, clear, thin, of colour
most like to glewe of leather, called Glutinum taurnium: Like a musherum, with
fine pores or fistules, such as is brought fro Mysia, a region of Asia. And
trust not it that will only ware white, being touched with the tongue: for so
will that do, that is adulterate with the juice of Tithymali, whereof the
greatest token is, that it burns not the tongue vehemently, as the right
Scamonie doth. One drachme of the juice drunk ex aqua pura uel muls^, purges
downwards choler phlegm. Volubilis Conuoluulus.
Mesues writing of five kinds of Volubilis or Conuoluulus, describes the
fifth kind thereof (which grows in Antiochia, Armenia, Arabia, Turchia) to
have a root like to Bryonia or bigger, like a great gored, a stalk.ii.
cubits log with little narowe leaves, formed like a fethered arowe, and
falling of at every light occasion: having more plenty of mylky juice then the
rest, whereof scamonie is made: and therefore is called the mistres of milk
giving herbs. It is hot and dry in the second degree (or rather with Galen
in the beginning of the third.) c. In the chapiter of Scammonium he says,
that Scamonie is of purgynge medicines the strongest. And after he hath showed
diverse manners of gathering, driyng, working it in paste, and sealyng it: he
says that it should be clear like gummes, or whityshe, or of divers colours,
chiefly that which flows first. The same touched or rubbed, with spittell or
water, gives milk. It ought also to be tender, brittle and easy to be
pouldered, light, and referring the propre odor of the herb: but that good,
not stynkyng. From the which notes howe much the more it differs, so much
the worse it is. It may be kept twenty years, but the older it is the weaker.
It is hot and dry in the third degree, bitter and sharpe: but not so sharpe
as the herb. It cutteth, scours, and purges yelowe choler, by attraction
fro out the blood, even from the extreme parts: so much is his furious
vehemence. It hurts the heart, the stomach, the liver, and the guts, and
troubles the other bowels, subverts the stomach, takes away appetite,
moves abhorfulnes, stirs thyrste, and ought not to be give to choleric
persons, and such as are apt to take fevers. When it is taken, heate, cold,
cold fruit, cold water, long sleep, exercise, wrath, and other vehement
affections of the mind, ought to be aduoyded: and so goes he forth to the
corrections of the same.

But now whether Scammonia Dioscoridis, and Volubilis quinta Mesuae, be one
herb under two names, or not: whose descriptions, though (being precysely
examined,) they do not exactly agree: yet are they (as you see) of no small
affinity. And may have the more, for that Mesues dispraiseth for nought, both
the herb and the juice of his country: Whereof belike he made his description,
or else perhaps of such a one, as he knew not otherwise then by report of
others. For so are right well approved authors, some times found to do. I
leave it to the wise and learned to discuss: rather then rashly to affirm any
thing, whereof I have neither sensible knowledge, nor just assurance: and that
the rather because right worthy wryters do leave it in doubt. But that
Scammonium Dioscoridis is as utterly out of use as unknown, there is no
doubt. For we have none that may in any wise be compared thereto: for our
best may rather be adjudged Scammonium Iudaicum, uel Syriacum, which
Dioscorides esteems most vile. And farther.xv. grains of the common
Scammonium, hath ben scene to purge the belly often, or with divers stools:
which by the testimony of Dioscorides a whole drachme should scarcely do.
Wherefore Andreas Marinus, wishes us diligently to search out, and prudently to
use our own native medicines. For we have in our regions (says he) medicines
that (if they were ryghtly known and prepared,) would purge much more luckily
then Scammonium, or unknown Turbith. For if the best bear with it so many
nociue qualities, as above is showed: what then doth the worst, whereof we have
the use? Which truly moved Brasauolus to wish, that it had never come to the
hands of men: as a thing more hurtful then profitable.

Scarificatio.
SCarificatio uel cutis Sculptura, Charac^a.
englishly Scarfication, is called in Greek (...), Hoc est Sculpo, Rado, uel
Scarifico,, to race, garse, or scarify the skin.

Schoenanthum.
(...), Schoen^th^ Schoenos aromaticos. Lib. 1.
quasi Schoeni, uel Schini flos, It is the flower of the sweet rush called
(...), hoc est iuncus odo ratus. This rush says Dioscorides, must be chosen
red and new, bearing fine flowers with red fragmentes, which being rubbed
in the hand smells like the rose: and binds the tongue with a fyery
biting. The flowers, the stalks, and the roots whereof, are in use. The flower
says Galen (which we handle,) Galen. de sym. lib. 8.
doth heate and bind moderately, neither lacks it a subtle nature: and
therefore Vrinam menses mouet, given in drink, or in fomentations: and
profits also the inflammations of the liver, the stomach, and the belly. But
the root is more adstringente, (though the flower also do bind with all his
parts:) and therefore is myxed with medicines that are given for spytting of
blood. Hitherto Galen.

And for as much as these flowers are not now brought unto us, yea and in
Uenice rarely scene: (whereat our marvel may be the less, since Galen notes
the in his time to be very rare:) The learned phisities have therefore
councelled to use, The tenderest or uppermost parts of the herb or rush. But
our Apothecaries, (say they) going to Uenise, are deceived in Iunco odorato:
buy either in the stead thereof, or mixed therewith, certain tender strigges
of Iunci^ palustris, that is the marsh rush, or rush of the fens.

It is commonly called Pastum uel palca Camellorum, or Camelles straw.

Scilla.
(...), called also of some Scylla, Cepe muris, Cepa marina of the Apothecaries
Squilla, in englyshe squille or sea onion, hath sharpe fervent, and cutting
power, and heats in the second degree. It mollifies the belly, moves urine,
is good for the hydropsie, for the iaundis, for the pains of the belly and the
old cough. Whereunto it helps much (by ye mind of Galen) to be roasted or
sod, Galen. de sym. Lib. 8.
rather then raw: for so is his vehemence diminished. Hereof see more in D.
Turners herbal.

Scirrhus*
(...), Scirrhos. Sclerotes.
Id est durities, written of old Sclirosis, is (as I gat her of Galen in diverse
places) a tumore against nature, ^
and an affect of harde and thick parts. (Which yet to take, the liver the
spleen are most ready) harde, without peyne, and sometime without sense.
Whose first cause says he, in his book of tumores against nature, is
double: as of gross tough phlegm, and of the dregs of blood. Which also
is double, whereof the one doth Hippocrates call black: The other also is
black, but properly called black choler. And in his fifth book of simple
medicines, he affirms it to spring of cold and gross humores: De art
curatiua. lib. 2.
as of melancholy, or of gross and viscous phlegm, (overmuch dried, and
impacte in the pores of the skin) or of both: and chances often by
ignorance, (through the use of vehement byndyng and coolyng things,) De com.
med. secun. loc. li. 6
to inflammations, and Ignibus sacris. If it come of phlegm, it has some
obscure sense, is curable with mollificatiues, though hardly: but that which
comes of melancholyke juice, is cancrous (the parts affected utterly without
sense,) and uncurable: and is by mollyficatiues exasperate.

And as the pure Scirrhus, made of melancholy, may in mixtures receive any of
the other three humores: Scirrhes oedematodes.
so may it in name variably change, and be called of phlegm (...), Scirrhos
phlegmonodes.
Id est Scirrhus oedematosus, Of blood (...), Hoc est inflamationis consors,
Scirrhos Erysipelatodes.
or of choler, and is named (...), quasi ignitae rubedinis, uel sacriignis
particeps.

Scrophula.
Scrophula, (so called of Auicenna, Guidone de Cauliaco, Bruno, Theodorico,
Lanfranco, and others, a Scropha, a pregnante soowe: because it or the like, is
a disease common to hogs) is a harde Scirrhous tumore, in the glandules of the
share or arm holes, but chiefly in the neck, and called in Latin Struma,
Struma. Cho^as.
in Greek (...): as the inflammatio in them, hath to name Phygethlon. Look
more at Bubo and Glandulae.

Sedges syluestris.
Sedges, signifies most commonly standing Corn. And where Lanfranke hath
Folia segetis syluestris, I know not howe to understand him therein, unless he
mean thereby some kind of the wild corns, that usually grow in Italy: as
Milium, Milium Indicum, (which they call Sorgos,) Panicum, Bromus, c. Whereof
the poor nedy wretches there, make their bread, especially of Sorgos. But
which of these (if any) he means, De symp. li. 7
it is harde to guess. But Galen in gluing together wounds, and healing
ulcers, (which is Lanfranke his purpose) praises Milium for the best.

Semperuiuum.
SEmperuiuum, which we may most aptly call Aygrene, is called in Greek
(...), Aeizoon.
id est semperuiuens, because it lives styll and kepeth grene, both winter
summer: neither dies it by any injurious whether. Truly a singular miracle of
nature, that an herb so cold and moyste, growing on the house top, (a place
most dry, and subject not only to the parching bemes of the Sun in summer,
but also to the most cold frosts, and vehement storms of winter,) should
yet live and be grene. Whereof indeed, many such as are ready to convert
those marvelous works of God, (that their brutyshe eyes can not otherwise
behold) into most horrible supersticions: have conceived a most vain
opinion, that lightninge could not hurt the house on whose top it grew:
and have therefore called it Barbam Iouis, Barba Iouis.
and is of three kinds: as Sedum maius, whereof hitherto.

The second is Sedum minus, Sedum Trithales.
called also in Greek (...), for that it blows thryce in the year, and thereof
is there Mas foemina. The male having a yelowe flower, the flower of the female
is pale or white, and is called Vermicularis, and Crassula minor. There seems
also (says Dioscorides) to be a third kind, Andrachne agria. Telephio
called of some (...), id est portulacasyluestris, of other (...), and of the
Romaines Illecebra, of nature very hot, contrary to the rest.

Sedum says Galen, De symp. ^e. fac. li. 6.
(both Maius and minus) dries lightly, and binds moderately: yet cools it
in the third degree. Wherein also a watery essence, bears the maisterie: and
therefore avails ad erysipelata, Herpetes Phlegmonas, coming of a fluxion:
and is an excellent repercussiue.

Serapinum.
COruptly so called of Apothecaries, but more trulys Sagapenum, Dioscor. lib.
3*
is the juice (saith Dioscorides) of an herb like to Ferulae, growing in
Media: whereof the best is shining through, and of a bright or shining yelow
colour without, white within: with an odor mean as it were between Laser and
Galbanum: De antidotis.
sharpe in taste, and will (saith Galen) soon resolve in water.

It profits in the peynes of the breast and the sides, to old coughs,
conuulsions and ruptures, and expurgeth the gross phlegm of the lunges.

Sagapenum (says Galen) is whotte and of subtle parts as are other
liquores: De sym. med. facultat. lib. 3.
But obteyneth a certain abstersion, whereby it purges and extenuateth the
scars of the eye: To the dullness also, and the dimnes of the sight, coming
of the grosnes of humores, It is a good medicine. But the plant like to Ferula
(whereof it comes) is weak and unprofitable.

Serpigo.
I Can not better express Lanfranke his mind of Serpigo* then him self hath
done, in the third treatice and first doctrine of his greater work, saying. I
say therefore that Serpigo is an exasperation of the skin, which crepeth
hither and thither, called in French Derbes, in Lumbardy Dembeda, or Volatica,
of others Ignis uolaticus, and comes of burned humores, assaultyng the skin
with exasperatio or roughnes* whereby I judge him (and others without number) to
mean none other thing, then Galen doth by Herpete symplici. But look more at
Herpes.

Howe be it, of Thiria, (which he joins as a partener, with Serpigine, and
to come of the same causes:) Look more at his place in the letter T. For in
his works I find thereof no farther explication.

Howe be it, Guido, Rolandus, and Rogerus, with divers others living about that
time, make four kinds of leprosies, (a division in Galen and the auncientes
not found,) which may come of the four humores burned, as Alopecia, which
comes of burned blood, Alopecia.
(though Rolandus say of phlegm.) Lepra leonina Lepra Elephatia.
Leonina, that springs of burnt choler, infecting the blood. Elephantia
coming of melancholy, (Rolande says of blood.) Thiriasis lepra
And Thiriasis, caused of salt phlegm putrefied, after Rolande of melancholy:
so called say they a Thiro, that is of an adder or viper: because it is scaly
loses the skin, as doth the adder. Wherein there is putrefaction, both of the
skin and flesh, and also pustules. Which name (if it may be of the Greek
derived) I judge to come, (...), Hoc est a serpent, uel fera aut noxa belua.
That is of a serpent or some cruel or hurtful beast, Vt uipera uel lupus.
(...) have ye old grecias generally taken pro bestiis uenenatis, Therion.
that is for venomous beasts, such as leave venom behind them, Theriomata.
(...) enim tetrum ul cus est.
with their stroke or bite: whereof comes (...), Id est tetra, uel uenenata
ulcera. That is cruel or venomous ulcers. And so of Theriacalia, that is
things or rather medicines that resist venom. But at Thiria you may read
somewhat more.

Sinapis.
SInapis, Napy.
is called in Greek (...). Of Sinapis, Plinie makes three kinds, Sinepy.
but it is of Dioscorides vndeuyded. Dioscor. lib. ^.
Who mecioneth but one, calling it Sinapi horrense, which we call garden
mustard or sendew sede: and therefore may a wild also be there understanded:
For the third Rapistrum of the late wryters, is usually put.

Musterde heats and dries, De symplici. (...). lib. 8.
(by the mind of Galen,) in the fourth degree. It is profitable for the
diseases of the throat, causes nesyng, and draws down rewines from the
head. c.

Solatrum.
OF Solanum, Strychnos.
which the Greekes name (...), both Dioscorides and Galen, Strychnos Cepaios.
do make four kinds. The first is (...), Solanu hortense, with us night
shade, Strychnos Halicaca^os, Physalis.
or petimorell. The second (...), Id est uesicaria, which we call winter
cherie, and following the Apothecaries Alkakenge. Strychnos hypnoticos.
The third is called of Galen (...), a consiliando somno, somniferum, of
provoking sleep. The fourth (quod ad insania adigat,) they call (...),
Strychnos Manicos.
Id est furiosum. A fifth also have the late wryters found and added,
Vesicaria perigrina.
calling it Vesicariam peregrina. So^anum hor tense, which doubtless
Lanfranke means by Solatrum, doth Galen also call Esculentum, De alimentis.
lib. 2.
because in time past it was planted in gardyns, and usually eaten, but we use
it rarely, says he as an aliment, (because it nourishes little,) but as a
medicine often. De symp. li. 8.
It cools and binds in the second degree: outwardly applied, they heal
maligne ulcers.

Spica.
SPicanardi, for so saith Nicolaus in his recepte of D^azingiber, or as some
have it Spicaindica, or Nardus indica, is so called saith Galen, in his first
book, De antidotis: because it in form resembles an ear of corn, for it is
in deed a root, and is called also of like reason in Greek (...). Nardu
Stachys.


It is hot in the third degree, and dry in the end of the second, De sym.
me. facult. li. 8.
consisting of a sharpe adstringent, and light bitter substance: Therefore is
the root both drunk and outwardly applied, convenient for the liver and the
stomach. It moves vryne, heals the gnawinge of the stomach, dries the
fluxions of the head, breast, and belly. Whereunto Nardus Indica, which is the
blacker, is stronger then Syriaca. Nardos Celtica. Nardos oreia.


Other two kinds there are, (...), Hoc est Gallica, (...). id est Montana.

Spodium.
POmpholix says Dioscorides, differs from Spodio, only in specie, not in
kind. And as the two kinds of (...), Cadmia.
are the earthy or stony parts of the our of brass, driven up from the
fornace, when the brass is in melting or purifying, as ashes or soot: and
cleaves to the sides, vaults, and walls, of the fornace or melting house.
Some for the lightness thereof rising, Cadmia botryitis quasi asinosa.
and cleauynge in the higher parts, and called (...): The other weyghtier
parts, that cleave therefore in the lower places of the walls, Cadmia placitis
uel (...). quasi crustosa.
they call (...): So not only of brass, but also of Cadmia broken, and by the
industry of the founder or workman, sprinkled in the fornace, and at the last
burned, comes both Spodium and Pompholyx. Which by the cunning blowing of
the bellows, do rise from the fornace. Whereof some rises, Pompholyx.
and hangs to the walls and couerynges of the house, Spodion.
and is (...): white, fatty, and so light, that it may fly away in the air:
and part, which is (...), so called (...), id est a cinere sordido, That is
of ashes myxt with dead coals, and rubbyshe: falls on the flower: and is of
colour black, weyghtie, and full of hears, chafe, as the swepyng of the
brasyers flower. Whereunto says Gallen, De sym. lib. 8.
that seems to be like in faculty, which is called Antispodium, which is
not to be used where Spodium may be had: neither yet Spodiu, if you may get
Pompholyx. Which if it be washed, is well ne'er the best of all other medicines
that dry without bytyng. And therefore is a mete medicine for cancrous and
maligne ulcers: and is also put into collyries that heal the webs of the
eyes, and staye the fluxions of the same. And farther is a very good remedy, ad
pudendorum, acsedis ulcera.

Spuma maris.
(...), is called of the Apothecaries Spuma maris, that is the spume or some of
the sea, whereon the birds called Alcyones, are said to make their nest, is
therefore called Alcyonium: though Plinie (whose sentence therein is less
allowed) affirm it to come of ye Alcios nests. It is after Dioscorides and
Galen, of five kinds, (whereof Plinie doth mention but four.) Galen. de sym.
Lib. 11.
The first is gross, weighty, sharpe in taste, without like a sponge, of
heavy smell like rotten fyshe: and is found chiefly on the shores. An other is
like the pin in the eye, or a sponge: light, full of holes, Phyc^s, id est
Alga.
of form somewhat lunge, and smells like the sea wedes, called Alga and
(...). The third is in form like a worm, Sea girdle.
soft and of purple colour: which they call Milesum. The fourth is light and
full of pores like the second, Milesum.
and resembles the moyste woulle, called Lana succida. The fifth is fashioned
like a mosherome, without smooth, within rough, like the pumyse stone, of no
savour, but of taste sharpe. They do all scour away and dygeste, having all
a whotte and sharpe quality. The first two do help scabs, skuruynes,
leprosies, and take away spots and morphewes, and scour and beautify the
skin: which the fifte can not do. The third is of all the rest the
subtlest, and is good for the affects of the reins, and bladder, and for
difficille p^ssynge: And being burned, doth cure with wine Alopecias. The
fourth hath also the same virtues, but is much weaker. The fifte is of all the
rest the whoteste: inso much that it burns the hear, and excoriateth and
exulcerateth the skin.

Styrax.
(...) or Styrax calamita a most pleasant gum, is the tears of a tree,
Dioscor. lib. 1.
saith Dioscorides, like to the quynce tree: whereof the best is fatty, pale or
yelowe, and gummy, with white lumps, yielding when it is melted a liquor like
honey: and kepeth long his good savour. De sym. med. facultat. lib. 8.
That which is dry, is of Galen dispraised: who saith that it doth heate,
mollify, and concoct. De com. med. secundum genera. lib. 7. Stacte.
And therefore helps the cough, catarrhes, distillations, and murres. Menses
prolicit, either druke or laid to. That which is commonly called Storax
liquida, is the fatty substance, called (...), pressed out of Myrrh: and
chiefly of that kind that is called Myrrha gabirca. Wherefore look more at
Myrrha.

Sulphur.
OR Sulphur is named in Greek (...), Theion.
is of two kinds, (under yt which Plinie reconeth. 4) The one (which is the
best) is called (...), Apyron.
Hoc est uiuum, uel ignis non exexpers, Theion pepyromenon.
is taken out of the vein without any boylyng. The other (...), id est igne
incoctum, that is boiled sulphur. Dioscor. lib. 5.
The best Sulphur uiuum, ought by Dioscorides to be fattye, green, not stony:
but bright, and shyninge like the glow worm. Every Sulphur (says Galen) hath
drawing power, is whotte of temperament of nature discussiue, De symplici.
faculta. lib. 9.
also swiftly concoctiue, and of so subtle essens, that it laid to, resists
the peryls of many venomous wounds: and is a medicine approved, to heal
scabs, leprosies, scuruines, itch.

Syncope.
(...), Id est animi deliquium, uel praeseps uirium lapsus, that is the defect
of the mind, or a sudden sliding away of the strength of the body, and
commonly called swoundynge, and is caused dyuersly. Galenus de methodome. (...)
Sometime of euel sharpe juice, or of raw humores, about ye mouth of the
stomach: of vnmesurable bledyng, swetyng, flux of the belly, great peyne,
vehement moving, immoderate watch, or emptines: of terror also, and fear, and
of such like perturbations of the mind, and conversation in stynkyng air.
Whose signs are rare and obscure pulse, coldness of the extreme parts, sweat
of the face, the skin of the same losing his beauty, and almost a
resolution of the whole body: which must be cured as variably as the causes
efficient are diverse.

Howe be it, the paroxisme present, is after the mind of the learned, (led by
reason and knowledge) Thus to be succurred. First throw into his face violently
rose water, with vinegar, or cold fountain water: whereby the astonished spirits
may be reuyued: And that in Summer, a burning fever or the cause whotte. The
extreme parts ought also in eruptions to be bound. And rub the legs, if
the eruption issue above: the arms if beneathe. But principally and with
speed, are the nostrils, and the mouth to be stopped (and as some will
also the ears:) That the air already drawn in, and passing into the inward
parts, and by and by is ready to issue out, So made whotte by often moving to
fro, may go again unto the heart: that by heatyng the same, the spirits may
be quickened and revived. And then forthwith is it expedient, to reuocate the
mind with things odoriferous. For nothing by the testimony of Hypocrates,
lib. de alimento, doth sooner call again the spirits. c. By the which, and
by bowing moderately the body: I have often brought again, even such as all men
present have thought dead. And thus much, because Lanfranke appoints the to
be revived, by the noises of Trupettes tympanies: Which (if they were
necessary) yet are they instrumetes, at so sudden exigentes to vnredy, to call
the person loud by his own name. Which truly I judge as vain and
rydiculous, (or worse) as the strokes and buffets, that the rude multitude
use. For if it be (as by the authority of Galen above, and as we see it is)
the defect of the mind, a loss of strength, and a general deprivation of
sense: what can the ears do more by hearing, then the eyes by saying? Or
rather, howe can the ears hear more then the eyes see? or the hands and
other parts of the boby feel. But this notwithstanding, I deny it not, but
that the sudden noise of trumpets or drums, may in the times of great
incisions, and such like dangerous enterprises, both reteyne and quicken so
the spirits (not yet lost,) that swoundyng may thereby be euited, whereof also
I have had the experience.

Synochus.
THose fevers (says Galen) that have one only accession or fit, De methodo
medendi. li. 9.
continuing from the beginnynge to the end, Synochos.
and that many days, are called (...), id est continentes, seu continuae,
whose cause efficient is yelowe choler, and is of nature double. Synochus
putrida.
The one having a manifest putrefaction, and is therefore called Synochus
putrida: and the other utterly without ye same, Synochus non putrida.
called Synochus non putrida, which is a kind of diarie fever: (and are of
Lanfranke, and divers other for distinction sake, called Synochae.) And because
the remission of the fit is wont to chance, by the transpiration or
breathing out of fervent humores, (for they never breathe out at all, in
vehement stipations,) A fytte of many days must needs be made. When in such
fevers there is no occasion, that may raise the beginning of an other
accession: It persisteth a fever, both of many days, and of one accession,
without the invasion of an other: neither referring quotidian, tertian, nor
quart. For as much therefore, as of these two, De differetiis febrium. lib. 2.
cap. 2. ulti.
a fever may be maintained: both that all the vapor may not pass out, and that
the same may heate whatsoever it touches: There must needs be three
differences of Synochus. For some continue from the beginning to the end,
Pyreti.
of one greatness: and are called in Greek (...), Homotoni, uel A^mastici
Anabatici su^e epa^mastici. Paracm. ^stici.
hoc est eodem uigore permanentes. Others do augment and still add to
somewhat, called (...), quasi incrementum suscipientes. And some deminishe by
little and little, which they call (...), Id est decrescentes.

Tamar indus.
OXuphonx, Oxyphoenix
is called in Latin Syluestris palma, that is the wild or sower Date tree,
whose fruit is called of the Arabians Tamar indus, and may be called in
Greek (...), Oxyphoenicobal. ^os.
and of some (...), quasi fructus uel dactilus palma acetosae, uel syluestris.
Which last hath not withstanding some learned adversaries. But their opinion
seems most false, that think Tamar indum and Myrobalanon to be all one: for
Tamar Indus hath a curnell or stone, which Myrabolani have not.

They are saith Mesues, sharpe or sower dates (like saith Syluius, unto the
sede of Cassia) and the fruits of the wild Indian date tree: A medicine
excellent and hurtless. Of the old aunciet writers either unknown, or under
these names vnmensioned, cold and dry in the second degree: After Auerois in
the third. By the which reason, it represses the sharpnes of humores,
purges choler, and mitigateth the feruoure thereof, and also of the blood:
heals the iaundies, and sharpe continual fevers. It stays vomiting,
quenches thyrste, and every burning of the liver and stomach. But to cold
stomaches, it must not be give alone. The best Tamar Indi should be fresh,
fatty, sincere, and tender, in taste sharpe sweet, of colour blackyshe, and
shynynge, myxed with hears, as it wear with certain roots.

Terebinthina.
(...), Terminthine Rhetine.
Resma terebinthina, is the liquid gum of the tree Terebinthus, among the
Greekes called (...), Terminthos.
and sometime (...): The leaves and flowers whereof are dry, Terebinthos.
and bind and heate in the second degree. De sym. me. facult. li. 9.
Terebinthin saith Galen, is preferred among other gummes, having a certain
adstriction: but not so manifest as hath Mastiche. De com. med. secund. genera
lib. 2.
But it hath a certain bytternes, whereby it digests and scours, more then
Mastiche. It purges strayte passages, and draws from depth more then the
rest: De com. med. secun. loc. li. 8.
and because it is of qualities most moderate, it is most safely admyxed with
medicines that heal ulcers, which should be without biting. But neither is
this our Terebynthine, which is the gum of the tree Laryx, and called
Larigna, Larigna.
(not without his specyall virtues,) nor yet as some suspect the finest that we
have, Terebinthina ueneta.
calling it Terebinthinam Venetam: For it is (as many learned affirm) A resin
taken out of the rynde of the young white fyrre tree, Abies.
called Abies, Resina oleosa.
and was of the auncientes called Resina oleosa. The determination whereof I
refer unto them again.

Terra sigillata.
Earth called of the Latins Terra, Ge. Chthon.
in Greek (...), is usually that, which being put in water dissolveth: and is
diverse kinds. For so much as the body of the earth is of nature dry,
utterly void of fury substance, every earth dries without biting: Whereof
many, (namely such as are mete for medicine) are in Dioscorides treated of at
large. Dioscor. lib. 5.
Among the which (...), Ge Lemnia, id est terra lenia.
Id est terra lemnia, (saith he) grows in holes, like cunny borowes, and is
brought from a fenny place out of the Isle Lemno. which the inhabitants
gather, and myxing it with goats blood, they make it in little cakes or loves,
and sign it with the image of a got: therefore call it (...), Sphragis egos
Hoc est sigillu caprae, or rather as Galen will, De symp. me. fac. li. 9.
(who of purpose to se it, visited the place above said) because it is
impressed with the sacred signet of Diana: but now is it marked with the
Turkyshe sygnet. He makes thereof three differences. Lemnia sphragis.
The first he also calls Leminam phragidon, which it was not lawful for
any to touche, Lemnia miltos
but their women priests, and differs from Lenia rubrica, (called in Greek
(...), It est terra sigilla^a rubea,) in that it defiles not the fingers when
it is touched, as Lemnia rubrica doth: and is of colour yelowe, like the hill
in Lemno. whereon there is neither stones, trees, or plants, growing: So much
says he is this earth visited. To the third, he gives neither name nor
description, but says that it hath scouring faculties. The other two are of
driyng faculty, and are used for the Dysenteria, against the venom of
beasts, or hurtful medicines, and also for all old and malignant ulcers.

Tertiana febris.
THe tertian fever, is either continual, and called Tertiana continua: Galenus
de different. febrium lib. 2.
or else hath intermission, and is named Tertiana intermittens. (Lanfranke
calls it Interpolata,) which is double. That is Tertiana pura, uel
exquisita: tertiana notha, sieve spuria. Exquisita tertiana intermittes, is
caused of yelow coler, dilated by the sensible parts of the body, and kepeth
her own pure and sincere nature, and chances to young choleryke persons, in
Summer, or in whotte and dry regions: inuadynge with a vehement rigour,
(wherein it differs from Febre ardent,) like the pryckynge of nedles (and
therein differs from a quartain) which endures not lunge: De tamoribus
praeter natura De art curatina. lib. ^.
but soon follows vehement heate, and much sweat. This fever endures not
above seven Paroxysmes, neither do any of the exceed the space of twelve
hours, Tertiana notha intermittens, is made for the most part, when choler is
mixed with phlegm, either gross or thin, sometimes though rarely, with
melacholie, which passes oft, both in number space of time, the paroxysmes
above said. But not so vehement, neither do the signs of digestion so soon
appear. For Tertiana continua resort to Cau^on.

Thapsia.
(...), Dioscor. lib. 4 Ideo aliquibus ^erula syluestris nominatur
so called (says Dioscorides) because it was first found in the Isle
Thapso, is an herb like to Ferula, in his whole nature, having a sclenderer
stalk, with leues like fenel. And on every branch a spokye top like to
Dylle, with yellow flowers, and a sede like Ferula, but brother somewhat, and
less: having also a long (...), black without, and white within: sharp also,
and covered with a thick rynde. The rynde and the milky juice thereof, do
purge choler, but is perylous to take without great prouydence. It is by the
testimony of Galen, De sympto. causis. lib. 6.
of a sharpe, and a mighty heatyng faculty, joined with moisture: And therefore
draws violently from the depth, and that which it draws it digests. The
juice hereof, (which is by art gathered from the root) is so vehement sharpe,
that the very breathe of the same, makes the face and other naked parts of
the that gather it, to swell excedyngly, and to rise in pustules.

Thymum.
THymum or Thymus, is also called in greek (...), which name also it hath
almost in every language, though not the same thing every where: for
Theophrastus and Plinie, Thymum albu Thymum Creticum.
mencioneth two kinds, calling them Album nigrum, as also Dioscorides doth,
though not where he describes Thymum creticum, that is Thyme of Candy, which
is called (...), Thymos Cephalotos.
Hoc est Thymum capitatum: but in his chapiter of Epithymum, which he
affirms to come, a Thymo duriore satureiae simili, that is of a harder Thyme,
like to Sauerie: Serpyllum hortense.
which I take to be our Thyme, and is of the odor that it hath like to
Serpyllum, called Serpyllum hortense. Thymu says Galen, De symp. li. 6.
cutteth and heats vehemently, and therefore Vrinam menses prouocat, foetumque
potum euellit. It purges the bowels, and joins with other medicines
attractiues, prepared for the breast and the lunges.

Thus.
Licence (called in Greek (...)) as well as the tree, Libanotos.
whereof it comes (called (...), Libanos.
) is called in Latyne Thus: Dioscor. lib. 1.
and grows in Arabia. Hereof Dioscorides makes four sorts. Libanos
stagonias, quasi (...) licidiare.
The best says he, is Thus masculinum, of his own nature round like a
drop, and therefore called (...), white, vndeuisyble, fat within when it is
broken, and burns speedily: hereof at Olibanu. That of India is of swarte and
reddishe colour, and is made round by industry: as first by cutting it in
square pieces, then turning it in vessels till it wax round, Syagrum.
but in time it wareth yelowe: Libanos atomos, quasi sectiones nullas
ostendens.
and this they call (...), or Syagrum. The second place hath Thus arabicu,
growing in Smilo: which some call Copiscum, of colour dark yellow. An other
kind there is, Thus Copiscu Thus amomite Cortex Thuris
called (...), of some Candidum, which cleaves to the fyngers, as doth
masticke.

Cortex thuris, which is the rynde of the Incense tree, is here also to be
remembered: which ought to be new, thick, fatty, sweet smelling, not rough,
without skins. Hereof also comes Manna thuris or Manna graecorum, having
also says Galen, some of the rynde therewith, whereof in his place. Thus
heats (says Galen) in the second degree, dries in the first, De symp. li.
7.
and hath some adstriction. The rynde dries in the second degree, and binds
evidently. It is of grosser parts then Thure, having little sharpnes: and
therefore is used for the griefs of the stomach, spitting of blood, flux of
the belly, and Dysenteria. Thus mollifies, swageth peyne, cococteth, and
bredeth quitture. But that in temperate natures: for in moyste bodies it
engenders flesh. It puts away the dymnesse of syghte, purges, fills,
and heals, the ulcers of the eyes, and all other hollow ulcers: g^ueth
bloody wounds, and stays all eruptions of blood.

Thiria.
(...) is a disease of the head, Ophiasis uel de mededi methodo.
and hath says Fuchsius (in his first book De medendis morbis) no latin name,
but is called of the Arabians and barbarous phisiciens Tyria. By the which
word they understand all serpents, but chiefly the Viper: which therefore I
think to come of this greek word (...), and so of that kind of leprosy,
which is among that sort called Theriasis, as above at Serpigo.

Even as plants says Galen are of two causes vitiate, De methodo medendi.
li. 14
namely some by the utter lack of nuryshyng juice, De com. med. secun. loc.
li. 1.
dried withered: other by the same contrary to their own natures, are infected:
so are the hears through the utter defect of their slymie nutritiue juice,
and also by the same vitiate corrupted. For through the utter lack thereof
comes Caluities, but of the same corrupted, rises (...), and (...). De
definitionibus.
And as in Alopecia the falling of the hear is circulare, changing into a
golden colour or like the fox, (whereof it hath that name, (...) quide uulpes
est: so in Ophiasi, yt affected part of the head is piled, Alopex.
after the manner of Serpents, receiving thereof also his name: Ophis enim
serpens est.

Tragacantha.
(...), Dioscor. lib. 3.
is a bright shining gum, lean, light, sincere, and swetishe: which runs
out of the root of a pricky shrubbe, called also Tragacantha. whose root is
broad, woody, stiff in the top of the turf: From the which do strong lowe
branches spread very broad: whereon do grow many small thin leaves, hydinge
under them selves white, stiff, and straight thorns. The gum, which we
call commonly Dragagantum, stops the poores of the skin, as gum doth:
whose most use hath been in medicines for the eyes, for the cough, for
horsenes, roughnes of the pypes and yawes, and other distillations: against
peyne of the reins, and corrosions of the bladder.

Triticum.
Wheat called in Greek (...), Pyros.
is after Galen, of fyrme nurishment, De (...) uictus ratione
and bredeth a juice gross and tough, and therefore is Alica (which also
nurisheth strongly) forbidden in them that are apt to breed the stone, or to
have obstructions in the liver: exterially used, De sy^p. li. ^.
it heats in the first degree, but neither can it dry nor moist manifestly.
Whatsoever is made of Amylum, is then it, both colder and drier. The Cataplasma
that is made with bread, digests more the with wheat, by reason of the salt
and leven: which hath power to draw up and digest, things that lye deep.

Turbith.
TVrbith is esteemed a barbarous name, give to a root, which is called
Turpetum, whereof among all men, there is no small ambiguity, nor a few
opinions. For Syluius and Manardus, do make thereof a destinction, in.iiii.
sorts, which I thought good thus to gather.

Turbith sieve Turpetum. The one, which some call Turbith Dioscoridis. Radix
pityusae, which hath the leaves of Pinus.
Serapionis. i. Radix Tripolii Dioscoridis.
Vulgar. i. Radix Tithymali foeminae sieve myrtites, so called because it hath
leaves like to Myrtus. Or Radix Alipi, after Matthiolus under the autorities of
Actuarius, who calls it Turpetum album.
Mesuae. Is the root of an herb, whose leaves are like Ferula: whereof they
dare not give sentence. Howbeit Brasauolus judges it the root of Tithymali
myrs^ites but that would Matthiolus refute: who seems by reasons to prove that
Turbith Mesuae Actuarii is none other thing then the root of Alipiae. And so
of our common Turpetum.


Wherefore knowing that there are at this day, not a few diligent men in this
kind of study: namely in the searching out of such unknown symples, the
certeintie of things so uncertain and doubtful: (least they should want a
just occasion, to examine such conditions of plants or roots, as shall in
anywyse be like to any of these.) I have set here (for the sakes chiefly of the
meanly learned) the several descriptions of the kinds of Turbith here
mecioned: Namly such as have not before in the Englyshe tongue been published.
For Pytiusa and Tithymalus myrtites, are of D. Turner right well described.
Which therefore I touche not.

Turbith Scrapionis sieve Tripolium, Dioscor. lib. 4
Greece (...), grows by the sea sides, in places that are by the tides
washed, and by the ebbes left again: so that it grows neither in the sea,
nor on the dry ground: with a lefe like to Glastum, but thicker, and a stalk
like the Date tree, divided in the top. whose flowers (as men say,) do
thrice in one day change their colours: being white in the morning, purple
at noone, and crimson at night: whose rote is white, odoriferous, and whotte in
taste.

Of the which, two dragmes drunk in wine, draws out water and urine by the
belly, and is put into medicines that resist venym.

(...), Dioscor. lib. 4
in Latin Alypum or Alypia, is a bushy and reddish herb with sclender stalks
and thin leaves: having a soft thin flower, and of them plenty, a
sclender root like the root of Beta, full of sharpe juice, with seed like
the sedes of Epithymi: which purges black choler, if it be taken with an
equal portion of Epithymum, with salt and vinegar: but it doth a little
exulcerate the intraelles.

It grows in places nigh the sea, chiefly and most pletifully in Libya:
though much of it do also growels where.

Turbith says Mesues, is a mylky herb, having leaves like Ferula but less:
whereof there is Hortense and Syluestre, of the which also some is great, and
some little: white (also) yelowe, ash coloured or black. Praysinge that
which is Gummy, white, empty, and like a reed, with a plain and ashy rynde,
or as it wear baked under ashes, being meanly new and easy to be broken: but
that says he, which is not gummy, is weak and troubles the belly:
dyspraysing also the yelowe and the black, the gross and the lean.

The curled or wrynkled rynded also, which is as it were sinewy within when it
is broken, which is the wild. The old is weak: The new doth less trouble
and overturn the bowels. Some do adulterate it, by anointing the rynde
outwardly with melted oil: but being broken, it is not gummy within.

And where as the root of Thapsia is numbered among the sorts of Turbith:
which the Apothecaries think to be theyrs. Andreas Marinus, calls it
Turbith apulum, affirming it to be that which mesues calls Crassum. The
fraud whereof being at the last discovered, it was rejected put out of use:
for though it purge phlegm as doth the right Turbith, yet that doth it
violently, and with the great damage of the principal members. Whose faculties
you may farther read before under the propre title thereof.

Mesues of his Turbith says, it is whotte in the third degree, purges
meanly by attraction, raises wyndes, that overturn the stomach ad nauseam:
and dries, being purged from the thin excrementes thereof. Turbith cortected
draws out gross, tough, and putrefied phlegm, from the breast, the
stomach, and the sinews: Even from the joints and farthest parts.

Tutia.
TVtia or Tuthia, Pomph^lyx.
is called in Greek (...), for the which look in Sp^dio.

Verbena.
VErbena or Verbenaca, is of two kinds, described of Dioscorides in two
several chapiters, calling them both (...), Peristereon.
but the second (...), Hoc est sacram herbam: Hierabotane.
for whose virtues and larger description, Look farther in master Turners
herbal.

Vermes terrestres.
VErmes terreni, Lumbrici.
called also Lumbrici Intestina terrae, being drunk in passo, do provoke
urine, heal the iaudise, and drive away tertian fevers: bruised and laid to
cut synewes, they glewe them together merueylouslye, and are good for the
cramp. Being boiled ci^n adipe anserino, and poured in, they heal the peynes
of the ears: If they be boiled in oil, and put into the contrary ear, they
help the peyne of the teethe.

Vernix.
OUt of the Juniper tree sweateth certain tears, in the spring time chiefly:
and therefore called Vernix, quasi Vernus ros, being of the colour and smell of
frankincense: Which hardened by heate, becomes a gum. Which saith
Fuchsius, (the Arabians, not without a great confusion of names,) have called
Sandaracham, which says Serapio, is whotte and dry, harde, and somewhat
bitter: and is brought from the land of the Christians. And the Apothecaries
cal it Vernicem. Sandarache.
But far is it from (...) of the Grecians and Latines: which is a stone,
found says Plinie, in the mines of gold and silver.

Brasauolus says, that Sand^racha is nothing else but the red parts of
Auripigmentum, so made by the more natural boylyng: for there may a kind of
Sandaracha be made, by the artificial boylyng of Auripigmentum. And therefore
may the one, (namely Sandaracha,) be called Arsenicum rubrum, and the other
(that is Auripigmentum) Arsenicum Croceum.

Matthiolus also says, that Sandaracha and Auripigmentum, are both of one
kind and faculty, neither differ they in any thing, but only that the one,
(to wit Sandaracha) is more concocted in the bowels of the earth then the
other, which is Auripigmentum: and are therefore by the same reason in
subtilties of virtues, more excellent the one then the other.

Dioscorides (the surest ground herein) says, that Auripigmentum is found
in the same mines that Sandaracha is, alowyng that which is fyerie red, or
like to Cinnabar: plain, pure, brittle, and smelling like Sulphur.

It is given cum mulso, to them that spit rot phlegm. The smoke hereof is
taken in, against the old cough. Licked in with honey, it clears the voice:
and in pylles is given, to harde breathing. Unto which virtues, not only
Plinie, and other Latines do agree of the same: But also the Arabians, the
more to augment their error, of their gummy Sandarachae: two things both in
substance and nature, (as you see) most contrary.

Wherefore, when you shall among the Greek authors find Sandaracha, you must
understand the same that Dioscorides writes of, called before Arsenicum
rubrum: But if among the Arabian wryters, you must take Gummi iuniperi.

An other kind of artificial or adulterate Sandaracha there is, made of
Serussa burned in the fire, till it have changed his colour, and is called
Sandix: whereof Plinie makes mention.

Vernix out of the later wryters hath the faculty to stay the flux of blood
at the nose: if it be laid to the forehead, cum Candido oui. And taken with
the poulder of Frankincense, or the poulder thereof supped in a rear egg,
suppresses vomiting: and laid to, or taken with the same, firmeth the
laxatyue belly, defends the falling of destillacions, dygesteth the phlegm
in the bowels, and kills worms, and other living things in the same.
Mensium fluxus continet: being put in, it dries the moist holownesses of
fistules: And helps the ryftes, cones, or chappinges, of the hands and
feet.

Vinum.
Old wine hurts the synewes, and other wynes the senses: Dioscor. li. 4.
though they be in taste sweet. And therefore ought they to be ware thereof, that
feel weakness in any of their bowels: But being taken in small quatitie
according to strength and delayed, it is unhurtful. New wine infiateth, doth
hardly concocte, and breeds many vain dreams: and moves urine. That which
is of mean age, wants both the former faults: and therefore is used in the
diet, both of sick and whole. The white and thynne wine, is to the stomach
profitable, and easily dispersed into the members. Black wine is gross, hard
to concocte, nourishes flesh, and causes dronkennes. Yellow wine, as it
holds a middle colour: so hath it faculties mean between both. But when
health quaileth, or is crazed, the white wine hath most praise. Wynes also
differ in savour. For sweet wine as it consists of gross parts, so doth it
difficilly breath out of the body, inflateth the stomach, and troubles the
belly and bowels, as doth new wine: but moves dronkennes less, and is
most apt for the reins bladder. De methodo medendi. li. 3.
Tart wine doth more swiftly pass through by the vryne: but makes peyne in
the head, and bredeth dronkennes. De art curatiua. lib. 2.
Sharpe wine is for the digestyng of meates into the members, most commodious:
restreyneth the belly and other fluxes, c. Wine says Galen, gleweth together
holownesses, Oenon uel Inon.
and is a convenient medicine for all ulcers. The Greekes do call it (...).

Viola.
Viola, so writ symplie without an adiectiue, is always taken for the blew
or purple violet, called in Greek (...), Idest Viola nigra or purpurea: and of
some Viola muraria. Some hold that it is called (...), because the nymphs
called Ioniae, gave first the flower thereof unto Jupiter as a gyfte. Others
because when Jupiter had turned the Nymph Io into a cow, the earth gave furth
violet flowers, as a pasture or food for the same. But many other herbs there
are, that are called Violae, whereof here to speak wear as nedelesse as
superfluous. Mesues gives to violettes, coldness and moystnes in the first
degree. They are somniferous, purge choler, staye thyrst, and quench all
inflammations: and therefore are applied, for the burning heate of the mouth
of the stomach and the eyes.

Viride aes.
IS called also Aerugo, Aerugo rasilis uel rasa.
that is the rust of brass. Of this Dioscorides makes two kinds. The one is
called Aerugo rasa or rasilis, and is made says he, by covering a vessel of
most strong vinegar, with a cauldern or other like vessel, or with plates of
brass, so close that no air may pass between: which after the tenth day
being opened, that Aerugo that is, must be scraped or rubbed of, c. Otherwise
dyuersly. The other he calls Aeruginem scoletiam, and notes thereof two
sorts. Aerugo scoletia.
The one he calls Fossile, that is dug, for it is taken out of the earth:
The other Factitiam, which is made by beating or labouring the sharpest white
vinegar, Aerugo fossilis
in a brazen mortar, Aerugo factitia.
with a copper pestell, till it receive a thickness of filth: Then must it be
beaten together in the Sun in the canicular days, cum alumine rotunda, sale
fossili, uel marino, uel nitro, till it grow to a thickness, and receive the
colour of Aeruginis: and when it becomes like worms, Aerugo uermi cularis.
it must be kept. This therefore hath been called of some Vernicularis. A
fourth kind also of Aerugenis, says he, Aerugo aurificum.
is made by the goldsmythes, of the vryne of children, in a brazen mortar, with
a pestell of the same: where wherewith they soulder gold. Of the which kinds of
Aerugenis scoletiae, Fossilis is the best: next to that is Aerugo derasa: the
third place hath Factitia, which yet is most adstringent and bytinge. Aerugo
aurificum, answers to Aerugini rasae. Here may thou see good reader, the
difference between Aeruginem florem aeris, Aerugo.
which is in his place described. All the Aerugines, Flos aris.
do bind, extenuate, and heate. They amend the scars or blots of the
eyes, cause tears, stay creping and eating sores, and defend wounds from
inflammations. They purge filthy ulcers, cum cera oleo, they heal the same.
Put into fistules with Ammoniaco, in yt manner of a collyrie, they errode the
callous substance of them: and are profitable for the swellynges, De methodo
med. li. 3.
and excressentes of the gummes. The poulder of Aeruginis (says Galen) put
alone into ulcers, De comp. me. secund. genera lib. 2.. 4.
suffers them not to putrefy: but it brings pein, and biting, not a
little: gnaws, and makes inflammations.

Virulentia.
VIrulentia uulnera, uel ulcera, virulent or venomous woudes or ulcers: a uiro,
which is venom or poison.

Viticella.
THe herb vulgarly called Viticella, Bryonia.
is called in Greek (...), Psilothron.
in Latin La alba psilothrum, Ampelos leuce
and of the Apothecaries Brionia: in Englyshe white vine or brionie. The root
and the juice of Briony (says Mesues) purges the brain, the synewes, and
the breast, of rotten phlegm moves vryne, and opens the obstructions of ye
bowels. But he appoints the teperamet out of Dioscorides, (who yet leaves
all things without degree of temperament,) to heate and dry in the third
degree.

They use says Galen, De symp. li. 6.
to eat the branches thereof in the spring time, as a meat (for the
adstriction thereof,) acceptable for the stomach. But to that adstriction it is
sharpe, and somewhat bitter: and thereby moves vryne moderately. The root hath
a scouring, driyng, and moderat heating power: and therefore drunk, softneth
the harde spleen, and laid to cum ficubus, heals Psoram, lepram. c. It is
sometimes mixed with corrosive medicines.

Vitriolum Romanum.
DIoscorides writing of Chalcanthum, (which the Greeks call (...), the Arabians
Zeg, the Latines Vitriolum, because it shines like glass,) and Atramentum
sutorium, ad atro colore: because it was used to dye leather black,) saith that
in kind it is but one thing: but deuydeth it into three differences. As one,
which congeileth of certain humores, gathered together drop by drop into
certain holes of the earth: and therefore is called (...), hoc est
Stillatitium. An other is made by a simple reason in caves, being after poured
out into certain diches that are made holowe: Chalcanthum.
which is properly called (...), Id est Concretitiu. The third is called
Coctile, Stalacticon.
and is wont to be made in Spain: Pecton.
being most weak and unprofitable. But among the late wryters there is not a
little confusion of names therein. For Matthiolus speaking of the time present,
says, that of Chalcanthum there are two kinds in Hetruria. The one growing
of it self in the earth by concretion, and is vulgarly called Coppa rosa.
Coppar osa.
The other is arteficiall: whose chiefest v^e is for dyers. which is either
the better or the worse, as well for the dispositions of regions and celestial
climates, as for the matter whereof it is made: But it is proved that Vitriolum
Romanum, excells the rest of the arteficall kinds, though it be of weaker
or vnperfecter colour. The second place hath Cyprium, but was of the
auncientes praised for the best. That which is brought from Germanie, is
weaker then any that is in Italy: for that it hath blew colour, it deceyueth
many.

Among the Apothecaries there are two kinds: namely Vitriolum symply so
called, (which says Brasauolus, some have falsely called Cholcothar,) and
Vitriolum Romanum: (which is saith he, Antiquorum misy.) And is harde, like
unto gould, shining like the stars, and being broken, glisters as with
golden sparks: All the which notes he affirms exactly to agree with Vitriolo
Romano of Germanie.

And for the better understanding of his mind therein, take these notes, as he
for the same reason, drew and gave forth the same.

Vitriolum, Atramentum, and the Arabike word Zeg, are says he, common or
general names, to all the sorts thereof as they follow.

(...) Antiquorum. i. Zeg rubeum Serapionis. Sorry.
(...) Antiquorum, Chalcitis.
i. Colcothar Serapionis. For ye late wryters err saith he that cal Vitriolum
Vstum Colcothar, which ought rather to have ben called Chalcitis.
(...). i. Zeg uiride, Misy.
Vitriolum Romanum. But out of Germanie says he there is brought romain
vitriole which is more harde of yelowe colour.
(...). i. Bities, Melanteria.
atramentum metallicum. Chalcanthum, atramentum Sutorium, Vitriolum.
Hereunto it is to be noted, that Chalcanthu doth by legthe of time, or by
present burning the same, degenerate into Chalcitin: which yet is such as
being disolued in water, will again become Chalcanthum. And these names says
he, do so mutually answer to them selves, that hereby thou can not err.

Howe be it, (as Matthiolus most truly says) Calcitis Mysy Sorry, have ben
long unknown, neither is there almost any that can say that he hath scene those
very things: yet doth the said Matthiolus report, that it chanced him,
(after long diligent search but al in vain,) to come at the last to the sight
of them, by the means of a certain Apothecary: Whose diligence God grant
ours to follow. They were found says he, about Trident.

But in that Musa Brasauolus, affirms that kind of Chalcanthum, which is
called Romanu, to be the true Misy, seems to stand says he, But note what
is said before of vitrioleum of Germanie.
both against truth and reason: both because Vitriolum Romanum, is neither of
a golden colour, nor glisters as with sparks when it is broken, but is more
like the substance of glass: And also that Misy is no medicine arteficiall,
but is without art made in the bowels of the earth.

Chalcanthum hath power to bind, to heate, and to induce eschares. Latas
uentris tineas necat, drachmae ponder deuoratum, aut cum mell linctum, and
moves vomit. Being drunk with water, it helps against the venom of
Musheroms. It purges the head being watered, dropped into ye nostrils with
woulle.

Of Chalcanthum, that is esteemed best which is blew, rare, fast, and
shining: such is Stillatitium, called of some Lonchoton. The next is
Concretitium, but the arteficiall is apter for dyers, to make blew colours
with, then the rest: but for the use of medicine weaker.

Vlceratina medicamina.
OR exulceratiua medicamina, are such medicines as by Corrosion do excoriate
or exulcerate: and comes of Vlcerare, or exulcerare, to blister or make
ulcers.

Vlcus.
GAlen in his fourth book De methodo medendi, saith: Est itaque morborum
genus, diuortium continui uocatum. Quod quidem in carnosa part, ulcus: in osse
fractura: in neruo conuulsio appellatur. c.

That is. There is one kind of diseases, called the sundryng of unity. which
in a fleshie part, is called Vlcus, In the bone Fractura, and in the synewe,
conuulsio. c. Whereunto quitture is always incident: and makes an exact
distinction, between it and Vulnus. More of it, and the deuisions thereof, you
may see in master Gales institution. It is called in Greek (...), Elcos.
whereof comes (...), Hoc est lethale, Elcos aniaton.
seu insanabile ulcus, a mortal or uncurable ulcer.

Vmbilicus veneris.
Look for it at Cotyledon.

Vndimia.
OR Ydema, Ydema.
or after others Zimia, but more rightly Oedema, Oedema.
is after Guido, and diverse others of that age, of.ii. sorts: natural and
unnatural: the natural caused of natural phlegm, or thinner then the same.
The unnatural is none other wise made, but either by the admirtio of other
humores: as choler, phlegm, c. Or by their affects in ye same, as by heating
driyng. c. Loke more at Oedema

Vngula.
OR Vnguis in oculo, is that which we call the web in the eye: Vnguis.
Which grows says Galen, to the pannycle that covers the eye outwardly,
De symptomatii causis. lib. 1
Vsque ad Iridis coronam, called agnata, or coh^rens. Which pannycle (saith
he) being compased with inflammation, De trem. palpi. con. rigore.
may by accidens impedyte the sight of the eye: but Chymosis and Vnguis, do
by a chief and principal reason, hyde and darken the pupil: even as the
great unnatural tumores of the cheake. Chymosis.


Vulnus.
IS proprelie Plaga nova uel sanguinea, in English, a new and bloody wound,
or not ^anious: For then is it no longer a wound, as before under the titles
Plaga ulcus.

Zingiber.
OR Gingiber, in Greek (...), hath of an old opinio been judged the root of
pepper: but that doth Pliny deny. And Dioscorides describes ginger in a
several chapiter, after he hath spoken of pepper, saiynge. Gingiberis, is a
plant of his own kind, growing in Arabia Trogladytica, which they use grene
for many things, as we do Ruta, mixing it with their first meates and
drynkes. The roots of this are little, Cyperus.
like the roots of Cyperus, white, and odoriferus, and in taste like pepper:
they ought to be chosen that are without woodwormes. They are kept with salt,
because they will otherwise soon putrefy: and are brought into Italie, in
earthen vessels. Ginger is convenient in meates and in sauces, having healing
and concoctiue power. It gently mollifies the belly, is vtile for the
stomach, And efficacious for the dymnesse, or dullness of sight. It is put in
medicines against venym, and answers in sum, to the virtues of pepper.
Hitherto Dioscorides.

Galen says it heats, De sym. lib. 6.
but not at the first as pepper, therefore is to be esteemed of subtler parts:
and seems to retain in it self a certain gross and vnlaboured humidity,
Piper longum.
like Piperi longo: And therefore doth the heate continue longer, that is made
by ginger or lunge pepper, then of the white, or black. They that have seen
Ginger in India, (saith Ruellius,) affirm it to have a creping root, with
knots and joints: From the which, and from the stalk, comes often new
roots, giving twice or thryse in the year leaves like a reed, but not so
long: and that it resembles wholly Gramen, neither is there any thing in that
region more common.

FINIS,
THough envy me accuse,
In such as will disdain:
It can not make me muse,
nor nothing vex my brain.
For they that do misuse,
Their tongues in such a case:
Will styll them selves abuse,
In running of that race.
But reason is mine aid,
To take my cause in hand:
And I nothing afraid,
With her in place to stand.
Having my hope so stayde,
That those that list to rail,
Wylbe right sore dismayed,
When reason shall prevail.
For truth by reason strong,
Will have the upper hand:
When envy vile and wrong,
shall fayntly flee the land.
And truth hath always been,
A daughter unto time:
Which as it hath been seen,
Detecteth every crime.

IOHN HALLE CHIRVRGIEN,
unto the yonge students of Chirurgerie, and to all the loving readers sends
greting, beginning first with this sentence of the diuyne phylosophier
Socrates.
He that will seek, and knows not
Howe much in more or less,
Can never tell when he doth find,
An aid for his distress.

Therefore Galen, the Prince of phisiciens, in the.vi. book of his therapeulike
methode affirms, that Chirurgiens being ignorant of the Anatomy, may err in
many things, specially in their incisions. For (saith he) if they knew what
unity and combination the members of the body have one with an other, howe
they proceed: If hurt happen unto the, they might perceive whether the nerues,
or other mebers having proper office or nedfull action be cut or not: and so to
judge truly of their work, and to be certain in their incisions.

To the confirmation of which sentence, Henricus de Ermunda villa, compares
the chirurgien ignorant in Anatomy, to a blind ma which would hew a piece of
timber: For as a blind man, that heweth on a log, knows not howe much he
should hew thereof, nor in what manner, (and therefore commonly erreth, in hewyng
more or less then he ought to do:) so likewise doth the chyrurgien that
works on the body of ma, not knowing the Anatomy. And that it is of
necessity, the chirurgien to know the Anatomy, the said Henry approves by
an evident argument: for every workman (says he) should know the subject of
his work. But the subject of chirurgerie is the body of man, which therefore
ought to be known of the chirurgien. Which knowledge of mans body or any part
thereof, can no wayse be attained but by Anatomy.

Anatome so called of the grecians is saith Carolus Stephanus, the dissection
of man his body, by reason and judgment, administered as as well in the simple
parts as in the copounde, to the perfect knowledge of them. For truly, the
perfect knowledge of parts doth chiefly consiste in indagacion or diligent
exquisition, of substance, quantity, form, number, situation and connexion.

The utility of Anatomye, (as the said author defines) is, that those
incommodities and dangers, whereunto the body is often subject, may be the more
easily preueted or defended. The which incommodities do run in divers parts
and offyces of the body, and also may greatly offend: For there are very few
members (or rather none) that are formed unto no use, or that do not exercise
their gyfte, either in their own office or in helping some other action.

And in the proheme of his second book, vehemently praising the utility
thereof, he says: for what in comparison, is more to be wished for then the
absolute knowledge of Anatomye? What is more excellent? what to the physicien
more profitable? What to the chyrurgien more worthy? The which who so endeavour
to get and the same obtain, are only worthily called physiciens and
chyrurgiens: neither is there ought that may more commend the phisicien or
chyrurgien, then the same Anatomy. Which study who so sets at nought, I
know not what in such men and their arts may be praised. For when the
minds delectation is coveted, or perfection and an absolute art sought for:
what doth so much delight or move ingenious wits, as the diligent editions,
difficultly searched out of our founders, in the procreation of this Micro
cosmos or little world? and surely Medicine without Anatomy, shall be neither
art nor any thing else.

This being true, as I think no learned or reasonable man will deny, howe
untruly do (in these our days) a great number bear the names of physike and
chyrurgerie: or howe ill deserve they to be called by those honourable names,
(being not only ignorant in the Anatomy them selves, but also disdainfully
contempne reprove, both the thing it self, and all such as travel there is,
either to profit them selves or others) let wise men judge.

These things considered, it may seem necessary, that the neglygent minds of
such, as little esteem this delectable fountain or sweet well spring of
their profession, be spurred forward unto understanding by some compendious
treatise, that may farther there travel, or cause them at the least (their
dull slouthfulnes set a part,) to proceed forward, not turning backward nor
loyteryng by the way, till they have scaled the forte of perfection, and won
the city of science.

But if I shall at this time determine a treatise of so high a profession, of
which also so many noble clerks have written before, which shall be pervsed
of so many at this present, ye judged also of those that are to come: howe
shall my hands refrain from fearful shaking, or my face from bashful
blushynges: since my simple and indigested frase, must show it self before so
many excellent, even such whose intellection will them lead my rudnes to
controwle. Which I fear much the rather may chance, because that of some
one thing many times divers authers make divers difinitions: for divers me have
divers minds, and diversity of minds, causes dyuersitie and variety in
opinions: which happens not only in this profession, but also in all
sciences, yea and most of all (which is lamentable) among the diuynes or
teachers of christen theology.

Yet not withstanding I doubt not, but whosoever shall indifferently behold
this simple treatise without parcialitie, conferring the same with the most
accepted authors, they shall find the same both sounding with truth and
reason.

But truly the malice of men so excedyngly increases, that no man no not the
best learned, (much less I,) can do ought without reproach and slander: yea
and that chiefly by men of his own profession. Oh how hateful and vile a
matter is this, and a plain demonstration of envy, when one man of science
shall be asked by a stranger. what opinion he hath in an other man of science
that he knows, he shall answer, he is a good herbarian, he knows well
herbs: or he is good at the Anatomy. I know nothing else of him. They that are
perfect in nothing them selves, have ever in readynes such disdeynfull
reproach to hyde their own ignorance: as though a man, being excellent in any
other thing, it proved him to be ignorant in all other: Which thing if it did
prove I might thus answer. It is better to be perfect in some one thing, then
to meddle with many things being perfect in none. And yet as it is evident to
prove, it argues no such thing but rather the contrary: for he whose
capacity hath atayned, to the perfect knowledge of any one part of science, is
the better to be hoped in that he shall proceed to the pure sincerite of all
the rest. For the philosopher compares the wit of man unto Iron: for as
Iron, the more it is scoured the brighter it is: so the wit of man, the more
it is used or occupied, is alwayse the finer and the better.

Certainly the remembrance of such disdainful obiectios, (when I had already
finyshed this thing) made me in doubt to put forth this work: but that my
friends with whom I conferred my doings, earnestly persuaded me not to regard
the rage of envy, so lunge as truth would bear out it self, while time
consumed both selander and also envy, the author of all reproach: and that I
should in no case cease to do that should profit many, for the euell of a
few: which think it an high point of knowledge, to munte and speak euell
of the doings of all other, while they them selves do nothing wherewith to
profit any.

Saying therefore I shall proceed in this simple work, I think it good first to
declare what names the learned Anatomistes have given to the body of ma. For
though divers have used the bodies of beasts for Anatomies, yet saying that
the body of man is the subject of our work, we (setting a side all other)
will treat only of it. Which is called in Greek Mycro cosmos, in Laun Minor
mundus, in Englyshe a little world: because in the same (even as in the frame
of the great world) so many wonders may be seen of natures works, to the
high honour and glory of almighty God.

May it not be proved, that the brain (like unto the heavens,) hangs
without any manner of staye or prop, to hold up the same? nay, It is so
evident, that every learned Anatomiste writes of the same, as a thing not to
be doubted of: and therefore judge the same to have a certain likeness with the
heavenly nature. And as the world hath two notable lights to govern the same,
namely the Son and the Moon: so hath the body of man, planred likewise in
the highest place two lights, called eyes: which are the lights of the
body, as the Son and the Moon are the lights of the world. And it is also
written of some doctors, that the brain hath.vii. concauites, being
instruments of the wits: which answer unto the.vii. spheres of the
planetes. And to be brief, it is a world ^o behold, and a wonderful wonder
to think, that as great merueyles may be seen, wrought by God in nature in
this little world man his body, as there is to be considered in any thing in the
vnyuersall great world, above or benethe at any time.

Secondly, it is called a common weal, for as much as there is therein
conseyned as it were a ryghteous regiment, between a prince and this subjects:
as for example. Let us call the heart of ma a king, the brain and the liver
the chief governors under him, the stomach and the guts, with other
aperteinyng to nutrymente, the officers of his court, and all the members
universally his subjects. And then let us see, if any man can deuyse any
necessary instrument of a common weal, needful for the wealth of the same,
from the highest to the lowest, that the like shall not be found in the body
of man: as it is so well known, to all those that travel in the knowledge of
Anatomy, that I need not here much thereof to write. Can it be perceived that
the hand or the foot, or any part of them or such like (which we may lyken to
the labourers, or as some call them vile mebers of a common weal,) at any time
to resist or rebel against the heart their sovereign lord, or any other
officer under him their superiors? no truly. The body of man is a common weal
without rebellion: the king so loving his subjects, and the subjects so
loving their king, that the one is ever ready to minister unto the other all
things needful: as if the heart by any occasion sustain damage, as we may
see in the disease called Sincope, or swoundyng. At such a time I say the
face, the hands, and the fete, are found cold and without feeling, strength
or life: and what proves it, but that as loving and obedient subjects, they
think nothing their own whereof the heart hath need, which is their lord and
governor? yea they utterly depryue the selves of altogether, to serve and
please their lord. Immediately as the swoundyng cease, the blood resorts to
the face, she hands and the feet are warm again: as it were benefits done,
rendered again with thanks and joy. And is not such a lord and king
worthy of good subjects, that for the help of one of the least of them, will
spend all that he hath, so long as lyte endures? as if a meber be hurt,
whereby any vein or artery is cut, the blood or spirit will issue in such
wise that it will not cease coming thither so lunge as any is let, if it be
not in time prevented. Oh kind and gentle governor, oh well willing and
obedient subjects.

Thirdly, the body of man is called in greek Anthropos, in latin, by
interpretation Arbor euersa, as we might say in English, a tree turned upside
down. For as a tree hath his root in the earth, growing with his body and
branches from the earth up towards the heavens: so contrariwyse, man hath his
root (which is the head) upward towards the heavens, all other parts
descending downwards to the earth: which stands by good reason, that for this
cause man of al otherthinges under heaven should be most excellent, by the use
of reason received of the soul (and of the same immortality) most like unto
god.

Considering therefore that the body of man is so precious, it should seem that
the science that serves to keep the same in health, or to restore health
being lost to the same, should be a thing of no small value, but rather of
great regard. Therefore as I judge, they err not that esteem the medicinal
art next unto divinity: for as much as diuynitie is the mean whereby the
soul is saved, surgery the mean to save the body: which is next in value
unto the soul. Wherefore as they which little esteem that art, (whereof the
office is so precious) seem very vnwyse, and to want utterly the use of
reason: so is it a great enormity for any to enterprise to use that art, not
able to coprehende the knowledge of the same.

For the which cause, that I might partly help young students, (as I am one
my self) to the ataynyng of some perfection, I have here gathered a little
work, conteynyng three short treatyses of the Anatomy or dissection of the
parts of man his body. Wherein I will not he so curious, as to take upon me the
precise numberyng of every small and difficult part, nor to be exquisite in
the dyuersitie of names: but only showing such number and names briefly, as
serve most to the commodities of the chyrurgiens intelection, with an order of
conducible notes, howe to use our handy work of medicine, (called in greek
Chirurgia) upon the body of man or any part thereof: whether it be ^ncisions,
cauterizations, bloudlettyng called phlebotomy, or ventosing called also
cuppyng or boxyng, scarification, or opening of apostemes on what part of the
body so ever it be, that none error be committed in the same. For of the
contrary, as of the vncunnyng doings of any of these, comes divers dangers,
as the deprivation and loss, both of members and life. And (as it may
evidently appear) for that cause was the cutting out of dead bodies first put
in use: and the large volumes written thereof by ancient authors, declare their
intent to be chiefly for that thing. So that as Guido affirms, Anatomy is.ij.
ways to be learned, The first and best by cutting of dead bodies: The second
by doctrine written in books.

Of this later manner, we shall by the grace of God in this short treatise say
a little, as occasion serves, and as the smalnes of the volume will give me
leave. Being thereto somewhat encouraged, by the example of good master U^carie,
late sargeante chyrurgien to the que^nes highness: Who was the first that ever
wrote a treatise of Anatomy in Englyshe, (to the profit of his brethren
chirurgiens, and the help of young students,) as far as I can learn.
Wherein I have omytted narracion by tables or painting out of pyctures: thinking
it more profitable for learners, to exercise the cutting out of bodies them
selves, then to behold the grauyng or painting of others. For Galen says in
his second book of the use of parts, that whosoever will be a diligent
beholder of the works of nature: It behooves him not to believe only books of
Anatomy, but rather his own proper eyes.

Notwithstanding if hereafter it shall seem good to my friends, that I I^erate
this work with augmentations: I will surely not refuse to do whatsoever
shall be thought profitable to the common weal, and commodious to the students
in this art. Wherein I desire the studious readers not to judge of me, that I
trust ever ye more to mine own judgements, because I have so boldly done this
thing, but rather that as I affirm all that I allege by authority, so would
I gladly be taught where I make any fault, of those ye are my betters. For I
esteem not my head so good, neither think I it so clear and void of error,
that I should in this work be so exquisite as to satisfy all men in their
variable judgements: but verily thinking my self faint of perfection, desiring
in my heart that the faults of this my work, may cause some man of charity
to set forth a more excellent work, to dash this out of name and
countenance: so that I might thereby be instructed of that which I lunge most
for, earnestly desire, and thirst to learn.

If this my simple work may give that occasion, at the lest I shall heartily
rejoice therein: for though I be imperfect, yet if mine vnperfectnes may be a
cause of perfection, both unto my self and other: it were as I suppose a good
chase. For (as ye divines interpret) the vnbelefe of Thomas, was a great help
to the faith of us all that come after: for because of his vnfaythfulnes
Christ showed him self, his precious wounds also, after his resurection:
which caused not only Thomas to believe vnfaynedly, but us all to be put out of
doubt acertayned of the glorious resurection of our mercy seat Christ Jesus.
Whom I most heartily beseech to keep you most gentle Readers, that wytsafe me
your good will and favourable report. And to send both unto you and me,
(through the shining beams of his eternal grace,) A bright, clear, and
frutefull understanding of that which we most earnestly covet to learn.
Amen. ()

The first treatise OF ANATOMY, WHICH brieflye shows the natures numbers
and names of all the simple members, with the diuersyties of their uses and
vtilities, whether they been Spermatike or Sanguyne, and conteyneth xiiii.
Chapiters.
The Argument of the first treatise.
FOr as much as no man is perfect in the composition of any thing, that is
ignorant in the simple parts thereof: it is necessary that I declare first,
the knowledge that I have collected of experience, Simple mebers.
and out of good Authors, concerning the simple members of man no his body,
Consimiliaria membra.
before that I speak of the anatomye in general. These are called simple
members, or consimiliares: The nerve, ye vain and the artery are also organ^ca
membra Galen. lib. 19. Vtilit.
Bones, Gristles, Lygaments, Synewes, Chords, Muscles, Panicles, Arteryes,
Ueynes, Flesh, Fat, and the Skin, beside the hears, and the nails. Which
although, some have called members, are not members in dede, but rather the
superfluities of mebers: As I intende to declare in this work, thorough the
permission of God, for whose help and grace it is needful that I pray, that
in these.iii. little treatyces I dissente not from the truth.

Of the bones. The first Chapter.
Wherefore after the example of good buylders, (who begin at the foundation
ascendyng upwards) I will begin at the bones, (which are the foundations
whereon all other members are supported and borne) and so proceed outward in
order to the rest. (...). Sicca anatome cadauer assiccatum.
The doctrine of bones observed in anatomye is called of Galen Osteologia and
Osteotome. The whole frame whereof being dried and reserved to anatomye, is
cauled Sccletos in Latin Cadauer assiccatum and vulgarlye Sicca anatome.

The bones then called in Greek Ostea, (...). i. Os.
and in Latin Ossa are simple members, similare, spermatyke, cold and dry of
complexion, insensible and inflexible, that is, without feeling, and not able
to be bowed. Of bones there are many and diverse in mans body, as well
concerning their number as their form or figure, and that because of the
need or necessity of their divers variable offices, which they have in the
body: their connexions and ioyninges together, being also diverse, have divers
names accordingly. Which ioynynges are divided, First into.ii. special
sorres. (...) Articulatio.
The first is called in Greek Arthrosis and in Latin Articulatio, which is the
most open and evident manner of Joining. (...) Vnio naturalis
The second, which the Greeks call Symphisin, is named in Latin Vnio
naturalis, and in Englyshe a natural union, which is a more hid, and
obscure ioyninge.

The first manner called articulation is also farther divided: first into two
sorts, as a privy or hid connexion (such as are scene in the bones of the
sculle) called in Greek Synarthrosis, (...) Coarticulatio.
and in Latin Coarticulatie: and a plain conspieuous manner, as in the arms
and hyppes, called in Greek Diarthrosis and in Latyne Dearticulatio. (...),
Dearticulatio
This dearticulation is farther of the Greeks divided into.iii. manners, as
Enarthrosis, Arthrodi^ and Gyng^ismos. (...).
Enarthrosis is when the large holownes of one bone receives the fullnes of an
others eminence, (...)
as in the hippes. Arthrodia is when ye shalowe holowne^ of one is moderatlye
aperynge upward, the headde of the other depressed down into it: as ye se
between the spondilles, and the rybbes. Gynglismos is when they so Join, as it
seems they enter mutuallye one in to an other, as the spondylles one to an
other, also the shoulder, the cubyte, and the mydle Joyntes of the fyngers.

Coarticulation is also triplie divided, (...). i. Sutura ^
as Sutura, Comphosis Hormonia* Sutura is when bones join like a seam Sewed
in most evident conspicuous manner, which in the head may diversely be scene.
Comphosis is when bones are infixed one to an other as are ye teeth in the iaw
bones. (...) ^
Harmonia called also Comssura is a joining by a simple line with out
indetinges, as in the Chin, the Share, some bones of the head. Comssura.
But note here that chirurgiens comonlie call al seames in the head comissures:
which common manner I also have observed in my general anatomy, lest yt
otherwise I should of the most part of readers not be understanded.

The second special manner called Symphysis hath also.ii. differeces: (...)
as in soft bones, which excrescentlie or musheru like join simply together:
in harde bones which by somewhat coming between, are so by nature united
coioyned, that they cleave together. this later manner is of iii. sorts, (...),
called of the Greeks Synchondrosis, Synneurosis, Syssarcolis. Synchondrosis
is, when grystles beneficially enter between the, as in the wrest diverse other
parts. (...)
Synneurosis is, where sinews helpingly go between the bones, Syssarcolis (so
called of Galen) is when by the help of flesh going between bones are joined
together. And as bones have variable names according to their places forms
offices, Ceruix (...) Collum, Capita Nodi.
likewise their ioyninges: so have their parts formably also. As the sclender
processes or forth goynges of bones are called in Latin Ceruices colla as we
may say the necks of bones, (...) i. Tuberculu.
whose extremes being blunt and round, are called Capita Nodi, (...) Apex
alic^ius rei.
Condili, the headdes or knots of bones: and such is the thigh bone, where
it enters the share bone. But yt which ends in a pointed process without a
round head, doth also cease to be called Ceruix, (...), id est Pixis.
and is called in Greek ^orone or Coronon, the crown or top of a bone.

The holownes of a bone (receiving the head of an other) being large and deep,
Acetabulum a^que o^e cauum.
is called in Greek Cotyle, in ^atyne Acetabulum, and vulgarly Pixis, in
English, the bore or cup of the joint. But such a holownes as is more
superficial and shalowe is called of the Greeks Gl^ne, (...)
of the likeness it with the bosom of the eye, which is the holowe entrance
towards the eye.

The number of bones in man body, after Auicen. are. 24 8. but other which
more precisely number the bones in the hands feet, (...). Os sesaminu uel
sesamiaeu.
cauled Sesamina or Sesamiae^ossa, with diverse other acompte them to be. 370.
and I find reasonable causes, why that the bones are so diverse, and many in
number: namely that one member may move, and remove without an other. I
mean that an other be not forced to move with it: Which otherwise could not
be, if there were not diverse bones. Secondlie that some (having their form or
figure for that use) might defend, as the walls of a strong defenced forte,
the principal members: and those are the bones of the head, and the breast.
Thirdly, that some should as foundacions bear up and sustain all the rest:
and those are the bones of the rydge (called in Latyne Spina, (...). i. Spina,
Sentis, uel Aculeus, Vertebra
in Greek Acantha, and particularly Vertebra, in English Spondilles or
turning joints) and also those of the legs. And finallye, that some may
fulfylle and strengthen holowe places, as do the bones of the hands and fete.

Of the Cartilage or Gristle. Chapi. ii.
THe second of simple members is the Gristle, which the Greeks call Chondron,
(...). i. Cartilago.
and the Latines Cartilaginem: and is in hardness next to the bones, (the
Anatomy whereof is called in greek Chondrotome:) but they are somewhat
flexyble, (...)
and cold and dry of complexion, and insensible, as are the bones. And I
find six causes, or commodities why the grystles were ordained. The first
cause is, The use of grystles.
that the continual mouynge of the harde bones in the Junctures might not be
done without detrimente to the lygamentes, if the grystles or Cartilages were
not a mean between the said lygamentes and the bones. The second cause is,
that when any contusion, or bruise, happens in soft members, the said
delicate members are the better defended, from the hard extremities of the
bones. The third cause is, that in the Joynctes the ends of the bones,
(which are gristlye) might more easily, and with nymblenes be folded, and
freated together, without offence or hurt of one towards another. The
fowerth is, that in some places that are mean between harde and soft, it is
necessary to set a gristle, as in the throat boule, or wind pipe, called
Arteria aspera: For there it doth howled and bear off the flesh, that the
passage of the wind or breathe be not interrupted or let. And also in that
place the grystllye substance helps much to the sound of the voice. Fyftlie
I find, that a gristlye substance is necessary in the borders of the eyes.
Sixtlye, they are behooveful in the nose and ears, for there they do both
draw abroad, and sustain, and bear up the soft parts: where as otherwise
they would nether be formable, nor yet do their office, or naturalle
operations.

Of the Lygamente. Chapi. iii.
THe third sort of simple members are the ligamets called in Greek of
Hyppocrates Syndesmi and in Latin Vincula or Lygamenta, (...) Vinculum sieve
ligamentu.
which are spermatyke and flexible, (...).
but yet insensible, and cold and dry of complexion: whose anatomy is called
in Greek Syndesmotome. And I find that ligamentes in the body have.iiii.
necessary uses: Utilities of lygamentes.
The first is, they bind the bones together. The second is, they profit
much in adioynynge themselves to synewes, to make the chords, and the
muscles. Thirdly they are resting places, to diverse of the synewes. And
fourthlie diverse inward members, as the matryr, the renes, and such like, are
by them uphold and sustained. And they are made flexible, because that
otherwise the ioyncte which by them is houlden together, would not have
moved, without an other had moved with him. And they are made insensible,
because otherwise they might never have suffered the labour and payne, in moving
and turnynge of the ioynct. And note that some lygametes bind the bones
inward, and some outward. For the which cause some Authors Judge them to
breed of the bones, although they be of the nature of the synewes. And Galen
says, in the.ii. book of the use of parts, that the couplynge of bones
together, is by the byndinges of strong branched lygamentes.

Of the Nerve or Synewe. Chapi. iiii.
THe fowerth of simple members is the synew, named in Greek Tonos or Neuros,
(...).
in Latyne Neruus, and his dissection Neur^to^e, which is spermatike, cold and
dry of complexion, flexible, and sensyble, strong tougbe, mean between harde
and soft: having their beginning from the brain, and the marrow of the
back. For there come from the brain. vii. pair of synewes, that are called
sensityue: Nerui sensorii
and from the marrow of the back, proceed xxx. pair of synewes, according to
the number of the spondils: and one more, which spryngeth alone by him self
from the last spondill, or loweste of all in the end of the rydge, and
therefore named Neruus sine pari. And these synewes that proceed from the
marrow of the back are called motyue synewes. Nerui motorii
So that from the brain, from the marow of the ridge together, Number of
synewes.
proceed or come forth.xxxvii. pair of synewes, and one odd one.

From all the which do proceed diverse and many synewes, ramifying and
spreadyng themselves, into innumerable branches, extending even to the extreme
parts: by the which we not only feel and perceive in every place as they
pass, both the comfort of healthesome and semblable things, and the greffes
of vnhelthsome and contrary things (which we cal peyne:) but also we have by
them only, the power of moving every member, namely sense of the sensityues,
which therefore are the more delicate: and moving of the motyues, which for
that action are more strong, after this saying of Galen. La enim sensus
nonsine dispositione quadam nerui, motus autem in faciendo sol^ actionem
obtinet: merito sensorius mollior, durior autem motorius neruus factus est:
that is, Saying that sense hath his workynge by a certain disposition, but
motion only in doyng: The sensityue sinew is conveniently made the softer,
or more delicate, and the motyue the harder. And to end with ^rolo Stephano we
may say, non esse omnino motum neque sentiri dolorem, nisi ubi neruus est,
aut partibus uicinus, aut iis counitus. That there is no moving, neither payne
felt, but where there is a sinew, either nigh the parts grieved or conjoined
with them.

Of the Chord or Tendon. The.v. Chapi.
THe fyfthe are the Chords or Tendons, (called in Greek Tenonta in Latyne
Tendines) that bear the name of simple members, (...) Tendo.
Official, and spermatike: but they are compound of Lygamentes, and tough
synewes: and therefore are they strong and towghe, cold and dry of
complexion, mean between harde and soft: (or as Galen saith, De motu ^culorum
libro
so much harder then the synewe, as it is softer then the Ligament), sensible,
flexible. And there are certain causes to be considered: why the chords were
compound, as I said, of synewes and ligamentes together. The first is, that
the synewes, being altogether sensitive, suffice not alone to susteyn the great
labour and travail that the tendon necessarylie doth suffer: wherefore being
compound with the insensyble ligament, there is made a temperature between
sensible insensible, yt so the moving may neither be paiful, nor utterly
without feeling. And by reason of the synewie substance of the chords they have
motyue virtue, according to the appetite, or will of the soul, or desire of
the mind. Moreover I find that these chords or tendons grow out of the
fleshy muscles: and that for good consyderation, great skill: for on these
muscles have the chords a resting place, after their great travail. The
muscle. Musculi sieve Lacerti.
And these fleshie muscles are clothed with a thin skyn or panicle, which
panicle serves as well, to keep the flesh of the muscle in due form: as also
that the said muscles should move alone according to the will, without the
disturbance of the parts adjacent, or next them. And I understand, that this
musculous flesh has within it many small fybers or thredes of a synewie
substance, Will in muscles.
wherein there is noted to be will, and those thredes come to the composition
of the tendons. And three properties is to be noted in the will of these
aforesaid muscles: that is to say, length wherein is contained the virtue
attractive: bredthe, wherein is the virtue expulsyue, and ouerth wartues: in
which is the virtue retentyue: and at the ends of those muscles, these fybers
or thredes, gather themselves together again, and make an other muscle: and so
have they their generalle procedynges, thorough out all the body. Number of
muscles.
Iohannes de Vigo aleagyng Auicen. numbereth the muscles to be. 531. but here I
omytte, to declare the proof of the said number, by resiting them
particulerlie, according to their places, trusting that this is sufficient, in
this brief treatyce. The muscle is called in Latin Musculus a mure, Musculus
Mus.
that is of a mouse, and therefore in Greek also (...), for as a mouse is
biggest in the myddest, smallest at both ends, so is a muscle. And it is
likewise called a lacerte, of the little beast named a Lyzarde, and in Latyne
Lacertus. Lacertus.
Thus in this.v. chapiter I have showed as well the nature, and making of the
muscles: as of the cho^de or tendon. The description of the mnscles by order of
anatomye do the Grecians call Miotomen. (...).


Of the Pannicles The vi. Chapiter.
^

Of the Artery or Pulse. The.vii: Chapiter.
SEuenthlye, (...) i. spiritus. semita.
the Artery or Pulse, called both in Greek and Latin Arteria, and in old
English the Wosen, (whose dissection also the grecians call Arteriotomen,) is
a member simple and spermatike, sinewye and hollow, having his beginning at the
heart, (...)
and it brings from the same spirit and life, unto all the members of the
body: Arteria.
and it is of complexio cold and dry. Wosen.
And every artery hath two coats, except only Arteria Venosa, Arteria
Venosa.
called in Englyshe the venalle artery, (because he has but one coat as
has the veyn:) whose office only is (being implanted in the lunges) to convey
fresh air always to the heart. That the great heate of the heart, caused by
his continualle motion, may thereby be refrigerate, cooled, mitigated, by
entering yt least ventricle thereof, even as the arteriall^ vein, called Vena
arteriosa, Vena arteriosa.
which (coming as some affirm, from the bothome of the heart, on the right
side) bears blood and spirit from the hart to the lunges, to quycken and
nourish them. And hereis to be noted a notable error or ouersyght in (...)
book of Anatomye, whereas this arterialle vein is acounted all one with
Arteria magna* and allo the offyces both of the venalle arterye and the
arterialle vein, are applied to the venalle arterye only. All the other
arteries, have each of them two coats, Utilitye of arteries.
that the spirit of life in them contained, may the better and more certainly
be preserved from hurt outewardlye: and also that the said lively spiryte,
may be the better retained within, that it pass not out before his time,
till all the extreme parts have it minystred unto them. Where as if it were
prevented before it came at them, there would follow mortyfication of the
members: for the arteriall spiryte is more subtle, and pierces sooner unto the
quickenynge of the members, then doothe the venalle or nutrimentalle blood.
Therefore one coat would not suffyce to carry it to those extreme parts, but
that it would be prevented and wasted by the way, before it come to the:
Whereof would follow the incommodities before recited.

Of the Vein. The.viii. Chapiter.
EIghtlye, (the vein named in Latin, Vena, (...), as some will, because blood
comes thereby to all parts of the body, (...).
in Greek Phlebion, and the dyssectyon of them Phlebotome, is a simple member,
as is the artery, cold and dry of complexion, and Spermatyke, but as the
arterye has his beginnynge from the heart, so has the vein his beginnynge
from the liver: The use of veins.
and it brings from thence nutrityue blood, unto all the members of the
body, to nourish them with. And I understand as well by experience, as by
that which I read, that there is no more difference between the vein and the
arterye, but that one (having two coats, and coming from the heart,) is
the vessel of vital and spiritual blood, and the other (having but one
coat, coming from the liver,) is the vessel of nutritiue blood. And this is
generally in all veins, except only the arteriall veyn^ which (as in the
seventh Chapiter I said) proceeds immediately from the heart.

And among all the veins there are two most pryncipalle, from which the
branches of all the reast proceed: that is to say, Vena porta, Vena porta.
and Vena Coele, which some call Vena Caua, Vena coele.
^r Magna, and these two have their beginnings in the liver. Vena caua.
I find ^n Regi^ine sanitatis salerni, the number of veins in man body to
be three hundredth, Number of veins.
three score, and five with these words. (Ex tricentenis decies ^ But I
thyncke this number to be mente of ^tay^e notable veins, which by order of
Anatomye, may be made open to the senses, and not precyselye of all: for they
branch out into innumerable branches, till they come to the very smallness
of hears, as it may be perceived in the pannicles, and some thyn skynnes, as
the eye lyddes, and the skyn of the yard, and diverse other places, and are
therefore called Venae Capillares.

Of the Flesh. Chap.ix.
NInthelye, (...). Caro.
the flesh (called in Greek Sarx, and in Latin Caro,) ^ a simple member, and
sanguine, engendered of blood, and congeyled by natural heate, therefore it
is whotte and moyste of complexion.

And I understand, that there are three kinds of Flesh, found in the body of
man. Flesh is of three kinds.
The first kind is very or true flesh, where of there is but little fore
found in the body, and that is among the gummes or teeth, and in the head
of the yard. The second is universal, mixed with the muscles, The use of
Flesh.
^asertes, or brawns. The third is found in knots, and curnels. And the
profytable uses of the flesh, in the body are diverse, and many. For some are
as clothes, or garments, so defend the body from distemperace. And some
defend the bru^ynge of harde things, and other some serve to keep the body
moyste, and temperate, in the time of heate, True Flesh
and labour. More over the true and pure flesh, whereof I spake first, serves
to fulfylle the void places, and is found in the parts aforesaid. And of the
use of musculous flesh I partly spake before, Musculous Flesh.
where I treated of the chords or tendones. Glandulae sieve adenes.
The use and profit of the glandulous or curnelly flesh, is to turn the
blood which it receives into his own colour: Glandulous Flesh.
as the flesh of the ma^ (...) or woman's breasts, turns the ^. And as the
^esticles, thorough their glandulous or (...) substance, turn the blood unto
sperms: and likewise I read that the curnels under the jaw, Providence of
nature.
turn the blood into ^ttell, to moist the mouth and the tu^ge: Oh wonderful
providence of nature, that ordeyne (...) nothing without a special cause, ^
ever one thing, serves in help and supply the necessity and lack of
another.

Of the fat^* The.x. Chapiter.
TEnthlye the fat called Pimele, (...).
and in latyne Seuu^, is a simple member, but not Spermatike. And three kinds
of fatnesses are found in the body: namelye Pinguedo, Pinguedo.
Aleps and Axungia. That which is called in latin Pinguedo is made of a
subtle portion of the blood, being congeyled together by the coldness of
the outward parts, and it is of complexion cold and moist, Insensible, and
intermedled between the skyn and the flesh. Adeps.
A^eps dyffereth not much from Pi^guedine, saving that it is departed from
the flesh, The use of Fat.
and is much like unto a fatty oil, being poured or spread out, among the
synewye or thin skinnye parts: that their dryness might always be
moisted, with such natural liquor, or fatness. And this Adeps is engendered,
out of the fatter parts of the blood in Vena porta, and spread forth by
thin and small veins, which as it approaches to the cold and dry parts,
congeyleth to such a thick substance. Fat is in qua^t^, more or less
according to complexion and place.
For the proof whereof as well those persons, whose bodies are cold and
Phlegmatike, as those places that are in both, most cold and temperate, (by
their distance from the liver:) have more quantity of fat, then such as are
of hotter complexion, or the nygher to the liver: as wytnesseth Galen, in
libro. 16. de Vsu partium, ac in libro. 1. de tempera nentis. Much like unto
this is Seuum, which yet is somewhat thicker. Axungia.
Axungia which the Greeks call Oxyngion is of the kind of, (...). Adeps.
Pinguedo saving only that it is outwardly departed from the flesh, where
it moysteneth the dry parts, by reason of his vnctiousnesse, as doth Adeps
in the parts above specifyed.

Of the skyn. Cap. xi.
THe eleuenthe, and the last of the simple members is the skyn: which is
official; and partly Spermatike, strong and tough, flexible, and sensible,
thyn and temperate: and two kinds of skynnes principally, are found in the
body.

The first is called Panniculus carnosus, Membrana. carnosa.
or membrana carnosa, this skyn be wraps all the body within, and under the
uttermost skyn. Panniculus carnosus.
And as Galen says, in libro. 3. de anatomicis administrationibus, libro. 16.
de Vsu partium, there comes unto this Fleshye panicle, and through it, the
veins, fibres, and strings of the sinews, that nourish and give feeling to
the outward skyn. The second skin, is that which covers, be wraps all the
body outwardly; and is the very t^ue skyn, which is properly called in latin
Cutis, in greek Derma. (...). i. cutis Vel pellis
And this skin has diverse natures and properties, according to the
dyuersityes of places in the body. For as Galen writes in his second book De
Vsu parti^, the skin of the palms of the hands, of the soles of the feet, of
the forheade, and allmoste all the face, with other parts, can hardly be
fleyne, by reason of the muscles and tendones, that are graffed and rooted in
it. ^position of the skyn.
And this skyn as I read and learn, is through the cunning of nature, made
and ordained, of divers and sondrye parts: as of Fybres, of Nerues, of veins,
and arteries, and such other. And this work has nature wrought for divers
causes. The uses of the skyn.
The one is, that thereby it might be temperate, by the having of part of
every quality. Whereby also it obteineth the virtue of feeling and sensible
judging, of every quality: as excess of heate, or cold. c. and might
thereof inform the common wits, that the parts agreued might attain from
them some help, or succour. Another cause is, that by the means of veins and
arteryes so produced, it might ever be nourished, made moyste, warmed, and
comforted: Whereby also the parts lying and being under it inwardly, might be
the better preserved: And also that wounds, ulcers, contusions, with other
like chances, might be the sooner and the easilyer cured, healed, and closed up
again by the reason thereof. And note that on the uppermost parts of this
skin, is a very thin insensible rimme or skyn, which is of the Grecians called
Epidermis, (...). i. summa cuticle.
and of the Latynes Cuticle, or Eflorescentia cutis: and rises in blisters
when the skin is burned, scalded, or by any means excoriated.

Of the hears and nailes. The.xii. Chapter.
FInally, Pili imgues Superfluityes of members.
Anatomistes reckon the nailes, and the hears: which yet are no mebers, but
rather ye superfluityes of members, as I said in the beginning. Which
superfluityes come of gross vapores, my^ed and condescended with viscous
matter, by reason whereof the pores in the skin suffyce not to avoid, Gener^yon
of hears and nails.
or expel them, wherefore they grow forth in such harde tough, and dry
substances: yet though it be true in dede, that they are but superfluities of
mebers, The uses of the nails.
they have uses very necessary in the body. The nails defend the fyngers
and the toes from great bruses: and they comely beutifye the fyngers, causynge
them to take the better hold, Gross humores expelled by nails.
and serve to claw and scratch the body when it itches: whereby much noyous
and fylthys humores are the better avoided. For the skin, whereof we last
spake, being full of pores or small holes, ordained of nature, Pores in the
skyn.
to expel such moistures and vapores as are noifull to the body, has often
times the said pores opilated, or stopped: through the which stopping not
only itch, but diverse other euels happen to the members. Wherefore the clawing
or scratching of the nails, is in such case vtyle and profitable: for as
much as the said scratchynge is a mean to open the pores. The uses of hear.
And the hears, are also necessary for diverse uses: the first is, it
defends the brain from to much heate, or to much cold, and from other
incommodities. Also it makes the figure or form of the face, the more comely
and decentr: and by the hear of the face, man and woman differ much, by the
colour of the hear, we know the complexion of the brain, and the other
principal members. Gross vapores also and ^umosities, Gross vapores purged by
hear.
in places needful, are by the hears the more easily expelled: as experience
proves ye sweat and gross vapores come sooner forth, where there is much
hear growing, then where there is little hear, perceived or scene.

Of the difference between the simple members and the compound. Cha. xiii.
IT is mere now, since I have called these members simple, that I show
wherefore I call them so, and to show the difference between those that are
simple, and them that are not simple. For howe may they be called simple, if
there be not also compound members, whereby the simple may be known, as each
thing is known by his contrary? I say that the simple members are two ways
to be known from those that are compound, by two notable dyfferences. First a
simple member, if it he divided in never so many parts, The difinition of a
simple member.
the least part bears the name of the whole, as though it were the whole
thing: As for example, the least part of a bone, is called bone, the least
part of a synewe, is synewe: and the least part of the flesh is flesh, and
so forth o^ all the rest that are called simple. For Totum similare
praedicatur de suis partibus.

For the which cause, as I said in the begynninge, they are also called in
greek Homocomres, (...) i. similaris. cuius pars eandem rationem idemque nome
cum toto obtine^.
in latin Similiaria, or cosimilaria membra that is to say like for the least
part is like it self in the whole. Contrariwise, it is nor so of the compound
members. For if a piece of a hand, an arm, a leg, a foot, a face, or a head
be separated from the whole, it can not bear the name of the whole thing,
from which it is separate: therefore are they not called Cosimilaria, as are
the simple members, The definition of a compound meber.
but rather Dissimilaria, and in Greek Anomocomeres, that is to say, unlike,
because a part of them, being separated from the whole, is not like, but
unlike it self in the whole: (...). i. quod ex dissimilibus copositum est
partibus.
for I can not call a pere of a hand, a hand nor a piece of a head, a head. c.
Secondly the compound members are so called, because they are composed
together of divers of those that are called simple. As for example, my hand is
a compound member: for it is composed of bones, gristels, pannicles,
ligamentes, muscles cortes, synewes, arteryes, veins, fat, and skyn. c.
Contrariwyse the simple members, whereof we have spoken in all this little
treatise, as a bone, a gristle. c. are alone simple of them selves, without
any other to be named in them. And thus have I proved sufficiently, the
difference between ye simple members and those that are compound: And have
showed, howe that every member that is called compound, has his
composition, of divers of them that are called simple.

Of the difference between the Spermatike and the Sanguine members. The.xiiii.
Chapter.
ANd now also since I have called some of those simple members spermatike, and
other some sanguyne: I think it good also, that I show you howe I
understand, The definition of the spermatike members.
for what cause they are so called. I say therefore, that spermatike members
are so called, because they have their bredynge and beginning of spermatike
matter: And are once engendered and made, by the sperm or seed of the
parents, and never after. For the which cause we say in chirurgerye, that
spermatike members never receive true regeneration, nor true consolidation,
when any solution of continuitye, as a wound, ulcer, Fistule. c. happens in
them: But are fain an other way to be helped, through the great providence of
nature, which as I said before, leaves nothing destitute of succour, in
necessity: for a certain substance resembling flesh, (...).
called therefore Poros Sarcodes, or as Lanfranke terms it, Caro Poroides, is
gathered together, fulfyllinge the place, and seruinge in the stead of that
which was lost, or separate. And this is the help of spermatike members,
which of complexion are cold and dry: wanting all other matter of
perfection, whereby they might be truly consolidate or regenerate. The
definition of a Sangume meber.
But contrariwise, the Sanguine members, so named because their bredynge, and
beginning is of blood, (called in Greek Haema and Phlegmos,) (...). i. sangu^s
are daily regenerate, and made in the body: Because their said first
matter, which is blood, is evermore renewed, and made again in the body. So
that when such solution of continuitye, as is said before, happens in them,
there is made again perfect restoration, or true consolidation For blood
they^ very substance, and first matter, is ever ready at hand, to make
perfect again the same thing, so wasted or separated. And truly this
seems to me a necessary thing, for the chirurgien to knew: that when he
sees a wound, or any disease in the members, Solution of continuitye, what
it is.
that makes solution of vnitye: that is to say, that separateth, that which
before was whole and grew together, he may Prognosticate, and judge truly,
whether there may be made true consolidation or not. For such true and
certain Prognostication brings the Chirurgien to estimation and worship.
Prognosticatyon.
And thus I understand the difference between the spermatike and the Sanguine
members, and what vtilitye it brings to the Chirurgien to have the true
knowledge of them.

The Conclusion.
Peradventure it will now be thought meet, The definityon of members, what
they are.
that I should have defined what a member is. For why should such words be
multiplied, without perfect knowledge upon what ground they are spoken? I
say therefore by the authority of Galen, in the first book of the use of
parts. A member is a body, that is not wholly separate, nor wholly conjoined to
an other. And after Auicenn in the plural number. Members are bodies, that are
engendered of the first commixtion of humores. And finallye I find* that in
the Anatomye there ought.ix. things to be sought, for the furtherance of
knowledge. that is to wit: the composition, the complexion, the substance, the
quantitye, the number, the figure, the operatio, the utility or use of members,
and what diseases may chance unto them.

The end of the first Treatise.
The second treatise OF ANATOMY, WHICH compendiouslye declares the
necessity, and necessary use, of.ix. knowledges, to be considered in the
Anatomy of members, throughout the whole body.
The argument of the second Treatise.
BECAVSE THAT IN the end of my collection of simple mebers, or first
treatice, I recited.ix. things to be considered in Anatomye, leaving the same
without farther declaration: I think it good now to prove the necessity of
those.ix. knowledges in a short treat^se by it self, before I enter any farther
into the Anatomy generally. For if the meaning of things be well discussed,
and declared before had, it shall make the matter manifest, and void of
obscurity, when a man shall talk of those things, in time place requisyte.
The which thing to do, it is needful that I crave the gentle pardon of those
that in this thing are my betters, in bearing with mine imbecility or weakness.
For truly I came but lately out of the shell, even as a bird that is not
fully fledge, nor able to fly: trusting yet hereafter to have my wings better
fethered, that now be so stobbed, and vnapte to serve the turn. In the mean
season, to show you what I am willing to do, if I could bring it about:
Lo here is the collection, that I have gathered of these.ix. things to be
considered in Anatomy. That is to say, the composition, the complexion, the
substance, the quantitye, the number, the figure, the operation, and the
utility of mebers, and finally what dyseases may chance to any of them.

Of the composition of members or Combination. The first Chapiter.
First the composition of members in Anatomye, Membrorum Compositio uel
Combinatoi.
is needful to be known, which some call combination, or knitting together
of members. And this combination is as well vnderstaded, in the composing
together of qualities or temperamentes, in the simple members: as in the
composition of diverse simple members in making a compound member. Therefore
although this word composition, belong chieflye to the compound members, yet
is there also a composition, Composytion in simple mebers.
or combination, to be sought in the simple member, Although not in substance,
yet in quality, as for example: When we say what and moist, whotte and dry,
Qualities.
or cold and moist, cold and dry. For when there is more then one quality
named in a member, then is there in that member combination, or couplinge
together of qualities. So that we may say, though the member be simple in
matter substance, yet is it of a compound complexion: for otherwise it must be
called hot only, cold only, dry or moist only: Which we find in no
writer of Anatomye. Composition in every member.
Therefore it must follow, that in every member there is a composition to be
sought: though not (as I said in substance yet in temperament of complexion.
And howe necessary, both these compositions, or combinatios are to be
considered of the Chirurgien, I think there be none so ignorant, but that he
doothe perceive if ever he red or saw Anatomye, or has heard it red. And
the composition of every member in substance, is so evident in every work
of Anatomye, that to prolong the time therwyth in this place, should be both
vain and tedious: therefore we leave this matter aus will speak of the
complexions of members.

Of the complexion of members. The.ii. Chapiter.
Secondly, Complexio membrorum.
the complexion, of every member is much to be noted, whether it be hot,
cold, dry, or moist. But truly, I have red of no member symply so
esteemed, but rather of a compound complexion, as I said before: As cold and
moist, as is the brain: hot and moist, as the liver: and so forth, as ye
may read in any written Anatomye: and as I intende by the grace of God to
declare in mine. And the complexion of all the simple members I have
sufficiently declared in my first treatise. But hear note, that when we call
any member, cold and moyste, or cold and dry, it is not for any peculier, or
precise facultye therein, as in the first Elements: but only by comparison
of one member with an other, or one part with an other. For we can not call
the brain cold and moist simply, or absolutely, but in comparynge it with
the liver or heart, (which in respect of it are hot,) and not otherwise: for
as Guido says, all members be naturally whotte.

The complexion of every member thus known, it shall be the easier to cure
diseases in them. For what avails it that we read in Galen, that what
members must have hot medicines, for the preservation of their natural
temperature, and likewise that cold members must have cold medicines: If I
understand not which member is hot, and which is cold: which is dry,
and which is moyste? For who can prevent the danger that he suspec^eth not,
or take away the enormity that he knows not? or howe shall the Chirurgien
cure the excess of any distemperature: as excess of cold or heate, dryness
or moistness by cooling the heate, heatinge the cold, moisting the dry, or
dryinge the moysts, as Galen teaches: If be understand ^ether the temperature,
nor distemperature of any meber? I may therefore conclude, that it is
necessary that a Chirurgien know the complexion of every member in the body
of man: Which body of man is the subject of his science, as Guido says.

Of the substance of members. The.iii. Chapter.
Thirdly in order follows the substance, Membrorum substantia.
which in every meber is much to be regarded. Of the substance of simple
members, I have allredy sufficiently spoken in my first treatise, whether they
be hard or soft, or mean between harde and soft: and when these words,
hard, soft, or mean, be spoken of in any meber, by order of Anatomy, it is
always met of ye substance. And truly it is very necessary for ye exact knowledge
of every disease, ye ready curation of the same, to consider the substance.
Foreuery member when it is diseased, the said diseases thereof, receive their
names according to the substance: as I will in the end of this treatise
show, when I speak of the diseases, that may chance unto the members. And as
ye disease receives a name, according to the substance of the member: so
every member receives diuerslye diverse remedies, according to their
substance. For the bones, whose substance is hard, requires remedies:
altogether diverse fro^ any of the other members, whose substance is either
soft, or mean between hard and soft. Which members also, whether they be
soft or mean, require remedies also according to their substance. I mean
here, by remedies handye operations: for as medicynes are made according to
complexion, so must hand^e work be done, according to the substance: Whether
it be in bynding, rolling, bolstering, or any other work. For if I know not
what remedy, every member in the body, according to his substance, may
sustain, or rather doth necessarily require: howe can I any otherwise do
but err? for if I shall work in the bones, as appertains to the Flesh,
and in the Flesh, as appertains to the bones: Who can doubt, but that of
necessity I must make a great confusion? and this as it seems to me, makes
a sufficient proof, that it is necessary in members to know their substance.

Of the quantitye of members. The.iiii. Chapiter.
FOurthlye, Membrorum quan^itas.
the quantity is nedefulle to be considered in members. That is to say: much
or little, great or small, for howe can we exactlye know any vein,
arterye, or synewe. c of other members in the body: ^s if we shall use
Phlebotomye, (...).
or any other handye work in the body, if we lack this principal
consideration of quantitye? For every vein is known and named much what by
his quantitye, in respect of others.

And as thysis an easy thing to do in conspicuous, large and great veins:
so is it a thing of more cunning and difficulty, to take a vein, that is
tender small and obscure. And also in the aforsayde work, and all other
operations of Surgery, the consyderation of quantity shall much farther
knowledge, in auoidynge of dangers.

For if we know what quantity, every member bears in his place, by mesuring
and considering the quantitye, we shall avoid the more easily all dangers,
that may hurt or offend them. And every member bears quantitye according to
ye place. For al veins, arteries synewes muscles bear diverse quantities
according to their diverse places: as veins and arteries, at their first
beginning of their proceedings from their originalle places are great: and wax
ever smaller, as they approach to the extreme parts. The bones also, through
the wonderful providence of nature, are much or little in quantitye,
according to the necessytyes of the places where they are: For where the
members be great, and much nourishment required, there are the veins also
great, to supply and serve that need.

And where there is much need of lyuelye spirit, there be great arteries:
Where much neade of mouynge is, great sinews and Chords: and where great
neade of strength is, there are great bones: as in other places that are
less, less members serve in every degre. And this is the mesuringe of
quantitye, through out all the whole body, even as necessity requires.

The quantitye of each member particularly, is to be showed when they be
particularly treated o^: as I have done sufficiently, of the simple mebers in
my first treatise.

But note, that there is an other consideration of quantitye of members: for
diverse members have diverse quantities in much or little, according to the
complexions of the body. That some members varye in quantitye, according to
complexion
For the ph^egmatike have much fat, and the chol^rick^ little fat or none:
The Sanguine have much flesh, and the melancholic have very little flesh.
And that it is necessary for the chirurgien, to know these things, no
reasonable man doubts, as I think.

Of number in members to be observed. The fyfthe Chapiter.
FIftlye the number of all sorts of members, Numerus membrorum.
are to be had in mind: as I said in my first treatise, of the number both
of the veins and sinews, and also of the bones and muscles. For as it was
exactlye considered, of ancient authors, what quantity members were of: so is
it noted, what number there be of them. For as it is a wonderful plesante
consyderation of natures works, so is it much commodious in the handye work
Chirurgerye, to understand howe number and store of every sort of members, is
given to each part of the body, to serve turn according to need. Who can
but wonder at natures providence, God of Nature.
(why say I not rather the God of nature) to ordeyne the order of number so
well in the body of man. There been ordained two ears, that if one be
interrupted of his offyce, by any mean or chance, the other may serve the
office of hearing. Like wise there are two eyes, that if one be hurt, the
other may serve: that the body be not left without that help. Have we not
also two legs and two arms, for like consideration? so are there also payers
of synewes, going forth through all the body, both sensityue, and motyue:
That by the reason of store, when hurt happens to one, Prognostication by
number.
the other may serve. Which is necessary for the Chirurgien to consider, that
he may Prognosticate in every wound, the danger that must of necessity
follow. For if he know the number of sinews, and how many of that number are
offended: he may easily judge both the quality and quantitye of the
offence, and also what defect may thereof ensus. And likewise is to be
understanded of the number of veins, arteries, and all other members.

Of Figure to be considered in members. The.vi. Chapiter.
SIxtlye the figure, Membrorum figura.
form, or proportion, of every meber, is much to be regarded. For there was no
member formed in the body, without a special cause, why the same figure, or
proportion was given to it. The bones of the head are knit together with the
comissures or seames, making by that joining a round shape or figure. Round
form
For as the Philosopher says, that form of all other is most certain, from
danger and harm. For all stripes, and all chances that happen to a round
proportion, are forced to slip, slide, Flat form.
or glance: but on all plain and flat forms, the force or violence of all
hurts tarry, staye, and pearce, to the greater detrymente of the parts so
hurt or stricken. Therefore it is ordained, as I said in my first treatise,
that all bones, that are set to defend from hurts the principalle members,
have their figure or form for that use most coueniente, and sure: that is to
say round For as well, the bowt form of the ribs, in their knittying
together, make a round figure, for the surer defence of the heart, and the
members within the breast, as the bones of the head, for the defence of the
brain. The veins are formed round and holowe, to carry the blood through
the body, as water pypes carry water from the conduict head to serve a whole
city. The arteries have like proportion, to carry likewise the lively
spirit, whereby all the members of the body live. The muscles, or braunes,
are formed like a mouse, as I said in my first treatise, big in the
midst, and smallest always towards the ends: that the body in no place
lack a comely figure. The brawns of the arms, ye caulfe of the leg, the
fyllets of the back, the comely figure of the face, and all the other parts:
are made in such comely decente, and beautiful form, through the variable
figures of the muscles.

The ligamentes, are made in the form of bands, to bind the ioynctes
together. And to conclude brieflye, each thing in the world, as well as the
body of man, is of small regard, if it lack the decente figure, or proportion
that it ought to have. And finally, no chirurgien can work assuredly or
cunningly, in the body of man, if he know not the figure of every member or
part.

Of the operation of members. The. Vii. Chapiter.
Seventhly the operation that is in members, Operatio Membrorum
is to be learned, of him that will be a chirurgien: And howe those operations
are conveyed and carried, to serve the need of every part. And to talk of
operations, it were mete to use this word parts, because it includes more,
then this word members: for we can call none of the. iiii. humores members,
yet are they parts of the body. So are the three spirits to wit the animal,
vital, and natural: (though in dede many learned men, have upon diverse
reasons, Sense, motion Spirit and life.
denied any third or naturalle spirit to be:)

The animal spirit giving the operatios of sense, and motion. The vital,
geuinge spirit and life to all the members. The natural, nurishment to all the
body. The vital spirit being made in the heart, the animal in the brain,
the natural in the liver. And both these last, animal, and natural, are
made of the first called vital. The vital spirit is carried into all parts,
by the arteries. The animal, by the sinews, the natural in the veins. And
of the operations of these, all other parts of the body, take their
operations. As ye operation of feeling, of moving, of hearing of seeing, of
smelling, of speaking: yea all operatios proceed of the first operations: of
which first operations proceeds ye forsaide spirits. The first operations
are these, which are also called virtues, or faculties, and are in number
four, namely attractive retentive, alteratiue, and expulsiue. And these four
are in every part of the body that is nurished, or yt serves to nurish other:
The attractive faculty being done by hotnesse and dryness, the retentive by
coldness and dryness, the alteratiue by hotnesse and moistness, the
expulsiue by coldness and moistness.

And through these natural virtues or faculties, are the iii. digestions
wrought and accomplished in the body. The first of these digestions is in the
stomach, the second in the liver, the third is universally in the veins. I
understand also yt there are iii. pores in the body: Animal, vital.
Natural: this last pour called natural, is divided into these iiii. forsaid
operations or virtues. And as I said before, all operations of every meber, are
received of these first operations: whether it befeling, moving, tasting,
seeing, hearing, smelling, or any other, yt any man can devise or name. For of
the first four is made nutrition, without the which no member may live, nor
grow. Much less have any operation or facultye. Therefore, when any member
is hurt or offended, we ought to call to mind, what operation belongs to
the part so hurt: and howe that member receives the same. As for example: the
operation of feeling and mouynge, is carried by the animal spirit in the
synewes, unto all members.

So doth heate and lyte come to all members, by the vital spiryte in the
arteryes. And the nutrimentall blood, by the naturalle spirit in the veins.
If therefore in any member, any of these be so offended that there is no hope
of recovery: we may boldly Prognosticate, that the operatyon of that member
so received is void and frustrate: Because the mean whereby it was achieved is
destroyed. Even as no water can come by a conduict, to a house or a city, when
the pipe is cut or broken by the way. But farthermore, if any member lack
his natural or due operation, so that he can not do his office, nevertheless
no hurt perceived in the outward parts: then must we consider, whether it
be feeling, mouinge, or strength that is lacking. Which thing known,
knowing also by what mean, the said member received his operation now
being lost: It shall be the easier to devise a remedy to cure and help the
same. Therefore, that it is necessary for the Chirurgien, to know the office or
operation of every member, as I think, neadeth no farther proof.

Of the vtilitye or office of members. The.Viii. Chapiter.
EIghtlye the vtilitye or offyce, Offitium uel Vtilitas membrorum.
that every member hath in the body, is greatly to be noted: for every member
in the body has a special office by him self, whereby he is necessary to
the body. And therefore when he is lacking, the body is destitute o^ that
necessary thing: even as a common weal that lacks his officer. What
members in the body are called official, ye shall understand in ye general
Anatomy. Notwithstanding, there is no meber in the body, that is without his
utility: yt is to say, that hath not a profitable use in the body. But for as
much as in my collection of the simple members, every member has his
vtilitye declared, where he is spoken of: I shall need the less in this place
to tarry upon it. But this brieflye I say: the bones are the susteiners of the
body. The gristles are formable additions. The ligamentes bind the joints
together. The muscles make a comely form. The synewes carry the feeling and
mouinge virtue. The vein carries the nutrityue blood. The arterye carries the
vital spirit. The flesh fills the void places. The fat moysteneth the
dry parts. The skin covers and clotheth the body. These are brieflye the
offices or the vtilities of all the simple members. By which the chirurgien
takes great note: As well to keep the body in health, as to cure it when it
is diseased.

Of the diseases that the members are subject Unto. Capi. ix.
NInthlye and last, Diseases chatynge to the members.
we ought to note, what diseases may chance to any member, and which been
curable. For there be diverse members, that when they be wounded, receive no
curation. Namelye the brain, the heart, the stomach, and such guts are not
fleshye, and other such like. And farthermore, as I said in my first
treatise* that spermatike members receive no true consolydation. Therapeut.
And as Galen saith, in li.iiii. therapeut in ye cure of ulcers, (confutinge
the error of Thessalus:) The diseases, namelye solution of continuity, (...).i.
fractio uel fractura.
receive diverse names, according to the diversity of the members, and their
substances. For the breaking of bones are called in Greek Catagma, and in
Latin Fractura. To the flesh happens wounds, ulcers, bruses, (...),.i.
(...)
tumores Apostemes. Solution of continuity in ye synewes is called Spasmos and
in the lygaments Thlasma in the muscles Apospasma, (...) contusio.
or Rhegma. Or as we say in plain Englyshe. The synewes suffer cramps,
palsyes, and conuuition: The bones breaking: The joints displacynges, The
Flesh wounds, (...).i. (...).
bruses. c. And to all the other members happens diverse peines, of diverse
names, as well by the excess or corruption of any of the.iiii. humores: (...).
i. eruptio sieve ruptura.
as also of ventositye, or windinesse, and waterye humores. The joints or
sinewye members, are grieved with aches, and gowtes. And fathermore apostemes,
ulcers, cancers, fistules, and such like: Do happen among the members, diversely
in diverse places of the body: receuynge their names oft times according to
their places, as it is writ of, by our ancient authors. whom I judge it
expedient to read and discretlye to follow.

The Conclusion.
LO, thus have I ended this second treatise, although grossely, and
vnlearnedly: trusting notwithstanding that it will be gently borne withal.
Truly my masters and brethren, these are but ears of corn, that I gleaned in
times paste after the bindinges of the plentiful sheues of others: trusting
to God that hereafter (though not yet,) I shall be able to bind sheues of
mine own, and scater some ears, for such as must glean, gather their
handfuls of other men's leuinges: Nether wish I, yt we should any longer live,
then we should show our selves profitable one to an other. In the which, as we
may learn in holy writ, and as the deuines, continually blow in our ears,
we shall be known to be the servants, of our Lord and sauyoure Jesus
Christ. Who taught his discyples to love an other, Saying, by this ye shall
be known, to be my discyples, in that ye love one an other. The which love
God grant us all. Amen.

The end of the second Treatise.
The third treatise OF ANATOMY, BRIEFLYE showing the form, the making, and
the natural operations or offices of every member, inwardly and outwardly,
from the head to the feet. And howe the handye work of Chirurgerye ought to
be done, in each part of the body.
The argument of the third Treatise.
Though I mean here according to promise, to write generally of Anatomy:
mine intent is not to name or express every small and difficult deuisyon of
parts. For though the body of man be finyte, may be comprehended, as cocerning
al that is needful necessary unto knowledge: yet I esteem it as unprofitable as
unpossible, to make explicatio of every extremity. for sure it is not possible
otherwise the by cogitatio to know exquisitely every small meber. wherefore the
aunciet Chirurgiens deu^ded ye body into diverse members, so far as was
requisite to surgery, the necessary knowledge howe to work in the same. The
rest (being over curious, thought as vnnedefull of such plain deuisios, as ye
work intricate,) was left by argumetes to be ministered to ye senses of the
ingenious, by cogitation and reason. But to the baser sort of less capacity:
it was thought sufficient to warn them of dagers, by certain brief general
rules. as to know where veins wear by bleding, arteries by beating or
pulsation. And in all members that did move and feel, they judged nerues or
sinews to be, both motive and sensityue. And as those ways are very brief,
so seems their end and commodity very small. But to our purpose.

That office error may be aduoided in surgery, through ignorance of Anatomy:
as when incision. Cauterizations, Phlebotomy, ventosyng, scari^ications,
opening of Apostemes, such like are to be done on the body of man.

I mean here to declare the names, natures, operatyons, compositions,
beginninges and endinges of as many members, as to the Chirurgiens intellection
is convenient.

Aduoiding nevertheless as ne'er as may be, all obscuritye and tediousness,
least in going about to be so precise and exact in the extreme deuisions and
spreadinges of every part, (garnishinge and painting the same with such
large expositions, as it would necessarily require:) I should rather become an
heavy fatigation or weariness to the readers, then any thing vtile or
profitable to their understanding.

Wherefore ye shall note by the way, that the body of man in the order of
Anatomye, is divided into. lii. ventrycles or principal parts, beside the
members called Artus. The three ventricles are these: the head, the breast, the
belly: whereof I will treat in the first, the third, and the fourth parts.

The members called Artus or the lymmes, are the arms and the hands, with the
legs and the feet: of these I speak in the second and fyfte parts.

The syxte part is of the names, (both in Latin and English) from the head
to the fete, of all exterior parts of the body, as they are called of the
most learned Anatomistes.

The first part of the third treatise, wherein is declared the Anatomy of the
head, with all his parts, as well conteinynge, as contained, and also the
neck and throat, unto the shoulders.
Of the brain, with his substance, complexion, form, and office, with the
number of his ventricles, and the marvelous motyons of the same.
The first Chapiter.
AS IN THE FIRST treatise I began with the bones, the foundations of all other
members, because by them all others are supported and borne: so it hear seems
unto me best, seeing man is called of the Grecians Anthropos, (...).i. homo.
(...) atque (...).
(as I have before opened) to begin at the root of the tree: and first at the
inner part thereof, and from thence to proceed to the utter, and then in order to
the trunk, or stock, and lastlye to the branches.

Then, sith the brain, and head, by consent of all learned authors, is the
root of the body: at the head, (called in Latin Caput and in Greek Cephale,)
Caput.
will I begin, by consideration of Anatomye: (...).
first of the contained, and then of that which conteyneth. The brain
therefore I say, which the Grecians (lacking for it a propre vocable*) have
called ^cephalon because that (as some will,) (...) Cerebrum
it is (...), that is in the head, and is called of the Latines Cerebrum, is a
principal member: whose substance is said to be ma^wye, and it is also soft,
and white of colour: The more outwardly the softer and the duller white: but
the more lower and inward, the more massye, tough, and perfecter white it is.
Of complexion it is cold and moist: and of generation Spermatike: for as
says Galenus, libroprimo de semine. Generationem ex solo semine habet. The
form ever agreing with the shape of the sculle inwardly. In the inferior, or
lower parts inwardly thereof, Uentricles.
are certain ventricles, which after the mind of diverse authors, are diuerslye
divided of some into three, and of others into four: yet do they consonantlye
agree in the whole, concerning their particular offices.

The aforsayde substance being opened, Glandulouse parts.
there are seen certain glandulous bodies, here and there among his parts
of substance diversely dispersed: which are neither so firm nor so white, but
wannishe, and also more moyste and clammye, then the brain it self: among
the which, the recrementes of the brain are thought to be gathered, from
whence they pass into the ventricles. These ventrycles, (as is said) are
most commonly numbered three, yet Galen confesses four, which Lanfranke
grants, for the manifest deuisyon of the large holownesse in the fore-parte
into two. Which as saith Carolus Stephanus, being ouerthwartlye divided: that
is the upper part from the nether mosie by an ouerthwarte incisyon, doth with
his boughtes and Cryckes on each side much represent the form of a man
ear.

The third then is the myddlemoste: and the fourth is behind, in an other
little brain, called also in ^atyne by diminution Cerebellum, Cerebellum.
and of the Grecians Parencephalis, (...).
and also of Erasistratus, Epencranis.

And this part is compact together, differynge euydentlye from the reasie of
the brain, (...).
interhedged with the Pia matter, as the other substance is: but it is divided
outwardly, as it were into many thyn, and sclender cy^cles, neither is it so
white as the reasie of the brain, bu^ composed, as of certain hillocks
couched together: of (...) curdy and britle substance, wherein is contained
abundance of spirit.

Furthermore, Humore in the ventri^l^
in the concauityes or celles of the former ventrycles, there is found
contained, a certain yelowishe waterye substance: which is judged to be the
repurgynge or syncke, of the humores of the brain, transcente from the
glandulous bodies before mentioned. Which humores, when so ever they
superabounde, do fall down by common passages, into the trench over the
rouffe or palate of the mouth, ordained to receive ye same: from whence it is
expelled, as well forward by the nosethrils, as backward into the mouth.
Whereof in his place more shall be said.

But upon this humore, in these former ventrycles, is a certain body, woven
together of infinite veins and arteryes, coming from the heart, growing
about the marvelous net called Rete Mirabile confirmed with a coat of Pia
matter: and this contexed body, is peculiarlye called of some Choriformis
membrana. Choriformis membrana.
And it so swymmeth in the foresaid humore, being so slacklye bound and
loselye tied, both to the bothome, and the sides of the holownesse, that it
deerreth, and strayeth to and fro, in the said humore: following
notwythstandynge, the exact form of the Crickes and corners of the said
ventricles, even to the arch or vault.

Whose offyce is to work in the ventrycles, inspyratyon, e^pyratyon, and
efflatyon: unto which mouinge, doubtless the whole substance of the brain
gives place, The brains motyons.
and is thereby caused to move and heave. The proof of which operatyon may be
manifestly seen, and the brain euydentlye to move: both in yonge infantes,
err their moulds be closed, and also in such as by chance have their
sculls broken.

Whereof Galen, (...). i. di latatio, uel destinctio.
upon good reason did attribute Diastolen, Systolen also to ye brain: and also
by this workinge, the vital spirit in the arteries, is there made animal. In
the bought or bosom of this Choriformis: (...). i. contractio, uel correptio.
are the spirits received and contained, as yet gross and impure: that by the
former ventricles, they may there be wrought and prepared, before they enter
the middle ventricle, and the seses thereof. Wherein they are made also yet more
perfect, that afterward they may descend, into the.iiii. or last ventricle
of Cerebellum: and to this purpose certain passages, ways or pores, are
ordained, to lead the said spirits from one cell into another. Which that it
should not to soon, or untimely be done: There is a certain delicate
glandulous body ordained, vnderlyinge the holowe pore, (whereof I do
immediately make mention) called Conarion, because it represents the form of
a Pine apple, (...). i. ^ux pinea, uel figura ex lato in acutum de^ines
called Conus. Which by his natural property stops the pore, in such
wise that the said spirits may not be carried before their time, into the
Cerebellum. The like whereof may be seue in a glandule, lying upon the gut
Pylorum: which will suffer no substance to pass out of the stomach into the
said gut, before the full time and complete end of digestion.

There is moreover a certain holowe pore, The pore deuidynge the ventricles.
which of some is called the third ventrycle, and of other a perforation
only: Constitutynge the third ventrycle to be ye vaulted body, above the
common holownesse of the former ventrycles, (which because it is like an arch
or vault) is called of the Grecians Camarion, (...) Fornix sieve. Corpus
fornicatum.
and Psallio^ides, the common sort call it Fornicem and Corpus fornicatum.
Which vaulted body was of nature made in the brain, that the upper substance
of the same, might be the stronglyer sustained.

But now concerning the said pore, which some, yea and Galen him self,
constitutes the third ventrycle: It is dyuerslye woven together, his upper
parts being covered, of a subtle panycle, but there not weak: which also
reaches even to the holownesse, of the hyndermoste ventricle. There are also
on the sides belonging to the said pore, certain lunge and sclender
emynences, growing out from the substance of the brain, Glutiae*
called Glutiae, or Naticulae: whose nigh concurse and vicinitye passing
together, Naticulae.
thou may says Galen, liken aptly to buttocks, touching together one an
other: though some likeninge them to the testicles, (...).
had rather call them Didymia. Anceformes
But they are called of the late wryters Anceformes, because they are like
boughtes, or buttocks. And these Anceformes do strengthen and thrust together
ye wormlike process, Epiphysis. Vermiformis
called Vermiformis epiphysis: whose function is chiefly, to stop and open
the pore, by contractinge together, or distending it self by length in the
same, whereof also it has his name: whose end or extreme part is about the
lower part of the third ventricle, called of ye Grecians Scoleco^ides. (...)
^.
But for the copiouse declaration of the causes of these and other names, with
many other circumstances hereunto belonging, for briefnesse sake here I leave
the loving reader, unto the perfect ennarratio^s of Galenus, Vesalius, and
Carolus Stephanus: where thy desires may be satisfied at the full. And now
according to the grounded judgements of the learned, Sense^ (...) wits.
I will proceed to the senses, or wits, contained and wrought in these
celles.

In the first part of the former ventricles, are founded the common wits or
senses, Common (...) or.v. wytte^.
called otherwise the.v. wits: as hearing, saying, smelling, feeling and
tasting. And in one part of this also is said to be the virtue of searching,
called Phantasia: (...) ^
which virtue takes all the forms or ordinances, disposed of the
aforsaide.v. wits, according to the mouinge and removing of sensible
things. In the other part of the said ventricles, is ordained the virtue
imaginative, which represents to the virtue memoratiue, what so ever it
receives of the common wits: Virtue imaginatyue.
as ye shape or form of sensible things c. as they were received from
without.

In the mydell cell or ventricle is constituted the virtue cogitatyue, Virtue
cogitatiue, or estimatyon.
or estimation: which ponders, weighs, judges, and declares, all such
things as are thereto offered and brought from the aforsayde virtues. Now
lastlye, the fourth or hyndermoste ventricle of Cerebellum, contains and
preserves in it self the virtue memoratiue: The virtue memoratiue.
Whereby it is noted the cell or store house, of that excellent virtue of
memory, or remembrance. From the which Cerebellum (at the extreme parts
thereof) proceeds forth the Medulla, or pith of the back, Nucha.
which as Galen saith, is of one substance with the brain: and is clothed
with like panicles, passing down in the holownesse of the spondilles, or
turning joints, (...). i. Spina dorsi.
even to ye end of the ridge And as the whole frame of spondils together, is
(of the likeness it has by reason of his manifold scraggy processes with
the thorne) called Spina dorsalis in Greek M^tiaea acantha: (...)..i. medulla
dorsalis.
So is this marrow called N^tiaeos myelos, id est dorsalis, uel spinalis
medulla, and vulgarlye Nucha.

The.ii. Chapiter.
Of the soft and also the harde panicles of the brain, and the vicinitye that
they have with the skyn covering the sculle, and necessary notes thereof
gathered. Then of the brains increasyng with the moan, and by what means the
brain is purged of his excrementes.
ANd immediately above the brain and the reast before spoken of, is ordained a
very tender skyn or covering, called in English the soft pannicle, in
Latin Pia matter, (...). i. pia matter sieve tenuis meninx.
Tenuis meninx* being yet of a more strong and tough substance then the
brain, that it may defend and save the brain and his delicate parts, from
the hardness of the harder pannicle, and the bones of the scull. And this
soft mother or tender pannicle, is thinlye and finely woven together of veins
and arteries, in a fine netlyke, or copweblyke sort. And it is divided, lying
lose from the brain, least it should be a burden to the same, offendynge it
thereby: saving in certain places, where veins and arteries proceed from this
tender pannicle, entering into the spaces and deuisyons, of the parts and
ventrycles of the brain. Whereby (or by such rather as he gathers together,
fro al parts of the brain) he sucks of ye brainy substance, yielding also to
ye brain, by those veins arteries, nurishmet, lively spirit: which spirit
being there farther digested, or by the natural workynge of the brain altered:
is made accordant to the virtue animal. And in this panicle are these veins
implanted, least otherwise lying lose, they might be thrust together or
disordered, by the beatynge of the brain.

Then next above this tender pannicle or soft veyle, is constitute the
strong mother, or ^oughe veyle, called the harde pannicle, Dura matter.
in latin Dura matter, or Crassa meninx: Crassa meninx*
which is harder and tougher to the end that it may defend the brain and
the soft pannicle, from the hardness of ye bone, by the valiente strength
thereof. And it is woven together clothlyke, by a strong holding or compaction
together, of arteries and veins whereby it is thick and strong. It is also
severed and divided from the soft pannicle generally, save only where
certain veins and arteries go from him to the said subtle veyle, or
delicate pannicle, to help, comfort, and corroborate the same. Neither hath
this harde pannicle, his continuance with the skull, called Caluari, after any
touching or cleauinge sort, but is seperate from the same, least it should
receive general hurt thereof, by reason of the bones hardness: except only in
the seames or commissures of the sculle, whereas certain fine and small ^eary
veins and arteries, (...).
proceed from it through ye said seames: as well to preserve the same from
falling down on the brain as also to the making of the skyn, (...) ^
immediately covering the scull, called therefore Pericarnion. Wherefore it
appears by reason, that all cuttynges, raspynges, trepanynges, or boringes,
are to be avoided in the seames of the scull, unless very great necessity
constreigne: least dangerous and deadly accidents follow, both to the hard
and soft pannicle, and also to the brain and that by the natural affinitye
and unity, they have ^ne with an other.

The like fear and consideration ought to be, as well at the conjunction, as
at the opposition of the moan with the Son. For the brain has then a
marvelous semblance, with the sea and waters, which at those times, have
their full spring tides. For even so doth the brain seem to flow, bearing
up the said pannicles so nigh the sculle, that it might be soon hurt with
instruments at such a time. And here is to be noted a marvelous provision of
nature in the scull, that at such rising of the pannicles by flowing of the
brain, the conspicuous veins and arteries of Dura matter be not hurt: nor by
the hardness of the bones pressed together: whereby ye course of the blood
might be let. For every such vein, and branch of vein, has in the scull an
holowe gutter, to lye in safely without hurt, or let of course, as in the
insyde of every scull may be scene, both great and small gutters, according
to the quantity, form, number, and diversity of vein branches in the harde
pannicle. Now the superfluityes of the brain are expelled in this sort.
Purgation of the brain.
From the former and middle ventricles, they fall down by two evident ways
into a round and holowe receptacle, commonly called in Latyne Lacuna, Lacuna.
which doctor Langton englisheth a dropynge pan: but the grecians (because of
the form, which is wide above, (...).
and ever the lower the narower, with a perforation in the bothome after the
man^er of a funnell) most proprely call it Choanen, and the latynes
Infundibulum. By the which funell hole, Infundibulum.
it passes the strainynge glandule, called Aden colatorius: Ade colatorius
(...) os cribrosum* (...) hoc est Spongiosum.
and then through the strainynge holes of the bones, having the offyce of a
syue, the form of a sponge, and are therefore called in Greek Ostea Isthmoidea,
but more proprelye of Hippocrates spongoidea. Whose passages end into the
holownesse of the palate over the mouth, which holownesse being destingued
with a pillourlike process, hath two perforations into the nose, called in
Latin Nares, that is the nostrils: through which the said superfluitnes
are purged forward. Nares.
And it has also by the Gargarion backward other sufficient passage,
Gargareon.
whereby by snuffing into the mouth, there may be sufficient purgation, as
necessity requires.

The third Chapiter.
Of the scull with his form and office, the number and names of bones, whereof
it is composed: with their form and propre^y^s, and the like of the seames or
comm^res thereof.
Upon these.ii. pannicles, (...) ^.
Duram matrem, Piam matre, is ordained the bones of the skull, (called in greek
(...) and in latin Caluaria:) ^.
^hiche is divided into ^ire, beside the bone called Paxilla. (...).
Whose beginning is at the end of the hinder bone of the head: (...) ^.
whose shape or form is like the letter. ^
V. or as some write like yt Greek letter Lamb^a, ^ or as Iohannes de Vigo
saith, like this figure 7. And the aforsayd Paxilla, vnderbeareth in ye hinder
part al the bones of ye head, ^
therefore is called the bearer up or ye wedglike bone, of the Greeks Sphenoide,
of the latins Cuneus, for it is like a wedge. (...) (...).
The first bone of ye skull is the bone of the fo^ead, and it is called
Coronale, whose form shape is in manner of half a circle, procedynge forth
into the fore part, and is fastened with the bone of the nose in the fore-part
thereof, in the manner of a saw, with the temple with other parts. And he is
fastened to the upper jaw also in the manner of a saw: there is made a kind
of fasteninge, in the (...) or fashion of a cross, Parietalia (...) lateralia
whose upper seam is long. Then ye two wall or side bones of the head called
Parietalia, or Lateralia (...) in greek Bregmatis ossa are joined together in
the myddest of the head, with a seam in the manner of a saw, between them
selves, ^.
with the bone called Occiput, or Os la (...), which is ye hinder bone of the
head, like this letter. ^. as I said before, ^
which Lauda, is also vulgarelye called Occipital^ and under this bone is set
the bone called Paxilla as it is above written, called also more commonly
Basilare: it is not fastened, with such evident seames to him, as other are:
but it only vnderbereth him. And upon the side bones, or wall bones on the left
side, on the right side are, ii. bones (under the which be the eaces) called
Ossa mendosa, and in greek Lepid^s, which be not fastened to the side bones with
seames, but by joining or setting of part unto part, in the manner of scales.

For the which cause Galen calls them Cortices squa^nas, Cortices.
and other Ossa Squamosa, Squa^ae.
and in the lower part of this bone (being harde and stony, Os Petraeum.
and therefore called Petraeum, or Petrosum being also a part of the bone
Mendosum) behind the upper jaw, Os Petrosum.
is (in each of them) a great hole by the which passes the synewe of
hearing. The commissurres of ye scull (...).
Thus may you see, that the bones comprehendynge the brain, are numbered to be
six, beside the bone which bears up all the react, fulfillynge the form or
shape of the head, Sutura. (...). Similis.
named ^axilla as is aforesaid. And note that the seames of the scull, as it is
wytnessed (ex Galeno de ossibus, (...). i. Sutura arct^alis aut Coronalis.
in all the whole do represent the figure of this letter. H. Notwithstanding,
the seam of Osis Laudae, being like the Greek letter Landa. is called
therefore Sutura Landoeides uel greece, Labdoeides Raph^. And the seam of ye
Coronall, is called in Greek Stephan^aea, (...). enim coron^ significat.
in latin Coronalis Arctualis or the ship seam, because it represents the
form of a boat or ship. The third right or straight seam passing
between the bones Pari^talia, (...). i. tunica Caluariam contegens.
and touching with his ends the coronal and occiptall bones, is called of the
Grecians Obeliaea Raphe, and in Latin S^tura Sagittalis.

The.iiii. Chapter.
Of the skyn covering the scull, then o^ the fleshy skin, and the vitermoste
of all, where in is the near, with a convenient note concerning incisyons of
the head.
IMediatlye then upon the scull, (...).
is fixed and set the pannicle, called Pe^icranion: which enuironeth,
compasses, and encloses all the whole substance of the scull: and is tied to
the pannicle wythinforthe, called Dura matter. by small veins and arteries,
passing through the seames of yt skull, as before is said. And upon this skyn
is situate an other thick, Membrana carnosa.
lacertous, fleshy skin, which is Membrana carnosa, comoly found each where under
the true skyn, above ye which is ye said true skyn, Heer of the head.
(in which grows the hear of the head:) which is woven together with
veins, arteries, synewes, coming from within forth: and especially it is
woven of the synewes, which come from the holes of the first and second
spondilles of the neck, which meddle them selves with veins and arteries,
weaving together the skyn covering the scull. And this skin is made harde,
having in him self a thin little fleshy substance, which makes it the greater
and the thicker. NOTA*
And understand well here, that when cuttynges must be made in the head,
that they shall be best most formable, that be made according to the growing
of the hears: for why the sinews of the fleshye skin proceed that way for
the most part. Incisions of the head.
And it is to be noted, that incisions ought not to be made generally after
the proceedings (by length) of the grains: as for example. In the forehead,
the grains of the skyn go ouerth wart, and yet the cuttynges, and
especially those that be deep, ought to be made after the length, cross and
overthwart the grains: for the synewes of the head proceed according to ye
length, and not after the grains.

The.v. Chapiter.
Of the nose.
IN the fore part of the head, between the eyes is constituted the nose:
Which is made of bones and grystles, lacertous flesh and skin, called in Greek
Rhia and in latin Ni^us. For the better declaration whereof, first note, yt
there are two notable processes, (...).
holowe, and of a sinewye substance, coming from the brain, taking root not
far from the synewes of syghte, which some men (estemynge them sinews) cal
Neruos Olfactibiles: ^.
affirming them to proceed of the third coniugation of the brains sinews. But
other more diligently weighing their beginninges and procedynges, deny them to be
proprelye synewes, (with whom I consent) naminge them only the organes of
smelling. And these organes have at their extreme ends within the forheade,
at the upper end of the nostrils certain eminences like in form to the
tetes or neples of women's breasts, and these receive the odor, Virtue of
smelling.
smell and savour of all things, plesante or noisome, through the
nosethrylles. which nosethrils or nose holes, (...). Nares.
call them as you list, are common with the gutter over the palate of the
mouth, which gutter as is before said, has also ways by the gurgulion
into the mouth: by reason whereof, when the mouth is shut, the air may
pass in and out through them, Utiiltyes of the nose.
by the drawing of the lunges. And as Galen saith, the nose is the principal
setter forth of the face, concerning the favour or due proportion thereof: For
where the nose wants says he, there the face is much deformed and
lothelye. And the nose is an offyciall member, and the instrument of smelling,
by the means of the aforsayde Organes, and stands out a little convenient
way, without the rest of the face. And because the creast bone of it, which
divides the nosethrils, and makes them twain, has a gristlye addityon, The
gristlye addityon of the nose.
the nose is flexible, and may be somewhat bowed, according to the will, which
is so ordained by nature, that it may the more conveniently, be purifyed
cleansed from the filth which the brain is purged of, by that necessary
mean. And finally the nose, through his foresaid office of smelling, presents
to the common wits, the savor of all things, either pleasant or noyful to the
same.

The.vi. Chapiter.
Of the eyes.
THere are also in ye fore-part of the head, Oculus.
under ye forhed ordained.ii. eyes, which be called yt watch me of yt body
therefore have their place so high, as it is most mete for that office. And as
Galen witnesses in the.vii. book, de Iuuamentis, the second chapiter, the
brain the head were chiefly made for the eyes, that they being the
instruments of sight, and the guiders and leaders of man, might be set in the
highest place, of all the frame of the body, there to be as* viewers, and
espyers of all manner of things. Even as it were watch men, which are for
that intent set in the highest place of a city, (...), i. oculus.
and they are called in Greek Ophthalmi, and in latin Oculi. And they are
constitute and made of three humores, (...). l. V^siuus, uel perspectiuus
neruus.
. vii. coats or tunicles, after this manner as follows. First out of yt
fore-part of the brain, proceeds, ii. hollow sinews called Nerui optici,
which as Gale declares in the.iiii. book, de morbo accidetibus in the first
chapiter are hollow as a rede, that for.ii. principal causes. The first is, yt
the visible spirit might pass aptly to the eyes. Uisible spirit
The second is, yt through the the form of visyble things might readily be
presented to the common wits, they are ye first pair of ye synewes of ye
brain. And immediately after their proceedings they unite the selves into one
sole holownes, from ye holownes they go forth in twain, as they go out at the
holes of the scull, they be clothed with the.ii. panicies of the brain, each
panicle giving a propre coat of his own substance unto them. And of these
synewes with their two clothinges aforsaid, and of the skin covering the skull
are br^ the foresaid tunicles or orbs, (...): Retiformis Ocul^ Tunica.
in which the.ii. humores are holden and contained. These coats are
numbered.vii. by reason of their diversities, in place, form, and office, as ye
shall hear. First of the optike sinews bredeth the most fine and tender
tunicle, called of Galen backwardly, or inwardly Amphiblestrocides, (...)* i.
tunica arar^osa uel aranae (...) Humour Crystallinus.
in latin Retiformis tunica, because it resebleth a net: but forwardly, or
outwardly, it is called in Greek Arachnoeides, and in latin Aranea tela:
because it is like a cobweb: and herein is holden the crystal humore which is
likened of diverse authors to a hail stone, and is called in latin Humour
Crystallinus.

Then of Pia matter bredeth a skin, whose inward part, (...). i. tunica
Similis secundis.
because in some point it is like to Chorion, (which is the second birth
covering,) is therefore called in greek Cheroeides, and in Latin Secundina:
but in the forparte it is called in Greek Rhagoeides, and in Latin, Vuea,
because there it resembles the grain of a grape, (...). i. Vuea ocula tunica.
being as some write of a black colour. A part whereof is planted in the
myddest, being in form like the cover of a mortar, composed of many fine
streams, like the hears of the eye lyddes or beams of the Sun, Humour
aqueus, uel Albugineus.
deuyding through yt form the waterye humore before, called Aqueus, and
Albugineus, and the glasy humore behind (called Vitreus,) Humour Vitreus.
a sonder: and having a round hole in the midst, contains edglynge the
crystalline humore, much like as the Horizonte comprehends the Globe. And
then the rest of V^ea forward, (which hath in the midst a certain hole,
wherein is made the pupille:) conteyneth in his circuit the humore Vitreus.

Thirdly of dura matter, is made an other tunicle, named in greek Ceratoeides,
(...).
and commonly in Latin, in the hinder part or inwardly Sc^erotica, and in
the forparte outwardly Cornea: because it has there the likeness of a most
bright or clear lantern horne: Tunica Cornea, uel translucida.
and this contains within it all these coats, and humores all ready said.

Then last of all, of the pannicle Peric anaeum bredeth an other tunicle,
Sclerotica.
called Cohaerens* and Agnata, and vulgarlye Coniunctiua: Cohaeres, Agnata.
which covers all the eye, saving that part of Cornea, which appears in
the midst of the eye outward, and covers the Pupilla, Coniunctiua.
which is the black of the eye, about the which is a circuit called Iris,
Pupilla.
or Corona. And this Coniunctiua is it that is called the white of the eye,
Iris. Corona.
and the circles of these tunicles, in their endinges, or going together in
the fore part of the eye, do make the circuit above said: which being of
diverse and for dry colours, is called Iris, because in that propretye it
resembles a rainbow.

Thus lo have I showed as briefly as may be, how and whereof these tunicles are
constitute: in what manner also and order, they contain the.iii. humores of
the eye, and for what cause these tunicles are numbered seven: although it may
be as truly said, that there are but.iiii. as the ingenious of the words
before may easily gather. And from the second coniugation of sinews of the
brain, do proceed the sinews which enter into the making of the.vii.
muscles: whereof the eye has power to move, and turn every way, according to
the will.

In the corners of the eyes are fartharmore curnels, by the which are
engendered, and from the which are shed the tears that at any time flow
from the eyes, after the opinyon of diverse learned.

Outwardly also the eyes have lyddes, (...) i. Palpebra^ aliquibus ta^ Gena.
whose offyces are as well to preserve by winckinge, the eyes from hurt
outwardly, as also to close them from the lyghte, geuyng them rest in time of
sleep: but chieflye of all, they defend and cover the eyes, from to much
vehement brightness of any light, or from the sodainnesse thereof least the
visible light of ye eyes, should thereby be confounded. For by this benefit of
lids, the eyes are marvelously eased, comforted, and the sight (as it were
by renewing) refreshed. And the veins that come to the eyes, and eye lids, do
come brauchynge from the vein of the temples: whereof it appears, that when
any course of humores, as what blood or any other moisture, do run from
the brain and the head into the eyes: it shall be profitable to cut the
branch (that comes from the temple vein) ouerthwarte, or a cross: for so
shall the superfluous course of such humores be stopped. And I find also in
good authors, NOTA.
yt the Phlebotomy of the forehead vein, also of the veins by the nose,
called Triplices, are most necessary for to help the diseases of the eyes.

The.vii. Chapiter.
Of the upper and the nether Jaws, with the number, figure, and several
offyces of the teethe.
Under the eyes (in the forparte) and under the nose is the upper jaw, Maxilla
superior.
called Maxilla superior, the bones whereof are of diverse authors diversely
nubred. For Guido (aledginge Galen for his authority) says, that there be ix.
bones in the upper jaw: unto whom Brunswike consents without
contradictyon: which opinyon Geminus thinckinge to disprove, reasons thus.
There can not be found.ix. bones (says he,) unless the nether jaw be
accounted with the upper, and then there should be.x. for the nether jaw is
made of.ii. bones: whereof I gather that Geminus accounted but.viii. though he
after (forgetting him self) where he numbereth generally all the bones
affirms xii. But Lanfrancus and Vigo account upon.xiiii. not showing their
compactions, but affirmynge the same to be unknown, or at the least harde to
be found. Notwythstandynge Carolus Stephanus noting their negligence doth
prove xv. particular bones in the upper jaw. But that is by accomptinge the
Basilare bone among them, where the two former authors put it among the bones
of the skull, so that the number of.xiiii. as well as.xv. are both true, their
minds understanded, and their order considered. But who so will understand
their several names and numbers, with also their true seats and conexions,
let them read Carolus Stephanus, where they may be satisfied, which here for
briefnesse sake I omit.

And now of the teeth called in latin Dentes. (...) Dens.
in Greek Odontes (whereof as well in the upper jaw, as also in the nether jaw
are fastened in some.xvi. and in others but.xiiii) there are (...). i.
incisores dentes (...). i. Canini dentes.
.iii. sorts or orders. The first are the fore teethe called in Greek Odontes
tomici, and in Latin Incisores or cutters. The second are those sharpe or
pointed ones, among which are the eye teeth, so called because dangerous
accidences do follow to the eyes, by the drawing or pluckynge out of them: and
these are of their sharpness called dog teeth, and therefore in latin
Canini, and in Greek Cynodotes. The third^ sort are the tuskles which the
Greeks call Gomphious Mylas, (...) i. molares (...) enin m^la. est.
the latines Maxillares Molares, yt is grynders. And upon this upper jaw is
fastened a pannycle or skin, growing of the pannicle covering the bone of ye
forheade, and of the third pair of part of the fourth pair of synewes of
the brain, and the part next unto him, and of the second pair of synewes of
Nucha. And thus is there made a convenient skyn to cover him. And the synewes
that come to this making, come partly from the brain, and partly from Nucha:
which give feeling and moving to the face, and to the palate in the roufe of
the mouth, and to the nose: and that mostelye, in the entrance of the making
of the muscles, at these aforsayde parts. Wherefore the incisyons that ought
to be done in these parts, as in the upper jaw or the nose, Incisions of the
upper jaw and t^nose.
must be done according to the going of the grains of the skyn. For the
going of the grains, and the procedynge of the synewes in the nose, and in
the upper jaw, is all one way, and nothing contrary.

And from the second, third, and the fourth payer of sinews of Nucha, Of
the nether jaw.
comes synewes to the muscles of the jaws, which move the nether jaw or
cheke hone. This nether jaw is made of two bones, Maxilla inferior.
which he joined together in the manner of saw: in the hinder part they are
joined with the knottye part of the jaw. Galenus de Anatomica
administratione. lib. 4.
In which nether iaw also be fired in some.xvi. in some but.xiiii. teeth: and
as well the teeth in the upper jaw, as also those in the nether jaw, are
bound with the coupled bindinges and skins, that proceade of Pericranium,
which is made of the harde pannicle of the brain, NOTA.
as is aforesaid. And this is the cause that ache of the teeth is oftentimes
cause of payne in the head and brain, Emu^ctorye place of the brain.
and brings disease and offence, to all the whole head. And under the jaw
and ears, where the glandules or curnelles are, is the emunctorye place, where
as the brain purges it self of all venomous and unnatural things, by
putting forth of Apostemes.

The.viii. Chapiter.
Of the lyppes, the chekes, the mouth and the Tungue.
Upon the upper and the nether jaws are fixed yt lips called in greek Chiloi
in latin Labia, (...). i. labru, uel labiu.
which are doors to the mouth, ayders of speech, and instruments of
pronunciations. (...). i. Gena.
And also the chekes (called Gena, in Greek Blephara) the seats of
shamefastness, the prospectes of man his complexion, and the walls of the
mouth: Whose offyces are many and diverse. But to avoid all ambiguity, these
chiefly are in them to be noted of the good chirurgie. They are consimilare,
compound, musculye, sinowye, skinnye, and of spongye lose parts, such as (if
they be wasted) are unpossible to be restored. Wherefore great heed ought to
be taken that no substance in them be wasted or lost, for if there be, the
Cicatrix will puckar them together (like the gatheringe or shrocklynge of
leather or parchmente at the fire, in such wise that the mouth will be drawn
a wry. And farther if (they being worn through) their substance be in great
quantitye wasted, it is not possible to be so repaired, that there shall not
ever after remain a whole through. So that in such case many times, the
teeth ever after are seen through the chekes, and the substance of meat and
drink is ready there always to issue out, when the party so grieved eats.

Within this compass then is the mouth enclosed, of the which all wryters of
Anatomye note.v. things to be considered. To wet the tungue, the teeth, the
lyppes, the palate or roufe of the mouth, and the Vuula: of all which
(because I speak particularly of them:) I need not here to say any more
generally: Wherefore I will now proceed to the tungue.

Betwixt the upper jaw and the nether, The tunge. (...). Lingua.
is set the Tungue, called Lingua, in greek Glossa. The which is made of a
soft flesh and white, veiny, chordy sinewy: and it takes his sinewy substance
of the syxte payer of synewes of the brain: and is called there the synewe of
speaking.

And of the seventh pair of sinews of the brain, ye tongue receives the
synewe of moving. And it is to be noted, that the tungue, the roufe of the
mouth, and the stomach, with the pipe thereof called Oesephagus, are clothed
all with one sensible synewye pannicle, coming from the brain: as experience
proves, that who so touches the tongue or roufe of the mouth ne'er the
throat, the stomach will tikle, and caste up by vomit, Utilityes of the
tungue.
all that is in it. And iii. causes I find why that the tungue was ordained
The first is, that it is a help to turn the meat in the mouth, that it may
the more effectually be ground small, and chawed with ye teeth. The second
offyce of the tongue is, to decern the taste of things, whether they be
sweet or sour, bitter, sharpe, or any other: presenting or enforminge the
same to the common wits. Thirdly it is the instrument of speech, for
without the tungue, there could be perceived no distinction of voices, Ueines
under the tugue
nor of words. And under ye tungue are.ii. veins, NOTA.
which appear, when it is lifted up, which are opened for diseases of the
tugue and the throat: Angina greece. (...).
as Angina, and other affects. But here ought heed to be taken, that
Phlebotomy be not done in the tugue, unless there be a general blood lettynge
before, or elsse ventosynge in the shoulders, or elsse that the body be
purged, with a medicine or a clister. For the Phlebotomye of the tongue
draws, augments, and multiplyeth the disease in the root of the tungue:
and especially if the body be replete or stiptike, unless some of those
remedies go before, of which I have spoken.

The.ix. Chapiter.
Of the ears.
Next after the jaws, (...). i. Auris, plurale (...) aures. Vnde (...). i.
auricula.
and under the bones Parietalia, on the right side and on the left side, are
ordained the ears, (which are called in Greek Ota, and in Latin Aures:) and
set on each side upon the harde bone Petrosu, which is a part of the bone
Mendosum, having in the holownesse thereof a wrinkled crookednesse, ending
with a number of pores. By reason of which crookednesse, there may pass no
instrument into the ears, be it never so fine no not a bristle, (as Galen
says in the nynthe eleuenthe books of the use of parts.) Unto which
holownesses on both sides do come the synewes of bearing, called Nerui
audibiles, Nerui audibiles.
which are of the fifth coniugation of synewes of the brain, which are said
to be hollow. And whereas they come to the holes of the ears, they are wrythed
much like a vine press, and are made at the ends like the heads of worms,
and upon these bones is made grows a broad gristle, which we cal ye ear,
whereon are planted certain sesyble synewes, coming fro the skin that covers
the skull: wherwt also are conjoined some soft fleshy parts, certain wryncles of
veins and synewes half round. NOTA.
Which the chirurgien must cut acco^dinge to that form, when any cuttynges
be needful in that place.

The.x. Chapiter.
Of the neck with the.vii. turnynge joints thereof, and his other contents.
Under the head in the hinder part is the pith or marowe of the back called
Nucha, Nucha.
and in greek Notiaeos Myelos, (...). i. Me dulla Spinalis. Spondils of the
neck are vii.
(under about ye which are ye.vii. spondilles or turning joints of the neck
called Septem Ceruicis uertebrae.) Out of the which Nucha between the
spondilles, go out.vii paier of sinews, so yt the first payer go out of the
first holes of the spondilles. The which holes are set against ye beginning of
Nucha, whereas the said Nucha departs from the brain. And this first payer,
spread the selves upon ye skin of the head, and there are made part of the
muscles. The second pair go out of the second hole, between the first
spondill and the second, and it goes to the skin of the head, and gives
mouinge unto it: and in some parts, it joins it self with the muscles of
the neeke, and the cheke bones, and gives moving unto them. Or rather at a
hole that is made on each side between every.ii. spondilles.
The third pair go out of the third spondill, which are spread and departed,
unto the moving of the broad bone of ye shoulder. The fourth pair, in like
manner go out of the upper holes of the fourth spondill, procedinge from thence
to the muscles, as well of the fore-part, as the hinder part of the back. The
fifth pair going out of the upper holes of the fyfthe spondille, are spread
upon the muscles of the midriffe, and to the muscles moving the head, and
after to the muscles of the shoulder blades. The sixte pair goes out of the
upper holes of the vi. spondil. The.vii. pair likewise goes out of ye upper
hole of the seventh spondil, which in their going out are departed upward and
downward, upon the muscles of the neck, the head, the breast, and the throat.

And after the synewes muscles, Ueines of the neck.
there are ordained in the neck, veins arteries, both open and hid. in the
neck be.ii. veins openly appearinge behind the ears: Of the which the
cuttinge is dreadefull and dangerous, because of the natural heat in the
received of the heart, and the affinity they have with the brain. For when they
are cut, there follows ^wounding, and diseases of many kinds, of their great
bleding. And after the cutting they will not lightly be stopped: whereupon
oftetimes follows death. And therefore it plainly appears, yt in al the
apostemes of ye neck, or in what case or disease so ever happen in the neck,
wherein cutting must be had: that those cuttinges must be done according to the
length, because of ye growing of the sinews, members of the neck. NOTA.
And the aforsaid veins arteries the which he there tied together, ought to be
considered, for fro those manifest veins arteries under the ears, there
proceed together other veins and arteries, in such wise, yt ye can not pierce
nor cut the veins, but that the arteries also must be pierced and cut: of which
doing should succeed the dangerous accidents aforesaid.

The xi. Chapiter.
Of the throat and the contents thereof, as the wind pipe, and the Epiglot,
the Uvula, and Almondes of the throat. c.
IN the forpart of the spondils of the neck beside ye throat, is set the pipe
of the stomach, ^
(called Meri or Oesophagus) by whom meat drink passes to the stomach,
which is made of strings, veins, and arteries, ^ coming from the sixte
pair of ^ And it is fastened in the throat with the sharpe arterye or pipe of
the lunges called Arteria aspera in greek Tracheia artesria, (...). i. aspera
Canalis qua Vox editur.
Pharynx and Larynx (though some dividing it somewhat more exactlye apply
these two last names, and that most truly, to the upper part of the same)
which is made of gristles and of synewes, (...). i. fistula spiritalis
coming from the syxte payer of synewes of the brain: and it is grainye and
has little hoops, in the utter part. And where as it grows with Oesophago
(or the pipe of the stomach,) in the upper end, it is even and soft.

And the throat is the beginning of the said conductes or pipes, in which
there is an empty place, where as are fixed the two amigdales: Amigdales of
the throat.
that is to say, the two pieces of flesh of the form of two almondes, one on
the right side and an other in the left. And these amigdales be fleshye and
sinewye, that they may be the stronger: for they give entrance to the meat
and drink, that it may easily pass into the conduicte (called Oesophagus.)
And they also help the aer, (...). i. Ligula. Lingula sieve minor lingua.
to enter into Tracheia arteria by the Epiglot, for upon the upper end of
these ways or pipes is a certain covering, which the greeks call
Epiglottiden, and the Latines. Ligulam. That in the time of eating, there enter
into ye sharpe artery so to the lunges no hurtful thing, nor any thing but
aer, or things like unto aer. And thou shalt understand by Epiglottiden, the
knot in the throat, at the end of the pipe, which knot falls down, and
makes diverse voices. And when a man eats or swaloweth his meat, it covers
Arteriam asperam, or the way of aer: but when one speaks, it is turned
upwards, so resting erected between both the passages, until through the
occasyons above said, there be need of lying down again as before. For as
we may see, when men do talk and eat both at once, it often chances, that
a cromme falls into ye sharpe artery: at which time they can not leave
coughinge, till the said cromme (or what so it is) be cast forth again.
Operculum Laringis.
And this Epiglottis is also called in Latyne of some Operculum Laringis.

And above the root of the tungue is a certain instrument, (...). ^. Columus
Columella aut Gurgulio
that cleaves to the palate in the inner part of the mouth, called in greek
Kion, of the ancients Gargareon, and in Latin Gurgulio: which is necessary
to break the aer, and to make diverse voices. And sometime it happens, yt it
excedeth his due form by diverse affects, by the which also it varyeth by
names: as when it excedeth in length, it is of that form called Columella,
and when in roundness like a grape, Vuea. Vuula.
it is called Vuea, or Vuula.

Upon these pipes are ordained diverse synewes, great small, open and privy:
which come from the syxte and seventh pair of synewes of the brain, and they
are meddled with the muscles of the neck and throat, with the third and
fourth pair of synewes of Nucha.

Upon the right side and upon the left side of the pipe of the lunges,
Guidegi Iugulares.
called Arteria aspera, are certain great and manifest black veins, called
Guidegi Iugulares and under them are. ii. arteryes: of whose cuttinge and
persynge, the blood runs from the heart and lunges, NOTA.
from whence they come. Whereby the lunges are diseased and hurt, and their
natural pour hindered and let, and also it brings diseases to the heart,
whereupon often times sudden death follows: Incisions in the throat.
And therefore all the incisions that be made in the throat, ought to be done
after the length. wherefore it is necessary that we eschew the veins of the
throat, and especially those that be great, and those that ^e called
Iugulares or Guidegi. For under every vein of the throat, is hid an arterye,
in the which, there proceeds spirit of life and natural heat, immediately
from the heart and the lunges. And therefore it openly appears that all
cuttings of this place are dreadful and perilous. NOTA.


Understand that the throat is fastened to the furcle of the breast, Pixis
gulae.
in the place called Iugulum, or Pixis Gulae* which is the box, or holownesse
of the throat: and the neck is fastened with the hinder part of the seuenthe
spondill, which is the first spondill of the breast: and also it is fastened
with the spade bone of the shoulder, that it may move the better, and the more
mightilye, when need requires: That the shape and form thereof, may also be
scene the fairer and the better. And between the shoulders behind, at the
nether end of the neck, Place for vent^synge.
are ventoses used, for diverse diseases of the head, and the parts thereof:
both with scarification and without scarification, as in good authors ye shall
rede, as the expert Chirurgien, knows by experience.

THE SECOND PART OF the Anatomy, treating of the form and shape of the
shoulder, and the adiutory of the arm, the hand, and the fyngers.
The.i. Chapiter.
Of the shoulder and the chan^ll bone.
AFter the neck and the throat, as well on the right side as on the left,
Humerus.
is ordained a shoulder, called Humerus, in greek Omos, and of some Brachio.
Wherein there are (...) i. humerus.
.iii. bones knyt, that by the means of that form and shape, the making
thereof may be the more noble and fair: and also the more profytable to mouynge
and workynge. The first of these bones, is the broad bone of the shoulder,
which many learned men call Scoptulum opertum, (...). i. Humerus latus.
and the Grecians O^oplatan. i. humerum latuni, and we vulgarlye Spatulam:
whose form and fashion in the hinder end or part toward the neck, Spatula.
is broad like a bakers pele. And in his length he has an edge, that
stretches to the head of this bone toward the shoulder, passing endlynge to
the broad end, which is toward the neck. In which broad end is knit a
gristle, which spreads a lunge beside the spondilles of the breast, unto the
seventh spondill of the neck. And on the other end, toward the shoulder,
this bone waxes great, in the end whereof is a holownesse, which is called
the box of the shoulder bone. Wherein the round head of the adiutorye
turns, as it accords to necessity in the workinge of this member.

This bone was made in this manner, that the bones of the breast and of the
neck, should be the stronger and surer in the shoulder, and that the
adiutorye should not be dislocate or put out of joint, for every lyghte
cause. And by this it manifestly appears that the bone of the adiutory, can
not be dislocated backward.

In the former part of the shoulder, (...) i clauis (...) ut Clauis a clau
dendo. Iugulum. Iurcule.
is ordained a bone called Clauis, or Iugulum, in greek Cleis, and in English
ye furcule or canel bone, which is tied with the broad bone, being the
second of the.iii. bones of the shoulder: and it is there set, that this
member may abide the better in his strength, and to bear up that place, that
it go not out forward by any small or lyghte occasion. And this bone is
less then the broad bone of the shoulder in his knitting, that the shape of
that place may be the fairer and ye more formable, and also that it should
not let the mouynge of the adiutorye. And so it plainly appears, by reason
of the being less of this bone in that part: that the roundness of the
adiutorye may be dislocate forward.

And after these bones, there are insensible ligamentes, which bind and knit
those bones together. And there is a certain lygature in the middle of the
aforesaid box or holownesse, entering the round end of the adiutory: which
knytteth the said round end with the aforesaid box. Of the breaking and over
stretchinge of which, NOTA.
succedeth a continual departing: so that thereby the restoringe of the
dislocation is let or hindered: In so much that other while when the bone is
reduced, and brought again to his situation and being, after the restoringe
thereof, it will leap or spring out again. Emunctorie place of the heart.
And under the shoulder, between the arm and the body, is the place
emunctory, whereas the heart doth send forth (in the time of Pestilence or
other venomous fevers,) such things as are unto him noious and contrary: as
experience proves, of the filthy Apostemes that there come forth at such
times in that place.

The.ii. Chapiter.
Of the bone adiutorium, then of ye elbow, the arm the hand, with the number,
figure, and offyces of the bones, and other parts in these contained.
THe third bone of the shoulder is the adiutory, which is round without, Os
adiutoriu. (...)
and hollow within, called Brachion.i. humerus* and commonly Aditorium os.

This bone is great, thyn, and in his holownesse full of marowe, of which
marowe he receives necessary moystnesse. And his upper end is round, going
into the bore of the shoulder bone, where it is knit and turns about:
hold between his ligatuues, with the other two bones in that place, as it is a
above said.

The other end of the adiutorye is fastened with the ii. cubit bones or
fociles, whereas he has.ii. knots in form like pullies, which enter into
the holowe cups and cavities of the two Focilles per Enarthrosin, whose names
are beneth written: whereof the upper focil or cubit bone is the less, and
stretches from the thumb unto the joint of the elbow. But the other bone is
somewhat greater and longer, stretchynge from the nether part, that is from
the little finger to the elbow: and lies upon the ^ther with a little
bearing out like a birds bill, in length to the adiutorye: which bunch or
knobbe makes the form of the elbow when it is bowed* which was made, that
this fasteninge with the end of the adiutorye, with the roll or pulley
thereof in the holowe cup, should be the more strong. And that it should
not be dislocate or anointed, with any small occasion: Therefore is the upper
focile supported upon the head of the adiutorye. And this place is bound with
strong insensible bonds, that by that means the situations of the bones may
be strong: and that they may abide when a man lifts burdes, and that the
arm go not backward, nor outward. And there the nether focill or mayor bone
of the cubitte, about this passing out, has his shape or form somewhat
bowing. Then next after the elbow, are the.ii. focilles aforsayde: The upper
most whereof is called in Greek Cercis, in Latin Radius and Focile minus. (...)
Radius sieve focile minus.
The nethermoste Pechis, in Latin Vlna, Cubitus, and focile Maius: which are
knit together endlonge, (...). i. Vlna Cubitas, uel focile minus.
by the means of ligamentes going between. And the less bone goes into the
greater, being made both as one. And they are joined, with the compaxion of
bones in ye wrest, called Carpus, or Brachiale: which is made together of
the.viii. bones called Rasseta, four of them being ordained without the
hand, (...). i. Carpus, uel Brachiale.
to the ends of the two focilles: the other.iiii. be knit and bound together
with the bones, of the holowness of the hand, Ossa Rasseta manus.
called Ossa metacarpii. And these bones have no marowe in them, because of
their thick and harde substance: But the focilles have marow in them, for the
cause before told in the bone called Adiutorium. And allthoughe it show not
in the less focill, so manifestly as it doth in the greater or mayor bone,
yet in the less focill is a certain holownesse, in which is found moistness,
in ye manner of marow, which serves there in the stead of marowe.

And after these bones Rasseta, are constitute the bones of the palms of the
hands, called Ostea metacarpi^.i. Post^rachialia, (...), id est Postbrachiale,
palma, uel manus pectus.
Palma, uel manus pectus, which are four in noumber, and are joined closely
together, per synarthrosim with ye forsayde bones Rasseta. And they are
jointly knit together at the other end, with the bones of the.iiii. fingers:
and not with the bones of the thumb. For the first great bone of the thumb,
For Synarthrosis, loke in the.i. chap. of the first treatise.
is knit to the end of the upper focill in the joint, and is thereby made
more strong in mouynge, then the other four: and also by that means it is the
more semelye and comely joined. So of the palm together with the fyngers is
made up the hand, (...). i. Manus
called Manus in greek Cheir. In every finger whereof are three bones, called
Digiti, or Ossa digitorum, Digiti, uel ossa digitorum.
save in the Thumb which hath but it: so yt in the fingers the thube of each
had, are.xiiii. bones. Wherefore with the bones Rasseta, which are eight in
number, (beside the bones Sesaminat) all the bones of the arm from the
shoulder to the ends of the fyngers, are in number.xxx.

Upon these bones and ligamentes hithervnto descrybed, are ordained synewes
which come from the.vi. and.vii pair of synewes of Nucha in the neck: and from
the first of Metaphrenum. Of which synewes (being compound mixed with ligamentes,
and intermedling of flesh,) are made muscles or brawns, which move the
shoulders, the adiutorye, the elbow, Muscles of the brain.
and the arm. In the end of these muscles, come out Chords, whereby the
fyngers are moved, the lower members. Of which muscles, there is one great
and manifest, in the midst of the adiutorye, so that some part of him is
within, and some part without: from ye which are departed the Chords or
tendones, that move the arm after diverse parts. And in the arm is an other
open and manifest muscle, being without the arm, and bespredeth the arm
about: from which departs diverse tendones, which move the fingers inward
and outward, as need requires.

The.iii. Chapiter.
Of the veins of the arm, with their beginninges procedynges, and howe
incision is to be done in the arm and hand.
AFter these muscles are ordained veins, open privy, which serve to
Phlebotomy: of the which there be.vi. in number. Whereof the first is departed
fro the vein under the arm hole, Ueines of the arm.vi. for Phlebotomy.
or from the veins showed in ye arm holes* which passes by the shoulder ( is
therefore called Humeralis) in the nether part or side of the arm, going to
the upper part of the elbow: Cephalica uena. Humeralis uena.
and there it is called Cephalica. For he proceeds of the vein, of which the
one part, goes up to the brain, nurisheth those parts, and the other part
nourishes the members of the arms, by reason whereof, he is so called. And
secondly from Cephalica, there proceeds a branch, which appears between
the thombe and the forefinger, Cephalica ocularis.
and there it is called Cephalica ocularis.

Thirdly from this shoulder vein, comes forth a great conspicuous branch,
beneathe the bought of the arm in the insyde, and from thence passes
slopewise over ye small of the arm, and there is called Funis brachii, Funis
Brachii.
spreading from thence with diverse branches to and on the back of the hand.

From the arm hole in the inside, comes the fourth vein seruinge to
Phlebotomy, which goes by the inner side of the adiutorye unto the elbow,
Basilica sieve Hepatica Vena.
and appears in the nether side of the bought of the arm, and is called
Basilica or Hepatica, which proceeds toward the hand, by the lower focille:
and then there departs from him a branch, which lies in the back of the
hand, between the little finger and the next adioyninge, and there is called,
of diverse men by diverse names, Saluatella sieve. Splenatica
as Saluatella or Plenatica, with such other: and it is the.v vein of
Phlebotomye. Sixtlye in the midst of the bought of the arm, there appears
an other vein, which is made of.ii. branches conjoined together in one:
whereof the one springs of Vena Cephalica the other comes from Vena
Basilica. This vein is called Vena Purpurea, Mediana sieve.
or Nigra, Communis also, Mediana, and of some Cardiaca: Comunis sieve.
and commonly with each of these veins preuilye or apertlye, Cardiaca uena
there is accompanied an arterye. Also the muscles of these places are made of
sinewy fibers, with mixinge of flesh and sinewye pannicles, procedinge styll
after the length. Of veins, arteries, and of feelynge synewes, is made the
utter skin: whereby it is nurished, and made sensyble.

And as well the vei^* whereby it is nourished, and the arteries whereby it ha^
^se, as the sinews, whereby it has felinge and mouinge, proceed in the arm,
all according to the length. NOTA.
These have we made open and plain, to the understanding, because it behooves
the Chirurgien to have respect, howe he makes incisions, (as in opening of
apostemes or otherwise) in these places. For why, for as much as all the
muscles, synewes, tendones, arteryes, and veins of this place: (namely from
the shoulders, to the ends of the fingers,) go and proceed after the length:
it requires, Incisions in the arm.
that the incisions and cauteries of those places, should be done always,
according to the procedynge of the aforsaide members in length.

And it seems that the vein Cephalica, which is in the bought of the arm,
and shows him self in the upper focile, going for the between the thumb
and the forefinger: serves to the head, and the parts thereof. And likewise
the vein that is in the lower part of the bought of the arm, called
Basilica, whose branch (as I said before) appears between the little finger
and the ringe finger, (and there is named Saluatella, serves to the liver and
the spleen: because it proceeds from a part of the vein that nurisheth the
lower members. And also the common vein, which appears in ye midest of ye
bought of ye arm, seems to serve both to ye upper and the nether parts: and
that because he grows both of the shoulder vein called Humeralis, Humeral^
Vena.
and of the arm hole vein called Axillaris, Axillaris Vena.
as it evidently appears.

And note, that all the veins here specified, proceed of that part of Vena
concaua that ascends up to the hart, putting forth one great branch into
the holownesse of the same. And after so ascendinge, is yet divided on each
side into.ii. branches: of the which one branch spredeth to all the rybbes,
to Pleura Diaphragma, nourishing them. The other goes to the fore part of the
breast, and so to the place of the furcle: where it is again triplye divided.
Whereof one branch ascendynge by the neck up to the head, is divided into
all parts of the same: The second goes to the shoulder, and the third to
the arm hole. Of which two do proceed all the deuisyons, whose names and
places of section, are here declared: whereby it appears what coligance and
unity, these veins have with the head, the hart, and the liver.

THE THIRD PART OF Anatomy, which shows the shape form of the furcules,
and of the ribs, of the breast, and the chine bone of that part, unto the
mouth of the stomach.
The.i. Chapiter.
Of the breast and the.xii. turning joints of that region, with the rybbes and
other bones, and parts, as Pleura. c.
Under the throat, in the foreparte thereof, are ordained the.ii. bones called
Claues Furculae, Clauis, Furcula.
and of some Iugula, Iugulum.
in english the canell bones: which he round without, and holowe within. And
they are fastened at the one end in the shoulder, as I have showed in the. ii.
chapiter: At the other end they are fastened together with the uppermost part
of the breast, (...).
at the pit of the throat.

At which pit begins the region of the breast, i. Os prectoale
holding in the fore-part of Pectorale called of Galen Sternon, which is
constytute but of. iii. bones, although some number them vii (as you se
Lanfranke doth,) according to the. vii. lunge ribs of each side joining to
them, which are in dede fastened to those ribs, each of them to other, with
a gristelly substance, that extends it self with a sce^lder flexible point,
beneathe those bones, (like ye point of a sword,) over the mouth of the
stomach: and therefore is called of divers authors in greek Xiphocides, (...).
and in latin Scutiformis, or Ensiformis. i. ensiformis, uel in ensis effigiem
exiens.
Which by his bowing gives room to the stomach: and yet by his gristlye
hardness defends it from hurt. And in that place, or nigh to the same
beneth, is the mouth of the stomach, (...). enim ensis est.
And this length, with the knittinges together, (...). i. pectus, uel Spiritalu^
p^^ium domicilium mummentum.
of gristlye substances, and the making of these bones, with the ribs in the
ridges, is proprelye called the breast, in Greek Thorax, and in Latin Pectus.
And of ryb^es there are on each side.xii. called Costae, which are fastened
with. xii. of the spondils, which are proprelye the spon^ils of the breast,
(...) est Spinae pa^ a Ceruice ad cinctu prote^sa. metaphreni Vertebrae.
and called therefore Metaphreni Vertebrae: as the next of the spondilles
down ward, which be.v. in number are called Lumborum Vertebrae, the
spondilles of ye reins. And those. xii. ribs are bowinge, in the manner of
half a compass: of the which there are vii. called Costae Verae which being
fastened at the hinder ends, with the spondilles of the back, (...). i.
Vertebra uel secundum Vulgos Spondyliu Costae Verae* Costae Spuriae*
are byggest in the myddest: whose former ends are fastened with the gristles
of the. iii. bones of Sternon: v. of those. xii. rybbes are short, and reche
not to Sternon, as do the other. vii. but are only fastened in the spondilles
behind, therefore called Costae Spuriae, in English falls ribs, or backward
rybbes: because when the formoste ends of them be bowed down, they bow upward
again. For they have no fastening at the fore ends, (...). i. Costa secudu
Aristot. aliis Latus. at (...) pro Pleura intelligitur mebrana Costas
succingens.
as have the. vii. great ribs: which are fastened as I said ere while with
the bones of the breast, and take their knittinges of them. note that along the
side, under or within these ribs, is a pannycle or skyn called Pleura, wherein
is engendered the inflammation called Pleuritis, and in Englyshe the pleurisye.

The. ii. Chapiter.
Of the heart.
ANd within those bones, (...). i. lateru dolo^, copunctio, Costalis, at uere
Succingeti^ mebra^ morbus, uel i^matio.
that is to say the bones of the breast, the rybbes, and the spondilles of the
same, within the holownesse that is made of them, I say is the heart, named in
Greek Cardia, and in Latyne Cor, confirmed and set. Which because he is the
principal member, (...). i. Cor atque ^
of all other members, and the beginning of life, is thus set in the myddest
of the breast, as ^orde and king to all the rest: of whom he is obeyed and
served, as a prince of his subjects. And the heart has blood in his own
substance, whereas all other members have it but in arteries and veins: and in
the heart is the nutrityue blood made lively spirit, and carried forth in
the arteries, which in the heart have their beginnynge, as I said
sufficiently in the first treatise. And the heart is covered with a strong
pannicle called of the latines Capsula cordis, (...). Tunica Cor contegens.
and of the Grecians Pericardion. And from the heart proceeds the great
artery, which is called in latin Arteria magna, from whom branches and
proceeds all the other arteries, yt are in any member of the body: by which
means the spirit of life is carried to all the members of the same, Arteria
magna.
as it is sufficiently said, in the first treatise and the. vii. chapiter.
And the heart is an offyciall member, spermatike, and of a lacertous
substance: The great end whereof in his being, leans and inclines most
unto the right side, and the small end leans most unto the left side. And
in the heart have the venall arterye, and the arteriall vein their
begynninges: of whose processes and offices I speak immediately hereafter in
the lunges.

Here also might be to great purpose declared, the great secretes of these
first mouinges, which are in the heart, called in greek Systole, (...).
and Diastole, in latin Contractio, Dilatatio, 1. contractio, uel compressio
which are compared in this orbicle, (of diverse learned men) to the primum
mobile or first mover, in the great orb. For these mouinges are the first
cause of all other mouinges: (...). i. dilatatio, destinctio, in terdum diuisio
as of pulses in the arteries, and so of all the rest. But because those
secretes pass the capacity of the common sort: and also that I should break
my purpose of briefnes, I omit them, and will now speak of the lunges or
lights.

The. iii. Chapiter.
Of the lunges, and their parts and offyces.
THe lunges also called in Greek Pneumon and in latin Pulmo, (...). 1. Pulmo.
are set in the same holownesse, which are cold and moist of complexion, and is
divided into v. lobes or parts: iii. or the right side, and. ii, on the left.
And there is also the pannicle Mediastinum, being of like composytion with
Diaphragma. And as Diaphragma divides the region of the breast and the parts
thereof, from the belly, so doth Mediastinum divide the lunges and the breast
into. Mediastinum.
ii. several parts, after the length. And this deuisyon of the lunges in
parts was ordained, that if one part perish, an other may serve the turn.

And. iii. kinds of vessels we find in the lunges worthy of note. ^.
The first is an arteriall vein (mentioned in the first treatise, chapi. 8.)
coming from the heart, and brancheth into ye luges: bringing from ye heart
lively spirit and nutrimentall blood unto them. The second is a venal
arterye, (whereof I have spoken in the first treatise cha. 7.) conveying from
all parts of the lunges into the left ventricle of the heart, fresh aer: as
well to temper and mytigate the great heate thereof, as also to be made there
(by mixinge with most fine blood) pure and lively spirit, by the workynge of
the heart, to be sent to the great arterye: and from him by all other
arteries, to all and every part of the body. Arteria aspera.
The third is Arteria aspera, through whom the lunges draw in and put
forth aer: for whose farther description, look in the end of the first
chapiter of this treatise.

And from the first spondill of the breast, which (if ye begin to number at
the upper end of Nucha) is the. viii. spondill of the ridge: (...). Stupor ^.
from this spondill I say, comes two sinews, which give feeling and moving
to the whole breast: for of them are made the muscles, and the moving synewes of
that place. And note, that some of the mouinge synewes and muscles of the
breast, move according to the will, which for the most part come from the. vi.
and. vii. pair of synewes of the brayn, and of Nucha: and some synewes move by
the natural making of the breast. Which is known by the disease or sickness,
called Apoplexia: The condition whereof is such, that before the time of the
sycknesse, the breast moves: but in the hour of sycknesse it can not move.
For in the time of sickness in this disease, the brain is found stopped,
from whence these synewes proceed: so that by the said stoppinge of the
brain, the animal spirits be suffocate, and may not distende in the said
synewes, to do their operation in mouynge.

The. iiii. Chapiter.
Of the veins of the breast, and their beginnings and proceedings, and howe
incisyon should be done in the breast, and the parts thereof.
THe veins that are in the aforesaid skin deuidinge the breast, (nourishynge
those parts,) come from the second branch of Vena caua: Vena caua.
which is the less of the two great veins, that have their begynninge, in
the holownesse of the liver. Which branch comes into Diaphragm: or the
midrife, fro thence it goes endlog into th^ forsayde skyn, which divides the
breast called Mediastinum. And with these go other veins, which come from the
third branch of unknown veins, in the right ear of the heart. (...).
But the arteryes, which come to the forsayde skyn and the breast, proceed or
issue of a branch that comes from the great arterye, which grows in the
left ear of the heart. And every arterye brancheth forth under the veins,
so that every member that is nourished by veins, is quickened and kept by
the lively spirit of the arteries: which proceed universally under the said
veins. And know that all the veins and arteries, which come openly to the
nurishinge of the members of the breast, and especially in the utter part,
proceed in their going, according to the length of the ribs, and of the bones
of the breast: ye and so do also the great synewes, which come to the making
of the muscles of the breast: having their beginning of Nucha, NOTA.
within the spondills of the same. Wherefore it euydentlye appears, howe and in
what manner the apostemes of these places should be cut, and howe cauteries
ought to be done in the same, when need requires.

Therefore as much as may be, they ought to be done in those places,
according to the going of the rybbes in length: and so shall there no synewe
be hurt, nor errore committed. For when incisions and cauteries be thus done
according to the length, and that in the utter most, lowest, and most
dependente places: of such work I say, comes the spediest, shortest, and
fairest end of ^urations. And most prone, apt, and ready to digestion,
mundification, consolidation, desiccation. c. as experience manifests.

THE FOVRTHE PART OF Anatomye, which declares the form and shape, of the
whole sircuite of the womb, namelye from the mouth of the stomach unto the
hanches, and of the spondilles of that region.
The. i. Chapiter.
Of the region of the belly, and the pannycles of the same, and the bones of
that part.
THe third ventricle is the belly, called in latin Venture, Venture.
which albeit that we here recite last, is ye first piece of work, to be begun
in order of di^ection of the body, least otherwise putrefaction hinder the
whole work. It begins at the lowest ribs, and ends in the grindes and
share, and this whole circuit is very lose and soft.

First then upon all the rest is the utter skin, common to all the body. In the
which about or very ne'er the midst of the belly, is seen as it were a
little round py^te or hole: which is an ornament not vnsemelye to that
part, commonly called in English the navel, (...).
in greek Omphalos, in latin Vmbilicus. i. Vmbilicus.
From which a certain hollow tying, like in form to a gut, proceeds:
infestinge it self in the holowe side of the liver. The offyce whereof was in
the mothers womb, to bring both blood and spirit from the mother, to the
liver of the child, and so from the liver to all the members of the body: and
also to expel (after digestion) the superfluous juice, which after the birth
is the urine, and passes by the yard: and afterwards the navel has no
office that we read of in Anatomye.

Next under the skin of the belly is ordained fatness, and also under that
fatness. viii. muscles, which accorde to the necessity of that place: the
making and office whereof we will anon declare. And note that all this whole
substance of muscles, fatness, and the skin together, upon the regyon of the
belly, is called of the Arabians Myrach, of the Greeks Epigastrion, (...). i.
Abdomen. Venture exterior, uel sumus Venture.
and of the Latines Abdomen, de Abdendo, that is of covering: because it
covers and closely hides, all the entraels. Wherein by the way their errore
is to be noted, that take Myrach to be a simple and particular pannicle,
whereas in dede no such pannicle as they imagine, can be found by Anatomye.
And farther Galen councelleth, that in all wounds of the belly, wherein
Siphach Syphac.
is cut: that in stitchinge of the wound, we should sew or take hold (in
the stitchynge) of Syphach with Myrach: which council can stand with no
reason, if Myrach be any other wise to be understanded then as I have said
before.

And vnder^ese muscles in the fore-part, (...).
is ordained an other skyn or panycle, i. omentum uel zirbus adi pinus.
(under the which is the call, which is called in Greek Epiploon, in latin
Omentum, or barbarouslye zirbus adipinus, and also the guts, unto the
testycles coddes. And this pannicle or skin, is called Siphach or Peritonaeum:
Siphac.
of the breaking of which Siphac, it happens that zirbus and the guts fall
out into the cod. (...). i. Tunica incestina circunde^s.
But sometime of the said going out of zirbus and the guts, there falls
only a swellynge in the flank: and then may the chirurgien know, that the
rupture or breaking of Siphac, is not great. Which may lightly be helped with
emplasters, conuenyente and resting, by lying upon the back, with under
shorynge and proppyng of the body: as for that cause and place shall seem
conuenyente.

And under this Siphac, Ossa ^
is ordained the bones of ye share, called Ossa pectinis, or Coxendices: which
bones are made after the form of a half circle or compass: saving in the
upper part toward the navel, they have some going out. And in the share, the
ends of them are bound and knit with the hanche, and there they become
sundry: that they may sustain those parts with their hardness.

The. ii. Chapiter.
Of the yard, and the coddes, and of the matrix.
Under or between the lower parts of these bones, is placed the yard or
instrument of generation: which the grecians call Caulon, Caulis. (...), i.
Virga^iri^ Penis.
the latines Caulem, Virgam penem: and consists in substance, partly of
ligamentes, (namely. ii. and they holowe each way, as it were all one thing:
such as else where are not found. These being replete with spirits, do
erecte the yard, with the help of two muscles lying to the sides of the
same.) Partly of notable veins and arteryes, coming from the great
vessels about Os amplum: and of synewes that spring from the common stock
of such as descend to the moving of the inferior parts. The head or extreme
end whereof, is thought to be pure and simple flesh, (...). a similitudine
eius, ideoque latin Glans.
and is called in greek Balams, in latin Glans, being covered with a double
skin named Posthe Praeputium: To the end yt the said fleshye head may be
preserved from hurt: and also, that by rubbing up and down, (...). i.
Praeputium aliqu^ti^ns que ipsa Virga.
or foreward and backward of the skin, upon the head of the yard, there be
provoked and stirred, the greater, and more aboundante appetite, in the act of
generation. And that by such rubbing, and mouynge of the skyn, upon the
head of the yard: the seed by the swellynge of the same, may be the more
aptly, and better cast out, into the vessels of generation in women, in time
of the said act.

Farthermore from the Syphach go down two pipes, the lower parts whereof be
made, (...). Geminus, at hic paniculus duplici sinu testes contines. (...). i.
Testis sieve Testiculus.
and becomes there a double bagged pannicle or skin in the cod, conteyninge
the stones: and is therefore called Didymos. Which stones or testicies, called
in Greek Orchees. in Latin Testes, are of substance says Galen, holowe,
lose, fleshy, and soft: Whose first covering is white, and bloodless, called
Dartos. Under the which as some write, is an other tender white tunicle or
covering, which they call Erythroeida. Whereunto belong sundry vessels, of
substance (for the most part) harde, De Vsit pars tium. li. 14. (...).
thick, and strong: As some to bring blood and spirit, from Venacaua Arteria
maxima, to the testicles, and called therefore Vasa semen adferentia, and also
Praeparantia: because they do not a little alter such blood as they bring,
and prepare the same. i. Tunica desa testes tegens (...).
But yet work they it not to perfectyon, for so should the testicles be
depriued of their office, of in genderinge sperm: for the which errore Galen
reproves Aristotle. i. Tunica tem^is, testes intern tegens. (...).
Which vessels as they enter the substance of the stones, do pass through
a manifest glandule, cleuing to the upper part of each stone: which helps
much the preparative facultye, and is called Epididymis, and of some also
Didymos. i. Semen genitale sieve prole ficum. (...)


Other vessels also there are to the stones belonging, called Vasasemen
deferentia, (or rather Eiaculatoria,) that carry the sede (now laboured) to the
yard, and there and thence, through the urine passage out of the same. c.
Least any man should judge two passages to belong to the same: i. non
nullis testium muolucrum, at Galeno Glandula quaedam est, utrique testi adnata.
one for sperm, and an other for urine. Yet are there notwithstanding two
holowe ligamentes, (and they not with out deuisyons,) which by receiving
spirit into them selves, do erecte the yard, as before.

Over those pipes or conduictes, (coming from Peritonio,) and also the stones
is appointed the uttermost skyn, (...). i. ^ at hic ^.
or purse of the testicles, called in Greek Oscheon, in Latyne Mentula
Scrotum. And in women in stead of the yard, is the neck of the Matrix,
called Ceruig Vteri, whose port or entrance is called Vulua. Which is made of
a stretching synewye substance: That it may conuententlye stretch in the time
of child bearing, as need requires.

And it has inwardly therewyth, V^l^s.
(as a manne has outwardly) two testicles or stones. Nevertheless, they be
smaller, flat, and round, in form of an Almonde: and the neck of it in
comparison to the testicles or coddes, is of the form and shape of a man
yard, as it were turned inward. And the head of this neck, in the time of
casting forth of the seed touches these testicles, moves them to cast
forth their seed the better, into the holownesse of the matrix. And next after
this neck inwardly is the matrix it self, or the womb, called in greek
Metra, (...) Vterus sieve matrix.
and in Latin Vterus: which is the field of generation of mankind, and is
placed between the gut Longaon, and the bladder: and is much like the bladder
in form, and inwardly (as some will,) like a painted heart. Of compound
substance: as sinewye, veinye, and of arteries. The rest of the making with
the offices and propreties whereof (: as in Coitu, and conception, the growing
of sperm into Embryo, and of Embryo to a living creature, of delyuerance or
birth, the issuinge of the secundine, abortion and the causes thereof, with
also all their circumstances: as the vartetye of vain opynyons about the
number of celles in the womb, the opening and closinge of the same, the
course of menstruous terms: With also the consection and taking out of a
living child, from a dead woman, or a dead child from a living woman:) I
here willingly omyt as things only appertaining to the wise, discrete, and
learned: who are well able to seek the same, in such learned authors, as have
largelye and plainelye written thereof: and I will proceed orderly, to the
bones and muscles of these parts. Notwithstanding note this, that the flesh
and skynnes of these parts, are to be delte withal to chirurgerye, as is to
be done with the yard, the coddes, and the parts to them nyghe adiacente.

The.iii. Chapiter.
Of the bones of the back part of these parts called turnynge joints, and
the muscles of the belly, with their form proprety,
Immediately, after the.xii. rybbes, and the spondilles of the breast, are
ordained as I said in the first chapiter of the third part, Lumborum
Vertebrae. (...).
Lumborum uertebrae, which are the v. spondilles of the reins. And they are
fastened and joined in ye nether part towards the fundament, with the broad
bone of the rump called Platy Hieron in greek, in latin Sacrum Latum Amplum:
i. Os Latum, Sacrum uel Amplum.
which after Carolus Stephanus, and others is made of.v. bones (ye some say
of.vi.) joined by Symphysin. How be it Gale saith, in li^* de ossibus but of.
iiii. being unlike in form to the rest of the spondilles. (...). i. Apendix.
caudae icuruae similis ossisacro adnato.
Whereunto at his inferior parts, is the last gristiye bone of the ridge
knit, called in greek Coceyx, in latin Os caudae, being also made of. iii.
parts: The last third part whereof is simply gristly. And from every. ii.
opposite holes of the spondiis, is duly brought forth a pair of synewes: from
the tail or end of ye chine, goes forth but one syne we alone, for it has
but one hole: and is therefore called Neruus sine pari. And these synewes, that
come from these. v. spondilles, come to the making of the muscles of the belly.
And from the hollow vein comes certain branches of veins, to the nurishing
of the said muscles: as from the great arterye comes also branches of
arteryes, unto the said muscles of the belly, which bring quickness, and heat
unto them.

And of these muscles of the belly, are.viii. as I said before, Muscles of the
belly.viii.
of the which there be.ii. that come down straight a longest the belly,
having their begynninge at the sharpe gristle, or shield of the breast, and
end at the bones above the privy members called Ossa pectinis: and therefore
are called Musculi recti. Musculi recti.
Then there are other two fixed to the rydge which go transuers from the
sides, cross the bredthe of the belly: Musculi
and therefore are called Musculi transuersi, or Laterales. Then are there.iiii.
that are called Musculi obliqui: ^
of the which there are.ii. that are called Obliqui ascendentes, because they
spread as it were cater cornered upward: and the other ii. ^
are called Obliqui descendentes, because they cross slope wise, the other.ii.
cater cornered downwards. So that the grains of the descendentes, cross the
grains of the ascedentes, The power attractive.
in manner and form of this letter.X. and by the virtues of the lunge strayte
muscles is made the power attractive: through the which is drawn down as
well by the intraels, as otherwise, all the superfluities of the dygestions: as
urine, wind, and earthly ercrementes. And by the virtues of the transuers
muscles, Retentyu^
is holden the power retentive: whereby all things are kept, and contained till
nature has wrought in them, her kind and offyce in digestion. Expulsy^e.
And by the oblique muscles, is made the power and strength to expel, avoid,
and put out such void excrementes, as nature wills to be expelled: whether
it be urine, NOTA.
ventosity or ordure. And note, that after Galen in his treatise De iuuamentis,
all wounds or incisyens made in the myddest of the belly are more dangerous,
Wounds made in the belly.
then those that are made in the sides: because the parts on the sides are
more apt to be handled, to take forth the entraels, then the middle parts be:
And also that the wounds, persynge the womb, will scarselye receive
incarnation, except Siphach be stitched to Mirach.

The.iiii. Chapiter.
Of the midriffe, and the parts next under it, as the liver, the gaul, the
milte, with the.ii. great veins, as Porta concana
WIthin this holownesse of the belly are the nouryshing members, The nuryshing
mebers
above the which and under the spiritual mebers, is a certain sinewy member,
broad and flat woven together of muscles, great arteries and veins, and is
therefore of Galen numbered among muscles of the breast: Which doth move, and is
caused to move, by the drawing in and out of aer. This member departs and
divides the spiritual mebers, from the nourishynge members: (...). i
interstitum, uel septum transuers^r, sieve Septum pectorale
and is called of the Grecians Diaphragma or Phrenes, and in latin Septum
transuersum, in English the midriffe: Which holds his place like the flap
of a bellows in that operation. And when that member is hurt or wounded, it
is said to be incurable and mortal: because of his noble making, and
delicate substance, and his needful and profitable workinge: which when it is
wounded, is made void and of none effect.

Under the mydryffe is the liver set on the right side, called in Greek Hepar,
and in latin Iecur: which is a principal member, (...). i. Iecur
official, and concerning his first creatyon spermatike, of substance as it
were coagulated blood.

And to him is knyt and bound a little net, which is the root of all the
veins in the body, The liver.
both inwardly and outwardly: and he is clothed with a synewy pannicle.

And of this net (being the spermatike substance of the liver) there is by
natures providence engendered.ii. great veins. Vena Porta, Porta Hepatis sieve
porta Iecoris.
Whereof the first is called Vena porta, Porta Hepatis, (...) Porta Iecoris:
from whom proceadeth the number of veins called Meseraicae, which are unto
Verae portae, as the branches of a tree unto the root or stock of the same.
The office of which veins is to draw the Chilous juice from the bothome of
the stomach and diverse guts, Venae meseraicae.
to the liver: where the second digestion is made. Vena Choele.
The second vein is called Vena choele, Vena concaua sieve
or Vena concaua, and of some Vena Ramosa. And this vein with his roots,
draws all the blood from the liver, Vena ramosa.
caryinge the same by his vniuersalle branches, into all the body: and in this
vein with his branches is the third digestion fulfiiled and made. From this
Vena Choecle, there are certain veins, which go from him to the reins,
Ve^rae emulgentes.
called Venae Emulgentes, or Vasa Emulgentia: which draw the waterye thin
substance, from the blood into the reins or kinde^s, Vasa emulgentia.
as it wear whey divided from pure milk. For which cause the Phisitiens call
the urine, Serum Sanguinis, Serum Sanguinis.
the whaye of blood.

And in ye midest of ye chest of ye liver, is set ye blader of choler,
commonly called the gall, (...)
in Greek Cystis choledoche, and in latin Folliculus fellis, or Vesicula
fellis: Which is an official member, spermatike and sinewy. From the which
departs two holowe pipes, Vesicauel Folliculus fellis. ^ istis fell^ (...) i.
fell (...) bill^, tum flaua, tum ^tra.
whereof one bears choler, (called Fell Bilis, and in Greek Chole) to the
stomach, to help thereby digestion: which also being sharpe and bitter, doth
mightilye scour away the remanentes: The other carries of the same matter to
the gut Pyloron, which by the aforsayde qualities purges from the same and
from the rest of the guts, their sliminesse and excrementes.

On the left side (as in the vnworthyer place) is set the spleen, commonly
called the milte, in Greek Splen, and in Latin Lien: which is a member
spermatike, and official. And is fastened with the liver, by certain ways or
vessels that go between them: whereby the gross and feculente parts of the
blood, are brought from the liver unto the same. Which kepeth them (by
converting them as it were into his own substance,) until by nature her
impulsyon it be set out, to serve else where some necessary purpose. where in
the mean time it is divided, and extenuated, and made a commodious nutriment to
the spleen: that by the means of certain arteries proceeding from the great
artery, immediately as it is passed through Septum transuersum.

Of this melancholic juice (called Chole or rather Melachole, (...). Bilis
Atra.
and in latin Atra bilis) That which is left or spared of the above said
nutriment, doth nature use (even as she doth yelowe choler) to stir up
appetite by his sharpness and sournesse in the mouth of the stomach. And also
(conveying the same each way by passages convenient,) to help ye virtue
retentive both in the guts and stomach.

The.v. Chapiter.
Of the stomach and of the guts, of Mesenterium, and of the veins called
Haemorrhoydes.
IN the myddest of those members is the stomach, called Ventriculus, in greek
Stomachos: which is a member compound and spermatike, (...). i. Ventriculus
Os Ventris.
synewye, and very sensible, and is made of.ii. coats: of the which the
innermoste is synewye, and the outmoste is fleshy. And is to all the members of
the body, as the earth is to all things engendered in the same: so that all
other members of the body, require of him the substance whereby they are
nourished, (as Galen says in the first chapiter of his book De Iuuamentis.)

Whose upper part is straight and narow, and his nether part very wide and
large, and his lower part is ended in the place of the navel: (...). i.
intestuium. (...) i. intestinu stati^ ex pyloro.
and is called the first vessel, wherein nature makes and fulfills her
first naturalle digestion. Wherefore it is called the chest or store house, for
all the meat belonging to the body, and the cooke also which dresses meat for
all parts of the body: for in the bothome of the stomach, is made
principally the digestion, whereby all the members of the body do grow, and are
nourished.

And to the stomach is tied, (...). i. Agnatio uel ortus.
fastened, and continued one gut, which after the difference of places is
divided, and called by diverse names: generally Entera in greek, Intestina in
latin: whose diuisyon is into.vi. parts. Whereof the first being in length
(...). i. Ianitor sieve ostiarius, hic enim infimum Ventriculi orificium, quod
dum coquitur ad Vnguem clauditur.
.xii. inches, is named Dodecadactylos Ecphysis, in latin Duodenum. The upper
end whereof, which is fastened to the nether orifice of the stomach, being as
it were the gate of the same: (for by the help of a glandule therein, it
stops so closely the passage, that nothing can pass out thereat, till
concoction be fully finished,) is called Pyloros, in latin Portenarium: that
is the porter or door keeper. The second or next gut unto this, is called
Exortus Ieiunium that is the empty or fastinge gut: Exortus. Ieiunium.
so called because it is ever found void or empty. (...).i. gracilae le
intest^. (...). i. Vnum (...) Ventre^uel cauum.
In this chiefly (in Duodeno, also and in the bothome of the stomach,) are
fixed certain clean and subtle veins, (whose continualle drawing, is the
cause of emptiness in the same.) which before and also hereafter, I call
Meseraicas. By the which they expel and the liver draws to him self, the
best and purest juice of the meat and drink, (...). i. Intestim crassioris,
pars superio^.
that are in those members concocted. With the lower end of Ieiuni, is knit
the lunge gut, that we call the small guts, the greekes Ileon, the latines
Tenue uel Subtilae, and is of length.xvi. cubits. Heart unto this is
Monoculos called also Caecum intestinum, or Saccus, in Englyshe the sack or
blind gut, because it seems to have but one hole in the upper end: for the
other end is like the bothome of a sack or bag. Unto the which is adjoined
Colon or the round gut: whereunto also is annexed the last gut, (as a part
of the same,) Longaon Intestinum rectu.
called Langaon, Intestinum rectum: which comes straight down by the
spondilies of the reins, and is ended in the fundamente.

Note also that the guts have their situation with a certain member, (...).
i. Mesenter^. Mesaraica uasa.
called Mesenterium, in Greek Mesaraeon: which is a notable texture of
innumerable veins and arteries, which are called Mesaraica Vasa, being ye
first veins: through whom the nutrityue juice as yet but raw, is drawn
out of the stomach, at the bothome of the same, and carried to the gates of
the liver, there to be the second time concocted. Porta Hepatis
And these veins do spring out ramifye of the vein, called Porta Hepatis,
are wholly covered and defended with pannycles and ligamentes, which are also
common to the guts: and this Mesenterium, being taken out of the body, is
like the cape of a shepherds cloak, the back part whereof is full of
kurnels, or glandulous flesh: which as I remember, the butchers when they take
this meber out of swyne and other beasts, do call the Trow. It growing
fast to the back, is the staye to all the guts, that they move not, from
their due and convenient places. And from the liver and the spleen come five
veins, to the fundamente or end of Longaon, called Haemorrhoides, for the
melancholy blood that they shed: and when they be swollen or open, (...) quasi
fluxus sanguinis, quonia ab his fluere saepe solet.
the disease is called Haemorrbois, and commonly the Emeroydes or Piles.

The.vi. Chapiter.
Of the bladder, the kidneis, the water pypes, and the ways generally of
vryne.
Upon the gut Longaon, or between Longaon, and the share in a man, and
between the matrixe and the share in a woman, is set ye blader, called in
latin Vesica, (...). i. uesica
and in Greek Physe: The which is the vessel of urine, being of a sinewye
substance, and the neck thereof is fleshye or musculye. And it is made of.ii.
coats, the which be ii. skins: and in the bladder are many small veins and
arteries, of which it purchases nurishmente and life. The neck of it passes
for the under the bone of the share, which in his going forth unto the
outmoste parts, is made small: and the way of urine that comes from it, is
made in the manner of a great vein, and it enters the substance of the
yard, passing forth through the flesh, in the lower parts of the bladder:
and parts in a manner the flesh of the yard in the midst, and by that
part goes out the urine.

In the yard there are Two holes in the yard.
.ii. holes, though both not through persing the same. One passing through, by
the which urine is cast out, and that is fastened with the neck of the
bladder: The other coming from the stones enters the aforesaid, by the which
the sede of man is cast out. And this is fastened with the vessels of sperm,
Was Fiaculatorium.
and is called Eiaculatorium Was, whereof also above. And in the beginning of
the yards holownesse, these two are made one.

And in the neck of a woman's blader, there is nothing sought, nor purchased,
concerning knowledge: for it is very short and strayte, and the nature of her
is not caste out in this manner: but comes a fundo Vteri per cervicem eius:
nether doth the urine passage help any thing thereto but serves only for
the expulsion of urine: wherein yet both great and small stones, are often
scene.

In the end of the.xii. spondils of the rybbes, and under the first spondill
of the reins, The teynes. (...). i. Ren.
are set the reins or kydneis, called in Latin Renes, in Greek Nephroi,
within the holownesse of the body: the right kydney being ever placed higher
then the left. Whose offyce is to convert the aforesaid whayey substance of
blood, conueyed into them by the means a little before in the.iiii. chapiter
mencyoned into perfect vryne. In echo of the which kidneis is a certain fine
straiuynge way implanted, called of Galen Porus Vreticus, Porus Vreticus.
through which the whey of blood, sucked in by Vasa Emulgentia, from the
holowe vein and great arterye, Vasa Emulgetia.
is conueyed out of the kidneis into the water pipes, called in Greek
Vretheres, and in Latin Meatus Vrinarii: which from thence descend, (...).
i. Vrinarii meatus (...)
passing crokedlye down, till they be joined by the nether ends, with the
utter skyn (nyghe the neck) of the bladder: percynge also immediately the
inner skyn thereof. Whereof it obteyneth a certain little covering like a
flap, (...). i. uri^.
resembling both in form and function such as we see in pumps and sluices:
which by the falling course of urine, is driven open at the entrance thereof
into the bladder: but after wards falling to again, it so closely shutteth
the entrance, that (as Galen says) not only urine, but also air is
prohibyted to go back again into the said water pipe.

And it is manifest that the synewes of those places, come from the spondilles
of that part, and the veins and arteries of those members, go as do the
veins of the belly and the flank: That is to say, after and according to
the riuels, wrinkles, grains and the growing of hear in those parts.

And therefore it is good, that the incisyons of those places, be done after
the procedinge of the grains: and also opening of apostemes, and workinge
with cauteryes, ought to be done in these places in the forsayde manner, that
we commit none error.

THE FIFTH PART OF ANAtomye, which expresses the form and shape of the
hanches, the thighs, the hams, the shynnes, and the feet, and of the
members contained in them.
The i. Chapiter.
Of the hippes and hanches, the grindes, the thighs, and the knee with their
parts.
IT behooves now that we speak orderly of the bones of the hanches or
hippes, which are two in number, one on the right side, an other on the
left, fastened by gristles ligamets behind to the holy bone, likewise
before, one with an other: whereas the upper parts of the, Ossa Ilium.
(bearing up the guts so named) are called Ossa Ilium, Anchas.
and vulgarly Anchas: and at the nether parts dependynge Ossa pubis, Ossa
Pubis.
or Pectinis, where also they are straighter, narower together in men then in
women. Ossa Pectinis.
Toward the sides (furthermore) outwardly, they have in each a manifest
greatness, wherein is a holownesse, called the bore or cup of the hipp:
(...). i. Os Coxen^.
and there are they called in Greek Ischia, and in latin Coxendices. Through
at which box, passes a hard and strong insensible ligament, from a muscle
lying within the share, enteringe the round end of the thyghe bone: whereby it
is therein firmly fastened. Which ligamet if it be broken by the dislocation of
the thigh bone: ye bone can never be restored to endure in his place, nor the
joint made perfect gain. Wherefore the chirurgien may help the ache, payne
of the member, caused by the dislocatyon: but restore it to continue he ca not,
for it will eftsoon leap out again. Outwardly is this joint bound with
strong insensible ligamentes, and also with synewes Chords.

And in the insyde of this joint between the legs, Emunctorye place of the
liver.
are the emunctorye places, called the grindes or shares: where as the liver
has his clensinge place, in the time of Pestilence, or any like venomous
infection, as ye may perceive by the apostemes there put forth, at such
times: even as the heart puts forth in the arm holes, and the brain under
the ears, or in the throat. And in the grindes are found certain curnels or
glandulous flesh, even s^che as are found under the jaws, and in like
places.

Then after the joints of the hyppes, are ordained the thigh bones, ^.
called Femora, Femina, and of some Coxa, which within are hollow, and full of
marow, and without round: and the upper end of this bone, as I said before, is
fastened with the cup or box of the hipp: where as it turns and moves, in
the time of moving of the thigh, leg, or foot. And the nether end enters
into the box, or cup of the focill of the shin: and there it is fastened
with the shin bones. This joint is also bound with strong insensible
ligamentes, which be ordained in every iuncture, that the rubbing or mouinge
of the joints, should not be felt painful or uneasy, as we sufficiently
have declared in the first treatise of the simple members, in the third
chapiter.

And upon this joint of the knee, in the forparte thereof, is set a round
gristlye bone, (...). i. Os seu Conchula quaedam genu contegens.
called in greek Epigomatis Mola, in latin Patella uel Rotula Genu, in
English the rotule of the knee: whose offyce is to defend the joint, and to
make the mouinge thereof the more easy. Patella sieve Rotula genu.


The.ii. Chapiter.
Of the shynnes, of the ankles, the feet and the toes, the bones and other
parts: of their composityon, with the figure and number of them.
ANd after the knee, (...). i. Sura atque pass^ uertitur ^i bula, uelacus.
are ordained the.ii. bones of the leg. (...). i. Tibia, aliis tame cofuse
interdu Crus atque fe mu^ La.
Which are fastened after the length, in the nether end, with the ankle and
the heal, are planted in them. And they are called the.ii. focils of the
legs: that is to say the greater focill and the less. The biggest is that
which is uppermost on the shin, called in greek Perone and in latin Sura,
Malleoli.
Focile maius. And the least is that which they commoly call the splint bone,
(...). i. Os la aliquotiens ipse Talus.
in the calfe of the leg, called in Greek Cneme, and in latin Tibia Focile
minus.

And in the lower ends, these ii. bones have.ii. additios called Malleoli,
which are the ankle bones: unto which is knit, (...). i. Os Calcis, Os cal
caneum.
(next forward under them) a bone called in greek Astragalos, and in latin
Talus. Nerte unto these behind is joined the heal bone, called of the Grecians
Pternan, of the latines Os Calcis, (...) i. Similis Scapha nauiu quo runda
generi.
or Calcaneum. Then next before is the instep bone called (of his form) the
shiplike bone, therefore in greek Scaphoeides, and in latin Nauiforme. Then
follow the.iiii. bones, called Rasseta pedis, and with the together Tarsus. Of
the which one in ye innersyde of the foot, is called in greek Cyboeides, in
latin Cubiforme, and in Englyshe the cube bone or the dye bone: (...).i.
Speciem Cubi referes, hoc est quadratum (...) ^aeri similis.
because it is every way square like a cube or dye: and the other.iii. are
called Chalcoidea: Unto this Rasseta are immediately joined the.v. bones of the
plant of the foot, called in Greek Pedion, in latin Pecten, or Planta pedis:
which answers nighlye to that part of the hand called Metacarpium. (...)
i. Pla^a pedis pars, uel platapedis
Immediately unto these endlonge join the bones of the two toes, (as in the
hand of the fingers, Digiti pedis*
) called therefore Digiti pedis, which are.xiiii. in number, for in every toe of
the foot are.iii. bones, save only in the great toe, in the which is
but.ii. bones: because that toe needs no great mouynge, neither is it
necessary to his form and shape. Bones in the leg numbr. ^.
And thus it appears, that in the leg and foot, from the hyp to the toes,
are contained.xxxi. bones.

The.iii. Chapiter.
Of the synewes, veins, arteryes, and muscles of the wh^le leg, of their
beginninges procedynges, forms and offyces, and howe incisyon or other like
handye work ought there to be done, with also the veins of section for
Phlebotomye.
FRom the holes of the.v. spondilles of the reins, and from the holes of the
last bone of the ridge, Synewes of the legs.
(as Galen says, in the.xiii and.xvi. book of the use of parts,) Come
synewes, which proceed by the hinder part of the hanches or hippes, after the
length thereof: and these synewes, give unto these places feeling moving, wilful
stirring. Muscles of the legs.
They are there also meddled with flesh, making muscles, whereby not only those
mebers are severally moved: but also such forms fashios as they have, are
thereby so institute and made. For from the ends of the muscles thus made,
proceed chords, which move the nether and the upper end: and especially the
knee, the shin, the legs. And there appear under the knees or hams.ii great
chords, the which move draw the leg both in and out: and all these
synewes, muscles, bonds, and tendones, of the thigh and leg, proceed
longwise. After the length of those mebers, there come also branches from the
said sinews: which come from the holes of the spondilles of the reins, into
the great and small muscles of the legs. From the nether ends whereof come
the mouynges of the fete, and the mebers thereof: as the heal and the toes. c.

And from the sides of the knee, and also from the bone called Patella genu, in
the calfe of the leg, proceeds a certain knitlynge together of synewes and
muscles, which are noble and delicate. Of the woundinge and pricking of
which, proceeds great payne, accidens, and disease unto the roots of them:
in such manner, that oftentimes the chirurgien can by no wisdom cunning,
bring remedy to the patient, or save him fro death. wherefore the wounds of
those places, are dangerons and dredfull, and many times uncurable, as some
authors have written.

And from the great holowe vein, called Vena Coele, or Vena Caua, (...). i.
Concauus. Vena Caua.
which has his begynninge in the liver, as as it was aforesaid, and from
the great arterye, which comes from the right ear of the heart, as it
was also said: From this vein and arterye. I say, comes branches of veins
and arteries, down to the gryndes or shares, from whence they proceed,
branchinge down with the synewes and muscles of the thighs, legs, and
feet: and proceed still after the length, as do the synewes and muscles,
even unto the ends of ye toes, giving nourishmet and life, unto those mebers.
And of these together, is made and woven the uttermost sensible skyn of those
parts. And therefore it manifestly appears, how the openinges of apostemes
ought to be done in these places. Incisions in the thyghe.
That is to say in the thyghes, the legs and the feet: yt the cuttinges and
cauterizations, ought to be done according to ye length of the spondilles, and
of the body.

And from the great branches of Vena concaua, that come into each thigh,
there are certain branches procedinge, the which are veins necessary to
Phlebotomy for diverse causes: Vena popletica.
as in phisike, also in surgery it is to be red. whereof the first appears
in the ham, called Vena popletica. The second in the inside of the ankle,
Saphena.
called Saphena, and of some Malleolaris. Malleolaris.
The third in the outsyde of the ankle, called Ischiatica. Ischiatica Vena.
The fourth is between the little toe and the next adjacent, called Renalis. And
this seems sufficient in respect of the rest of the work to be spoken,
Renalis Vena
of the veins of the legs, and fete: namely such as serve to Phlebotomye.

THE SIXTE PART, WHICH briefly in one Chapiter shows the names as well in
Latin as in English, of all the exterior or outward parts of man his body,
from the head to the feet.
First, the crown or upper part of the head, where the hear grows or
turns every way, is called in latin Vertex: the fore part whereof is
called Sinciput, and the hinder part C^ciput.

Then the face, which is called in Latin Facies: the upper part whereof,
which we call in English the forehead, is called in Latin Frons: the brows
of the eyes are called Supercilia, the eye lyddes Palpebrae, the corners of the
eyes Anguli Oculorum and the eyes Oculi.

The nose is called in latin Nasus, the cheeks Genae, the nostrils Nares,
the lips Labra, the mouth Os, ye tunge Lingua, and the rouffe of the mouth
Palatum: the jaws are called Maxillae, as the upper jaw Maxilla superior, and
the nather jaw Maxilla inferior, Dentes the teethe, and the chynne Mentum.

The parts above the eyes and ears, which we call in English the temples,
are called in latin Tempora: the ears are called Aures, the hear Capilli,
and Barba the beard

The part of the neck behind, reaching from the nodle to the nether
spondill or turnynge joint of the neck, is called in latin Ceruix: and the
foreparte of the neck, which reaches from the face, to the beginning of the
breast or canell bones is called Collum: the throat is called Gula ye shoulders
are called Humeri, the upper part of the shoulder is lugulum, and the shoulder
blades Scapulae.

The upper part of the arm, continuing the length of the adiutorye bone,
from the shoulder to the elbow, is called Brachlum the bought of the arm
Gibber, the elbow Cubitus* The part between the elbow the wrest, which we call
in English ye cubit, is called in latin Vlna: ye wrest Carpus, the hands
Martus, the palm of the hand Palma: the thumb is called in latin Pollex, ye
forefinger Index, ye middle finger Medius the ring finger, which is also called
the wedding finger, is called Medicus ye little finger or ear figer, is called
^uricularis.

The arm holes are called in latin Axillae, the breast Pectus, the sides
Latera, the paps or dugs Mamae, the nepples or tetes Papillae, the back
Dorsum, the nether parts where of next unto the hippes, are called in latin
Lumbi, in greek Lagone, in English the loins.

The belly is called Venture, the nether part thereof Imus Venture, the navel
Vmbilicus, and the side between the belly and the back under the ribs, is
called Hypochondria, which we may call in English the waste.

The grind or share is called Pubes, between the which are set the privy
members, under the bothome of the belly: which some call the genitales. whereof
that part which we call the yard, is called in latin Virga* or Caulis: the
fleshye head whereof is called Glans, and the skin covering the same
Praeputium, the coddes or balock purse Scrotum, and the stones Testiculi.

The buttocks are called Nates, the fundament Anus, the hippes Coxendices, the
thigh Femur, the knee Genu, the hams Poplites, the shins Tibiae, and the
caulfe of the leg Sura.

Then follow the feet, which are set under the legs: as the hands are
under the arms: and they are called in latin Pedes, the sides whereof which we
call in English ankles, are called in latin Malleoli, and the hinder part
which we cal the heal, is named Calx, or Calcaneus. The hollow of ye foot is
called Planta, the treading place is named Vestigiu. then proceed there forth
the toes, as in the hands there do fingers, which both are called in latin
Digiti: the toes being called Digiti Pedis. And as well on the toes as on the
fingers are nailes growing, which are called in latin Vngues.

Thus to the honour and glory of God, that so wonderfully hath wrought in
natnre, I have showed such things, as in the body of man is to be
considered, in order of Anatomye: as far as my simple knowledge was then able
to collecte: partly as I have observed by experience, and partly as I could
gather of good authors: even such ancient wryters, as in this work I have
by occasion aleaged, and also some new wryters of Anatomy, of our time: as
Vesalius, Carolus Stephanus c. as well of ye inward, as of the outward parts:
that young students may have thereof some profit, as I my self have learned
and profited in gathering of the same. Desiering all those, to who any thing
herein written shall seem imperfect, gross, or untrue, that of their
gentleness they will bestow their labour, and set forth the fruit of
their good and laudable studies, in amending that to them shall seem amysse:
even as I have been to show my good will, in doing of this brief and simple
thing: and will also be most glad, at their hands to receive with condinge
thanks and laud, such learning as may amend my fault, or redress mine error:
that the truth may also in these things be published, to the contentation of
all gentle, well willing minds. (whereat some might seem astonished, through ye
variety of opinion in wryters, which nevertheless shot al at one mark for ye
most part, and utter their setences, ye seem so variable, to one end purpose,
if they be in differentlye weighed, and understand: though yet every one saw
not all, no not the most autentike.) That is to say, that by the knowledge of
the situation of all members in the body, there may be a safe and cunning
workynge in Surgery upon the body of man, to avoid error and offence. For
the which cause I have in this work rather used that order, then to be
precise in numbers, or curious in names.

The Conclusion of the whole work.
NOw to conclude this general and third treatise, and so of this whole work,
confessing mine imbesility, and want of perfection: thus much I say that the
body of man, whereof we have brieflye treated, is (as all other creatures are)
made and compact of the four Elements: That is to say, Fire, Elements.
Air, Water, and Earth. As their very properties may be perceived in the
four humores in manne: Humours.
namelye blood, Blood.
Phlegm, Phlegm.
Choler, and melancholy: For the which cause, Choler.
the said.iiii. humores are called of the learned sort, Melancholy.
the sons of elements. For as the fire is hot and dry, so is choler: and as
the air, is hot and moyste, so is blood: as the water is cold and moyste,
so is Phlegm: and as the earth is cold and dry, so is melancholy. And of
those four humores are the four complexions named: Complexion.
as Sanguine, Choleric, Phlegmatike, and Melancholic. Yet not wythstanding
we call no man so, because he is made of one only element, or that he is
endued with one only humore: But contrary, as I said before, every person
is made of four elements, and has in him four humores, but not every man
in a like temperature: And that is the cause, that one man is named of one
humore, and an other of an other. As when blood excedeth, or surmounts in
any body the rest of the humores, that person is called a Sanguine man: not
because he is all of blood, but because blood bears in the body most
domination. And so likewyse it is to be understand of all the other three: to
be called of choler, choleric, of Phlegm, Phlegmatike, of Melancholy,
Melancholic. And also I understand, that in the complexions, is a division of
nyne temperamentes: of the which, first there be.iiii. simple. That is to
say, hot, cold, dry, and moyste: whereof there are two actiues, that is to
say workers, and the other two been passiues, that is to say sufferers. And
brieflye to say, hotnesse and coldness, be actiues, dryness and moystnesse
be passiues. And by the combination or bindinge together, of two of the
aforesaid four, the one always being active, the other passive, are the
other four made: that is to say, the compound complexions, as hot and
moyste, cold and moyste, hot and dry, cold and dry. The ninth which
differs from all these, is the very true temperamente, and may be called a
just and true complexion* even as it were measured by waighte: nether
excedinge other in any quality or quantitye, but being a just temperamente,
measured of equal portions of every quality. So that we could not call a man
of such complexion, sanguine nor Choleric, Phlegmatike nor Melancholic: but
rather a man of a perfect complexion or just temperament. which perfect
temperature, is as it were a trial, or touch stone: to try and prove all other
complexions by. For the nearer to this temper, any man complexion doth draw,
the more perfect it is: and the more it differs from this temperamente, in
any quality the worse it is, and the more dystemperate.

Therefore, he that will judge truly of complexions must always have in his
Imagination, the foresaid perfect temperamente.

To be brief, every creature on earth, or in the world, of these elements,
have their beginninges: yea the world it self, under the stars is nothing
else. And because the body of man above all other things, Mi^o (...) Minor
(...)
of these four has most perfect temperamente, it is called in Greek Micro
Cosmos: that is to say a little world. For it is a little world in deed, to
be considered in order of Anatomye: yea a wonderful world, such a world, as
the great world in dede, was made for the only sake of it.

And as some have named it a little world, so have other some called it a
common weal, a royal kingdom, and a righteous regimet: For in this common
weal, was never found rebellion, but every subject seruisable to his
governor, and every superior tendering the wealth of his inferyors. Oh worthy
common weal, by whom all common weals may take sufficient example and view,
howe to govern, or to be governed. Oh wilful and negligent man ye run a
stray, as one not knowing the rule of righteousness. What need thou a
preacher in such a case: where thou art sufficiently taught if thou wilt
learn in thine own creation? Oh why should that creature be brute, or
insypient, or as a salvage beast, which for his wonderful gifts, given him
of God in his creation, is called a little world, or a common weal? what a
strange thing were it, that he which is a common weal in him self, and
carries continually with in him self, the perfect image of a common weal,
should in a common weal, be a cause of a common destruction?

I leave here many things, to be considered in complexions, with many other
things which were necessary for this place: but because they are
sufficiently treated of all ready in our vulgar tungue, by diverse learned men,
and that of late years, I willingly omit them: considering that it would be
rather a note of presumption or vain glory, then ought else: except I could
mend or better their doings, that have written thereof all ready: unto whom I
co^esse my self not worthy to hold the candle.

Wherefore gentil readers, wishing you most heartily well to fare, I end this
work of Anatomy: desiring your gentle hearts, in this to accept my good will,
and take it in good part.

Who can but praise, and eke extolle,
The worthy art surgery:
which builded is on reason whole,
As ye may well perceive and see:
And nothing out of reasons reach,
In any point doth it contain.
Then to their art they are a breach,
That reason have in such disdeine.
Sith reason doth attain the skill,
Of every member in his place.
All men of art, should bear good will,
To reason and the same embrace.
For by her lore ye shall attain,
All knowledge good for to advance.
And shall withstand the proud disdain,
Of those that dwell in ignorance.
Wherefore of truth I can not seace,
To marvel much at momus sect:
Sith nothing can their wits releace,
with ignorance so much infect.
For what a mome was he that said,
These bokemen can but talk and prate,
And we are they that with our aide,
Do all the cures in each estate.
An other says I can not talk,
But I will work even with the best,
Thus stubbernly these buserdes walk,
Upon their blind customs that rest.
For if their talk any truth had,
A blind man might colours decern,
And every fool and peevish lad,
Might doctors be and never learn.
But who so doth them rightly mark,
Shall find them meter for the carte,
That grope thus blindly in the dark,
Then have to do in such an art.
Therefore who so will perfect be,
To reason let them now resort,
And flee from such as disagree,
From reasons rules in such a sort.

An historiall expoSTVLATION: AGAINST THE beastly abusers, both of
Chyrurger^e, and Physyke, in our time: with a goodly doctrine, and
instruction, necessary to be marked, and followed, of all true chirurgiens:
gathered by Iohn Halle Chyrurgyen.
EOr as much as in the Epistle and Prefaces, I have declared the dishonour that
the noble art of medicine susteyneth, by deceauynge Fugitives, and other false
abusers: I think it good here to blasen the deeds of some, in this our time,
that it may apere, that not without a sufficient cause, I have so there of
them complained.

First there came into the town of Maydstone, In the year of our Lord. 1555.
a woman which named her self Jone, having with her a walking mate, whom she
called her husband. This wicked beast toke her Inn at the sign of the Bell,
in the town aforesaid. Where she caused within short space to be published,
that she could heal all manner, both inward and outward diseases. One powder
she carried in a blader, made of the herb Daphn^ydes, and Anise sede together,
which she (as an only sufficient remedy for all grefes) administered unto
all her foolish patients, in like quantite to all people, neither regarding
time, strength, nor age. Al the time of her being there, (which was about.iii
weeks) there resorted to her company, diverse Ruffians, and vacaboundes, under
pretence of being diseased, sekyng to her for remedy: so that her false
profession, was unto their wicked behaviour, for the time in that to woe a
safe supportation.

This is beastly deceauer, among many others took in had an honest mas
child, who had a suppurat tumor in his navel, percynge dangerously the
panicles of the belie: to whom she administered the said powder in great
quantitye, in so much, that the child did vomyte continually, for the space
of half a day and more, without ceassynge: whereby the said aposteme brake.

The parents of the child then feared much, by the grenousnesse of the
syghte, that his stomach would break: which may be thought that in very
dede it so did. For in process of time, there issued out by the orifice of ye
same, vii. worms at.vii. several times (such as children are wont to avoid,
either upward or downward, from the stomach and gutte^ called ^eretes.i.
Rotun^) with also a certain yelowe substance not stinkynge, such as we
sometimes find, in the stomaches of dead men, when we open them.

This fearful sight I say, caused the childes parents to send for me, to
know therein mine opinion and counsel: unto whom I prognosticated (as I saw
good cause,) that the matter was very dangerous, and not like to be cured. But
this beastly form of a woman, hearing me so say: answered that she doubted
therein no danger, and farthermore offered herself to be locked up in a
chamber with the child, and that if she healed him not, she might be
punished: with a great deal more circumstance of prating and deceitful
bragging words. Unto whose most wicked and diulyshe boldness, I thus
answered. Where as you say that ye doubt not any danger in this child, I
very well believe you: for ignorant fools can doubt no perils, and who is
bolder then blind bayerd? howe should they doubt that know not what a doubt
means. Notwithstanding, this pre-eminence you deceauynge re^negates have, ye
may brag, lye, and lace, till ye have murdered or destroyed such as credyte
you, and then are ye gone, ye show your heles, and that is only your
defence. But honest men of art must have truth for their defence, and
experience of their true work, and may promise no more then they may
perform.

What should I make many words, the parents of the child all to late
discharged this deceauer. And the child notwithstanding the counsel had of
divers learned men, dyed afterward of the said grefe. But the said deceauer
according to my Prophecy, after.iii. days ran away, she and her walking mate,
robbynge their host where they lay, of the sheets, pillowheres and blankets
that they lay in. And by their entysement of one of the maid servants of
their said host: They had muscadell served them in stead of bear, while
they lay there for the most part: which enticed servant ran away also
with them, and could not since be herd of.

Secondly in the year of our Lord. 1556. there resorted unto Maydstone one
Robert Haris, professynge and pretending an high knowledge in Physike: under
cloak where of he deceived meruaylouslie with vile Sorcery. This deceauer could
tel (as the foolish people reported of him,) by only looking in ones face, all
secrete marks scars of the body, and what they had done, and what had
chanced unto them all their life time before. Wherewith he had so incensed the
fond and waueryng minds of some, that pity was to here. Among whom one
woman (who for her years and professio, ought to have been more discrete:)
When I reasoned with her against his doings: she earnestly affirmed, that she
knew well that he was then dystant from her, at the least.vii. miles, and yet
she verelye believed that he knew what she then said. Oh great beastlynes and
infydelitie, specially in such as have borne a face to favour the word of
God.

Well for jesting a little against the madness of this deceauer, I had a
dagger drawn at me not lunge after. The words that I spake were to his
hostess, when I saw him go by, in this wise. Is this (quod I) the cunyng
sothsayer, that is said to sye at your house? Sothesayer quod she: I know no
such thing by him, therefore ye are to blame so to name him. Why quod I,
such men and such informed me that he can tell of things lost, and help
children and cattle bewitched and forspoken, and can tell by looking in ones
face, what marks he has on his body, and where, and tell them what they
have done, their fortune to come. Yea and all this in dede he can do quod she.
Why then he is a Sothesayer and a Sorcerer quod J. Well quod she if he have so
much cunning in his belly, he is the happier, and it is the more joy of him.
Nay quod I, it were mere folyshnes for him to carry his cunning in his belly:
and why, quod she. Why quod I, think you that men of learning and knowledge
cary their cunning in their bellies? Where else quod she, and why not? Mary quod
I, if he should bear his cunning there, he should always waste it when he
went to the privy, so in time he should lose all his cunning. This being
merylye spoken: turned me afterwards not to a little displeasure, even at their
hands, where I had deserved and looked for friendship as of duty: but I must
cease to marvel any longer at this, when almost every such abominable
vylaine is defended upheld, and maintained, by such as of right, and
according to the wholesome laws of this realm, should punish them for these
their abusions. Yet surly the grieffe were the less, if only the blind,
superstitious antiquity, had a regard and love to such deceauers. But now a
great number that have borne an outward show of great holynes, and love to
Gods holy word: We see them seek daily, to such o^elishe Wyches and
Sorcerers, If their finger do but ache, as though they were Gods, and could
presently help them wit words: although they know that God in his Israell,
hath called them an abhominacion, and hath farther commanded, that none such
should be suffered among them to live.

Thyrdlie in the year of our Lord a thousand syue hundred fifty and eight,
there came to Maydstone one Thomas Lufkyn, by occupation a Fuller, and burler
of clothe, and had been brought by (by report of diverse honest men,) at the
fullyng mylles there beside the town, nevertheless he had ben lunge absent from
that country, in which time he had by roving abroad becomde a Phisicien, a
Chirurgien, an Astronomier, a palmister, a phisiognomier, a sothsayer, a
fortune deuyner, and I can not tell what. This deceauer was the beastliest
beguiler by his sorcerys that ever I herd of, making Physike the only colour,
to cover all his crafty theft, and mischiefs, for he set up a bill at his
first coming, to publish his being there, the tenor whereof was in effect
as follows:

If any manne woman, or child, be sick, or would be let blood, or be
diseased, with any manner of inward or outward grefes, as al manner of agues,
or fevers, plurises, cholyke, stone, strangulion, impostumes, f^stulas kanker,
goutes, pocks, bone ache, and payne of the joins, which comes for lack of
bloudlettyng: let them resort to the sign of the Sarazens head, in the east
lane, and bring their waters with them to be scene, and they shall have
remedy. Byme Thomas Luffkin.

Unto this Devil incarnate, resorted all sorts of vain and indiscreet
persons, as it were to a God, to know all secretes paste and to come,
specially women, to know how many husbands and children they should have,
and whether they should bury their husbands then living. And to be brefe,
there was not so great a secrete, that he would not take upon him to declare,
unto some he prophesied death within a month, who thanks be to God are yet
living, and in health. All this he boasted that he could do by Astronomy. But
when he was talked with of one that had but a yonge and small skill in that
art. He could make no direct answer no more then pup my dog.

This beast could with a wooden face, brag, face, and set out his maters
with bold task: that the simple people was by him, marvelously seduced to
believe his lies, and boastinge tales.

Among many that talked with him, one of mine acquaintance asked him this
question: sir quod he, if you be so cunning as ye are named, or as you would
fain be esteemed to be, Wherefore go ye, and travail ye, from place to place?
For being so cunning, ye can not lack wheresoever ye dwell: for people will
resort unto you far and ne'er, seeking upon you: so that you should not
need thus to travail for your living. Unto whom he made this beastly
answer, I know quod he by Astronomye the influence of the stars and thereby
perceive, when and howe long any place shall be unto me fortunate: and when I
perceive by the stars, that any euell fortune, is like to chance to me in
that place: I straight way wisely avoid the danger, and goo to an other
place, whereas I know it will be fortunate and lucky. For what use they to
cloak their villainies with, but Astronomye, Physic, and Surgery, as I
showed you before.

But this false knave had answered more truly, if he had said thus. Though
for a time as all new ^angels are highly set by and marveled at, among
the foolish and rude people, so naughty false merchantes with their crafty,
and villainous feseightes, may for a time have credits and success according
to their wicked expectations: yet in a while with use, the people will begin to
smell out, and be weary of their doings, which they at the first so
gredelye did seek, for the strange news. For such false deceauers, perceive
and know, that the fond minds of the common rude multitude of people, at the
first, in seekynge to see strange things, are mad of desire. And as they
are unreasonable in seekynge the news, so are they soon weary of the use
thereof: for much familiarity engenders contempt, even in good things.
Therefore when men begin to perceive, and to espy the craft and subtilty of
such deceauers, it is time for them to change their place that they may the
easilyer deceive again, where there: falshode is strange and new, and all
together unknown. If I say he had thus answered, he had said the very
truth. This deceauer had sufficient audacitye, with talk to set out his
falshode, and to bear down all that be ignorant, so lunge as his knavery
knackes were unknown. Well the end of his being there, was as it is common
with them all, without any difference, for he suddenly was gone with many a
poor man money, which he had taken before hand: promising them help,
which only he recompensed with ^he winge of his heles.

Fourthlye, in the year of our Lord a thousand, five hundred and three
score. One Ualentyne, came into a Parish, in the weld of Kent^ called
Staplehurste: whereas he changed his name, calling him self master Wynkfylde:
affirmynge him self to be the son of a worshipful Knight of that name. This
abominable deceauer, made the people believe, that he could tel all things
present, past, and to come: And the very thoughts of men, and their diseases,
by only lokinge in their faces. When any came to him with vrines: (which
commonly in the country they bring in a stone cruise,) he made them believe,
that only by feeling the weight thereof, he would tell them all their diseases
in their bodies, or without: And other while made them believe, that he went to
ask council of the deuel, by going a little aside, and mu^blyng to him self,
and then coming again, would tell them all and more to. For what care or
shame of euell have these hell hounds who see their abomination: but even as
the Ape turns his filthy parts to every man syghte: so shame they not
to acknowledge the selves to have conference with the devil, yt so yet all wise
men may know their deeds to be all devilish. wherein the vain opinion of some,
(though not of the wisest sort,) helps the not a little* who esteem those
damnable arts to be high points of learning. Oh Eth^ike madness.

This beastly beguyler so incensed in short space the vayn minds, of the
rude and wauerynge multitude of people: that he was sought unto, and esteemed
more a great deal the God (oh Heathenish and Idolatrous people, not much
unlike this was their outrageous madness to their peuysh pilgrimages: wherewith
in times past they were most miserably bewiched). Yea such a wonderful fame
and brute, went abroad of his doings, that some of the very worshipfulles
of those parts were stricken with admiration, and desire to seek to him, to
know many good morowes. Whereof also he would not a little brag and boast.
But as time reveals all things, so this deulyshe beast in short time was
known in his right kind and name: and that he had.iii. wives living at that
present: of which the first lived very porelye and miserably in Canturbury: The
second after she knew his wickedness, departed from him, and married after with
a pressed. The third which he at that present had, he married at Westmynster, as
I was credible informed, being there a rich widow. But now after this
vylaynie was known by his first wise coming to Staplehurst, he ran away from
her also, leaving her desolate, undone, and in much misery for he had spent
all her substance by riotous fare. For he was reported to fare at his table
like a Lord, and was served as fynelye as a Prince: but such shameful deeds
can never be without wicked end, at the least at Gods hand, though it be
neglected of the Magistrates.

This last wife being sent on his errand to Maydstone, to an Apothicaries
widow for certain drougges, chanced to forget some of their names:
wherewith the women being both not a little troubled the Apothecaries widow
asked why her husband did not write for his things, whereunto his woman
answered, that Master Wynkfylde was a right Latynist, for he could write no
Englyshe. By this ye may perceive he was a well learned manne.

This woman being as I said left desolate, married after with one Thomas
Riden, who was his man, who went together to Westminster, there to dwell:
whither not log after, this Winkefield came, minding again to seduce the woman
to follow him, as before she had. Who, so detested, his late beastly usance,
that she complained him so to the Archebyshop of Canturbury, other of the
quenes majesties honourable council: that he was long imprisoned in the gate
house, He was whipped.
and for his wickedness sore punyshed. Yet in the end being delivered, he
ceased not any whit to use his old practise: for he came immediately, to
Robardesbridge in Sussexe, where he wrought the like wickedness as before. and
being there espied, within a while, with diverse wicked facts, he removed:
putting on a brazen face, came again into Kente* to Staplehurst: where he
freshly renewed, the use of his odiouse feats: for the which master Bisley,
person of Staplehurste, caused him to be ascited of the ordinary to the
spiritual court, as an adulterer, and a woorker by diulishe and magical
arts. Wherefore he removed two miles from thence, to a parish called Marden,
thynkinge him self thereby the more salfe: but the law notwithstanding,
proceeded so against him, that he was there upon his contempt excommunicated:
and yet never left his old fashions. He spent in his house weekly six pound
(as diverse honest men reported,) in meat and drink: with such resort
and banketyngee, as it was a wonder to see, whereby he not a little augmented
his fame: the people resorting to him far and nyghe, for he would tell them
such wonders, that all had him in admiration. But especially, he was cunning.
to enchant women to love, and did for rewards, diverse feats in such
cases: lastly, he began to work properly for himself as follows.

At a parish called Loose, in the hundred of Maydstone, a certain blind man,
called blind Orgar, had a wife who was sick of diverse aches and
swellynges, who hearing of this marvelous monster: sent her daughter upon a
wednesday, down to Marden, with her water, to this master Wynkfelde: who so
enchanted her, that she forgot her way home to her father and mother, in so
much that her mother thought her loss: for she tarried there till the
saturdaye following. Then taking her way homeward, and being come half way,
her mind was so intoxicate, that she returned back again to her lover: who
lovingly (fearing least her friends should make exclamation thereof,)
accompanied her, till she was nyghe at home: and then returning, he promised
her, to come to her mother by a certain day: which he in deed performed.
And so filled he the simple woman, with such flattering, and crafty
persuasions, and fair promyses of health: that she thought nothing to
whotte, or to heavy for him, no, not her daughter, as it apeared: for he
forsook Marden (where he was.xii. pound in debt, upward) and came to
inhabit at Loose, in this poor blind mans house: in so much that in a
while, all people theraboute spake much shame, that it was suffered.

The which report, at such time as it came to the ears of the worshipful
Justices thereabouts: with also the trade of his former life: the complaint
of diverse honest men, whose money he had taken, and deceived them: and the
clamour of his creditors, to whom he ought, as is aforesaid:) They sent out
their warrant, to all Constables of that hundred, chargynge them to aprehende,
and bring him before them at Maydstone, the thursdaye following. Who being
warned thereof, by certain disemblyng men, and chiefly, a flattering minister:
he fled could not be found, neither was he since heard of in that country.
This later fit chanced in the year of our lord, 1562. in lent. Many more
particular histories could I here write of his detestable facts: but to
avoid prolixity, I leave them at this time, trusting that this may suffyce,
to describe what he is, and to give al men warning of him and all other like
deceivers.

The truth was so: he had no learning in the world, nor could read
English, (and as I suppose, knew not a letter, or a. b. from a bateldore,) as
it was well proved, yet made he the people believe that he could speak Latin,
Greek, and Hebrue.

Item in the year. 1562. there came to the town of Maidstone, an old fellow,
who took upon him, to heal all diseases, as a profound phisitien: whom
(forbecause men had been so deluded, by diverse former deceivers) I caused to be
examined, before the officers of the said town. And when he was asked his
name* he said John Bewly, secodly where he dwelled: and he answered at London, in
the old bailey, against sir Roger Chamley: Thirdly, if he were a phisitien, he
said yea. Fourthly, where he learned that art, and he said by his own
study. Fiftly, where he studied it, he answered, in his own house. Sixtly,
what authors he had red. He said Eliote, and others Seventhly, we asked
what other: and he said, he had forgotten. Eightly, we asked him what wear the
names of Eliotes books: he said, he remembered not. Then we brougth him an
Englyshe bo^ke to read, which he refused: but when he was commanded to
read, he desired us to be good to him, for he was a poor man, and in deed
could not read: and said, that he intended not to tarry there, but to repair
home again. This being done on a sunday, after evensong: his host was bound
for his foorthcoming the next day: when upon his humble suit, he was let go:
being warned with exhortations, to leave such false and naughty deceits.

Farther in the same year, one Willia a shoemaker, came into Kente, pretending
to be very cunning, in curing diseases of the eyes. And being brought to a
friend of mine, to have his judgement in ones eye, whereof ye sight was weak:
first putting them in much fear, of the eye: he at length promised, to do
great things thereto. But the friends of ye party diseased, destered me first
to talk with him, to understand his cunning, which I at their request, did at
a time appointed, asked him if he understood, what was ye cause of her
infirmity, he said he could not tel: but he wold heal it, he doubted not.
Then I asked him, whether he were a surgien, or a phisitie: and he answered no,
he was a shoemaker, but he could heal all manner of sore eyes.

I asked him where he learned that: he said that was no matter. Well said I,
saying that you can heal sore eyes: what is an eye, whereof is it made, of what
members or parts is it composed? a^d he said he knew not that. Then I asked
him if he wear worthy to be a shoemaker, or to be so called, that knew not
howe, or whereof a shoe was made? he answered no, he was not worthy. Then said
I, howe dare you work upon such a precious, and intricate member of man, as
is the eye: saying you know not the nature thereof: and why, or by what reason,
it doth see more then a mans nose, or his hand doth. He answered, that though
he could not tell this: yet could he heal all manner of sore eyes. And that
where as master Luke of London, hath a great name of curing eyes: he could
do that which master Luke could not do, nor turn his hand to. Thus bragged
this proud varlet against and above, that reverent man of known learning
and experience. And I said I thought so: for master Luke said I, is no
shoemaker. Well said he, I perceive you do but scorn me, and flung out of
the doors in a great fume. And could not be caused to tarry and drink by any
entreaty, neither have I since that time heard any thing of him.

What other men and women besides these, have come into the forsayde place: If
I should rehearse them, and the discourse of their doings: It wear to
tedious, yea it wold abhor any honest mans ears to hear of it. There came a
woman thither (as she reported herself) a ministers wife, (but I think she
falsely lied,) in the aforesaid year. The officers hearing of her
prophession, called her before them, and examined her: with whom she was so
stout, as to say (when she was warned to depart the town, in payne of
inprysonment,) these words. I have quod the, travelled through all parts of
this realm, and I was yet never forbidden in any place, to minister my
physike, and hath (said she) your town a privilege above all other, to
forbydde me to do good, and to heal the queenes liege people? Then was she
asked what authority she had, or of whom she was allowed thus to do, or
what certificate she had brought with her, to witness with her, of her good
behauour in places where she was before? And she said she was never before so
examined, neither feared to be put to such trial, neither saw she ever the
place, that a woman could find so little courtesy: especially, sith she
asked nothing gratis of any man, or otherwise then for her money. these stout
words notwithstanding, she was expelled ye town.

And not long after came thither a makeshifte, with two men wayghting on him,
as very rakehelles as him self, bragging that he was a profound phisicien:
being called by the officers to examinatio, was so streyghtly charged, yt he
confessed himself and his men, to be fellows in friendship, and all of one
krewe: and that this was a shift, mutually devised among them to get money: and
so wear they expelled the town: or rather they shifted suddenly away, for
fear of punyshement: which if they had tarried, they could not have escaped,
so good then was the mind of the officers for that year. And now one
history of the time present, to knit up this my tale of vagabonds,
rennegates most hateful.

One Robert Nicols, a false deceiver, and most ignorant beast, and of the
profession of vagaboundes, (as wear his former fellows:) Hath in times passed
boasted him self to have been the seruaunt of master Uicary, late Sergeant
Chyrurgien to the Queenes highness. But now the matter being put in trial, he
^ayeth he was apprentice with a priest. Among whose wicked prodigious doings,
(which are infinite,) one very notable chanced in the year of our lord. 15.
4. the. 26. of September. He poured in a purgation to an honest woman of good
fame, one Riches wydows, of Linton (a parish three miles distant from
Maydestone): which within three or four hours at the most, purged the life
out of her body: so violent was this mortal potion. The woman being before in
perfect health, to all men's judgements: being only of simplicity persuaded
to take the same, by the deceivable persuasions of this Nicols: Who made fair
whether of all things, and her to believe, that he would deliver her of such
diseases, as in deed she had not. For he should have had by compositio, xx.
shillings for the said drink.

For this murderous fact, he was by the Queenes majesties Justices,
apprehended, and imprisoned in the Gail of Maydstone. Where he was communed
with all, concerning his knowledge and doings, and for what cause he gave her
that purgation, and howe she was persuaded to take it. He answered, that he
knew by her complexion, that her liver and her lunges wear rotten, and
therefore he could her so. Whereunto one replied saiynge, nay, she was not
sick, but thou tauldest her so for thy fylthye lucre, she believed thee. And
because (as thou saydest) thou knew all this by her complexion, I pray thee
what complexion am I of? He answered, you are sanguine. Then was it asked him,
whether it wear proper to a sanguyne man, to have black hear, as that party
had on his heard? To* this he answered, O, ye will say ye are more a the
Choler. Then the party gave him his hand to feel, which was commonly cold,
saiynge: is a Choleric man wont to be so cold? Which when he had felt,
he said: O then ye would be of the fleme. Then was he asked, what is a
sanguine man, or why is he called sanguine? He answered a sanguine man, is he
that has a good disgesture. Mary as thou say quod the demander, here in
haste thou showed howe great thy cunning is in iudgyng complexions. Then was
it said to him, ye profess both Physic and Chirurgerit: What authors have
you red? He answered Vigo, and Gasken. Then was it demanded, what medicine
gave thou the woman wherewith thou haddeste so evil luck? And he said
Catapussis. Then being rebuked, for that he would take on him to give
medicynes inwardly, whereof he knew not the names, much less the natures:
He said, as stoutly, as obstinately, that he knew as many purgations as ye
party that reproved him. Then he asked him of four or five, such as came
first to mind, as Tamar indes, Myrobalanes, Agarick c. Of all ye which he said
he knew none. Then was he required to name them that he did know. And he said
he knew Catapussis and Catapistela. Then was he asked what Catapistela was:
Why quod he to the demander, do not you know it? No said the party, not by
that name. And it was further asked, whether it wear an herb, a root, a
tree, a stone, the hove, horne, or tail of a beast, or what it was? Nicols
answered that it was none of those, but a thing made beyond the seas: It is
not made in Englande quod he, I think it be made in France. Then was he
again reproved, for his beastly braggyng. And here may thou see quod the
person that reasoned with him,) thine own ignorance, in that thou say it
is made, where it is in deed the fructe of a tree, called Cas^ia Fistula (as I
think thou meanest,) and not Catapistela. And he answered (not withstanding
his former impudency,) it is so: saying also thus, oh, you call it Casia,
belike because it is like a case.

Then this man beginning to prove his cunning, in the natures of symples, asked
him the nature of Pepper. He said it was hot in the first degree, and cold
in the second. Why then said the demaundaunt, what say you to the nature of
an oyster? And he (answering as before of the temperamente,) said cold in
the first degree, and hot in the third. Then was it said to the standers
by, here may you see his beastly ignorance, did ye ever hear that two
contraries* could dwell together and agree in one subject? Whereunto this
lewd fellow most proudly answered. Though I can not reason so well as you,
but am confounded at your hand: yet have I done great and many cures, which
said he comes of somewhat: though you say I know nothing. After this one
asked him if he wear by authority admitted, according to the laws of this
realm, to use Physic and Surgery, as a practiser of the sam. To whom an
other said: think you that any such ignorant ass as this is, can be any where
so admitted? Unto all this he said, if none should be suffered to use the but
the learned, or such as are permitted: a great many poor people should
perish for lack of help. To this he was answered. Nay, rather a great
number, that are daily killed or lamed. by such ignorant beasts as thou art,
might (by the benefit of nature, and other good helps of cunning men) recover
right well and live: If such as thou art wear not.

Among other questions of the Anatomy, to al the which he answered as beastly,
as in other things before: It was asked him what the spleen was, and he
answered, that it was a disease in the side, baked harde like a biscuit: deniyng
that there was any thing called the spleen, but the disease (says he) so
called.

Then was it further demanded of him (because he boasted much of
Chirurgerie,) what a wound was? and he answered a wound is a hurt or a
bruise. What is an ulcer then said the opponente^ he answered, an ulcer is a
wound. And then being asked whether a wound and an ulcer wear all one, he
said, a wound is that which is new, and an ulcer is that which is old. To
this it was replied that an ulcer might also be new, and that it was an ulcer,
though it wear but one day old. After this he said that he knew an ulcer
with a Canker, also a Marmole and a Fistula. Wherefore he was asked what was a
Canker, and he said. A Canker is when an ulcer doth by rankling become a
Canker. Whereunto one replied saying. A Cancer may in dede be vlcerate and is
often so: but that every ulcer may by rankling (as thou says) become a
Cancer: it hath not been red nor seen. But then he said that he spake of a
Canker not of a Cancer: for a Cancer said he is when an ulcer stynketh.

Much more could I write of his beastly answers, if I thought this not
enough, yea to much, except it wear better. And though I think this enough,
to grieve any wise mans eyes to see, or ears to hear: yet shall I desire them
to bear with a word or twain more, that what they are, even the unskilful
may perceive, and learn to beware of them.

A certain patient of mine, (having lately been cured at my hand,) metynge
with this Nicols at his brothers house, reasoned with him of a payne that he
sometime had in his hyppe: I trow quod he, ye cal it a Sciatica, do ye not?
Yea said Nicols: there is a Sciatica, and a Sciitica. Then said my patient, I
never heard my Chyrurgien name any such. Who is that said Nicols? and my
patient named me. Then began Nicols to praise a neighbour of mine, saying that
he was cunninger then I: but my patient praised me, to be cunninger then my
neighbour. Yea said Nicols, in talk: Halle can talk better. Then said my
patient: I had a grievous sore leg, with great apostemacions and
hollowness: wherefore, if he could have done nothing but talk, he might have
talked long enough to my leg, before it would so have been whole.

Unto the same man also he made his vaunt on a time, that he saw his master,
close a mans head together: that was clefte from the crown of the head, down
to the neck: who said he was after healed, and did live. This shamles lye,
being heard of a merry man: was with an other like lye quited, on this sort.
Tush (said this merry man) I have heard of as great a matter as this. For a
certain man, falling into the hands of thieves, was robbed: and his head was
so smooth cut off, that it stood styll upon his neck till he rode home:
whose wife meting him at the door, perceived his bosom bloody, and asked him
if his nose had bled: which words when the man heard, he took his nose in
his hand to blow it, and therewith threw his head in at the door. And now as
it is time I leave also this monster, least I should to much weary the loving
reader, with the long reading of these most frivolous comunications, and
tragedious doings, (which I have with grief of heart written, trusting that
it will not only be a warning unto some, that they commit not their life and
health insicknesse, unto such life purgers: but also that it coming to the
hands of some virtuous mean, may with the pity of other men's miseries, move
them to labour, to the most of their power, to redress these euels.) Omitting
also one Carter, otherwise called Caruell, otherwise May. Who is a Sorcerer,
and a worker by dyuelyshe spirits, clokyng the same under the colour of
Physic: and hath done much mischief among the people, with his abhorrefull
doings. Which I will hereafter (as leysoure and occasion shall serve,)
farther declare.

I will here also omit to talk of Grigge the Poulter, with diverse other,
whose ends have made their doings known. And also of a Joiner in London, a
Frencheman borne, that is of late become a Phisitien: who is esteemed at this
day, among diverse right worshipful, to be very learned, and cunning, that
know not his original: yea, they call him doctor James. But an honest woman,
an old neighbour of his, (not lunge since) at a ma of worshyppes house in
Kente, marveled to see him in such bravery, and lordly apparel: Who when
she took acquaintance of him, he wrong her harde by the hand, and rounded
her in the ear, saying: If thou be an honest woman, keep thy tongue in thy
headde, and say nothing of me.

For surely, a monstrous great legend should I make, it I should here recite
all such, as I have known heard of. But if any man would know more, of the
doings of these deceyuers runnegates: let him read a little book, called a
Galley late come into Englande, from Terra Nova, laden with Phisitiens,
Apothecaries and Chirurgiens, c. The author whereof I know not. Also let them
read a little work, entitled A Poesy, made in form of a vision, c. lately
imprinted. Also let them read the verses of master Bulleyne, in his Bulwark,
In the Dialogue between sorenes, and Surgery: where he right truly,
pleasantly, describes them in their right colours. In the which book also in
diverse places, he notes ye sleighty practises, of such abusers as he hath
know, in diverse coutreis.

What shall we think Diogenes would say, if he now lived, and saw so many
rustical crafts men leave their mysteries, and become Phisitiens? saying he
said to one that was a weak wrestler, (and after became a Phisitien,) these
words in effect: what intend thou now quod he, craftily, and privily be
revenged of them that wear wont to vanquish or overthrow thee? Or what
would Socrates now say, who said (upon like occasion) to a painter, that
became a phisitien? now thou workest subtillye (quod he,) for whereas before
thine errors were espied, and judged of all men: now thou will hyde them in
the earth, or bury the in ye ground. Meaning (without doubt) yt such
phisiciens are more like to kill me, the to save, or heal the.

Well sure if there were good orders in all places, the wholesome laws of this
realm well executed: there could none such dereyue, with their running about,
and kreping into corners, unsuspected, examined. For it is easy to coiecture,
or rather perfectly to know, that no honest cunning man, that means truly,
and instlye, will refuse to dwell and continue, in some esteemed city or town:
(for unto such wise and learned men delight to resort,) and to run about here
and there, through all the realm, thus like vacaboundes, to deceive the
unskilful people, with their beastly doings.

I trust yet one day to see it better looked on. And in the mean season let a
great many abusers (whom I know especially in Kent, both men and women, have
not here named them,) repeat and leave their wickedness. Otherwise let them assure
them selves, I will no more stay to publysh them with their wicked doings,
knavery knackes, bringing the into this register, the I have don to setforth
these.

It shall behove every good chirurgien therefore, to place him self in some
good town, or famous city, and surely the people will resort unto him, and
send for him at their need, to his sufficient profit and living: neither will
any good man despeyre of this.

It can not be without suspicion therefore, either of ye lack of cunning, or of
a deceivable false conscience: that a Chirurgien, or Phisitien, shall refuse to
fire himself constantly in some dwelling place, and to become a wandering
fugitive, as these were and are, of whom I have written.

Not withstanding, I am not ignorant that constant dwellers may be also
deceauyng abusers: so long as there is no punyshment, nor execution of laws to
the contrary, as for example.

One named Kiterell, dwells in Kente, at a parish called Bedersoen: that hath
been all his life a sawyer of timber and board, a man very simple, and
altogether unlearned: Who at this present is become a Phisitien, or rather a
detestable deceauyng sorcerer. He will give judgment on vrines, and while
that he looks on the water, he will grope and feel him self all about: and
otherwhyle, where as he feleth, he will shrynke, as though he were pricked, or
felt some great pain. Then he turns to the messenger and tells him
where, in what sort the party is grieved: which makes the people think him
very cunning. They seek to him far and near for remedy, for such as are
bewyched or enchanted: and as they commonly term it, forspoken. What stuff
this is, let the wise and learned judge. And he hath so prospered with these
doings, that in short space he hath been able, both to purchase and build,
as I am credibly informed, of diverse men that do know and have seen the same.
For there are many that report, (and they no small fools,) that he hath cured
such as al the learned Phisitiens in England could do no good unto, believe it
who will.

Not withstanding Cardanus a learned Philosopher, in his work De Subtilitate,
in the tenth book thereof, entitled of spirits or devils, seems to prove
that there are certain griefs, chaunsing sometime to mans body by
enchantment, or the working of cursed sciences: Whereof for so much as
physic and chirurgerie, know no cause, they are also to seek of a remedy.
For in these laudable arts, there is a reasonable cause found of every
disease: upon the reason whereof, there is ordained a remedy. But when through
diuilyshe and wicked sciences, there is any sycknesse procured, whereof the
laudable art of medicine knows not ye cause: so can it procure no help. But
only by help of some of those sciences most detestable, must the same be taken
away again: so that it seems to be a common composition among them, the one
to torment the bodies, both of man beasts, that an other may be sought unto,
to remedy the same: So one being ever a workynge instrument to an other. For
the said Cardanus being a learned Phisitien, and great Philosopher of our time,
of Mylayne, citeth for an example, a marvelous history, done in the same
city: which I will here write, that the gentle reader may by comparing the
same with others: the better understand the great subtilties, and wicked
workings of such kind of persons: the history is as follows.

Dygressing a while from that which we have said, we will now rehearse what
we this last year have scene. A certain wise in the city of Mylayne, being
come of a noble stock, was sick of a whote or burning urine, with a
continual desire to expel the same. About the which the most famous
Phisitiens of our said city (being seven in number, beside other strange
ones, with also the Chirurgiens) were convocated, I my self being present: and
yet we all could not well agree of the cause of her grief. For some esteemed it
to be a stone, one called it Erysipelas, commonly called saint Antonies fire:
an other an ulcer, other named it an harde tumor, called Scirrbus: other said
it was a Cancer, some affirmed that it was an Aposteme, some that it was
certain vessikes or blisters: but remedies there could none be found against
those affects. But through whotte fomentations, there were certain vessikes
or blisters made, which were cut. And through the use of those violent
torments, there followed an inu^luntary emission or letting go of urine,
whereof there followed to her at.ii. times, a dangerous accidence namely a spasme
or cramp, without pulse or strength. Thus being tormented by this malady,
seven whole months without remedy, she was of the Phisitiens forsaken, and in
utter despeyre of health. And certainly she did not feign her grefe
considering that she drunk so many bitter medicines, with suffering so many
fomentations and perfumes, permittyng also that secret place to to be seen,
of so great a nubre of Phisitiens, beholding it by a glass: observing also the
diet so lunge a time, suffering bloudlettyng, suffering the forsayde vessickes
to be cut, and the application and working of so many corrostues or burning
medicines, which procured escares, besides Iron instruments and fire. Wherefore
we being out of comfort, and uncertain of the sycknesse, at the last, they
condescended to my sentence: which was not the greatest absurdity of all, as
hereafter shall apere, which sentence was grounded on this argument. That the
disease did wax worse, and grew more and more, through the medycines. The
payne was continually in the place, where the neck of the bladder doth join
with the neck of the matrix: with a great extenuation or falling away of the
body into leanes, with such a face as is described of Hippocrates. The
emission of urine, was not voluntary, though there were a continual desire to
do it. There were ulcers also about the place, which were made partly through
the heate and sharpness of the medicines, and partly through the importune
attraction of Iro. Nevertheless the burning of urine did not only remain but
increase, she evermore having a fervent desire to make water, in so much that
some Phisitiens did think that there was a stone in the bladder: albeit the
searching with an vrinary instrument, called in Greek Catheter, took away that
opinion: But now at the last when it was published al abroad, yt this woman
was extremely sick, there stepped forth to her help, one Iosephus Niger, a
renouined professor of the Greek letters: who was of some suspected to be an
enchanter, or worker in the wicked sciences: This woman having a son of.x.
years old, which was scoller to the said Joseph, of him instituted unto
letters. This Joseph brought with him a glass of Crystal, in form of a
triangle, wherein he caused the child to look: who said that therein he saw
three foul ugly spirits, standing on their feet before his mother. when he
had whistered other words in the childes ear, the child said that he saw
an other spirit on horseback, more high and great the the other.iii. with a
sceptour threforked, or of three pricks, who bound the other three spirits,
one after an other, and being so bound, he did them under his saddel: which
done, he delivered his glass to be kept. Why should I stand so long rehersing
this history? This woman having some perswasio by this art doth fall on
sleep, her grefe, her burning, and her appetite to make water doth cease, ye
rosiall colour came again in her face, her flesh was restored unto a good
liking: so that anon after she conceived: and thus was she well perfectly
healed. And for the proof hereof, I have to witness all the familiars of the
woman, all the phisitiens convocated, and the effect it self. For where as
before she was a dead body, now may each one see her in health.

And now it must follow (saying that there can be found none other cause) that
this woman was healed by a spirit, or by imagination, or by hope. For if the
child spake the truth, (Iosephus dissembling the matter for fear of ye law:)
she was healed by a spirit. If ye child were taught instructed before of
Iosephus, to speak al that he should require of him, then it was a subtlety,
wrought for the health of his mother: so it should appear, that she was healed
by imagination, or by confidence. And surely this doyng were marvelous, saying
Joseph would take no reward, neither know I to what end such a subtlety
or fraud should extend: not only because he took no money, but also
considering, what infamy would succeed, in as much as he knew not, what
good, or ill success would come, of such an enterprise. Wherefore it is like
to be true, that she was healed of a spirit. Thus far Cardanus.

It may chance now, that some whose minds are already affectionate to these
arts, will say: yt it is necessary that such men should be, for the comfort
of them that have need, when as no help otherwise will serve. To whom it may
be answered: that if they be Christian me, they ought not to seek help at
devils: sith ye holy ghost by the mouth of saint Paule hath warned, that no
man do euell that good may come thereof. Farthermore, if none such (as god in
his holy law hath commanded) were suffered to live, there could no such
inconvenience chance, whereby any man should have need to seek to them for
help: saying that there is never any need of their aid, but where the effect
is first caused, through the wicked working of those damnable arts. But let
this suffice that we have spoken, concerning the wicked abuses of Physic and
Chirurgerie: and let us now proceed to the duty of the Chirurgien, and the
good observation of his office: which will avoid these and all like abuses,
whereunto at this day (God amend it) Physic and Surgery, is made a cloak.
For none of these false merchantes will wyllyngly be called, by the name of
that which they most use: but they will be called Phisiciens, Chirurgiens,
and Astronomers, when they can as much skill in any of them as brute beasts.
And concerning the behauour, that is required in a true Chirurgien to his
patient, of one Chirurgien to an other concerning council, honest working
and knowledge: I have thought good to gather the councels, and good documents,
of divers good and veterate authors, (and have formed the same into Englyshe
verses, or metre:) and here to place the same, for the better instruction of
all yonge Chirurgiens: that it may as well be easy to learn, as apt to be
kept in memory, of all willing learners.

Hark and draw ne'er ye young students,
Your ears loke ye unclose:
The worthy art Surgery,
To practise that purpose.
And mark what the great masters say,
That here before have wrought:
And did to their disciples leave,
In wrytinge what they taught.
And to their scholars did descriue,
A brief methode or way:
Commaundinge them the same to mark,
On this wise began they say.
When thou art called at any time,
A patient to see:
And dost perceive the cure to great,
And ponderous for thee.
See that thou lay disdain aside,
And pride of thine own skill:
And think no shame counsel to take,
But rather with good will,
Get one or two of expert men,
To help thee in that need:
And make them partakers with thee,
In that work to proceed.
For in so doing thine honesty,
Thou shalt well keep and save:
Also thy patient thereby,
Right great comfort shall have.
By this means thou may haplye learn,
right seldom scene before,
Of thee, or him which first thee taught:
Though thou have cunning store.
And also if onghte go a wry,
Or hinder in thy cure:
The one may mend the others fault,
while friendship doth endure.
The wounded or sore man also,
Shall have no cause to grudge:
In you such vniformitye,
while he may see and judge.
And farthermore thou haste thy part,
Both of profyt and fame:
when that your work has good success,
And luckilye doth frame.
And if it hap to frame amiss,
Suspicyon can be none:
Since thou haste sought all means of health,
And wouldste not be alone.
So each man shall with other bear,
Thy just cause to defend:
All wise and learned men also,
Shall thee praise and commend.
For all that be discrete doubtless,
will judge thee to be wise:
In that thou doest desire to learn,
And augment thy practise.
And will not that through negligence,
And pride of thine own way:
Thy patient in pain should spill,
To perish and dekaye.
Thy purpose thus thou shalt attain,
with ease and honesty:
where otherwise it may thee bring,
Shame and ignominye.
And farther if thou way it right,
It is easy to guess:
That better two, then one alone,
All errores may redress.
For as all men that here do live,
Borne in this wretched vale,
Are fraughted full of errores great,
Our boot mixed with bale.
From which the prudent Salomon,
was never void and free:
As of him self he writes plain,
who so will read may see.
So if thou in Chirurgerye,
Alone will walk and wade:
Thine errores will thy work confound,
And all thine honour quade.
Sith Bernarde knew not all him self,
Think never in thy mind:
But that at last by painful proof,
Thou shalt thine errores find.
For errores not staide at the first,
But suffered to proceed:
To mischiefs great as Plato says,
will grow in very dede.
But the beginning if thou stop,
By good counsel and pure:
All doubtful things thou shalt prevent,
And harde diseases cure,
For all to late comes remedy,
when through thy negligence:
The grief is grown paste aide and cure,
And all experience.
But one thing note, when two or more
Together ioygned be:
About the painful patient,
See that ye do agree.
See that no discord do arise,
Nor be at no debate:
For that shall sore discomfort him,
That is in sick estate.
And when alone with your sore man,
One of you is present:
Defame nor dispraise in no wise,
The same that is absent.
For nought can more discomfort him,
That lies in grief and peyne:
Then hear that one of you doth bear,
To other such disdeine.
wherefore what so ye have to say,
In things about your art:
Let it be done among your selves,
In secrete and a part.
with one consent vniformlye,
Comfort the wounded man:
But unto some good friend of his,
Express all that ye can.
And let them know the danger great,
That like is to succeed:
Prognosticatinge wittilye,
And in convenient speed.
wherefore each one of you shall take,
At other his counsel:
Howe that in most convenient wise,
Ye may the grief expel.
And so that one in any wise,
From other nothing hide:
But by all means consulte, and for
The sick man health provide.
For in that need if any do,
His counsel keep a aloof:
And so the wounded man decay,
It shall be his reproof.
See that for goulde or couetise,
Ye take no thing in hand:
which incurable for to be,
Ye do well understand.
Or ought unless to cure the same,
Thou have some perfect ground:
For if thou do, it will thy fame
In utter shame confound.
Look of thy self in any wise,
Thou make no praise nor boste:
For that shall turn to thy dispraise,
when thou doest use it most.
See thou dispraise none other man,
His error though thou know:
For sure an other for thy plage,
Shall thee like curtsye show.
Commend the deeds of each good man,
The best loke that thou say:
So shall good fame redound to thee,
From all men day by day.
Not only in surgery,
Thou ought to be expert:
But also in Astronomye,
Both preuye and aperte.
In natural Philosophy,
Thy study should be bent:
To know each herb, shrubbe, root and tree,
Must be thy good intent,
Each beast and foul, with worm and fish,
And all that bears life:
Their virtues and their natures both,
with thee ought to be rife.
And in the ground metal and stone,
And veins of earth also:
Their powers and virtues in degre,
Should not be hid the fro.
But chieflye the Anatomye,
Ye ought to understand:
If ye will cure well any thing,
That ye do take in hand.
For by the same above the rest,
Ye shall great fame deserve:
The life of man from many streightes,
To save and well preserve.
without the knowledge of which art,
thou can not chose but err:
In all that thou shalt go about,
Thy knowledge to prefer:
As if ye cut or cauterize,
Or use Phlebotomye:
Ye can not but err in the same,
without Anatomye.
He is no true Chirurgien,
That can not show by art,
The nature of eurye member,
Each from other apart.
For in that noble handye work,
There doth nothing excel,
The knowledge of Anatomye,
If it be learned well.
Endeavour therefore by all means,
The same to know and cunne,
For when thou haste it perfectly,
Thine art is halflye won.
For thereby shalt thou understand,
Of each member in dede,
Their nature and their offices,
And howe they do proceed.
And unto what good use they serve,
As well the least as most,
And by their hurt Prognosticate,
what action will be lost.
whereby of knowledge and great skill,
Thou shalt obtain the brute,
And men to thee in general,
For help shall make their suit.
wherefore all honour, laud and praise,
To God ascribed be,
The Father, Son, and holy Ghost,
One God and personnes three.
Perhaps now some man will object and say, that it is not possible always
to observe these rules. For if I dwell far from expert men of whom to ask
council, and peradventure ammatched in the place where I dwell, with some
bragging proud boy, that came lately out of his prentishode: who shall for
lack of knowledge and discretion seek mine infamy and dishonour, and is
therefore not mete to associate my self with, but rather to be avoided.

To this I answer that it behooves a good chirurgien to be ingenious, that in
this case is thy remedy. To be ingenious, is to be apt to devise new remedies
for new diseases, and such as thou haste not before seen nor heard of. In
such a case in deed it behooves thee to be very politic, and that
allmightye God may the better prosper all thy works and devises. Serve God
faithfully in hearty contemplacions day and night, desiring God for Jesus
Christ's sake his dere son our sauyoure, to enspire thee with such grace,
that thou maiste to his honour and glory, end all such enterprises as thou
take upon thee to do: (Of which prayer I will hereafter write an example,)
for if God be on thy side, fear not who so ever be against thee. And that thou
may the better know what thou dost, that wilt be a chirurgien, and what
thou take upon thee to profess: know out of good and learned authors,
what Chirurgerye is. And so shalt thou be the better able wisely to work
alone, where the needful society of counsel doth want.

Surgery therefore (as Angelus Bolognius in the prologe to his book of the
cure of external ulcers says) is ye most ancient, ye the most sure and
excellent part of the art of medicine, which works by handy operation.
For the name thereof which was given thereto by most auncyent authors,
signifies nothing elsse: For Surgery is Operatio Manualis that is handye
work. Wherefore sith it is a part of Phisike, we can not so rightly name it
in English, as to call it the handye work of medicine. And farthermore the
art of medicine or Physic (wherein Surgery is comprehended) is an art,
and so it ought to be named, and not a science. And chirurgerye is not an art
properlye of it self without Phisike, or separated from the same, as some do
think: neither can Phisike be an whole and perfect art without Surgery,
as some would imagine. For since they are both parts one of an other, how can
they be divided or seperate without detriment to them both? For it is not a
whole body, that lacks one of his chief members or parts. For nether can
Chirurgerye be perfectly learned without theorike, nor Phisike without
Practise. And whereas Theorike and practise go not together, whether ye call it
Phisike or Surgery, I dare boldly affirm, that there is in them no manner
of perfection worthy commendation. Yet some there be that think that only to
Phisike belongs Theorike or Speculation, and that to Surgery belongs
only practise: but howe far their judgements differ from truth let every
wise man judge. What knowledge is there in Phisike, that is not requisyte in
Chirurgerye? whether it be Gramer, Philosophy, Astronomye, Anatomye, or any
other? ye the very judicial of urine, and the pulse: as good Doctor Record our
worthy country man witnesses. wherefore I affirm, according to the sentence
of most wise authoures, that the knowledge of Chirurgerye consists in.ii.
things: namelye speculation and practise: therefore it is not only a workinge,
but an excellent knowledge and understanding howe to work well and
perfectly. But the effectual acts of Chirurgerye in deed (as Guido says,)
consyste in cuttinge, in knittinge, in bindinge, in purging, purifying, and
exercisynge the handye operation: and all this upon the body of man, to heal
or bring health to the same, as much as is possible. Which addition we put to,
because it never hath ben, is, nor shall be possible for any chirurgien to heal
all that are diseased and sore. Therefore we may thus conclude, that
chirurgerye is an art both workynge and teachinge howe to work upon the
body of man, to heal all such diseases as are possible to be cured.

Now therefore let the good chirurgien (that will avoid wicked crafts and
abuses) first learn, and then work and use experience: wherein thou shalt
understand that the only reading in books is not sufficient, as many a one
at this day, (to the great hurt of much people) thinks. For there is no
science that can without saying the practyse and experience of cunning masters
therein, be learned: and surely in the art of medicine, (chieflye chirurgerye)
practise and experience is the chiefest learning: although with out other
learning (I confess) no man can attain to the perfection that therein is
required. And for this doth learning (in books contained chieflye serve, to
teach men to know the works of learned masters of old time. But assure thy
self (what so ever such masters have written,) thou shalt never perfectly
digest to thine own use, any thing in them: except thou be able to join by
comparison, that which thou haste scene in other men works before thine
eyes, and in the practise of thine own hands, with that which thou find
written in old authors: for little profit, sweetness, or understanding shall
one get of authors, except he see the same also put in practise. Therefore
when thou haste scene proved by cunning masters ye which thou haste red, thou
art truly learned in thine art, and therefore apt to work and use
experience thy self.

And this regard to experience in learning made Socrates say, that learning
ought not to be written in books, but rather in men minds. For this
excellent Philosopher well perceived, that the committing of cunning to
written books, made men to neglect the practise and experience of their
wits, by means whereof they became vncunninge.

Galen also has friendly admonished us, that we ought nor, (if we will be
perfectly cunning) to trust only to doctrine written in books, but rather
our propre eyes: which are to be trusted above all other authors, ye before
Hippocrates and Galen. For without the eyes consent (saith Socrates) the ears
ought not to be trusted: for the ears are subjects and often deceived: but
the eyes are judges both true and certain.

As I would therefore that all Chirurgiens should be learned, so would I have
no man think him self learned, otherwise then chiefly by experience: for
learning in surgery, consists not in speculation only, nor in practise
only, but in speculation well practised by experience. Therefore when we say
that a chirurgien must first be learned and then work: It is not meant that
any man by the reading of a book or books only, may learn how to work: for
truly that has caused so many deseiuinge abusers, as there are at this
day.

Good chirurgien therefore have a regard to these things, even as thou wilt
answer for the same at the dredful day, when the eternal Lord and almighty
master, shall call for account of each man talent: whether they have gained
therewith according to his will, or whether they have abused or vainlye hid the
same.

Furthermore these things considered observed, it is expedient chiefly before
all things yt thou have Gods fear always before thine eyes, that thou
lead a virtuous life, and (as ne'er as God shall give thee grace) vnsported to
the world: doing just virtuous deeds, abhorring abstaining from all
viciousness. Let wicked pride be far from thy hart, and rather with all
humility confess, that thou can do nothing of thy self, (as thou can
not in deed,) but through the grace and merciful favour of God.

Likewise avoid envy and wicked wrath, be neither wrathful nor enuyous,
that an other man of thine Art has better success then thy self: but
rather endeavour thy self in the fear and service of God, to learn to do
better, and to exceed others. For to a diligent and willing mind, there is
nothing to harde no impossible.

Let charitye surmount couetise, so that it have no place in thy heart:
otherwise then it shallbe requisite for thee to live like a man of science with
a decent and honest maintenance of necessaries. Let no slouthe cause thee to
neglect thy cures whereof thou haste take charge, least through thy negligence
they pearishe, and their blood call for vengeance on thee at the hands of God.

In any wise be thou no lechoure, but adorn thy life with honest, chaste, and
sober manners: for that unclean and filthy vice is much to be abhorred in a
Chirurgyen: considering the secretes of many honest folks, that to his
charge and cure must be committed.

Lastlye and above all these, beware of drunkenness, a vice that was never
more used, then it is of many at this time. For when has this vile report
(or rather reproach) gone of so many as it doth at this day, he is a good
chirurgyen in the forenone? O abomination of all other in a chirurgien to be
detested. But how vnmete such are to be chirurgiens, I have touched more at
large in my preface.

Let virtue therefore I say be thy guide: let her be both thy rule and
compass, whereby to frame all thy doings. And consider that chirurgerye is a^
art to heal dyseases, which is a virtuous exercise, ye a gift of Gods
spiryte as says S. Paule: and therefore can never be well used of vicious
personnes, although they have never so much lerninge. For vice and virtue can
never accorde, but always one is expelled by the other, for two contraries can
never agree in one subject.

Consider also howe by virtuous and holy life, and by faithful prayer the
very angles at Gods appointment have descended from heaven, to aid and
help men in the^e need, teachinge them remedies for diverse griefs: as holy
Raphaell was sent to Tobye. And as thou may read in the.xxxviii. chapiter
of Jesus the son of Sirache where he (treating of the Phisitien) says. The
hour may come that the sick may be healed through them when they pray
unto the Lord, that he may recover and get health to live longer. Lo here
may thou see that thy duty is to pray unto God for thy patient, and for
help and grace to heal him. Pray therefore faithfully unto God: serve him
devoutly, call rightly upon his holy name day and night, with an holy
abstinence as scripture teaches, not omyttinge deeds of alms, the fruit of
perfect faith.

Moreover be not ingrate nor unthankful unto God, when he sends good
success to thy business, good luck to thy hands, and grants thee thy
hearts desire. For unthankfulness many times is the cause that our prayers are
not heard. Praise God therefore for his benefits, pray faithfully to him in
all thy streightes of need, and this doing be sure that God will prosper all
thy ways, and give good success to all thy works. Take here therefore an
example of prayer which thou may use I trust to the glory of God.

A prayer necessary to be said of all Chirurgiens.
O Almighty, eternal, impassible, and incomprehensible Lord God: which
haste created all things of nothing, and man out of the slime of the earth,
setting him in paradyse to live ever in felicity: from which he most
disobedientlye fell into this world of infyrmities. Which infirmities yet
nevertheless thou haste (of thy great mercy) so pitied: that for the help
and cura^ion of them, thou haste (by thy special grace) given virtue unto
trees, herbs, roots, beasts, fowls, fishes, worms, stones and metalles.
And in fine hast left nothing, among all that thou haste made without a propre
virtue, for man his vtilitye and help in time of need: and haste also most
graciously given knowledge unto men, for to use and minister thy creatures to
the help of their griefs. Grant unto me most merciful God, that (as I
truly believe and faithfully trust, that all health and virtue comes from
thee,) I may so know and use thy creatures to the help of my christen
brethren and neighbours, in that art that I through thy providence, have
from my youth up been trained and instituted unto: that not only I for the
prosperous success of mine art, but my poor patients also and all other
together, may praise and honour thy holy and blessed name. which lives and
reign one God in Trinitye, and Trinitye in vnitye, world without end. Amen.

Another.
O Lord God everlasting and almighty chirurgien, who only art the Lord that
healest Israell: (yt is thine elect). And hast created medicin out of the earth
(of no wise man to be abhorred) so that bitter water was made sweet by the
virtue of a tree: that men might learn thereby to know that thou haste given
virtue to all things, and hast given wisdom and knowledge unto men fro time
to time, that thou may be honoured in thy wondrous works. For Salomon spake
of all rotes and trees, even from the Cedar that grows in Libanon, unto the
Hisope that springs out of the wall. Ye he spake also of beasts, fowls,
worms, and of fishes. I read also O Lord that by a little meal, the
bitterness of Colocinthis was cured in the potage pot of the prophets
children: And by a plaster of figs king Ezechias was healed of his sickness
sore. I also remember that by ye gaul of a fyshe, the blindness was taken
from old Tobies eyes. Innumerable O Lord are the testimonies of scripture,
beside daily experience: which provokes and stirs me to laud and praise
thy most glorious name. I beseech thee therefore, oh most merciful Lord, that
I may so use, and all my patients so receive thy creatures, that thou so
graciously haste ordained for medicine, that health may be obtained, and thy
name for the same everlastingly honoured. Grant this oh lord, holy and
euerliuyng god, for the merits of thy dere son our only saviour and mercy
seat thy holy wisdom Jesus Christ, in whom is all virtue to cure all things
world without end. Amen.

A prayer to be used of the good Chirurgien before he conclude to take in hand
the curation of any harde and difficult thing, at any mans importunate suit
and request.
O Almighty lord God heavenly father who by thy divine providence forseest
and dispose all things to thy glory and the profit of thy church. Thou
see all things before they come to pass, and things that yet are not are
with thee as though they were: but man thou hast enclosed within metes bounds
of knowing things after they are chanced: so that we only judge of things
present, as for things to come, we can not before hand certenly decern them.
Not withstanding for so much as thou hast mercifully decreed through our lord
Jesus Christ, that all things turn to the best to those thy chosen
children, who rightly love and fear thee: Thy strength supplies our
weakness, thy wisdom our folly, thy knowledge our ignorance: And cause us
nevertheless to feel by faith in our souls, that which our carnal senses
can in no wise taste. My prayer therefore oh merciful lord, is that of thy
gracious goodness and merciful benignity, thou wilt so foresee and provide for
me most unworthy and wretched sinner (yet thy servant through Christ) that I
never take upon me to cure either this or any other thing, unless thy godly will
be, that I may through thy grace so end the same, that not only I may thereby
attain an honest fame, and the party grieved joy, gladness and health: But
chiefly that we both and all other good people (the same considering) may
remember thee with thanks, land, honour, and praise, for thine abundant mercy
grace and virtue to our lives end. Grant this O Lord God eternal and
omnipotent, for the sake of thy everlasting word, thy dere son our only
saviour and mediator, by whom thou workest all in all things: who lives and
reigns with thee and the holy ghost, one God in Trinity, and Tinitie in
unity world without end. Amen.

Now that after my simple skill I have formed prayers mete for Chirurgiens, I
think it mete to show also an example howe to praise God for the good success
of the chirurgiens business, as follows.
O Eternal father, almighty God maker of al things, howe great glorious are
all thy woderous works, thy loving kyndnes and mercies to mankynde exceeding
them all: for thy benefits bestowed on mankynde are infinite and incomparable.
Among which thy creatures and works of thy hands, I most poor unworthy man
and wretched sinner, have endless cause to acknowledge thy grace and mercies.

If oh lord I should once imagine to gratify thy goodness, behold what hath
mortal man to give unto God? or what hath man that is not Gods? neither hast
thou O God any need of man, or ought that man hath. But not withstanding, thy
son our saviour by diuyne providence hath satisfied for us thy will, and
apeased thy wrath, justly bent on us for our manifold sins: And through the
holy ghost thy spirit of truth (who leads us unto all truth) we are
informed, that thou askeste of us from henceforth no more, but a lively
sacrifice of thanks geuyng and praise of thy holy name.

Wherefore not withstading mine unworthiness, through Christ I am boldened
(fully hoping that of thy great mercy thou wilt fatherly accept the same)
most heartily to thank thee with all my heart and soul, for the good success
that thou haste given to the exercise of my hands to bring even wonderful
things to pass. Wherefore O Lord holy and just: all possible thanks, honour,
glory, and praise, be given unto thee. Beseeching thee (for Jesus Christ's sake)
to give me grace that I never forget or put out of mind for any thing while
I live, to remember styll to offer thee this sacrifice, so that I receive not
this thy great graces vnthankefully unto my lives end: and after this life
that I may with the holy patriarchs, prophets, Apostles, Euangelistes,
Martyrs, Confessors, Angels and Archangels, singe with incessant voice before
thy throne, holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabbath for ever and ever. Amen.

Finally, see that ye ascribe al honour unto the holy Trinity, and seek not in
any wise your own praise and vain glory, least ye therein displease GOD and
iustely provoke him to withdraw his grace frome you, whose instruments ye
are, while ye do well, as is the hammer in the hand of the work manne. For
as says the prophet Esaie, Cap. 10. Number gloriabitur securis aduersus eum qui
^asecat? aut serra magnificabitur aduersus eum qui se tractat? Quod perinde
esset ac si uirga sese eleuaret cotra eu qui ipsam fert, et baculus sese
extolleret quasi lignum non esset. That is, Shall the axe boste it self
against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw brag against him that
hadleth it? Which were even like as if the rod did exalt it self against
him that bears it and the staff should extolle it self as though it wear
no wood.

FINIS.
Our misery and frail estate,
In nothing is declared more,
Then in our errors rathe and late.
That chance when least we loke therefore,
Yea and also which yet is more,
we many times put faults in ur,
when from them we our selves think sure,
wherefore since it is destinate,
And none can clearly it withstand,
with love and with most friendly rate,
Before to rede thou take in hand
This work, let all the faults be scande,
And by this rule the same redress,
Lest faults good fruit to much opresse.
