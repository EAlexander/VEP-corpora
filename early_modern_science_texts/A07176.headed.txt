Calves, and how to use Bulls and other cattle to the yoke, and fell. With
diverse approved remedies, to help most diseases among cattle: most necessary
for all, especially for husband men, having the government of any such cattle.

LONDON Printed by Iohn Wolf, 1587.

To the right worshipful Sir Edward Montegue Knight, Leonard Mascall wishes
increase of worship, to the honour of God, and the benefit of the common wealth.
IT is written in histories (Right Worshipful) that the sons of Seth and
Seneca, or some other zealous Philosophers, being desirous to leave some thing
worth memory unto their posterities. Did make two pillars, one of brass, and
another of earth, wherein were graven the principles of the seven sciences, to
the end their successors should understand the good wills of their
predecessors: whereby they did set forth and show all such good knowledge and
learning, as they had found out in their time, to the furtherance of their
common wealth. So likewise now, things necessary for the same, ought not to
be deferd, nor lightly regarded, or forgotten. And whereas the delights of
people are of diverse kinds, the same is perceived by their doings: But as
touching their delights, those ought chiefly to be regarded which profit most
the common wealth. As (among the rest) the government and preservation of
cattle, and such like: wherein (for lack of knowledge) oft times the poor
man loses his beast. Also I have known that the diseased cattle, of
wealthy yeomen, and other poor men sometimes have all perished, whereby the
whole parisheshaue been impoverished thereby: which thing hath been a great
loss unto such towns, and also hindrances unto the common wealth. Marcus
Tullius Cicero, was ever desirous to further his country and common wealth,
and said, that day was evil spent, that he did not therein do good, to his
common wealth: I would it were so now. Even so likewise our predecessors,
Aristotle, Virgill, Plato, and many other in giving us examples therein, have
left immortal fame behind them in writing, through the good zeal and love
they had to their country and common wealth. Which thing likewise (Right
worshipful) hath moved me of long time to gather and put in writing the doings
of diverse and sundry persons, as well strangers as of our own country men, to
show the helps for most diseases in cattle. And for as much as I am informed
your worship is desirous to know and understand of the government of cattle,
and of the fatting of Oxen, to the intent to show the good will I bear to
further therein, I thought good to set forth the practises of many men, how to
help cattle diseased: which thing ought not to be kept secret for the lucar
of a few, but rather I do communicate this my labour to him that hath delight
therein. If any think not well hereof, or despise this my travel, I will
friendly desire them with these words: Quod meliora nosti, candidus imparti si
non, his utter mecum. Which is: If you know any better how to mend it, of
your courtesy impart it, if not, take part of this with me. Thus I leave to
trouble your worship any further, desiring you to bear with this my plain
and rude stile, and to be the defender thereof in print, and in so doing, I
shall think my travel well bestowed, my pains much lightened, and my good will
well recompensed.

To the Reader.
WHen I had gathered and collctted (gentle Reader) certain medicines how for
to help cattle and to govern them. I considered what benefit, and profit it
might be to my country and common wealth, specially unto the husband men, and
such as have the government of Oxen, Horses, Sheep, and such other cattle. For
oft times for want of knowledge, many cattle being sick, do perish and die:
Where as sickness and hurts are accident unto man diverse ways, even so it
chances unto cattle. Whereupon I thought it good to take occasion for the
love of my country and common wealth, to write somewhat, partly of the
government for our most used cattle, as oxen, kine, calves, horses, sheep,
hogs, and such: with diverse approved remedies for them. Plainly and perfectly
set forth, as well to be understood of the unlearned husband man, as of the
learned gentle man: showing somewhat moreover for the bones setting in a beast:
Declaring likewise the order and nature of hogs, with the use of dogs, and the
cause of their madness, with certain helps against the bitten cattle, and
also to help mangy dogs, with diverse approved ways to take moules in any kind
of ground. Which thing ye shall find out in the tables of the same by alphabet
and number, divided into three books. Trusting (gentle Reader) thou wilt take
all in good part, as is meant of the author hereof.

To the Husband man.
THou husband man, that fain would know,
Some remedies to find:
How for to help thy sickly beast,
To satisfy thy mind.
Here may thou learn plenty thereof,
Thou needs not farther go:
But therein search, and thou shalt find
Such helps to help their woe.
And when thou would fain cattle keep,
For to maintain thy stock:
Thou must then learn as well the helps
As to increase the flock.
For if thou seek first the beast,
And know not how to use him:
When he fal'th sick, always thou art,
In danger for to loose him.
For want of knowledge and good skill,
Oft times it may so fall:
A man that is full rich in beasts,
He may soon loose them all.
Therefore in this I council thee,
Seek first to help disease:
As great a praife to him that saves,
As he that can increase.

What knowledge a man ought to have that uses to buy and sell oxen.
I May not easily, nor will say all that a man ought to follow or to avoid
in buying of Oxen. But ye shall this understand, oxen are according to the
region and country where they are bred, for as there is diversity of grounds
and countries, so likewise there is diversities of bodies, and diversities of
natural courage. And likewise diversity in hair and horne of them. For those
Oxen in Asia, be of one sort, and those in France of another sort: so likewise
here in Englande of another sort. And yet not so many diversities of
Provinces, but as many diversities in the beasts, as in Italie, in Capam,
there they have white Oxen, and small of body, yet very good to labour in the
plough and till the ground. Also in the Duchy of Vrben there are great oxen
both white and red, mighty of body and of a great courage. In Tuscane and about
Rome, the oxen are well set and thick and strong made to labour. Likewise in
the Alps, and hills of Burgony they be strong and can; well endure all
labour, fair like wise withal. But never the less although they do thus
differ so in diverse parts, yet the buyer shall mark and understand here in
certain general rules of oxen, the which Mago of Carthage hath given us, and
saith, he that Buying oxen and his properties.
will buy oxen must buy young oxen, well quartered, having large and big
members, with long horns somewhat black, strong and big, his foorehead
broad, and his brows wrinkled: his ears rough within, and hayrie like
velvet, his eyes great and large, his monzell black, his nostrilles croofted,
wrythen and very open and wide, the chin of his neck long, thick, and
fleshie, the dewlappe or skin that hangs under his throat, to be great in
hanging almost down to his knees, his breast round and big, his shoulders
large and deep. His belly big compass in falling deep, his ribs to be
wide and open, his rains large, his back straight and flat, with a little
bending toward the rump, his thighs round, his legs straight and well
trust, rather somewhat short than long: his knees full and round trust, his
hooves or claws on his feet to be large and broad under foot, his tail
long, and well hayred, and to be brief, his body to be thick short, his
colour to be red or black is best, also to be gentle and ease to handle and
touch, to lead or to occupy. These are the chiefest properties (if a man would
buy,) to know a good ox by, and here shall follow the best way how for to
tame them.

The manner and way best for a man to tame his oxen.
FIrst to use it best is this, ye shall use to handle your Oxen, and touch
them when they are young bullocks and calves, and also use to tie them and to
binds them to the stall, so that hereafter it shall not be painful unto you to
tame them, nor yet so dangerous to bruise them as when they wax old, and yet
I would not have them to be tamed, not before three years, nor after five
years: for the one is too weak and tender, and the other is too hard and
strong, to tame those which shall be taken wild and fierce: for ye shall then
soon hurt them. Therefore in housing them first, ye shall make your doors
large for them to go in and out, and make a right coming in to the house, for
crushing one another. And also let your stals be bourded under their feet, and
likewise before them, and let the cross beam over their heads be of seven
foot high, to tie up their heads if need be. Ye shall also fasten them first
thereunto, and within a while after, ye shall use to handle them by the head
and horns: and use to water them in the stall, for by coming abroad, they
will seek to break away will not yield so soon to the keeper. Some do yoke
them together (...) two days abroad: ye shall likewise take good heed that one
ox touch not another with their horns, so within two or three days that ye
see them wax more tame, towards the Evening ye may prove to lead them forth
and to walk them half a mile space or more, and so return again. But first
ye must see to tie them so straight, that they may not well move their heads,
then approthe gently, and go before them, not behind them, nor on their sides,
and speak to them fair, and so accustom them to see and behold the keeper,
then rub their heads, touche their nostrilles and mouzelles: so that they
may know and feel the sent of the keeper, and thus ye may use them all. Ye
shall also wash and sprinckle them with wine to make them more tame and
familiar with you, and then put your hand under their bellies, and betwixt
their thighs: to the end that when ye do touche them there, they fly not
away Flies. worms and tykes, to take away.
or strike. And use them thus, that ye may at any time take from them flies,
worms, or tykes. Then use to be more near their sides, but not behind for
fear a blow with their feet. and then use to open their jaws and take forth
their tongue, and rub the pallet of his mouth with salt, and use once or
twice a year to give them a drink, myxte with one pound of salt grease
melted, with three pintes of ale or wine, and by training and using them this,
ye may soon make them tame, so that ye may soon after use them to the yoke,
in coupling them with some other gentle ox, and so use to tie them to some
tree, or other thing, and then ye may use them to the plough. But first use
them to some light earth, for the other may soon tyre, and so dull them,
because their necks being yet but soft and tender, may soon be bruised and
gaulded with the bow and yoke, if the earth be very hard, and they as then
are but tender rude. And above all take heed in taming a Bull, that he Taming
a bull.
hurt you not with his horns or feet. For if ye do not use him orderly at
the first, ye shall hardly tame him after: but he will have one ill touch or
other, and likewise an old ox, is more harder to tame and doubtfuller than
the young ox. For I have proved (saith he) and had experience thereof at my
house. and to frame a young ox to the plough or carte, ye shall match him
best with an old ox that is tame, very strong and gentle, which To yoke a
young ox.
will hold the young ox back if he be too hasty, or pluck him forward, if
he be too slow, or if ye will ye may make a yoke for three oxen, and put the
young ox in the midst, and by that means ye shall make the most hardiest ox
to be tame, and refuse no labour at the length. For the young ox (being never
so stubborn) in remaining between the two old oxen, they will if he be too
flacke, constrain him to draw, or if he would shoot forward, they will
hold him back and stay him, or if he would draw back, they will hold him
forward. Also if he would lye down, the other will hold him up. Thus by
policy he may be let of his stubborn frowardness. Also yoke him to wild
bullocks that have not laboured before, and so let them gee yoked lose
together for two or three days, and so they will wax tame. And a little
chastening after willmake him endure to labour well, and some young oxen after
they be made tame and gentle, they will wax weary and lie down in the furrow,
and when any do so, he ought not suddenly to be corrected and raised again by
violence, but by some gentle VVeary oxen.
means after a little rest, for be may lie down by some other occasion, as
sickness or faintness either want of meat and water, which will trouble him
more than blows. Wheanie lie so down by slothfulnesse, ye shall bind fast
his feet that he cannot rise to feed, and let him so lie, and so he shall be
constrained through hunger and thirst to leave his weary slothfulnesse, which
do seldom hap. Also ye shall not yoke together two beasts of unequal
strength and stature, ^oking unequal.
for the weaker shall still have the worse. Again, those beasts are best to
labour that pass on the way without fear of shadows, dogs, waters, or any
other thing they see or hear, and those beasts also that eat much, and slow
in chewing: for they digest better, and do keep their force virtue without
waxing lean or feeble, more than those which are hasty feeders. Also this is
counted a great fault in some keepers of oxen, which will have his ox rather
fat than lean: wherefore to labour, the body of a travailing ox or other
ought to be in a mean or good state, rather than fat, having his muskels or
nerfes strongly made, not charged with fat: which will but grieve them to
labour when they are so. Thus I will leave off their government and speak
hereafter of diseases, as if an ox have water in Water in the belly.
his belly, ye shall give him the juice of hemp leaves, mixed with water to
drink, or the leaves of Elder stamped with ale or beer do purge by seege, or
the root sod in old wine or ale, and given, is good to void water out of
the maw and belly.

The remedies for certain diseases in oxen, kine, and other ca^tell,

meat, and know not howe to belie and keep them in health and strength
Therefore, our ancients did use, to give them quarterly of Lupin peason, with
the seeds of Cypres, by even portion, beaten together, and then steeped all
one night in water, and set in the open air, which did use them so, to keep
them safe from sickness. Also oft times cattle will have a sickness which
will make them desire to vomit, and caught with poverty, the which ye shall
help by Vomit to help.
throwing into his throat fasting, a raw hen egg shell all whole. Then on
the morrow, take bruised Ramsons with the stalks and mix it with wine or ale,
and give it: or of common garlic put into his ears. This is not one thing
alone to help them, but there is diverse others: as to mix salt with their
meat. And some do give them of mugwoort with oil or wine to drink. Others
do give them the roots of leekes beaten with wine, or the seeds of fur
tree, or frankincense tree, and also the seeds of sauin, or few, to make them
drink it with wine or ale: and some do give them the herb called in English,
white Colleuer, in Latin Drostis, mixed with bitter fitches. So^ do give them
a little of a serpents skin beaten with wine. They do use also to beat
wild time, or savoury in sweet wine, and so gives it, which is counted very
good for them. Likewise the sea Onion called Squilla in Latin, to be cut small
and soaked in water, and given to swallow it. All these or every of them when
they are ministered, ought to be given and ministered three days together, a
pint or more at once to a beast, which will purge their belly, and take away the
diseases, and also doth renew them unto strength and health again. And among
all medicines the lees of olives to be given, is a singular good medicine, mixed
with as much water as lees. Wherefore, it shall not be ill to accustom your
cattle thus, ye shall first sprinckle therewith gently their meat, and then
put a little thereof into their water, and at length ye may mix in their
water a more portion thereof: and so give it unto them, and likewise among
their meat, so thus ye may use to keep the continually in health as they did
use them in time past.

The causes of pestilence in Cattle.
THe causes of pestilence, one thing is, the chafing of cattle: wherefore ye
must not chafe your cattle much in labour, specially in the summer, for that
doth besides, bring unto them the flux of the belly, or else an ague. Also ye
shall neither let hogs, or hens to enter into their stawles, for their doung
being mixed with your cattelles meat, will breed a pestilence at length, and kill
them. And specially the doug of hogs doth breed a murren among cattle (the
sooner) in eating thereof: if remedy be not soon had, they will grow to a
murren, and die thereof. The remedies are these, ye must by and by change
their laier, and to divide them into many parts: and far of from thence.
And also to separate the whole from the sick, for one beast infected will
poison all the rest in short time. Now when ye have changed them into other
parts, ye must put them where no other beasts do feed with them, to the end
they do not infect others therein, and to overcome this pestilent evil, is
Medicine against the pestilence.
to give them medicines therefore, thus ye must use them: Ye shall take of
wild carret called in Latin Daucus, or wild Parsenepe, or of groundstll, or
of Angelica roots, or the root of the sea holly named Eringion, in Latin,
with fennel seed, and sprinckle it with sod wine, and fine wheaten meal,
with hot water, mix them so together, and give your sick cattle drink
thereof: then soon after ye shall make a drink of Cacia, mirre, and
Franckincense, in like portion, mixed with as much blood of the sea Tortu, if ye
can, then put all together in a quart of old wine, and then squirt it into
their nostrilles. Ye must minister this medicine three days together, every
day a third part.

We have (saith he,) found also a meet short medicine and a good, which is,
the root called in Latin Consiligo, in French Pomele, or Patedelion, in
English I take it to be black Elleborie, which is very good for al cattle
Which root ought to be taken after this manner. Ye must di^e him out of the
earth with your left hand, before the sun do rise, for as they say, he is so
taken, and thereby he hath the more virtue: which ye must use in this sort.
First, ye must bore thorough a circle of holes, with an awl or a bodkin of
brass, or latin in the flap or broadest part of the beasts ear. But first
chip away the hair on both sides thereof: and then bore your holes, so done,
then when ye see the blood issue forth like a round circle, ye shall then put
into the said holes of the foresaid root, cut in small pieces. And when it
is within the flesh holes, that beast shall incontinently recover and were
fresh and lusty again, and shall not fall into the danger of the said
venomous disease. For the root will draw forth al the venom at the said
holes in his ear. Whereby that part of the care will rot and fall away, and
by the loss thereof, the beast shall escape and be saved. Cornelius Celsus,
his counsel is this, ye shall put into their nostrils, of Mistleto leaves
stamped with wine, but this must be done, ass^ as your beasts begin to ware
ficke, and then to use every beast that is infected as is aforesaid.

For a beast that doth not like nor well digest his meat.
when a beast doth not digest his meat, the signs is of rawnesse in the
stomach, and want of digestion is when he belches often, and his guts makes
a crowling, his (...) will be charged with drops, his nerfes and sinews will be
hard and stiff, which cause is: he do not use to rub nor (...) himself.
The remedies are these, ye shall take 9. pintes of warm water; and 30.
colewoort leaves a little boiled, and mixed with some vinegre, so make him to
swallow it down, and all day after ye shall let him eat nothing but that.
Some do lie him in the stal, lays meat before him, so that he cannot eat
thereof, then they take 4. pound of the tops of lentils, and the tops of
wild olives, and beats them together with a pound of honey, and put thereto 4.
pintes of water, and then sets it a night in the open air, and on the
morrow give it him, and within an hour after they give him of wild tares, or
fetches soked in water, but no drink: and this ye must do three days
together, till all the cause be taken away. Then if this do not help his
digestion or crowling of his guts and belly, which thing doth trouble him so,
that he cannot eat his meat, and it makes him to weep and to complain and
morn: then let him not rest long in a place, and also if he lie on the earth,
ye shall re^ his head often where his tail was. Also this is a manifest remedy
for them: ye shall bind hard the upper part of his tail next his bulcke, so
done, ye shall give him then a pint and a half of wine, mixed with a quarter of
a pint of oil olive, and make him to swallow it; and then lead him apace, the
space of a mile a half. Then if the disease go not away; ye shall then anoint
your hands with grease, butter, or oil olive, and draw forth his doung at
his fundament, and make him like wise to run a good space after, if this
profit not, ye shall take wild figs dried, and all to bruise them, then
mix them with nine times so much warm water, and so give it unto him. If
this yet help not, ye shall then take two pound of the leaves of myrtes,
then stamp them and mix them with three pintes of warm water, and so give it
with a horne, but first let him blood under the tail, chase him well before ye
let him blood to bleed the better: and when he hath bled sufficiently, then
stop it in binding it about with the bark of some tree, for closeness. Also
they use this remedy among the rest, that is, to give unto the beast three
ounces of beaten garlic, in a pint of wine or more, and then to drive and
make him to run a good while after. Another, they use also to beat two
ounces of salt with ten onions, and then puts thereto a little melted honey,
and so puts it into the tewel or arsegut of the beast: and after they chase him
awhile and make him to run. Al these aforesaid have been assayed against
lack of digestion.

Against the crowling (called of some) the crying of the guts, and fretting
thereof in cattle.
AS concerning the crowling and crying of the guts pain thereof in cattle,
which are oft times troubled therewith, which grief is appeased and helped by
this means, as when the beast shall suddenly see any thing swim, specially a
drake on the water, shall suddenly be healed thereof, and also the drake in
sudden beholding the beast, the said beast shall be healed thereof. Likewise,
if any drake behold the horse, the said horse shall be suddenly whole thereby.
And yet as some times they can find no medicine that can help. Also the
signs of the trenches, with fretting of the guts are these, The flux of the
belly, with great abundance of fleam: the remedies are: take five Cypress
Trenches,
apples, with so many gall nuts, with old wheat the weight of both the
other two, then beat them well altogether, and put it into three pintes of
red wine, and give the beast by even portions thereof four mornings, ye
shall not forget to put there unto (if ye can) of lentile peas, of mirtes,
and the croppes of wild olive tre^s. All these have been said to help the
frenches and fretting of the guts. The flux of the belly doth increase by
little and Flux of the ^elli^.
little, and so at length goes through the whole body of the beast: which will
sore diminish his strength, and cause him to labour very ^owe and faintly.
When this shall happen, ye must keep your ox or other beast three days from
drink and the first day to give him nothing to eat. Then after give him the
croppes of wild olives, or of Reed, or such like, or the seeds of lentile
peas, or mirtes, but ge^e him as little water as ye ^an: For the flux of the
bellies sometimes continues unto blood, and then it weakens a beast very
much, and he will thereof die if there be not som^ remedy found. Wh^rfore the
best is (as aforesaid) to giu^ him no drink for the space of four ^r five
days, but to giu^ him the br^ised kirnelle^ of raysons, steeped all one night
in red wine, or to give him of gall nu^es, and of Cypress, mixed and beaten
together in red wine, and so given in a morning. Likewise also against the
payne o^ the guts and flux thereof, some do take the shuts and tops of
the tether bay tree, and steepes it wi^h so much Sothernwood all a night in
three pin^es of warm water, and so gives it to the beast fasting. Another:
also other do take and bruise a quantity of the dried kirnelles of grapes, and
gives it mixed with three pintes of red wine, and to let him drink no other
thing, but (as aforesaid) ^he tops of baize, and sothern wood steeped in warm
water, so long as the said ^uxe do continue, or as ye shall see cause.

If the flux do not soon cease, or the pain of the gut^ and belly. ye shall
give him but little meat for the space of three or four days. For his head
being then charged with a waterish humour, he shall (by eating little) avoid
more easier the water out by his e^es, and at his nose, then otherwise he
should do, and for an extreme and speedy remedy thereof, ye must burn him in
the midst of his forehead, with a hot iron unto the bone: and also flitte or
race his ears, after rub the place twice a day with some ox peace warmed on
the fire, and use this medicine until he be whole, and also ye shall anoint
the burnt place in his forehead, with tar oil olive mixed together, which
thing is counted a very good and perfect remedy*

If your beast have the flux of blood, some do use to take Flux of blood.
a quantite of new hogs doung, with a handful of the moss that grows
about the foot of an Ash tree, and chops it very small, with the hogs doung,
and then they mix it with a quart of good strong ale, or beer, and so gives
it the beast in the morning with a horne. Another, some takes a quick loche
fish and puts it in his throat and makes him to swallow it. Another: take also
of the herb called bloodwoorte, with the herb called shepherds purse of each
a had^ul: and then ^hoppe them together small, and so mix them with a quart of
the milk of one coloured Cow, and stirr^ them well together, with some leaven
of browne bread, then (...) you strain it with the runnet of milk, so giu^ it
to the beast milk warm first and last 8. or 9. days together: Another, Take
three ounces of Facioli, called in Latin Smilax, in English kidney bean or
long bean, take those which are red, with 6. drag^es of Pepper, with a
quantity of the seed of broom made in fine powder, and so give him thereof,
twice or thrice a day: in putting three ounces of the said powder in two
quarts of milk. Another, some do make the beast to swallow a live frog, in
cutting of one of his legs, and so puts it down his throat. Another, some
other do take of new hogs doung, mixed with a quart of strong ale or beer,
and so gives thereof to the beast, morning, at noone, and at night, the space
of three days together: often proved. Another, some takes 5. or 6. small
thin slices the leanest of martlemas beef, and let them be laid awhile to
soak in a quart of strong ale or beer, and put thereto one handful of hogs
deung newly made, then stir it all well together, and so make the beast t^
drink it evening and morning the space of two or 3. days, and keep him still
in the house: use this and it will help him often proved. Another: take a good
handful or more of kno^gresse, chop it small, then bruise it a little, and
mix it with a pint or more of good ale or beer. And i^ ye can get the shell
stone w^ic^ is found on tylde lands, (and is much like unto the scallop shell,)
which ye shall burn in the fire, then make fine powder thereof: then put some
of that powder unto your foresaid drink, and so give it your beast, which have
bin proved a good remedy. Another: make a posset of the milk of one coloured
cow, and give it unto your sick beast luke warm. Another, take a quantity of
the fine powder of Bolearmeniacke, and mix it with ale or beer and give it
your beast with a horne. Another: take a quantity of the powder of the roots
of gallingale, finely beaten, and the mix it with a pint or more of good ale
or beer, and so give it: another, also the roots of the wild^ mallowes boiled
in wine, or strong beer, and given to the beast, is good to stop the flux
of blood, and so are all those before mentioned, good against the bloody flux
in cattle, being ministered in fit and convenient time, will take the more effect
to stop the said disease.

Against superfluous flesh growing on the tongue of some cattle, which is
called of some persons, the barbes.
SUch superfluous flesh on the tongue of cattle will hinder the beast
oftentimes in eating his meat, being called of some husbands, the barbes, or
teates, which doth grow long like teates nigh the root of his tongue.
Wherefore they do cast him, and take forth his tongue and clip them away
with a pair of shears, or cut them with a sharpe knife, and some do burn
them with a hot iron: which way is counted more painful to the beast. Then
they rub it with salt and garlic beaten together, till all the ^egme be
clean gone, then they wash all his mouth, with s^lt and wine, or salt and
vinegre, and within an hour after, ye may give him some grass, or green
herbs, or the tender leaves of trees, so long till they be all whole.

Also if a beast have the barbes, which (as some do say) will grow and hang
like flethe pimples under his tongue, which must be clipped off, and then rubbed
and chafed with garlic and salt beaten together, as aforesaid: and wash and
rub his mouth gently with soft linen dipped in warm wine, and bathe well
these sores under his tongu^ and then use him as aforesaid, and he shall do
well.

If ye beast have neither barbes nor yet flux, do not eat his meat well, it
shall be then good to beat garlic with Sallet oil, and squirt thereof a
mornings into his nostrils, if ye mix therewith the juice of an onion, it shall
make him the more desirous to eat.

Against pissing of blood or bloody flux.
IF this disease be newly begun of your beast, ye shall take but a frog, and
cut off his left leg, and so put him alive into the beasts mouth: but then
ye must have ready a handful of salt mixed with a pint of good stale ale, and
so soon as ye can after the frog, give the beast the drink, and make him to
swallow al down together, for this is counted very good, and also well
approved. But if your beast have continued long, then shall y^ take of sharpe
Tanners owze, with the powder made of old martlemas Beef, mixed and well
stirred altogether, then given to the beast: this is also good well proved, and
the juice of madder given with honied water is called good.

If your cattle have dropping nostrilles.
IF the nostrilles of your beasts do drop, or water run forth thereat, ye
shall rub his throat with salt sau^rie mixed together, and also his jaws, to
rub and chafe the said parts with brine and garlic mixed together, or to
squirt into his nostrils the juice of pimpernel, mixed with a little white wine,
and this is good both for the dropping nostrils, and the watery eyes of cattle.

For an Ox or a Cow that swells thorough the abundance of blood.
IF any Ox or Cow do sometimes swell thorough abundance of blood, whereby it
will swell in their tongue that it will stop their wind, and soon perish
thereof, if there be not remedy with speed. The remedy is, ye shall first
chafe him a little, up and down, then cast him and take forth his tongue, and
prick with an awl thorough the great middle vain thereof under, and there at
let him bleed well, and he shall amend soon again: but look then that the
sign be not in the head, for then it is ill to stop. And sometimes a beasts
tongue will swell so big, that he can hardly take his breath, ye shall see him
lyll hold out his tongue, then if there be not speedy remedy he dies: which
remedy is, ye must prick the vain under his tongue as is before mentioned and
he shall do well

Against the venomed tongue of a beast, and also his body.
THe tongue of an ox or bullock sometimes shall be swollen and venomed by
eating of some venomous grass, or such like, and then he will commonly gape,
eat no meat, but stand holding down his head and morn. The remedy is, ye
shall bruise a white onion, and mix it with a little good vinegre, then give it
him and make him to swallow it down: But first rub his mouth and tongue
with all well, and then give it him. So done, ye shall pashe a whole egg into
his mouth shell and all, and make him so to swallow it down, and then he will
recover and do well again.

Sometimes a beast will be swollen all his body, by eating some evil thing and
venomous among their grass, as the ^eld spider, frogs, snails, eftes, or
cold herbs, as poppy, dwale, hemlock, and such which will make them swell.
The remedies are. Take of the juice of plantaine, with the juice of wild
carrets by even portion, and give the beast thereof, with a little vinegar. Also
the juice of inugwort mixed with ale or beer, and give it. Likewise, the juice
of cleuers, or goose grease, stamped and straind, and given, is a special remedy
against venom of the field spider, and others also. Again, the garden tanzy,
stamped and straind, and given with wine. Also the seed of the great Cowthistle
dried and made into powder, and given with wine: or the root thereof boiled in
wine and given. Likewise the leaves of annisestedes boild in water and given.
Again, the seed of rocket beaten and given wish ale: or a handful of betony
leaves, stamped and straind with ale and beer, and given. Likewise doth
garlic, being stamped together with Ale or Dear, and given with ale. Any of
these are good alone to be given to a beast, when he is swollen, by eating of
any venomous thing. And if ye do take of some herbs 2. parts together, it will
then be the stronger and take more effect: but my counsel is, use them with
discretion even as ye shall see cause.

Against the swelling in a beast by eating of a Tyne worm.
IF any Ox or other beast, have eaten any tineworme, which is a small red
worm, round and full of legs, much like a hog louse. Which worm in Summer
will be creeping among the grass. If any beast have eaten such, it will poison
him, and he will suddenly swell thereof, so that within four twenty hours (if
he be not remedied) he will die thereof. One remedy is, ye shall take a quantity
of stale, put there in a quantity of falfe, ^e them well together and so give
it him and so soon as ye can chafe him after till he do stowar for when they
do stowar, they lightly shall do well. Another. Take a good handful of herb
Robart, (which smells like a fox:) Chop it small and bruise it well, and then
mix it with good ale, or beer, and so give it your beast. Another, Take of
the earth of Ant hills, and mix it with vinegar, and so give it to your beast.
Those are all good against the foresaid venom of the tine worm.

Against Costiuenes in cattle.
THere is also another kind of swelling in oxen and kine, both through
costinenes which is, when they are so hard bound in their bodies through heate,
that they cannot dung, which will cause them to swell. The remedy is to chafe
and drive him well up and down a good space, if then he do not dung, ye must
then anoint your hand with oil or grease, then rake him and take forth his
dung. Some do give him of the ^ in drink, and so doth well. Yet others do but
rake him, and he doth well also.

Against the worm in a beasts tail.
THere will breed in the tail of cattle a certain worm, like to a eating
canker, which will breed in the end of his tail, which will cause the beast
to become lean and of il liking. Which place ye shall feel to be somewhat
soft, and a little above that place on the inside of his tail, ye shall slit
the skin (with a sharpe knife) two inches long downright: so done, then take
a quantity of ^uised garlic, and safe mixed together, and then hind it fast
to that place, and let it so remain till it do fall away of it self, and so
the beast shall recover and be well again.

For an Ox or Cow having the fever.
OXen and kine both will sometime have the Fever or Ague, which is gotten by
some cold or other sickness. The signs are, when his eyes wax hollow, and
are dropping, his head lumpish and heavy, his mouth foaming and lathering,
and drawing long his breath with payne, and sometimes he will sigh. So when yet
shall see such tokens, ye may judge it to be the fever. The remedy: ye
shall then keep him a day and a night without meat or drink. Then on the
next morning fasting, ye shall draw a little blood under his tail. Then about
one hour after, ye shall give him thirty small trunchions of Colewoortes,
sod in salet oil, and salt fish water or brine, and make him to swallow
it: thus ye must use him for five mornings together fasting, and ye shall
cast before him the tender branches of lentile peas, or the tender croppes of
the Olive trees or such, or else the tender buds of the Vine: and ye must
rub or cleanse his lips, and thrice a day ye must give him cold water
for to drink, and so ye shall keep him in the stal till he be whole and
sound.

Also the fever is gotten of labouring ox, by great travel in hoate times, and
when he hath that, ye shall see him hang down his head, his eyes will inflame
and bounce, and his body will be hot out of al order, which ye shall feel
by touching his skin. Wherefore they use to let him blood on the vain of his
forehead, or on the vain of his ear, and then they give him of green herbs,
as lattice, and such other cold herbs, and they bathe also his body with
white, wine and so they give him cold water to drink, and so he will amend.

Against the Cough in Cattle.
Cattle sometimes will have the cough by taking of cold, or by great travel or
by, eating some evil thing. If the cough in an Ox be newly taken, he may be
well and soon remedied thereof, by a drink made of water mixed with barley
meal. Sometimes they use to give unto the beast, of stitchwoort smally chopped,
with husked beans bruised altogether, and so given. They take also of lentile
peas out of their husks, and then bruise them small, and mix them with three
pyntes of warm water, and give it with a horne. They heal also an old cough
with two pound of Isope steeped in a quart or more of water, with eight pound
of lentyle peas, smally beaten and mixed altogether, and so given to the beast
with a horne. Another: take the juice thereof, with sallet oil, or the small
roots thereof beaten with barley meal, and so given and make him to swallow
it. Another: take the roots of leekes clean washed, and then beaten with pure
wheat, and so given fasting. This doth heal any old cough. Another: take of
wild tares out of their husks, then beat them with as much of husked barley,
and make him for to swallow it. Another: Isope also stamped with ale or beer,
and given is good likewise, and to give him no other drink for the space of
eight days but mugwoort boiled in water and so given. Another: take five
leaves of Asarabacca, and stamp it, and then strain it with wine, or good
ale, and so give it with a horne to the beast. Another, mix the powder of
light woort, (which grows among stones, or on Oaks like a dried turf nigh the
ground) with ale or beer, and give it warm, and it will help. Also take
butter, new ale, stamped garlic, with dragon water, and so give it the beast
warm. Well proved.

Impostumes in beasts to help.
IF any beast be troubled with an impostume or such like sore, the best shall
be to open the place with an iron, and when it is cut, then shall ye crush
forth al the ill humour and matter therein. Then stir and wash it clean
with the warm urine of an Ox. So done, then use such things as doth cleanse
and heal. And take Cherpi, (so called in French) mixed with tar and oil
olive: plaster wise close the sore therewith. If ye cannot within wash the sore
clean, ye shall melt of the tallow of an Ox, or goat, and so power it into
the wound, let it run down al about the bottom thereof. Some sores after they
have applied this medicine, they will gather a fiery heate and a distilling of
humour which will descend unto that place. Therefore to avoid the same, ye shall
wash it with old urine of men, and then to anoint it, with tar and old
grease mixed.

Against the impostumation of boils, they do use to kill them by laying to of
leven, mixed with the sea onion Squilla, Boils.
and some vinegar, and they also do open the sore and wash it with his own
peace made warm: then they tent it with lynt dipped in tar, and in the end,
ye shall heal it with tents dipped in moulten tallow, either of Ox or
goat.

To heal the closhe or founder in the feet of Cattle.
THE closhe or foundering in the feet of cattle, is taken by some cold after
a great heate, or by some vehement travail which have stirred the blood so,
that it goes down to the feet, like the founder of a horse. When this do
happen in cattle, it will sudden visit the hoof of the beast, and ye shall
feel it hot, and payneth the beast so, that he will not suffer you for to
crushe the place. But when the blood rests in the legs above the hoof, ye
shall but chafe him often, and rub him harde to make the blood retire again.
If that profit not, ye must lance his feet gently round on the edge of
his hooves, with small rases not deep. But if the blood be gone down into the
hoof, ye must open then a little (with a sharpe knife) in the midst under
both the claws. Then lay a tent thereto of lynt, mixed with salt, nettles and
vinegar, and make him a buskin of broom if ye can, for that is more wholesome,
and let not his feet come in any water till he be whole, but keep him dry
in the stall.

And look also that the blood do issue when ye do cut him, for if then he
do not bleed, it will grow to some putrefaction, and so to impostumation,
and then it will be long in healing. Therefore ye must open and cleanse it
well, and bind thereto clothes st^eped in vinegar, salt, and oil, and in the
end, take of old grease and Dear suet melted together in like portion, and
heal it therewith. If the blood do fall to the outmost parts of the clees,
ye must then pare the ends thereof to the quick, and so let them bleed. But
see that ye open the clees in the midst of the ends, so that no
impostumation be there, and they will do well.

For sinews stiff and shrinking.
IF an Ox or other beast do closh or halt thorough the stiffness of the
sinews and nerfes, ye shall chafe his legs, knees, and hams, with salt and
oil mixed till they be well. If the sinews be stiff about the knees, ye must
then bathe him with hoate vinegar, or with mistleto sod in running water, or
with millet (which is a grain like tares) and lyne seed, and in al issues, ye
must scarify and race the greened place, and then to put thereon of fresh
butter washed in water and vinegar, and in the end annoynt it with salt butter
mixed with Goats suet.

Also to boyle southernwood in sallet oil, or neats feet oil, and so do
annoynt therewith. Another: the juice of Stiffenesse of sinews.
priuet mixed with oil therewith annoynt. Another: mustard seed boiled in oil,
anoint the sinews therewith. Another: take of barlie meal, sallet oil, rue,
salt, coriader, stap al these together, so plaistred on: will comfort both
sinews, nerfes. Another: take water ye cabbage or colewortts have bin sod
in, to bathe therewith is very good. Another: take lyneseede, and barley meal,
and mix them well together; and then playstred to, is good to mollify and make
soft all hardness of the sinews, nerfes, and iointes. Another: take the roots
of Saturian, stamp them and mix them with sheep milk, and then plaistred,
will supple the sinews prettily. Also horehound beaten with oil and vinegar,
and then plaistred to, doth the like supple the sinews and nerfes. Some do say,
take yarrow and barrow hogs grease, and beat them well together, and then
laid too, will knit sinews together To knit sinews
being cut asonder.

Against the swelling of the knees of cattle.
IF the knees of Ox or Cow or other beast be swollen, ye shall first bath him
in white vinegar. Then take vinegar, lineseed, and millet, and sprinckle it
with honeyed water, so mix them and bind that to his knees: or else take a
sponge kept in water that mistleto is sod in, and lay that unto his knee. If
there be any inflammation of humour, ye shall then lay too leuain, and barley
meal steeped in warm wine, or in honied water boild, to ripe it, and when it
is ripe, ye shall lance it with a razor, and then heal it with lint, salt,
and oil, as before is said. Cornelius Celsus saith, the roots of flowerdeluce,
or the see onion squilla, with salt, or the juice of knotgres put into the
wound, will heal it. Also, all diseases comenly in the body without wound
being new, are healed by rubbings and chafings of the flesh and skin: but if
they be old, ye must then cut or burn, and to heal them in melting butter
or goats suet, and powered thereon.

To heal scabs or galls in cattle.
IF your cattle be scabby, ye shall take of garlic and bruise it, and
therewith rub and chafe all the sores. Also against scabbe or gall: They take
garlic, savoury, brimstone powder, vinegar, and gall nuts beaten, with the
juice of callamint, neppe, or horehound mixed with soot of the chimney, and so
anoint therewith. And if it grow to some vicer or great sore, then to use and
rub the place, with bruised mallowes mixed with white wine, and bind thereof to
the place. Also the great bur leaves beaten with oil and laid too, all
these before mentioned are good.

And for the galling of the neck with the yoke, and if it swell but one side,
ye shall let him blood in the ear of that side: But if he be chaft in the
midst of the neck, then let him blood in both his ears, and lay thereto a
plaster made with the marrow of an ox, mixed with the suet a buck, and then
melt it all together with some oil and tar: and therewith ye shall heal
it: And it will do very well.

Also if an ox be gald and bruised on his neck, a sufficient medicine is this.
Ye shall first draw blood at one of his ears. If not: Take of the hear be
called in latin Auia, in french, Aus oiseauls, beat it with salt, and so lay
it too, aus if it do then aswage the chyne of his neck, look then on which
side he hangs or leans his head, and let him blood on the contrary side
he leans, on the ear. But before ye do this, ye shall beat his ear well
with a twig, and ye shall see it swell and rise on the vain. Then lance the
said vain and let him bleed well thereat: and on the next morning draw some
more blood thereon, and so let him not travail of two days after. On the
third day ye may travail him a little, and so by little and little ye
may use him to his task and former journey.

But if he be of neither side galde, and yet his neck swollen in the midst
thereof. Then ye must let him blood on both his ears: and if ye let him not
blood within two days after the disease have taken his neck, it will so
inflame, that the nerfes and sinews will wax stiff, and then it will grow
to a sore of engendered blood: for which I have found a singular good medicine,
that is, ye shall take tar, and the marow in an Ox bone, with the suet of a
buck, with old oil olive, of each a like portion. Then boyle al together and
so use for to annoynt him when he leaves his yoke. But first ye shall always
wash him with the water where he commonly drinks of, and then let it dire,
and then anoint him with the said medicine. But if all his neck be so
inflamed that he cannot bear his yoke, the next remedy is to let him rest,
and use to wash his neck with cold water, and so rub and chafe it with the
some of silver or litarge. Celsus wills to put on the rest of his neck that
is so inflamed, the before said herb called Auia.

For a beast being hide bound.
THere is a disease in beasts called in Latin Coriago, in English, hide bound,
which doth sore torment and grieve a beast. This grief happens to a
labouring Ox when he hath been sore travailed in labour, or sore travelling in
traueiling in rainy weather, and thereby come to be hide bound through
poverty. Wherefore ye must take heed when they return from labour being sore
chaft of body and short of breath. Some do use therefore to sprinckle them with
wine, do cast a piece of the fat of a beast down his throat: but if he have
this disease already, it shall be good to sees bay leaves in ale, and to bath
him therewith as hot as he can suffer. And suddenly thereupon for to chafe
and rub him with oil, and wine mixed together, and to pluck and draw his
skin on both his sides, and loose it from his ribs: and it is good to be
done in a hot sunny day, that it may dry and sink therein. Another. Some
do put too the lees of olives, wine, and grease, and annoynt therewith, which
medicine they do use, after they have done rubbing, and chafyng the beast.
Also if a beast like not, and his skin do cleave to his bones, ye shall
bathe him all over with wine, and oil olyue, myxt together. Some do take
mallowes boiled in wine, or ale, or wort mixed with oil, and so bath him
therewith. Also, some do sees what grains in ale, and so bath and rub him
therewith once a day for 3. or 4. days together, and to give him the water of
boylde barley.

For the itch in cattle.
TThe itch oft times in cattle may come for lack of good dressing. Also it
may be taken of his fellows, and it may come by ill water and choler in the
veins. If a beast have an itch, ye shall wash and chafe him with his own vrin
made warm, and mixed with old salt butter: or ye shall annoynt him with oil,
rosin, and white wine melted together, Some do wash it with peace, salt, and
the juice of marigoldes, mixed all together. Use this and it will help.

Against the lunges of cattle infected.
IF the lights or lunges of a beast be infected which is a grievous disease: For
thereby he will wax, lean and pine away, and at length he dries so in his
body by a common cough, whereby at the length it will kill him, if he have no
remedy. The remedies are, ye shall pearce one of his ears with a little
bodkin, (as is before said for the murren or pestilence) and being so perst, ye
shall put into the said holes, the burnt root of some hazel tree. Then take a
quantity of the juice of leekes, with so much sallet oil, and mix it with a
pint and half of wine, and give it him fasting, use this 9. mornings together,
and he shall do well. Also if the sickness of the lights be not sore, they do
give him but the juice of leekes mixed with sweet wine, and they put of the
burnt root of hazel into his ear, as before said.

But ye shall understand, if the beast have continued long therewith, he will
then stand much, and eat but little, and therefore he will wax hollow and
thin of body: and some times he will cough 20. times in one hour. Then he is
sore taken and far gone therewith, and very few do recover, if he be not
looked unto. Wherefore the best way is, ye shall divide your cattle asunder,
so many as he hath companied with, and then let them blood a little, as
aforesaid. Also there be many men that can setter them, which is to cut the
dewlappe before on the brisket: and therefore also there is grass, which some
husbands do call setter woort, or fetter grass, which ye shall take and bruise
it a little in a mortar or dish. Then make the dewlap hollow betwixt the skin
and the flesh, and put thereof so much as a hens egg, into the said dewlap,
and then look unto it that it fall not forth again, and he shall amend. This
some have proved and it hath done well.

Also again, some cattle will have their lunges grown to their sides, which is
got (as some husbands say) by some great drought, or lack of water in
convenient times. And when he is thus grieved therewith, ye shall hear him
house, or have (as it were) a hollow cough, and will forsake his meat, and his
hair on his back will stare up right. Then the help is hard to recover, but
to kill him is best. Yet some do give him of the lungwort, which lies all the
year, (save in the spring) in the ground, and they give a handful of the said
roots bruised in ale or beer, four or five mornings together, and no meat
after of two hours space. Others do take a quantity of figs, with a
handful of I^ope, bruised together, then boyle them a little in a quart of ale
or beer, then strains it and gives it cold to the beast 3. or 4. mornings,
and let him not eat the space of two hours after. Also to take a good
handful of pensis, or hearts ease, and stamp it with a quart of ale or beer,
and then strain it and gives it so to the beast 3. or 4. mornings, and then
use him as before is said. All these are counted special good against the said
grief.

Also some husbands say, this disease grows in a beast by surfeiting and sore
chafyng and then suddenly take cold thereon: to show if he be lungrowne, he
will then lather sometimes at his mouth, in holding it commonly open, with a
running water at his mouth and nose. The cure therefore, they cut away a round
piece of skin in the gullet or brisket place, and then with their finger and
a little salt make a hole downward two inches or more, and then fills the
said hole with red garlic stamped, and plaistred thereon with nettles stamped
with salt, or with yarrow and salt mixed with vinegar. Then shall ye give him
this following. Take of fenecreke, or turmericke, of lungwoort herb, stamp
all these together in a mortar, and then mix it with a pint or more of strong
ale, or beer, and so give it. Use this twice or thrice or more as ye shall
see cause, and it will help, if he be not too far gone. Often proved.

Likewise some do put into the foresaid cut place, of lungwoort bruised with
salt a little, and thereof make it like a tent, and then wrappes it all over
with fresh hogs grease, and binds it round with a thread, and then role it in
salt, and so put it down the said hole as far as it will go, and so stich
up the said hole again, and they give him of lungwoort mixed in ale to drink.
And so he shall recover God willing.

Against the biting of a mad Dog.
IF a beast be bitten with any mad dog, ye shall take garlic and bruise it, and
then put it into a thin linen cloth, and then al to rub and chafe the bitten
place therewith, and it will do well. Some do squirt into the holes or wash the
wound with water and salt long mixed before together, which is also a good
remedy. Another: ye shall wash and rub the bitten place, with the waybrode
leaves stamped, and also to give unto the beast the juice thereof mixed with ale
or beer. Another. Take the root of the great bur and bruise that with some
salt, and so lay it to the bitten place, and this will help either man or
beast. Well proved.

Against the pallet of a beasts mouth inflamed.
THere will sometimes both ox and cow have the pallet of their mouth inflamed
so, that he cannot well eat his meat, which beast oft times will give a sigh,
in standing and weighing more on the one side then on the other. The remedy is,
ye must cast him, and then race him in the pallet of his mouth, and make him
there bleed well. Then ye shall give him of red fetches without husks, mixed
with green leaves, or some other green herbs, but give him no dry meat
till he be through whole thereof.

To help the clowse.
THe clowse is a kind of grief which do commonly hap on the neck of
labouring cattle, which doth not so much molest them, as doth the inflammation,
because they do not thereby leave their work. For which thing it shall be
sufficient to put and disolue thereon of lamp oil, and soap mixed together,
and so anoint. This is good. But the best shall be, if ye can to let him rest
till he be whole: and ye must look also that his neck then do not loose his
hair, which is soon lost when they labour in the rain, or else sweat: For
when his neck begins once to pil (then fear the other,) ye shall then rub it
with the powder of old tiles finely made: and before ye do vnyoake, cast of
that powder on their necks, and when it is well dried on, then chafe thereon
all over with the foresaid oil, and so ye shall always keep your oxen in
good order from time to time.

Remedies for the hoof of a beast that is hurt.
IF the hoof of your beast be hurt at any time either with culter or share, or
any part of her clees hurt, ye shall make a salve of pitch, old grease, mixed
with the powder of brimstone, melted al together, and with a hot iron melt of
that on the sore hoof or clet. This medicine is good also, when the beast hath
been hurt either with stubbe or spell of wood, and if there be any little gone
in, it will draw it forth, but if his foot be hurt far within the flesh, by
some sharpe stone or other thing, then ye must open the wound, and then sear
it with some hot iron, and then bathe it three days together morning and
evening with warm vinegar, and wrap it with a buskin of broom if ye can: Also
if the beasts leg be hurt with the share, then ye shall lay too of the
herb called sea lettis, or sea spurge, mixed with salt, called in greek
Tithimalus, for that is good to heal it, and is also good to heal the hurt in
the foot, as well as on the leg: But first ye shall always wash it with
hot peace of men, and then burn ready a faggot of some wood abroad, and
as soon as the flame is out, make the beast tread on the hot embers with his
sore foot: Then annoyut it with tar, and old grease mixed together. It were
good also to wash your beast feet often with cold water when yo vnyoake them,
for that shall keep them from foundering, and then after to anoint and chafe
their pasturns, and betwixt their clees, with old grease, and they shall do
well.

Also if an ox do halt of his foot through taking of some great cold, ye
must then wash it with warm vrin, but if it come through the cause of blood or
an impostume in the foot then ye shall chafe and rub it first well to stir
the blood, and then raze the skin with a sharpe razor, above the clees, and
make it bleed, and wash it with peace and salt, if it will not so heal but
descend into the foot, ye must then open the top of the hoof under, to the
quick: and make the blood there to come forth, then lap his foot as before is
said, or make a buskin that no water or other thing get in to hurt it, till it
be whole.

Likewise, if an Ox be cut or gravelled in the foot, the help is, ye shall
bathe him with warm urine, and then anoint him with tar, and old grease,
melted together, and there is nothing better to use before ye do vnyoke, then
to rub and chafe their feet with old fresh grease.

If the feet of an Ox do open and chappe, so that y^ horne do crack and
cleave, ye shall bath it well first with warm Hoof cho^
vinegar and and salt, and oil mixed altogether. Then lap it well for a day or
more, and put thereon a plaster of old grease, and pitch, melted together.
And so it will heel again and do well, and when his hooves are broken, ye shall
cover and wrap them with linen steeped in vinegar, oil, and salt, for three
days still renew it in laying to the said medicine. Then on the fourth day,
melt pitch and old grease together, and put it thereon with the bark of a
pine apple tree, clean pullished: and when it begins to heal, ye shall
rub it al over with the soot of a chimney, and let it heal. But if ye make
small account thereof, there will woorms engender soon in the sore, and make it
fall to a coldness, if ye wash it not on mornings with cold water: so if this
will not heel it, ye shall then bruise of horehound, leeks, and salt together,
and so lay it there too, and this will soon kill the worms, and when the sore
is well cleansed, ye shall lay thereon a plaster of tow, mixed with pitch, oil,
and old grease, and so anoint it al over with the same, to keep off the fly
away and it will do well.

To help the bruise on the shoulder of a beast.
SOmetimes by long travel a labouring Ox in treading on the hard ground, or by
some crushe against posts or gates, will be lame in their shoulders, and
oftentimes sore bruised: if this happen in any beast, ye shall then let him
blood on the fore legs. If he be hurt in the hinder hippes, ye shall then let
him blood on the hinder legs, and then wash and bathe it with warm vinegar,
salt and oil mixed together, or bathe his shoulder with peace and mallowes
boiled together. If these do not help, then ye shall lance it a little, and
then lay a plaster of pitch thereon and it will heal it.

Against stinging with Adder or Snake.
WHen any beast is stung with Adder or bitten with a snake, it will so ranckle;
that the beast may soon die thereof, if there be not remedy soon had. Against
any biting thereof ye shall bruise the root of the great bur with salt, and
so lay it too, and it will take away the venom. Another better, which is, cake
of the roots of the sharp pointed threeleaued grass, which bears long
sweet leaves and rough, mix the juice thereof with wine, and give it ye
beast, or cast it into his mouth: and beat the leaves with salt and lay it to
the sore, if ye cannot have the green herb bruise the seed with wine and give
it him, or bruise ye stalks roots, and then mix it with meal, and salt, honeyed
water, plaster wise laid thereon. Another: ye shall take v. pound of ye tender
crops of an Ash tree well beaten, and then mixed with three pynts of sallet
oil, in so much wine, the strain it give it to the beast. Also take of the
said Ashtree croppes, beat them with salt, and lay it to the venomed place.
If a beast be stung, ye shall rub the place with the oil of a scorpion,
(which ye shall have at the Apothecaries,) or give him soap mixed with vinegar,
wash the place with bur leaves, sod in water, or green stamped with salt and
laid too.

The stinging of the fieldspider.
IF a beast be stung with the field spider, it will soon cause nflammation, and
grow to an impostume, if there be not speedy remedy. A beast being stung with
y^ field spider, or bitten with antes, al they be but small worms, yet their
venom is great, will put the beast to great danger, therefore some do hold, in
pricking the place with a latin naule, and then mix soap vinegar, chafe the
place therewith. Also some say, if the field spider be taken put in oil olive,
so die therein ^ot, if a beast be stung of him, anoint with ye oil and it
will help, and so like of other venomous worms put in oil,) but if ye have
none thereof, so that the wound show fair and without danger, ye shall but
take of bruised Cumin, mixed with tar, and so anoint therewith: and plaster
it thereon also: and it will take away the danger thereof. But if it do grow
inward to an impostume, then it shall be best to burn it with a hot iron, so
much as is corrupted, and then annoynt it with tar, and oil, and so it
heales. Some laps a live spider in clay earth, and when it is dry, hanges
it about the beasts neck, and by that (they say) it preserves the beast from
being stung therewith. Again, some do stamp of wormwood, or Southernewood
with Vinegar, and clappes it on the venomed place and it helps. Also to take
beaten cammamile, with honey, and lay it too, doth the like. Also take of house
leek, stamp it with ale, and give it to drink, or the water of a Lilly
root, bruised and strained in water vinegar, so given to the beast.

Remedies against diseases of the eyes.
THe eye of a beast is tender is a principal meber, soon may be hurt diverse
ways. The griefs thereof are commonly healed with honey, but when they do inflame
and swell, the they mix of the meal of pure wheat, with honied water lay it
too. Also if an ox have y^ haw in the eye, ye shall heal it with the salt of
the montain, or spanish salt, or Sal armeniacke, Haw in the eye.
or sal Capadoce, any of these beat into a fine powder, and blown (with a
quill three mornings) into his eye. Likewise the powder of the root called in
Greek Silphion, (in English pelliter of Spain,) mix with ten times so much
Salarmeniack, well beat together, then blow thereof into his eye, it destroys
the haw. Also the said root beaten with the oil of masticktree, there with
annoynt y^ eye. Likewise for the haw or sore eye, some makes a round collar of
Sal armeniack, mixed with some honey, lays it round about his eye, and annoynts
thereon al round about with tar resolved with oil olive, for fear of bees
coming to his eye, or to anoint his eye with the juice of Cammamell. Also the
leaves and stalks of Crow foot to be bruised laid to the eye, doth take away
the haw or web, and is good against a lash on the eye.

Again, if a beast be stricken on the eye, ye shall take of the juice of
centory herb, and mixed with a little honey, and Stroke in the eye.
therewith annoynt his eye, and lay it also plaster wise thereon. Do this
against night, for fear of Bees troubling the beast: also if the eye of your
beast chance to be stricken, ye shall take the croomes of wheaten bread, or
other, and then soak it a little in rose water, or vinegar, and so lay it to
his eye, and it will help. But if it swell or inflame, then the best is to
take southernwood, and bruise it with a little vinegar Eyes inflamed.
and lay it too. Also the juice of Pimpernell, is good against all griefs of
the eyes, or to be mixed with other things.

Also against the watering of beasts eyes, as sometimes Watery eyes.
they will run of water. The remedy therefore, they use to lay on the brows
or eye lids, the meal of dried barley, tempered with water, and honey. Also
the feeds of wild parsenepes, or the juice of wild dayfies mixed with honey
and so annoynt: which is also good against any pain of the eyes, then anoint
it all over with tar and oil mixed as aforesaid for fear of bees coming to
the honey, and troubling the beast. And also for the web in the eye, ye shall
take of white salt, and wrap it in a linen cloth, and then rake it under the
embars, and burn it, and then take beat it to a small powder, and with a goose
quil blow thereof into Web in the eye.
his eye, and then hold your hand thereon a while, ye shall see it water, and
thereupon amend. Also the juice of Dragos to annoynt the eye is good against
the web in the eye, and the juice of the wild lattice doth the like. Also, for
a sore eye in a beast, ye shall spurt beer therein, or chew the leaves of
ground Ivy, and drop it in his eye, or the juice thereof in like manner,
mixed with a little powder of Gynger.

If a beast chance to swallow a horseleech worm in his water.
IF any beast, do swallow down a horsleech with his drink, which will molest
and trouble him greatly. For ye said horseleech will commonly stay in his throat
and there suck blood, and so will inflame the place in causing his throatebowle
to swell, whereby he will sore trouble the beast in letting the passage of his
meat, so that he cannot swallow, nor take his wind. If she lie so far
within, that one cannot take her forth with his hand, ye must then put a quill
or some kane into the beasts throat, filled with hoate oil and let it go
down, or squirt oil and so soon as the oil do but touch the worm, she will
fall off. Ye may also get her off by letting the fume of the punaise unto her,
(which is in Italy, a stinking worm like a tycke,) which as soon as she
feels the fume, she will fall off, But if she do hold and stay in the
stomach entrails, then ye must give the beast hoate vinegar which will kill her:
and this will serve as well for other cattle.

For the Dewbolne in cattle.
THe dewbolne in Ox, Cow, or other beast, is swelling in his body as much as
the skin may hold, which swelling is very dangerous to some for bursting,
it is gotten by eating of the trifoly grass in a dewy morning (as some say)
which grass makes him so to swell as though he would burst. The remedy is,
some do chase and drive him softly up and down to make him to doung. If that
do not help, then ye must rake him and take forth his doung. If that will not
serve, then they strike a hole with a knife or bodkin into the hollow part of
his back above his flank, and so thereat lets out the wind by a feather or
quil, and so he will recover again. But beware ye strike him not so deep that
ye pearce his guts. Also to give him rue, or garden tanzey stamped with wine
and ale to drink is very good for ye same, or give him a quart of veriuyce.

This disease comes to a beast that is greedy and is put into a Pastor of
such rank grass in eating so greedily thereof that his sides will swell as
high as his back bone, and sometimes the one side will swell more than the
other, and yet few die thereof, and when a beast is so, he may not be hastily
driven nor laboured till he be swagged, for it is but a substance of wind
within his body. Therefore it is good to drive him softly and suffer him not to
lye, some do strike him as aforesaid so deep till the wind do come forth,
for wind do remain betwixt the body and the great panche, and his bowels.

Wherefore it is evil to put a hungry beast into such pasture after a dew or
rain, for the said grass is then so sweet and windy withal, that it
fills them full of wind, and when they be so swollen, some beast will stand
still, some will lie down, but if ye can raise him, stir him up and down to
make him doung. For if he do once doung, he is past danger for that time, but
if he lie and will not rise, ye shall strike him in with a sharpe knife or
bodkin, three inch deep or more, if that will not serve, thrust him so deep
till ye see the wind come forth. Then some do put a quill into the hole, or
a feather, that the wind may come forth thereat the better, and when ye shall
see him well slaked, ye may then lay a little tar thereon to keep off the
fly, and he shall do well again in a short space.

Against the stinging of hornet, wasp, or breese fly.
IF your ox or Cow be stung with wasp or hornet, ye remedy is, ye shall
temper Ceruse or red lead in water, then rub the stung place therewith, it
is good also to sprinckle the place where the beast do feed, with the
decoction of bay leaves sod in water. Also how to make that the breese fly
shall not annoy and bite cattle when they labour, which is, ye shall rub the
beast with the decoction before mentioned. Also if any be stung or bit therewith,
ye shall rub and wet that place al over with the froth or spittle of ye said
beast, and that will help. Likewise take the juice of mallows and rub or
annoynt the place therewith, and it will help, or to annoynt the beast with
sallet oil, which will make that the fly will not touch the beast, where he is
so anointed.

How to kill lice or tykes on cattle.
IF your oxen or kine, or other cattle be lousy, which comes sometime by
some sickness or surfeit in taking cold after a great wet or rain. Sometimes by
great poverty, whereby so long as they are vexed with lice, so long they will not
prosper. The remedies are, ye shall take the decoction of wild olives mixed with
salt, then rub and chafe the beast all over therewith. Another: take of
quicksiluer killed in oil olive and mixed well together, and therewith annoynt.
Another: take the roots of white ellebory, otherwise called neesing powder, and
mix of that powder with oil, therewith anoint, or boil it with good
vinegar, so wash therewith. Another: take of bearefoote herb, stamp it and
then strayn it with vinegar, then mix therewith the powder of brimstone, and
wash the beast therewith. Another: take garlic and stamp it, and mix it with
peniriall, and then give it to the beast with ale or beer, and let him be
chafed a while after. Another: take the seed of stauesacre, dried and beaten
into a fine powder, then mix it with oil or fresh grease, and annoynt ye
beast therewith. Al these before mentioned are good to kill both lice and tickes,
for so long as your cattle are troubled therewith, they will prosper smally
although ye feed the well, yet a good pastor may do much hereunto, but it will
be long ere they recover. And some do sift ashes on their backs and then rain
kills them.

Against any swelling in Ox or Cow by eating of some venomous herbs.
A Beast by chance sometime will have a swelling in al his body, which may come
by eating of some venomous herb or such like, as of the ground thistle called
in Latin Camaelion, or of hebane, hemlock, or toadstools. If he have eaten any
of these, they will make him so to swell that he will leave his meat. The
remedy is, ye shall chop very small, a good handful of wormwood, and then
stir it with a good quart of ale or beer, and so give it unto the beast, if
once given do small profit, give it him again twice or thrice, some do
stir him the up down a good while after. Others do keep him in the house an
hour or two after, so he hath done well again. Also yough is evil for cattle
to eat.

Against swelling of Cattle by eating of green corn.
IF your cattle do chance thorough negliget keepers to break into your corn and
eat thereof when it is nigh ripe (as in the time of harvest,) of barley, ry,
or wheat, it will make the mightily to swell by lying and sprouting in their
mawes, which thing will put them in dagger of death, if they have not soon
remedy. The help is, some do use to drive them up down till they see them
assuage thereof, and so they recover, and some do throw a new laid egg shell
and al into the beasts mouth, and breaks it in his mouth, makes him to
swallow it with ale. Again, some other do take a handful of the tops of
nettles, beat well then strained with wine, or honeyed water, and so given. Also
to take of Anniseseeds bruised give in wine or strong ale, or to take a handful
of ye leaves of Aron or cuckoespit, mixed with salt vinegar given. In likewise
take of juniper leaves or green berries, stamp strain them with wine, then
give it the beast. All these aforesaid have bin proved good remedies against
such swellings, or take soot, the hard row of a red hearing, beat them and
give the beast in ale or beer.

To help the garget in the throat of a beast.
IF the garget be in the throat of a beast, it will trouble him sore, which is
commonly taken by some great drought for want of water, and it will cause a
swelling under the ioules or the sides thereof. The remedy is, ye shall cast
him, then cut and flee the skin on both sides, so far as any swelling doth
appear. So done, then take of the whitest sifted ashes that ye can, and mix
them with the grounds of stale old peace, and stur them well both together,
then also wash the fleshy sore therewith. Some do boyle it first, and then wash
therewith, both the ways are good. Then ye shall close up the skin again,
and anoint it with tar and oil mixed. Also ye may lay thereon a plaster of
nettles bruised and myxt with salt, and so it will heal it. Or a plaster of
pitch likewise.

To help the garget on the tongue.
THe garget in the tongue of the beast, ox or cow, is a certain swelling
under the root of his tongue, which will cause his head and face to swell, to
froth also at the mouth, he will then forsake his meat in often gulping in his
throat. The remedy is, ye must cast him on some straw for bruising, and then
take forth his tongue, and with the point of a sharp knife, slit along the
middle vain under an inch, right from the root of his tongue, and there will
come forth black blood and water, which comes from the gall: Then ye shall
rub the place with salt and vinegar mixed, and so he will recover and do well
again. Often proved.

To help the blayne of the Tongue.
THe blaine of the tongue which will come to some cattle, is a certain
bladder growing above on the root of his tongue, against the pipe, which
grief at length in swelling will stop his wind, which comes at the first by
some great chasing and heat of the stomach: whereby (as some do judge) it doth
still grow and increase by more heat. For commonly it comes in summer and not
in winter: For when the beast is hot and hath been chaste, then (if there be
any) it will rise, and swell full of wind and water, so when it is full, and
big withal, it will stop the beasts wind, which ye shall perceive by his
gaping and holding forth his tongue, and foaming at his mouth. If then there be
not speedy remedy, he will suddenly fall and dye. The remedy is, to cast him
and take forth his tongue, and slit the bladder or break^ it thereon: then
softly wash it with vinegar, and a little salt. So he shall do well again.

This blaine on the root of the tongue, comes by great chasing, and fast
driving, and for want of water, they take a heat and so rises the blaine:
which cattle will suddenly dye thereof, specially fat cattle, for they will
soonest have the blaine. Some beast will have many under the tongue. Therefore ye
must prick them with an awl, if ye have no other tool, and then chafe them
so with your hand that ye break them all, for the breaking doth help as
aforesaid. Then peace thereon if ye have no other thing, and so he shall do
well. Often proved.

Against the garget coming by any push or other stroke.
whereas the garget breeds in cattle upon some bruise or some push, ye shall
cut a hole where the bruise is, make it hollow to the bottom thereof. Some do
but cut and raise the skin so far as the bruise goes, and then make and
have ready of beaten garlic, and the tops of the sharpe nettles, with some
resty bacon of the outside, beat all well together, then put it into the said
hole: then shall ye bath it twice a day as follows. Take the grounds of ale
or beer, and the soot of a chimney, of white sifted ashes, of black soap if
ye can, mix all these well together, and stur it well over the fire, and make
it warm: Then hath and wash the sore place therewith, use this morning and
evening till it be through whole. Well proved. Another way. Some do cut a hole
on the upper side of the bruise or sore, and then make it hollow: Then they take
of goose grease, and black soap, with a little tar, and then boils them
altogether in a pan, and pores it boiling hot into the hole. Use this once a
day, and this will heal it. Often proved.

Against the garget in the maw.
THe garget in the maw of cattle is an evil thing, which is gotten when they
covet to eat of crabs or acornes lying under the trees: Which thing
sometimes they will swallow some whole without breaking or chewing, which fruit
lies whole in their maw, and will not digest. But in continuance of time they
will sprout and grow in their mawes (as some say) which thing will cause the
beast to swell, and seem as though some thing did stick and trouble his
gullet and throat. And those beasts that have eaten many thereof, and lies in
their mawes vndigested, are like to die thereof, if remedy be not soon found:
the remedy is, ye shall take a good quantity of whole mustard seed, the mix it
with wine, or strong ale and give it to the beast. Another. Chop, then bruise
small a good handful of camamile, then mix it with wine, and give it the
beast. Another. Take a handful of ginniper crops or beries, cut them, and then
al to bruise them small: Then mix it with wine, and give it.

Another. Take peniryall, rocket, garden mint, of each in like quantity, stamp
them together, then put a pint of wine or ale, and let it stand close covered
all night: on the morrow strain it and then give it the beast. Another. Take a
good handful of the the roots and leaves of Auens, wash them, then lay them
to soak all a night in wine, or strong ale, then on the morrow stamp them, and
then strain them, and so give it the beast. All these remedies are found good
to digest, and also for the clensing of the maw.

To help an ox or other beast that have lost their Quide.
IF an ox or other beast by chance do leese his quide, as sometimes a beast
by some occasion his quide will fall from him out of his mouth, and then he will
morn and have no stomach to eat, because the meat which he hath already
eaten will not digest. The remedy is: some do use to take part of the quide
out of another beasts mouth, which is of like nature, as if it be a cow that do
want her quide, to take some of the quide of another cow, and give it her to
swallow down, and by that means she will do well again: and so the like of
other beasts. Also again some do take a handful of the herb called Cudwoort,
which they bruise small, and puts a quantity of fat thereunto, and so convey
it into the beasts mouth to swallow that have lost his quide, and so he will
amend. Again, some other take a piece of leven, and put that into the beasts
mouth, as before said, and so he will thereby recover again. Also when a beast
hath lost his quide clean, ye may give him loom of a wall mixed with peace, and
make him swallow it. Or ye shall take the crum of bread, and mix it with a
little salt, and there withal, to rub and chafe the tongue of the beast: but
if he have so remained long, whereby he is far spent and wasted, then ye
shall take forth his tongue and prick the vain there under with an awl in 2.
or 3. places, and so it will bleed, and thereby he will recover again and do
well. Often proved.

To help calves that have the worms.
Calves will oftimes have worms in their bellies, which will annoy them much, at
length kill them: and when they are so troubled therewith, ye shall see some ru up
down, not to stand or abide long in a place, some will lye down, shake,
quiver, straight way up again about, some will hold their heads oft toward their
sides: and those worms in calves do breed of an il digestiug of their meat.
Wherefore ye must then see often unto them, that they come not into the
foresaid danger: but when any calves have the, to help him thereof, ye shall
take lupin peas half raw, and bruise them, then make them into small pieces,
and cast of those into his throat, and make him to swallow them: so many as ye
shall seem good. Do this a mornings and it will kill the. Another. Take
sothernwood, or wormwood, bruise thereof with dry figs, with fetches, make the
like paste thereof, cast them into his throat. Another. Take one part of old
grease, with 3. parts of Isope, then mix and beat them al well together, and
then give it as the other aforesaid. Another. Take of the juice of horehound,
beaten and stamped with a quantity of leekblades, and so made in pellets and
given. Another. Take of wormeseed, bruise it well, and give it in wine. and so
give the powder of sauin mixed with wine or ale: if those worms be in the maw
of calves, then ye shall give them a little of the oil of Sauin, mixed with a
little new milk, and that will kill them being in the maw of any beast.
Also weaning of calves sometimes will breed worms, when they come to grass
soon after they be weaned. Which thing ye shall perceive when they are
troubled therewith, for they will then tremble and shake, sometimes lie and
sprawl on the ground. The remedy is, ye shall then take a quantity of the soot
of a chimnn, with the like quantity of sower leven, and a little tar, then
stur mix all these together well, in a pint of new milk from the come, and
so give to each calfe a portion thereof. Use this for four mornings together.
A pint of milk will serve four calves at a time. Also some do give them of
tanners owse to drink, and so thereby they recover and do well.

Worms in cattle.
IF your cattle be troubled with worms, ye shall stamp a good handful of
wormewoode, then strain it with ale or beer, and give it to the beast with a
horne. Another. Take a handful of box leaves, cut them, and stamp them, and
give them with ale or wine, or take the powder thereof and mix it with new
milk and so give it. Another. Take of the herb called prickmadam, which
grows on houses or walls) a handful: then beat the leaves and tops thereof,
and so mix it with all or beer, so give it with a horne. Another. Stamp a
good handful of mugwoort, then strain it with ale, give it. Or take a handful
of the red nettle, which carries the red flower, called archangell, stamp and
strain thereof into als or beer and then give it. Another. Take a handful of
wood sage, or wild sage, bruise it, then strain it with ale, so give it.
Another. Take and stamp of garden cress, then strain it with ale so give.
Another. Take and stamp garlic, mix it with milk or ale and so give it. Al
these are special good against worms in cattle.

Against pain in the feet of cattle, called of some husbands, the foul,
SOmetimes cattle will have a disease betwixt their cleases, called y^ foul:
Which grief sometimes will be in y^ fore feet, sometimes on y^ hinder feet.
Which grief will comoly swell make y^ beast to halt. The remedy is; ye must cast
him, and then bind his four feet together. Then take a rope of hair, or some
other hard twisted rope, and draw it up and down betwixt his clease, till ye
make it bleed well. Then take some tar and mix it with some honey, and fresh
grease, and lay to thereof. Then put a buskin, or such like thing on his foot,
to keep it from dirt, and then ye may put him into some clean pasture till
he be whole: or to keep in the house and he will soon be whole, in two or
three days again.

There will breed also (as some husbands say) a like grief and swelling
betwixt the clees of cattle, called the worm, which will grow to a bunch and
so to a ripens, and at length it will break, and it will be in the midst of
his clees, and and so it will make him halt, so much that he cannot well go.
When that ye shall see it swell so big, ye shall then lance it, and so let
forth the corrupt matter. Then anoint it with tar, and fresh grease mixed,
and then keep his foot clean for two or three days, and it shall do well
again.

To help a beast that pisseth blood.
Some do take a loch fish quick and put it down the beasts throat. If that
help not, ye shall take of bloudwoort herb, of shepherds purse, of
knotgrasse, of each a like quantity, stamp them altogether: then strain them
with a quart of the milk of one coloured cow, and put thereto also a little
runnet, made of the said milk, and mix therewith the leven of browne bread,
then strain them all together, and so give it with a horne. Use this morning
and evening eight or nine days, and it will help. Or give him of the powder
of the rinds of pomgarnets, or the powder of the husks of acornes, with red
wine, and it will also help him. Likewise the shell stones (that lye in erable
lands, as a fore said) first burnt, and then beat into fine powder, and put
into the runnet of milk and so sturde well together, and so give the beast.
Use this 3. or 4. days morning and evening and be shall do well.

To help the shewt of blood in cattle.
THe shewt of blood commonly is, to those beasts which have been evil kept,
then to be put to feed in good pasture, those will so feed that they will soon
wax fat, and so increase of blood, that they will cast their blood at their
mouths. The remedy is, when ye shall see any so, ye shall cut of the tops of
both his ears, and then with a small stick ye shall all to beat them, and
that will cause them bleed the more, and thereupon he will amend. Some lets
blood on the neck, which is very good if he can find well the vain. And
some let blood on the vain under the eye. All these are very good against the
said shewt of blood. Also some do take of the herb turmentil, stamped and
straind with ale or beer, and so given, which have been proved also very good
against the same.

The warnell worms in cattle.
SOme cattle will have certain worms sticking within their skin on their
backs, called (of some husbandmen) warnell worms: which worms comes commonly
unto beasts which are poor and lean by great poverty, which worms will stick
as on their backs along on both sides thereof, a foot deep or more, which are
evil for the sale of the skin if it be then taken. Also ye shall perceive them
within y^ skin of the beast, like small knots or knobs, they will show and
appear over the skin like black spots. The remedy is: some do pick them forth
with the point of an awl, yet some husbands do say: as the beast doth grow in
fatness, those warnell worms will wear away, and his skin will be again as
sound as any others.

Also some cattle will have a disease run in diverse parts of their bodies and
legs, called (of some husbands) y^ waribreede. The remedy is this, ye must
cast him and bind his four feet together, with a hoate iron (if the
waribrede be long,) sear them off hard by the body, but if it be but
beginning, and is yet but flat and low, then ye shall but lay the hoate iron
thereon: and sear it but to the skin, then annoynt it with tar and fresh
grease mixed, and so it will heal for ever.

Against the gout in Cattle.
Certain cattle will have (as some husbands say) a grief in their feet
sometimes, which they cal the gout, and commonly it will be on their hinder
feet, which thing will cause the beast to go very stiff behind. For which
grief I could never find any person that could help it, but the best is, for
to bathe his feet in cold water, and then to put him into good pasture and
make him fat and so sell him.

Against looseness of teeth in Cattle.
YE shall understand when the teeth of any beast is loose, so long he cannot
well eat his meat, which sometimes comes thorough the feeble and weakness of
the beast, and sometime by a cold reume, gotten by lying in some cold and wet
place, or by eating of much watery grass. The remedy is, ye shall cast him, and
draw blood on his gummes: and so he will amend, some do rub and anoint his
gums: (after his blood letting,) with strong sack, and so he will amend. Also
some do slit his tail under, nigh his rump, and byndes thereto a little
bruised garlic, and so he will recover and do well again.

Against mylting of a beast.
THe mylting of Ox, Cow, or other beast is called of husbandmen, when he will
sudden lye down if ye shall stay never so little, being at plough or cart.
Which grief is gotten by some blow or sore strype (with god or such like)
on the beasts side: which makes him to faint and fall down. When any shall so
lie down ye shall not raise him up sudden again, but ye shall then turn him,
and lay him on the other side, and so let him rest a while, and so he will
recover again: then if ye can, bruise of the bark of an Ash, and strain it
with ale, and so give him to drink, and he shall do well.

To help any beast that cannot peace.
THey use to give unto an Ox that cannot peace, of warm water mixed with bra,
which is good to make him peace: also take and stamp of sowthistle, and then
heat it with ale or beer, and so give it to y^ beast. Another: take and bruise
a hadful of anniseedes, and then mix it with ale or beer and give it.
Another: take bruise of Carduus benedictus, the strain it with white wine, and
so give it to the beast. Any one of these aforesaid, is good to be given a
beast, when he cannot peace, and to provoke him there unto.

Against the flowing of the gall in cattle.
THe flowing of the gall in Ox or other beast, the chief occasion thereof,
some husbands cannot well tel, except it should be the abundance of choler,
increasing by great travel in hot times, and so there by filling the gall with
choler, thereupon it flows al over the body, so increases y^ yelows or
iaundise. The remedies are, some takes of gal woort herb, which is bitter, then
stamps a handful thereof, so strains it with a quart of ale, so gives it to the
beast 2. or 3. mornings. Another: ye may also give the juice of wormwood or
southernwood stamped and straind with ale, and so given as y^ other. Another:
take y^ inner green bark of elder a handful, and soak it al one night in beer
or ale in a vessel, close covered: then strain it in y^ morning, and so give
it to the beast. Another: some do give the juice of mugwoort mixed with honied
water, with a little saffron, and so given. All these aforesaid are very good
against the flowing of the gall, and also for the iaundice, Another for the
same: take the yelke of an egg, and mix it with some harde soot, powder of
Pepper, and honey, and put the egg shell and al down his throat, Quod Willis,
then give him a little chamberly, and he shall dowel.

To help a beast that is gored.
IF any beast chance to be stricken and gored with some of his fellows, for
fear of some gargel come thereof, or some impostume to grow and breed
thereof. The remedy, ye shall take of ashes finely sifted, and mix them with
the grounds of ale or beer, and make it thick like a batter, and so lay it
thereon, use this and it will heal it. Another: some do take unto the said
grounds or dregs of ale, of unquenched lime finely beaten, and so mixed well
together, and so lay it thereto. Another: some puts in steed of ashes, red
earth, or oaker, mixed like wise together as aforesaid, and so lays it too
plaisterwise. Another: likewise a plaster of pitch, is also good to be laid
thereon. And all the other aforesaid are very good to heal a beast that is
gored or hurt.

Against the turning disease in cattle.
THere is a certain disease comes to some cattle, called (of husband me) y^
turning disease. Which disease in eating their meat will cause the to turn about
let their feeding sore also those cattle which are troubled with this disease,
are always in dagger of falling into pits and ditches such like. The cause is,
there lies a bledder under the skul in the forehead of the beast, which is
between the brain and the brayn pan, which bladder must be taken forth, or
he will never amend, but in y^ end he will die thereof. The remedy is, ye must
cast him and bind his 4. feet together, and there ye shall feel al over softly
with your thumb thrusting thereon, whereas ye find the softest place, a little
there above ye shall cut the skin overthwart, four inches, so likewise
beneath the soft place. Then also in the midst ye shall cut the skin downward
between the two overthwart cuts, flea those skins on both sides, then turn
them up, and pynne them with pyns. Then take a sharpe knife and cut the
brain pan there under two inches broad, and three inches log: but beware
your knife go no deeper then the thickness of the brain pan for piercing the
brain, (For if ye do so the beast will dye,) Then ye shall take away that cut
boane, ye shall see a bledder there under two inches or more long full of water.
Which bledder ye shall softly take clean away, and see that ye hurt not his
brain. So done, then ye shall lay down again the cut skin as before, and
sow them fast together: then bind a lynnen cloth three or four fold, dipped in
fresh grease and tar, and laid thereon, which will keep it from wind and
cold for the space of ten or twelve days, which skin will so grow again,
and he shall do well. And hereupon I have seen (saith mine Author) many
recover and do well. But for the more surety (when a beast is troubled with
this disease being flat, or having any reasonable flesh on him) is to kyl him,
and so there is but small loss. The like disease ye shall have in young
sheep, which is spoken of in his place.

Things good for sinews and to knit bones.
when as there shall chance any bones of your cattle to be broken, ye shall
take of the herb called in Latin Aron, in English, Cuckospit, stamp thereof
with barley meal and a little honey, and so playsterwise lay it to. Another:
take of the herb called in Latin symphitum, in English cumphory, bruise of
the leaves and root, with a little honey, and lay it to playsterwise. Another:
take of yarrow and stamp it with swines grease, and playsterwise lay it to,
which will knyt not bones only, but sinews also. Another: take the tender
buds of the Ash tree, stamp them with shell snails or black snails, and
so lay it too, or take the powder made of the bark of an Ash tree, mingle and
beat it with the leaves of cumphory, and then lay it too. Another, sees the
bark of an Elm tree, in running water, then bruise it and lay it to. All
these aforesaid are good to comfort sinews, and for the knitting of bones.

To breed calves and to geld them
IF ye will breed calves to make young bulls, take no calf that is calved
within the prime, which is counted the five days after the change, for those
will not prove well, as some husbands say. Nor likewise also any calfe (or
other) then calved, is not good for to keep, but to eat or sell, among a
hundred calves, two shall be sufficient for to make bulls: as for al the rest; it
shall be best to geld them soon after they are calved, or at 2. years of age,
then to lay upon the sores y^ ashes of vine twigs, burnt and mixed with
litarge. And on the 3. day after, ye may melt of tar, and mingle of the said
ashes therewith, and anoint therewith for fear of swelling. Also the manner
of gelding of Calves, Mago doth counsel and say, y^ calves would be gelded when
they are are young and tender, not with any iron? But with a cloven hazel
stick so pressed together, and then race the cod by little and little till it
be consumed. This he takes to be the bestway of gelding, when they are young
and tender, for this kind of way is done with owten wound.

For when a calfe is somewhat big, he would better tarry unto two years, then
to geld him at one year, which to geld them is best in Autumn, when the moon
is in decreasing, and the sign from that place, ye shall then cast him and
traues his feet together, and before ye touch him with iron, ye must take up
his stones, then take two straight lathes like rulers of wood, made like a
pair of barnicles or tongues. Then take up the stones with the nerfes and
strings that the stones do hang by, then close your tongs under betwixt his
body his stones, close them harde together (leaving the stones on the outside
thereof,) some gelders make them of iron for the more strength. Then slit the
purse first of one cod, and put forth the stone thereat, and cut him off
within hard by the said tongs and close by the nerfs, and so likewise take
forth the other stone, and then some do sear it for bleeding too much, and
annoyntes it with fresh grease and lets him go, but see to cut them in such
sort, that ye leave the ends of the strings joining to the said nerfes: for
thereby he shall not loose much of his blood, nor shall not be all feminate,
nor yet very stout of his members, in leaving still the form of the male,
although the force of engendering be taken away, the which Horse gelt or Bull.
he will not suddenly loose by and by after he is gelt, for when a horse or bull
is gelt, they will (if ye will suffer them,) cover incontinent, and certainly
engeder, which ye shall not suffer none so to do, for fear least they die of
the bloody flux, but after ye have so dressed him, ye shall anoint him with
fresh grease. Some do annoynt after he is cut, with the ashes of the tender
vine branches, mixed with the skin of silver, the ye shall give them no drink
for the space of three or four days, but to eat of green herbs, and give
him but little thereof, for ye shall nourish him as though he were sick, in
giving him the croppes of trees and green herbs. The least danger in gelding
an old beast, is a Boar, all other beasts are more, dangerous being gelded
when they are old.

Some do use a kind of gelding young calves or fools (as I have heard) under
nine days, or as soon as the stones descended A kind of gelding.
down into the cod, they will by and by take him knit softly the purse of
the cod betwixt the stones and his body with a shoemakers thread, and as the
foal doth grow increase, the stones will consume and wear away, which kind
of gelding (as I have learned) they do use in the North parts.

Aristotle saith, it is jeopardy in gelding al kind of cattle being old,
except ^ara be: and likewise it is best gelding in the increase of the moon,
for it will make them grow fair, large, and bigger than those which are
gelded in the wayne of the moon, so that ye geld or spay in a good sign.
Also in cutting or letting blood, these signs are counted most dangerous, if
the Moon have power over them. As Taurus, Leo, Gemini, Virgo, and the latter
part of Libra, and Scorpio, and also the two signs governed under Saturne, as
Capricorne and Aquarius. The rest are all good, as Aries, Cancer, Sagittarius
and Pisces, so that the Moon be not in them.

Also ye shall note, that if the sign be coming within a day of the cut
place, it shall not then be so good to cut with out a more danger, as when
the sign is once past the place. For a green wound being newly cut, the
sign coming nigh unto it, will cause it to bleed afresh, being but a
little moved, or else to grow and breed to some impostumation of blood or
other humours, which hath bin often seen among cattle, whereby they have died
thereof, but to geld your calves when they are but young is counted best. As
when they are of six or eight weeks old, for else (as some husbands say)
they will not commonly prove so fair nor so good to wean. If any calfe do
swell after he is new glded, some do use to burn one of his stones to powder,
and so beat it small, and cast it thereon, and some do mix it with neates
foot oil, and so annoints the sore place therewith.

The charge to the keeper and governor of cattle.
THe keeper and governor of cattle must always be diligent to foresee that
his cattle have meat in due season, that his stalls be cleanly kept, and
that no poultry, hens, or ducks, or hogs do use at any time the said
stalls. For the feathers of poultry is unwholesome for cattle, and also their
doung breed the murrain in cattle as some do judge, and the doung also of
hogs doth them no good, and likewise the lice of hogs will make them
unquiet and scabby. Also the keeper ought to rub them daily that labour and
to kembe them with a card, which will make them the lustier, and to wash
their feet with cold water when they labour not, will do well, Ye shall
also know the force and age of an ox in visiting his mouth, for he will cast
his two foremost teeth within ten months of his first year, and within six
weeks after that, he will cast the two next teeth unto them, and about the
end of three years, he will change and cast them all. And when they are
grown all full up again, they will then be all equal, white and long. But
when the Ox begins to wax old, they will return and wax crooked and
black and likewise unequal. Also for Oxen to labour, the black The labouring
Ox.
Ox and the red ox are the best, and the brown or greeseled Ox are next,
the white Ox is worst of al colours. An Ox will serve well to labour till he be
of ten years, not after so good, for he will then wax dull, weak feeble.
Wherefore then it were best to feed him and so to sell him: an ox will live
well 15, or 16. years. Also wild oxen are better to bear a burden than to
labour, for they are never so free nor so strong to draw and labour, as the
tame Oxen are. Likewise it is not good to labour with any bull among your oxen,
Bull te labour.
for he will be stubborn and sullen, and loves to be a master over the rest,
whereby he will but trouble them. Therefore it shall be always best to keep the
bulls lusty and fat, to cover always your kine, so shall ye still have fair
calves and large withal: one good and lusty bull is sufficient for threescore
kine.

Likewise kine to be put to ye bull, ye best chiefest times is in May, June,
July, then ye kine should be put to ye bull before Kine put to the bull.
they have bin in any good pasture: for some husbands saith: a lean cow will
take, and sooner be with calfe then a fat cow. If a cow with make desire the
bull, if she be milked incontinent before, she will not then take nor desire
the bull, if then she have no bull, leese her make, she will desire the bull
about a month after again, thus some husbands have proved, and the bull the
contrary. For he must be fat and lusty when he shall cover the kine, or else
those calves will be weak. A cow will live well 15. years, but after she will
wax feeble and wear. Also ye shall not let a cow take the bull before she be
three year old. For when young kine go to the bull, they bring forth commonly
small and weak calves: therefore some husbands will never wean the first
calfe of a cow. And also ye shall not put your kine unto the bull before the
third or fourth day of June, to the end that she may (by the virtue in eating
of herbs and grass) be the more hot and lusty as to take the bull when she
shall be put unto him. Wherefore some husbands (to make a cow take the bull the
sooner) do give her of the herb called cowmake, which grows like a white
gilloflower among corn. Then to keep her a little hungry, and to give her
thereof, two hours before she shall take the bull, and that will put her in
more heat, and ye shall then rub her natural cundit with nettles, which is also
good, if she will refuse the bull. Some husbands do counsel not to suffer your
kine to be conered under four years, and likewise not after twelve years,
because the one is too young, and the other is too old.

And also they say, the best time to put the bull with the kine is, all the
month of July. For then the kine will bring their calves in ver, in the
beginning and spring of herbs and grass: ye need not constrain her then to
take the bull, for the abundance of herbs will provoke and put her in heat,
so that ye shall not then constrain her. A cow will go with calfe ten
months. If a cow refuse, or the bull will not cover her, ye shall make them
have appetite, as it is spoken of among the horses and mares, and as it is
before rehearsed: and then ye shall diminish her pasture, to the end that the
abundance of grass do not make her barren, for a cow being fat, will smally
desire the bull, and when she hath taken, ye may judge by refusing the bull,
and also to know whether she shall have a cow calfe or bull calfe, ye shall
understand, if the bull descend from her on the right side of her, more then
the least, is to judge a bull calfe: and likewise the contrary if he descend
on the least side. Or if the com in descending and lying down on the right
side, is to judge she hath a bull calfe. And if she lye down on the left
side, is to judge a cow calfe. And when ye shall judge she hath taken by
refusing the bull, which thing doth not always happen true, for although she
have taken, yet many kine be not satisfied, for some brute beasts will have a
voluptuous desire above nature, as well as other creatures.

Also to nourish your kine and calves, in countries where there is great store
of pasture, they may nourish their calves all the year. But where there is
small store of pasture, it will scant suffice them from two year to two year:
And ye may nourish your calves of their dams for one years space. But that
year those kine must not be charged with any kind of labour. Also when a cow
hath calved, some husbands will after the calfe hath sucked iii. weeks, take
away a tet, milk it clean: the next week another tette, so the third. Thus
they will have milk plenty, and yet many kine will keep milk enough to serve
for her calfe. If a cow pass x. years, she is not then so good to bring
calves as before. If a young cow calue before three years, ye shall take away
the calf, and milk her first three days together, because she shall not then
be charged with to much milk. Then milk her no more but let the calfe have al
the rest: If ye will dry up her milk, ye shall noint her vdderne all over with
tar. Kine desire not so much to drink of the river water as of pond water,
because the water of the river is more colder then the pond water: Which river
water being so cold, will chyll her within, and make her in danger to cast her
calfe, if God work not the contrary. Notwithstanding among all great cattle,
the cow will lightly abide the most coldest air. Wherefore they commonly let
them lye without the doors all the winter in most places and countries.

The government of cattle, and the ordering of kine with their calves.
STephanus saith, to order cattle, and to nourish kine orderly and well, the
husband man must see himself, or else have some trusty and skilful man, to
look and often resort unto his cattle, as oxen or kine in the stall, or
without, and to feed or see that they have sufficient meat and water daily at
convenient times, morning and evening, and to see when any beast is sickly to
help him with medicine, and to make their stawles for cattle to lye in, to
set it east and west, with windows and doors towards the south, and close
toward the north, for that is very sharpe and cold in winter for cattle: And
to strew of beaten salt all over on the boards or stones under them, because
(they say) it is a manifest thing to keep their bodies in health: And they do
use to straw some sand or gravel, under their cattle, on the planks for
sliding whereby they may stand the better, without sliding, and likewise to
see them have litter at evenings after their labour.

And when ye shall put them forth in the spring with your kine, ye shall
separate the young sucking calves as soon as they have sucked their dams, ye
shall put them into some several house or other place, where they shall
remain all the day, and when ye will have them suck, ye shall let them
forth to their dams, and let them suck but evening and morning, and so shut
them up again in the house, for by this order the calves shall wax more fairer
and also sooner fat, then roaming still with their dams. Also when a cow hath
calved, if she be not then well kept (although she be a good nurse) she shall
not be able to nourish well her calfe: therefore they do use to give kine with
calfe, of ye green herb called melilot, they stamp it with some honey, lay it
al a night to soak in milk, and so give it her like a medicine: for that is
counted marvelous good for a cow with calfe or other beast. Likewise again,
they do stamp peas with wine, and so gives it them: and let the farmers wife,
as soon as your calves be take up, to put the milk apart, that butter and
cheese may be made thereof without any mast, and see to always that your
cheese be well and close gathered, in pressing forth clean all the why (for
why remaining in the curdes, will make the cheese wax sower, and air will
make it full of holes.) And likewise that your pots be well scalded and clean
washed, with other your vessels thereunto belonging, or else vessels with cheese
fats and such, will make your cheese wax sower also. And likewise that your
women servants touch no butter nor cheese having their months terms on them,
for that is very vnholsome.

Moreover when as ye shall see a labouring ox that laboreth daily, bate no
part of his flesh, but remains still fat and in good liking, which is no good
sign: for he is full of phlegm.

Therefore ye shall every viij. day, open his mouth and wash it with his own
peace, and thereby ye shall draw forth much phlegm thereat, which otherwise he
would still swallow down. Which phlegm oftimes will molest and grieve him to
eat his meat: for by the abundance of phlegm doth cause him to have the
catar of reume, which ye shall perceius when he is troubled therewith, by
watering of his eyne, for they will seem very watery: and when they drop water,
he will then hang down his ears. Then ye shall take him and wash his mouth
with time bruised in white wine, and thereupon rub his mouth with garlic, and
fine salt mixed together: so done, then wash his mouth again with wine as
before.

Some do cleanse the said phlegm with bay leaves beaten with the bark of
pomgarnets, and so mixed with wine and wash therewith. And other some do squirt
wine mixed with mirre, into their nostrils: but for the reume or catarre, if his
eyes do inflame, ye shall but let him blood on the vain under his tongue, and
so ye shall remedy it.

To help a cow of the whetherd.
TO help a cow that is whetherd, that is, when she hath newly calved and hath
not cast her cleaning, she will dye of it shortly after. To make her void and
cast the same, ye shall take a good quantity of the juice of mallows, and mix
it with ale or wine and give it, which is good to repulse the latter birth
after the cow have calved. Another. Take mugwoort, stamp and strain it with
ale and so give it, which will both cleanse the latter birth, and also bring
forth the dead calfe within her. Another. Take of Aristolochia, do bruise mix
it with myrre and pepper, and then give it with white wine or strong ale, which
doth cast forth the latter burden. Another. Stamp a good handful of
penirial, and strain it with ale and so give it, which will put forth the
latter burden. Another. Bruise a good handful of betonie leaves, strain it
with honied water then given: which doth drive forth the second birth. Also
take of syler montaine, stamp it and then strain it with wine and so give it:
which is good to cleanse and drive forth the latter burden. Also they do use to
give when a cow is whetherd, of smoked barley, which barley is but singed in the
straw and so given, and she will eat thereof: any one of these before said, is
good against the said disease, if ye shall see knots in the mouth then judge
she hath not cleand of her birth: then must ye take them from her, or she will
dye.

To help a beast pricked with a thorne.
YE shall take a bettle fly, called of some a shumbarbe, which crepeth commenly on
horse dung, or other dung, slit his belly but kill him not, and lay to the cut
place, where ye thorne went in. If any thing will help this will do it, but
some what painful a while. Another. Take the black snail that bears no
shell, bruise it and lay it to. Another. Shave ye roots of red roses, and put
thereto of black soap, and so lay it to. Another. Take agrimony, rue,
marigoldes, of each a like quantity, stamp them all together mixed with a little
salt, so lay it to. Another. Take of the root of barbery tree, bruise it and
lay it to, which will draw forth either thorne or iron out of the bone.

How to visit and oversee your cattle from time to time.
YE must often oversee and visit your troupes of cattle, a -- against any
infirmity, that may daily hap, and to choose take forth the old cattle from
the young, so must ye likewise take your kine which are barren fro the other,
because they will bear no more, and yet occupy the place of the bearing kine.
Which barren kine ye may rather fat them, or occupy them to the plough, for
they may as well endure labour and travail, as the young ox, because being
bar they are as light. They delight to be in sunny places in winter ny^ sea,
and in summer to be in thick shady woods, and they love more the pasture on
mountains, then on the plains, and also their hooves will better endure in
forests and gras woods or in places of clay or marris grounds, then in hard
stony places.

Things good to purge cattle.
THe powder of ix. or xv. leaves of laurel, or the green leaves thereof
beaten, and straind with a pint of honied water, mixed with a little salt, then
straind and given to the beast in the morning: this will purge somewhat strong.

Also the leaves of the elder, bruised and sod in water, then straind and so
given, doth purge both choler phlegm downward: And also it doth cleanse water
out of the stomach. Also the beries of elder stamped and straind with ale or
beer doth ye like. Or the inner rind which is green, taken stamped with wine,
and so let it stand cold all a night, and then strain it in the morning and
give it warm. Or likewise the low elder, called danewoort, which will do the
like, and in all points it will purge both choler and phlegm, as well as the
other elder: and (as some do judge) it is good to be given cattle in the time
of plague or morren among beasts.

Likewise ye may take of spurge which gives like milk, take a good handful
thereof, stamp it, and then strain it, with a pint or more of water and
vinegar in like portion, and so give it: this will purge both choler and
phlegm. Also xx. or xxx. of the seeds thereof sed in honied water mixed with a
little salt, then bruise them, and so give it, which doth purge more stronger.

Another. Ye may take a good handful of Centory, of the tops, leaves and
flowers, boil it in a quart of ale or beer, till a quarter be wasted, then
strain it and give it warm: this ye may minister at al times (if the sign do
serve) and it will gently purge both choler and phlegm, but chiefly choler,
keep him in the house (if it be cold) vi. hours after,

Another. Ye shall take a handful of the roots of polypodium (which is the
fern that grows on the oak.) chop it small, then bruise it, and mix it with
a quart of honied water, and so give it warm. In summer ye may take likewise a
good handful of the branches, and use it as the other before said: this doth
purge both choler and phlegm, but chiefly phlegm. Another. Ye shall take a
good handful of the crops of broom being green, then bruise it, and put unto
it a pint or more of honied water, or strong ale, and let it rest so al night,
then on the morrow strain it and give it warm. If ye will make it more
stronger, ye may put into it, two drams of the seed made into powder, and then
it will work more stronger.

Another. Take of Scene of Alexandria, with a peniworth of anniseseedes, then
boil them in a quart or more of ale, till a quarter thereof be wasted, then
strain it, and so give it warm, this doth purge very gently. Also the scene
romana, y^ is here growing in diverse gardens (as at Lambeth house) take iii.
drams of the seed made into powder, with the powder of anniseseede, the mixed with
a pint of strong ale, so given warm, and this will purge more stronger.
Another. Take vi. drams of the root of flourdeluce made into powder, and mix
it with a pint or more of honied water, and so give it warm. The more
proportion ye give, of al these aforesaid, the stronger they will be to work.
Wherefore ye must use them with discretion, and as ye shall see cause, for ye
may as well give too much as to little: and as y^ best is, when ye do give them
any drink to purge, to keep them in winter warm after, a day and a night and
so they shall do well, God willing. The best signs to give them drink is,
Scorpio, and pisces.

To make a stawle or frame to give your cattle drinks when ye shall see any
cause.
COlumella saith, it shall be very necessary of good husbands to make a staule
or frame, to give your beasts drink in when ye shall see need: Which ye shall
make like unto those that the ferrours or smiths do use for shooing of their
ungracious horses. Which fashion ye shall make thus, ye shall first pitch your
4. corner posts fast in the ground, and then plank it in the bottom: then
shall ye plank the sides with four strong bars of a side, well and fast
made to the four corner posts, which posts must be at least vii. foot hye,
then cross those bars on the out sides with iii. cross bars, and let the
entrance be four foot wide, so that the beast may easily enter in, and there
set with vi. bar res behind. So when the beast is in, he cannot retire nor
return on neither side thereof, nor yet stir backward nor forward. Also ye
must have two bars before, and a strong cross bar thereon, and as they tie
their horses with their halters, so must ye tie up their horns, that ye may
give them drink more easier: thus being tied his head fast unto the bar
within, his feet shall not then strain without the stall but rest within on
the planks: And to order him that he shall not ascend with his body, ye
must bind his body down to the bars, to make that ye shall not stir no
way to hurt him, but shall be at commandment to receive the medicine, and
this order ye may use for all your great cattle, and thereby to keep them in
health from time to time.

How to fat an Ox.
STephanus saith, ye may fat an ox soon with fetches, peas, boiled barley, or
beans husked and bruised, and ye may also fat an ox well with hay, but not to
give him as ye give unto a horse, if ye give him in summer of the tender
branches of trees, it will refresh him, if ye give an ox only akornes, it
will make him scabbie, except the akornes be dried and mixed with bran, or
such like. Also an Ox that ye intend to make fat, and so to bargain and sell,
ye may labour him in fair times once or twice a week in gentle grounds, and
to labour him now and then a little for exercise; it will make him have a better
stomach to his meat, and let him eat nothing but barley, and hay, and
sometimes a little herbs or vine branches, or other tender branches, that he
loves, so shall he be in good order. Also to fat an ox ye shall give him
ground beans, dried barley, or Elm leaves, but specially going in the son
doth make him like well, to wash him twice or thrice a week with warm water.
Also colewoortes to boyle with bran, doth make them have soluble bellies,
and it doth nourish as much as doth barley. Likewise chafe mixed with ground
beans, is good sometimes, your oxen are less subject to diseases the your
horse: yet to preserve and keep them in health, our elders did use to purge
them every quarter three days together, one with lupin peas, another with the
grain of Cypress, beat in like quantity, steeped al one night before, in a
pint or a pint and a half of water and so given. Others do give other things
according to the use of the country.

Again, if any Ox do wax weak and feeble in labour, they do use to give
him once a month, of fetches beaten and steeped in water, and mixed with beaten
bran, and to keep an ox from being weary, they do use now and then to rub
his horns with turpentine, mixed with oil olive. But see that ye touch no
other part of his head, but his horns, for if ye so do, it will at length
hurt his sight. Also there will be sometimes arising come over the heart of an
Ox. showing thereby as though he would vomit, to help the same, ye shall
rub and chafe his mouzell and mouth with bruised garlic, or else with beaten
leekes, and then force him to swallow it down.

Against the Colic in cattle
YE shall give chiefly for the same unto your ox of bruised garlic with
wine, or bruised leekes mixed with a pint of wine, also against the gurling or
rumbling in the belly, and noise of his guts, which ye shall understand when
he complains thereof, ye shall often see him lye down, and suddenly to rise
up again, because ye cannot for pain rest long in a place, to help the
same, some do use to put unto his drink the oil of nuts. Others do give
him of onions boiled in sweet wine, and some do give of mirre, with the powder
of bays steeped in wine, and also they do prick his skin all about the
clees of his feet, or to prick under his tail, so long till it begin to
bleed, and so he shall amend.

Times best to stop laxes.
THe chiefest times to stop flux or laxe is, when the moon or sign is in
Taurus, Virgo or Capricorne, the to give your beast drinks to stop it shall
do best, but to purge by drinks as before is mentioned, y^ is, when the sign
is chiefly in Scorpio and Pisces. Also it is not good to purge or let blood
(without great need) in ye change of the moon, neither when there is any evil
aspect of one planet unto another, nor in the signs of Capricorne Aquarius,
for they are ye two houses of Saturne, neither when the moon is afflicted with
Saturne Mars. Thus if al these rules aforesaid be observed and kept, things
will work the better, your cattle thereby the better be presarued.

The form and quality of a Bull.
For so much as I have somewhat spoken before of Oxen, I will here take
opportunity to speak somewhat of the Bull and of his form, which is, those
Bulls which ought to be praised, they ought to have long and great members, and
also to be gentle and of a mean age, the black and the red Bulls are the
best. The rest ye must consider to have all things in him as in the ox, for
there is no difference betwixt a good Bull and a good Ox, save that the Bull
ought to have a quicker look, and his horns to be more shorter, likewise his
neck more fleshy, insomuch as it is the greatest part of his body and the
strongest to the proportion of the rest, his belly long, slender and straight,
whereby he may the more easier cover the kine, thus much for the Bull and his
proportion.

The form and quality of a fair Cow.
COlumella says, a Cow of estimation ought to be large and long bodied, and
also to be gentle, having a large and deep belly, a broad forehead, and
black open eyne, with fair and black pullished horns: her ears rough and
hayrie, her jaws well shut, the fan of her tail great, the claws and
horns of her feet small, her legs short and thick, her breast deep, al the
rest like unto the male, and specially to be young: for when a Cow shall
pass ten years, she may not so well bear calves.

Also Stephanus saith, the farmer having good understanding, shall always
esteem the Cow of a mean stature, and being but four or five years old, the
browne colour mirte with white spots is good, with the red and the black,
also to have a large deep belly, broad for head, black eyne great, clean
horns and black, her ears rough, her jaws narrow set, her mouzell great,
her hair somewhat crumpled, her hooves little and smally clove, her legs
short, her thighs thick and round, her vdderne large and deep, having but
four tettes, her neck long and thick, her breast large deep hanging, her
feet broad and thick. These are the chiefest points belonging to a fair
cow.

How to keep a Cow that is great bellied with calfe.
STephanus since, ye must keep your kine with calfe from dangers, from the
tenth month, for then she waxes great bellied, and also in winter if she be
then with calfe, ye shall nourish her in the stal from the eight month, because
of extreme cold, and then to give her of good meat, it shall do well. But in
Summer ye shall give her the branches of tender bruise of trees, such as ye
can get, and use her not after two months to fast, but let her feed on
mornings in the fields, and so to milk her, and give her also in the evening
fresh forage when she comes to the house. And likewise in the morning before
she goes to the field, and when she have calved, ye shall keep back the
calfe, when she goes to field, and so use her still as ye shall see cause. And
when to geld as aforee is mentioned. Some do use to geld To geld calves.
when the calves are young, and some lets them run a year or more before they
geld, which is counted more dangerous. Therefore, as most do use, to geld under
the damme is best: then after their gelding, ye must keep them well in good
pastures, that they may be the more readier and stronger to labour at 2.
years. They do use also to labour their barren Kine to labour.
kine after nine years, when as they bring no more calves. Therefore they are
put unto the use of drawing in the yoke as the oxen are. Also if calves be not
gelded Gelt of calves
within one year, they will not be great, if there grow an impostume after
gelding, burn his stones to ashes, caste that powder thereon, and it will
help.

How to buy lean kine or cattle.
FItz harbart saith, and if a man by lean kine or oxen to feed, ye must see
they be young, for the younger they be the sooner they will feed, and look
well that their hair stare not, but that they do use to like themselves, and
see also they be whole mouthed in wanting none of their teeth. For although
he have the gout, and broken both of tail and pizell, yet will he feed, but
an Ox having the gout will not be driven far, ye shall choose him with a
broad rib, and a thick hide, and not to be loose skinned, nor yet stick
harde to the ribs or sides. For then he will not feed so well. Also those
husbands that mean to thrine, must have both Kine and Oxen, Horse, mares, and
young cattle, and to rear every year some calves and foales, or else he
shall be constrained to buy. If ye buy Oxen for the plough, see they be young
and not gowtie, nor yet broken hair of tail nor pizell. Again if ye buy
kine to the payle, ye must see they be young and (having such properties as
before is mentioned.) Also gentle to milk and likewise to nourish up their
calves.

How to buy fat or lean cattle.
ALso in buying other oxen or kine to fat, ye shall first handle them and
see if they be soft on the cropp^ behind the shoulder, and also upon the
hindmost ryb, and upon the huckle bone, and on the nathe by his tail, and
to see likewise if your Ox have a great cod, and a Cow, to have a big
nauill, for that is a good sign she should be well tallowed, ye must take
heed also where ye buy any lean cattle or fat, and of whom and where
they were bred: for if ye buy from a better ground then ye have your self,
those cattle will not so well like with you, ye shall also look if there be
no manner of sickness among those cattle in the quarter or parish where ye
intend to buy, For if there be other murre or long saugh, or other infectiue
disease, it is great jeopardy buying any beast coming from thence. For one
beast will soon take sickness of another, which sickness will perhaps continue
ten or twelve years or more, ere it will appear on him. If any beast chance
to be sick, ye shall avoid him soon from the rest of his company. These and
such like rules, the buyer ought always to have respect, and take good heed
thereof.

Against the murren or plague among Cattle.
AS for the murren or plague among cattle, there be me enough (says he) that
can help the same, being taken betimes. Which disease comes of an infection
of blood, and it appears commonly first in the head, for then his head will
swell, and his eyne wax great, and they will run of water. And when he do
once froth at the mouth, he is then past remedy, but shortly after he will
dye, and yet when they are thus sick they will eat. The remedies are, ye
shall flea the beast that is so dead, and bury him in a deep pit, and cover
him well with earth, that no dogs can come to the carrion. For so many beasts
as do smell thereof, are like to be infected with the same disease, therewith
ye shall have the skin straight to the tanner, carry it not home for fear
of more peril may fall thereof, there is a common use and done of a great
charity, which is, they will put the beast skin on a pole, and then set it
in a hedge fast bound to a stake by the high way side, that every man riding
by, may perceive thereby where the sickness of cattle is, and also in what
towneshippe, and they hold an opinion it will thereby cease the rather, which
I do scarcely believe. But a beast having the murren, being flayed, it will
appear between the flesh and the skin, for it will be as though it were full
of froth bubbles like bliffers, some blackish, some blew, and some yellow,
which will commonly be in a fat B^, an ynch^ thick and more deep in the
flesh.

There have been some Beasts that have dyed of the murren (as I have been
credibly told) he that fleade him died soon after, and he that went with it
to the tanner, and the horse that carried it, and the tanner that tanned it,
all these died soon therevppon, which was thought it was by the infection of
the stinking skin, but being true, it was a marvelous infection. Wherefore
it is thought good of some to bury them whole, for fear of a further
inconvenience, this is thought good of some to take a small corde and bind it
harde about his neck, then on the far side, ye shall feel a great vain,
and with a launcet. ye shall strike thereon and let him blood, a pint or
more, and so likewise on the other side of his neck. Then take away the corde,
and it will sudden stanch, but if the sign be there, he is in more danger
of bleeding still. If he so do, ye shall clap to bruised nettles and salt,
or wild tansie bruised and laid too, and some therefore do give them
drinks. Thus must ye serve al your cattle that are infected or being
together in one pasture, so doing, ye shall avoid the greater danger in this
disease. For the murren is taken by venomed grass, by company, and poisoned
water, and by hunger.

The rearing of Calves for increase.
IT shall be good for husbandmen, to rear yearly so many calves as they
conveniently can keep to maintain his stock, chiefly those calves that do fall
betwixt candlemas May, for in that season their milk may best be spared, and
by that time, there will be sufficient grass to wean them, and in Winter
following, they will be strong enough to save themselves among other cattle,
having now and then some small helps, and also the Dams by June shall be the
readier again to take the bull, to bring other calves in the time aforesaid,
and if a Cow tarry till after May ere she calue, The calfe will be too weak in ye
winter, following: and the dam will not be so ready to take the Bull again, but
thereby oft time go barren. Also to rear a calfe after Michaelmas, and to
keep the dam at hard meat as they do in some countries, it would be too
costly al the Winter, and a cow abroad will give more milk with a little
grass, then much fodder lying in the close house, or fed with hay and straw
remaining in the stall: for the dry and harde meat doth diminish more milk a
great deal than grass. As for those husbands that have but small pasture or
none at all, must do as they may, and in my mind, it were far better for
them to sell their calves, than to rear them, whereby they may save the milk
to a more profit for the keeping of his house, and the Cow then will the
rather go to the Bull again.

Also if the husband go with an Ox plough, it shall be then meet to rear two
Ox calves, and two Cow calves yearly, to hold up his stock if he can so
do, and it will be the more profit. Also it is better to wean calves at
grass, than at harde meat if they were at grass before. And those that can
have several pastures for their kine calves shall do well and rear with
less cost then others. The weaning of Calves with hay and water will make
them have great bellies, because they stir not so well therewith as with
grass, and they will the rather rot when they come to grass. And again in
Winter they would be put in houses, rather than to remain abroad, and to
give them but hay on nights, and to pasture them in the day time. And thus
being used, they shall be much better to handle when they shall be kine or
oxen to serve to any other purpose.

The loss of calfe, lamb, or foal, which is the least loss.
YE shall understand, the least hurt for the husbandman is, his cow to cast her
calfe, then his eawe to cast her lamb, or mare her colt, because the calfe
will suck so much milk as he is worth, before he shall be able to kill. And
of the yowes milk, there comes no profit but the lamb: yet in some countries
they wean their lambs and milk their yowes, which is a hinderance for them
to take the ram in dry season. But thereby oftimes goes many yowes barren,
because they are brought so low with milking. Also if the the mare cast her
foal, that is thrice so great a loss as the other two, for if that foal come
of a good breed, which is a most necessary thing for every man to provide for
himself, and as much charge will a bad mare cost in keeping, as a good mare, and
with good keeping the foal will be in short time ready to sell, for double so
much money as the lamb, and calfe is worth.

What cattle are most meet to go in one pasture together.
YE shall understand, it is not so good nor so profitable, to have cattle all
of one sort in a pasture together, as to have all oxen, or all horses in a
pasture together, nor yet sheep alone except they pasture on high grounds,
for they will not feed even, but overrun, and leave many tufts of grass here
and there untouched in diverse places of the pasture: except it be greatly laid
with cattle. Therefore ye shall perceive that horses will agree well with other
cattle in one pasture together, for there is some grass that horses will eat,
and beasts will not, and lightly a horse will covet to feed after other
cattle. Also a horse loves to feed on low grounds, as plashes and hollow
places. But horses and sheep will not so well agree together, except it be for
the sheep to feed on the upper grounds. For a sheep will feed on a bare
passure, eat the sweetest grass, and so will a horse likewise, but he must
have it longer. Yet (as some do say) a horse will eat as nigh the ground as a
sheep, but he cannot therewith fill his belly so soon. To one hundredth of
cattle in a pasture, ye may have xx. horses, if it be a low ground. But if
there be plenty of grass, then ye may put therein an hundredth sheep mo: and
so likewise to the rate of the goodness of the Pasture, more or less in
cattle: and after this order ye may eat your pastures even with cattle,
and leave but few tuftes of grass uneaten.

Also if it be a high ground, ye may then put in more sheep, and less of other
cattle. For many kine and draught oxen, will eat a ground much barer then
the fatting oxen or kine. And ye may also give a mylch Cow as well to much
meat as to little: For to much meat will make her soon fat, and then she
will the rather take the Bull: and she being fat will give lesser milk then
a leanner cow: For the fatness stops the poares of the rains which should
convey the milk unto the vdderne. Wherefore a mean pasture is always best
to keep your mylch kine in, and to have them in a good mean estate, neither
to fat nor to lean. Also if a Cow be fat when she shall calue, she is
in more danger then being lean, and the calfe (she being fat) shall be the
less of stature. As for your draught oxen ye cannot give them to much meat,
except it be the after grass of a lowe mowed meadow. For that will cause
them to have the gyrrie, and then he may not away so well with labour.
Likewise if there be very much grass in a close, the cattle will feed the
worse thereof, for better is a good sweet bit from the earth, then a large
and deep grass. For where as it is long, the beasts will byte of the tops
thereof and no more, for that is the sweetest. And the other grass shall
remain still on the ground and so rot, for no beast will eat thereof, but
horses only in winter. For they will feed on foggy grass and such like.
Also ye shall understand that horses and cattle may not well be foddered in
winter all together, but put apart, for the beasts with their horns will gore
both horses and sheep. Wherefore it is the more danger so to feed them
together: it is best therefore to make standing rackes and cratches, and to
cast their meat therein: Which staves ought to be set somewhat nigh together,
for pulling and spoiling their fodder to much at once under their feet. It
were rather better to change their places every day where ye feed them, which
should make them to gather up more clean, and not for to trample so much under
their feet. Thus much as concerning the pasturing of cattle together in
pastures, and also the fothering of them together in winter.

A very good order for the fatting of oxen in the stawle.
when soever you intend to fat any oxen in the stawle, being in somer or
winter to set them up, if ye take them from grass in the summer, they will
hardly fall to the eating of hay of a good while after, but when ye then take
them up, keep them so without meat and water one day and a night, and so they
will by extreme hunger forget the grass the rather, and then at the first give
them a little hay at once, whereby they may eat it up clean, and thereby
wax still hungry. Ye must also take them up into the stawle on a dry day, for
if ye stawle them wet, they will have (as some graziers say) warnell worms
on their backs, which will commonly come unto them by famine poverty, and
will hurt the skin. And also it will make them be lousy. Ye shall therefore use
to kembe them with wool cards or horse comb, as some do, say it doth make the
more lustier. But indeed that is good for the labouring oxen, so to be used,
but not for the fatting ox as some judge: nor ye shall not let them go forth of
the stawle at any time, not so much as to drink. For then they will desire
the more to be abroad, the licking of them will hinder (as they say) their
fatting. But ye shall so provide that they may have water brought them in
cowles, or else to come through their stawles, as some do use, which is to set a
wooden troffe along through their stawles, and with a pipe of lead and a cock
at the end thereof, coming from a conduit or cistern, and thereby fills the
said troffe twice a day with fresh water, morning and evening, and at every
time before, to cleanse the troffe of all the old water, and so to give them
fresh, for after they have once drunk their fills of the fresh water, they will
lightly have no more thereof, for they will blow thereon, and after loath to
drink any more thereof until they have fresh. For an ox or cow is a beast
that doth love to feed sweet and clenly. Also ye shall lay your troffes end
somewhat a slope so that the water may run forth al at the one end thereof, in
taking forth a pin to let out the said water: and then wash the troffe clean,
and so give them fresh. Thus ye must use them daily morning and evening so long
as ye fat them.

And first in the morning ye shall take away all their old hay, and so cleanse
their water troffe, and then give them fresh water, and then a little fresh hay
again, so at noone, and likewise at night: and thus to use them to be fed
from time to time. Also it shall be best to place and set their troffe on the
farther side their crib ny unto the wall, and to set it two foot hie and
more, and their racks likewise would stand of a good height, as of iiii. foot
or more, and to be made almost as broad beneath as above, for fear of tangling
their horns therein, and the rack staves set not passing iiii. inches a
sunder: yet some do use to feed them on the ground without a rack, but that
is thought to be more dustye and more wasteful of hay. They do also give them
sometimes for change, of wheat or barley chafe, with the gurgins thereof, for
that after it (they say) will make them to drink well. But the hay is only the
chiefest fodder and will make the hard flesh.

Likewise their standarts and posts to fasten the by would be made round and
smooth, of the bigness of xvi. inches about and vii. foot long, and set iiii.
foot wide one post from another. Ye must see likewise they be set fast and
strong both above and beneath: and ye shall also hardle your oxen in the
stawle, all of the one side of your standartes or posts, for fear of their
horns the one ox to hurt the other, and ye shall fasten them unto the posts,
with a bow-with made shacle wise, sliding above and beneath his neck on the
standard, so that the one side of his neck shall be always close unto the
said standard or post. By which order of tying so, they shall not at any time
bow their heads so well to like them. For in licking them (as is said) it doth
hinder their feeding in the fatting. And also if ye tie them as plow oxen be,
with a sole and a with, which is made like a yoke bow, which would be to long
a tie from the standard, and they will then both like them selves, and strike
each other with their horns: therefore the other way of hardeling and tying is
best. Some do make a light cradle of wood, and put it about their necks, which
will keep their heads from furning back to like themselves in any part of
their bodies, but it is not so easy to lie down. Other do al to smeere them
with their own dung, and then cast ashes thereon, which will save them from
licking. Also for the clensing and farming of them, they do use morning and
evening to shoouell down their dung, and to see from time to time that they
be clean kept, for that is a furtherance unto their fatting and liking. And
as for the littering of them, they do not litter at all, but let them lye on
fair dry planks, and in their own dung. Yet some are of this opinion, that
to litter them somewhat under the fore-part of their bodies, shall not be
hurtful unto them: and further their keeper must from time to time look unto
them, and mark how they eat and drink orderly as they should do. For
sometimes there will grow diseases among the in their mouths, as the barbes and
such like: Which will much hinder their feeding, and so pair if they be not
looked unto in time, and have help.

Some do also use to make holes behind them, and set there in earthen pots even
with the ground, to keep their peace in, and so covers them with square
boards or planks, which peace they do use to wash the bodies of those apple
trees which are given to be worm eaten, or canker eat: for they say, that will
save them. They do also use to cast the said peace among their roots in the
garden, for that will also kill or cause the worms to void, and save the
roots from being eaten. Thus much for the ordering and fatting of the oxen in
the stawle.

Ye shall take the roots of great sedge, which sedge bears long leaves with
white strekes therein, much like a white and green lace, and grows in some
gardens, like a quitch grass, and the roots are much like unto the quitch
grass, but they are more greater, and will run in the ground like the quitch
called garum, in latin, and it is thought to be a kind thereof. Take a handful
of the said roots, bruise them, and boil them in a quart of good ale, then
strain it, so give it luke warm three or four mornings, and they shall amed.
But let them not eat nor drink the space of two or three hours after.

The nature of the shrove mouse.
THe shrove mouse is an ill beast and doth trouble hurt men's cattle in many
places: for her teeth are venomous, for where as she bites any beast, it will
soon ranckle and swell, that if they have not some help they will dye thereof.
The remedies are, those medicines which are used against venoming of other
cattle, be also good for this.

There is also a common saying among husbandmen, that if any beast be mouse
crop, that is, when she runs over the back of any beast, he shall suddenly
wax lame, and commonly in the hinder parts, so that he shall not be able to
rise nor go, but draw his legs after him. Wherein I have hard no remeady but
these: one is, ye shall have him to a brier growing at both the ends, and draw
that beast under it through, and so he will recover: some beat him with the said
brier. Also among husbandmen this is counted most chief and often proved. That
is, ye shall often toss and turn the lame beast, and turn him over and over:
Now of one side and then of another, every way up and down, which (as they
say) is a present help.

Another. Some do teach to bore a hole in any tree, elm or other, and put
therein a live shrove mouse, and pin it close, and let it so dry therein. Then
when any beast is mouse crop, ye shall beat the beast with a twig of the
same tree, and he shall recover again. Another. If your beast be bitten with
the said mouse, it will swell and inflame, and then they do help it in pricking
the place with a bodkin, or nawle of latin, and then all to chafe it thereon,
with soap and vinegar mixed together, and that will help it. Another. Sum do
take a shrove meuse alive, and put her into a glass of sallet oil, and
therein let her die, and when any beast is bitten with her, they anoint the
bitten place with the said oil, and so he will amend, but touch no other place
with the oil.

To heal the tetter on cattle.
THe tetter is an unseemly scuruines or scabbe growing on the skin or
outward part of a beast. Some are broad, and some will grow long, and hang
like a cluster of grapes, or like a when with curnels, and knobs somewhat
hard. It is supposed they do increase by wet and poverty: and some think it
doth increase of some venomed humour, or by some prick or bruise or such like.
It is not grievous unto the beast, but unseemly. The remedies are, they do
help the running or broad Tetter, by searing it round about with a hot
iron, and then to lay Tar thereon. Some do but lay Tar only thereon:
and for the long tetter, that hangs down like a cluster of grapes, or bunch:
They do sear it of with a hot iron, and then do tar it thereon, and so it
goes away. Also they say, when the beast doth wax fat and lusty by grass,
it will so wear away by little and little again: for they have it commonly in
winter, and not in summer.

Another for the same.
YE shall mix orpement with tar, and put thereto of gray soap, al in like
quantity, and do heat it, and then anoint therewith, so often as ye shall see
cause, and this will heal it. If the tetters hang long, some do knit them
about with hair, and by such means they will so consume and fall away.

Against faintness in labouring oxen.
THose oxen that are laboured all the winter at plough, toward the spring they
will wax faint and poor, and full of lice, and with small labour they will
lye down. Therefore to keep them still in good plight, and lusty, ye shall
give them before their watering, to every Ox a good handful of barley in the
straw, and then after let them drink: which will always keep them lusty and
strong. And also kembe your oxen with a horse comb or card, it will delight
them the more, being fat oxen. Yet some will say, a fatting ox, must not be
touched or rubbed on the back.

For a cow lacking milk, having new calved.
WHen ye have a cow that hath newly calved, and lacking milk through
poverty, to cause her milk to increase, ye shall boyle of anniseseedes in
good ale, or wine, then strain it and give it milk warm. Another: take a
handful of the leaves of the hedge vine, (called Briony) then bail it in ale
or wine and strain it, and so give it her. Another: also the leaves of
colewoorts boiled in water, or to give her them raw, will do the like, and it is
also good against the weathering of a Cow. Another: ye shall give her of
sod barley and Fennel seed sod together let her eat the same, or green
Fennel chopped and mixed with sod barley, and so given. Also the herb
Nigilromana, stamped and strained with ale or wine, and so given three or four
mornings. All these are very good approved to increase milk in a Cow.

To help the love.
THe love is a disease which breeds in the claws of a Beast, and comes (as
some husbands says,) by treading in the doung of Christian folk, which burns
them so betwixt their claws, that it will make them to halt. To cure, ye shall
take a roapes end, and rub and chafe him betwixt the claws therewith, so
that ye make it bleed. Then anoint it with some tar, and fresh grease, and
it will heal soon again.

Against goring of a beast.
IF any beast be gored, ye shall take of rosen, fresh grease, and wax each
alike, then boil them altogether in a pot of earth, and then keep it, and
when as ye shall have any need to occupy thereof, make a tent of linen, or
flax, well anointed with the said ointment, and so put it down to the
bottom of the wound, and so use the same and it will soon heal him: or
power in the wound boiling butter.

For the neck of an Ox that is swollen.
TO heal the neck of any Ox y^ is swollen with yoke or other ways, ye shall
take tallow, and melt it in a pot, and as hot as ye may suffer, power it on
the swollen place, use this once a day, and it will heal him in short space
without other thing.

For a spraine or stroke.
AGainst a spraine or stroke, ye shall take of butter, black soap, and hemlock
herb, with a quantity of bay salt, then bail them altogether, and al to
bathe the spraine, or stroke therewith, as hot as ye may well suffer, and it
will help. If it be in the legs, ye shall put unto (the things
aforesaid:) the grounds of beer, or ale, and wash it therewith: and then
wrap it about with a hair rope dipped in chamberly, and he shall do well.

To help the shoulder bone of any beast out of joint.
IF the shoulder bone of any beast be out of joint, ye shall well perceive it,
by feeling if lye down and inward towards his body: so that ye may easily
put your two fingers betwixt those bones, and also he will still trip on the
same foot. To help the same, ye shall first cast him, bind his other three
legs together, then make one to draw forth that leg straight, then put
one of your hands on the point of his shoulder where the bone went out, and
put your other hand on the inside next his body, and thrust up the bone that
is fallen out, into his right place again, just to the other bone, if ye shall
see then it be not come home just and close, ye must thrust up your fist
betwixt the said shoulder and his body, and put it up more close, or else with
some trunchion of wood, and therewith put it up more closer. Then being right,
and put up straight and close together, ye shall make two wodde pricks of one
length, and make two holes cross, under the skin, just over the midst of
the said joint, an inch and a half asunder from both sides of the said
joint, and put your two pricks cross there under the skin. Then take of
whip corde, or strong packthreed, and wrap it under the said ends of your
pricks round, and therewith draw up the skin on a lump together: so done,
fasten your thread, and let it so remain till it fall away of it self, and
he shall do well again, if it be an Ox, ye may labour him again within
two days after. And if the fly be then buste, ye may annoynt the place
with some tar.

For the neck being out of joint.
IF the neck of any beast be out of joint, he will still hold and bow his
head on the contrary side that the bone is out: to help the same. First ye
shall feel the bone if ye can that is out, so done, then ye shall make one to
hold straight his head with a halter, and let another set his hand on the
place, where the bone went out, and then do you on the other side thrust in the
joint that is out, into his place again. And so let the beasts head be
tied to a surcingle, to bend on the same side that the bone went out, and so
let his head be kept for the space of nine days after, till the flesh have
grown, and is fast settled on the joint again.

For any other joint of a beast that is out.
WHere as any other joint of a beast is out: First ye shall search and feel
for the bone y^ is out, so done mark on what side he is, or went out, so done,
let one pluck and hold out that limb strait, then set one of your hands on
the place or bone where it went out, and with your other hand, thrust in the

For any bone that is broken, or limb out of joint.
TO help any bone of a beast that is broken, ye must cast and bind his

bolstered round about, and then splinted thereon and well lapped, and let it so
remain for the space of nine days, and give him to drink, of Cumphorie
herb, stamped with milk or ale, for that will help to knit the bones the
sooner. The bark of ash beaten with wine, and so plaistred, will close and
knit bones together. Also the Elm inner bark, laid in a running water, and
to bathe the place therewith doth knit the broken bones.

Also Plinie saith, the roots of Rocket boiled in water, plastered to, will
draw and knit broken bones. And Dioscoride saith, wild Betony newly stamped
and playstered to, will likewise draw and knit broken bones. Thus much for a
beasts shoulder out of joint, and for the setting of broken bones. Also hazell

An instruction for the ferrar and horseleech.
THe duty of Ferrars and Horseleeches which desire the knowledge to help
soreness and diseases in horses. They must well and perfectly understand of
the present disease in the horse before they minister. Also to look on him
well, howe many other griefs are growing on him, and whether the cause be
hot or cold. To know also the operation of all such herbs, and drugs, as
he doth minister unto them. With what quantity and portion of each thing
thereof, and in what time and hour of the dale and year is best. Also what
force and strength the horse is of which he doth minister unto. And whether he
be old or young, and which disease to cure first.

These things well considered, so when ye have ministered unto the horse, and
given them drinks in declaring howe they should after be kept. He ought
also to look well unto them (after their drinks) for a time: to see howe his
medicines doth work, not to give a horse drink (as most horseleeches do)
and then to let them go, and takes no care thereof after. Whereby many horses
falls worse sick, and so perishes soon after for lack of attendance and
good government, which is a great discredit to that ferrour, or horseleech.
For like as the wise learned Physician, when he have ministered unto his
patient. He will not then upon the sudden depart, but first he will know the
working of his medicine: and thereby he gets the more knowledge. Even so
the horseleech should after giving drinks, mark the working thereof in each
horse. So likewise for his salves and players he should look unto them
from time to time, and see the working thereof, whereby so doyng, he should
increase still more and more in knowledge and fame. Thus much for instruction
to the ferrar and horseleech.

The judgment of Laurence Ruce of a beautiful horse.
THe parts of a beautiful horse are these, he ought to have a small lean
head, with the skin joining to the same, broad forehead, short ears and
sharpe, great eyes not hollow, his nostrils large and open, his lips thin
and slender, a large mouth and close, a long neck and slender towards the
head, his mane crested somewhat bowing up, broad breast, a short back and
straight, his reins full on both sides with flanks like an Ox, his hanches
long stretchingout, a round rump, his tail with slender long hair, large
thighs fleshy withinside as without, his legs straight, lean and plain, large
hips, great legs, lean and full of hair, the joints of his legs big, not
fleshie by the hooves, round hooves, short pastornes, strong and well set,
with the rest of his universal members of his body in length as in breadth,
his neck rising greater towards his shoulders and breast, and to be higher
behind then before, like to the stag or hart.

Also the nature of the horse.
THe horse is of a hot temperate nature, his heat is showed by his highness, he
is hold and of long life, for he is of a longer life than all other labouring
beasts, his teperature is therein found, for he is easy to be taught, and
gentle towards his master and feeder. Thus much here touching the beauty
and nature of a horse.

To the Horsemaister and breeder of coltes.
1
RIde not thy horse too young I say,
nor labour him too sore:
Where gristles is as yet but weak,
strive not with him therefore.
2
A young horse soon doth catch a crushe,
and wilful oft they be:
Whereby their sorrows doth increase,
as daily ye may see.
3
Therefore to use and tame thy coltes,
from year to year take pain:
And when thou make them ready sale,
the more shall be thy gain.
4
Thy horse once sick, defer not time,
his grief for to appease:
For soreness oft so dangerous be,
thou may thy horse soon leese.
5
If thou doest mark of sorenes most,
whereof they do proceed:
Thou shalt find out that most do come,
For lack of taking heed.
6
Therefore let this book be thy glass,
wherein thou may have sight:
How for to help and save thy horse,
wherein thou hast delight.
7
Here may thou find, both learn and see,
no kind of helps to want:
Of secret knowledge in thy horse,
which skill hath bin full scant.
A Proverb.
To trust all currant horsecoursers,
I vise thee to beware,
For truth among the most of them
is found to be full rare.
Breeding of coltes.
ALl those which hath a desire for to breed coltes horse, they must first make
provision for the good government thereof, and to have large pastures, and to
be measured in their meat as well as other cattle. For a horse doth ask a
greater diligence to be meated and kept in the stable more then other cattle.
There is three sorts of horses, the first are to be nourished young, which are
noble and excellent: for the field and tourney. The second is, for carriage of
burdens, as moyles and pack horse, which are bought and sold for that purpose
according to their goodness. The third is, another sort of horses and mares of
easy prices, common for most men, the which is of a meaner and smaller stature,
and for the common sort are most necessary to travel with, and also are
better to feed and bring up for to till the earth, which must have also
keepers continually to see unto the in fields pastures, as well as in woods or
other grounds, and to keep them from dangerous places of myres and bogs,
and where as they may have soft grass and sweet, as well as to be rank, high
and great. They do suffer these horses to be with the mares in pastures or
other grounds, and pass not when they do cover the mares, not for these sort
of horses: but for your large great mares, they ought to be covered about
April or May, and some do cover in mid March, to the end the mares may foal
about the same time they were covered, in having ready the same time the tender
grass and herb to feed on, and to have the hot and fair season unto
harvest: for about the end of xii. months after she foaleth: and therefore ye
must with good aduisemet, put the horse unto the mare. For he that keeps these
sort of beasts, must serve them at the same hour, when they are desirous, or
when they do enter into the fierce and hot desire of the horse, which is (as
Hippomanes saith) a venom) because it inflames both men and beasts, and to
have the like rage in love as the horses and mares. For mares may conceive of
themselves, without the company of the horse, as without doubt it is most true,
that in some countries, the mares be so great heate, and desires so to be
covered, that although they have not the horse, nevertheless in thinking and
desiring so much the horse, they burn so within themselves, that in thinking
thereof, they become with foal. Like as the birds of houses, as Cocks to
lay eggs, and hens to lay eggs without the Cock. And as the Poet Virgill
in his third book of Georgiques saith thus:

Above all all beasts great love there was,
in these hot sort of mares,
As was oft times in Venus love,
by fleshly mindful cares.
When Glaucus punished was,
for his audacity,
By carrying of such mares,
into the yle Pontie.
Which love did cause them range,
the mountains of Gargare,
Also Ascanie, and
the mountains of Gargare.
Thorough springs and mighty rivers,
themselves did oft torment,
By eating of the herb in spring,
that heate did still augment.
They turning on the mountains high,
all right against the wind,
Saith (my Author) Sephorus,
in their hot burning mind.
They so became with foal,
without having the horse,
Which fire to quench is marvelous,
that so will have his course.
They running in all parts fiercely,
thorough ragged rocks and stones,
Over mountains and low valleys,
with cries, sighs and groans.
Except the Orient parts,
and in the North and West:
Whereas the wind is boisterous cold,
with shades oft times oppressed.
Which beasts with piercing air,
oft times are turned and tossed:
Whereas small heate of sun doth come,
are punished with the frost.
Which causes their hot nature
more milder for to be,
In countries cold also they are,
as ye may daily see.
Also it is most true in ye holy mountains of Spain, which lies towards y^
occident seas. Many genets young mares Covering mares.
have colts, without the covering of the horse, which coltes they do nourish
bring up, and yet they are unprofitable, for within 3 years when they should
be at perfect grouth, they die. But as touching the covering of ye mares, ye
meetest time is about the month of March or April, then let the young mares be
satisfied of their natural desire, the rest of y^ year to keep the horse fro
them, to separat y^ great stalions apart, it shall be best, because they shall not
cover when they would: but to keep them to cover, when the best time is, and
so it shall be better, so that ye have pasture for them, and let them be far
from the mares, or else to keep them still in the stable, until the time of
covering your mares, against which time they ought to be well nourished, and
fed with barley, dried peas, to make them more lustier. For whereas a horse is
weak in covering, so much weaker shall the colt be in growing and might. Some
do make the horse therefore as lusty as he may be, whereby he may the better
endure to cover many mares within a short time, and yet not to cover above xv.
or xx. mares, nor to begin before he is of three years old: for then he
will better continue till twenty years, and most commonly they are found
good, if the horse be then strong, and have rest. But if he be feeble and
weak, ye must then rub the nature of the mare with a spounge, and put it
into the horse nostrils, and if the mare will not suffer the horse to cover
her, ye shall bruise the sea onion, called squilla, and with that all to rub the
secrets of the mare, and that shall put her in more heat. And sometimes they
let an other horse leap on the mare, to bring her in more heat, and takes him
of again by and by, and then put the other horse unto her and so he covers
her. Now after she have taken and is with foal, ye must have a great care for
hurting of her, and not to labour her soon after her covering, Government of
the mare with foal.
or when she is nie foling. But to nourish her well specially in both the said
times. If ye have not grass in winter, ye must stable her, for she feed
twain. Let her not run, or travail sore, nor suffer any great cold, nor
yet to keep her in any strait or narrow place, or close shut up, that one
hurt not an others belly. For al these before said do oftentimes make them bring
forth dead coltes. Also the snuff of of a candle hold it at her nose, will
make her cast her colt, or when she longs not to give her desire. Also if the
mare foal in traueiling, or have a dead colt, ye shall stamp polipodium
roots, or oak fern, and mix it with warm water, and give it her with a
horne. But if she have fold well and the colt fair, touch not the colt with
your hands, for by touching it never so little (being yet but tender) ye may
soon hurt it. Ye must also have a care to see it laid warm, and to order the
damme so as she may have space enough about her, for the tender colt may soon
be hurt by the dam if she should chance to lye on it. So by little and little
ye may bring it abroad with the mare, and take heed that dung hurt not his
hooves: and when he is of more strength, ye may then let him feed continually
with the dam, because she shall not have anger to see her colt, for commonly a
mare will become sick for love of her colt, if she see it not. Good and lusty
mares do bring coltes yearly, and the great and fair mares, ought not to have
coltes but from two year to two year, to the end (by long sucking) the coltes
may wax and grow more stronger, and thereby they will be the better to travel,
when any shall be put to serve in the field.

Also the stallen must not be younger then three years when he covers a
mare, and so he may continue unto xx. years well: and the ma^e may bear well
at two years, so that when she is of iii. years she shall nourish well her
colt, but after she is x. years, she is not so good. For commonly an old mares
colt will be heavy in labour, weak, and soon weary. If ye will she shall
bring a male colt, or female, for the male, when the horse doth cover her, ye
must bind back with a cord or pluck back his left stone, and for the female
Mares, for male female
bind back the right stone of the horse, and thus ye may do unto all other
kind of cattle.

After the colt is fold incontinent ye may judge what he will be: if he be well
fold, then tractable and sure of foot, moving Tokens of a good colt.
at the noise of any thing, full of play and swift, having a short rump, more
proper then other are of his age. If he will leap out of a hole without
reculing back. If he will by the way pass boldly over bridges and rivers. Also
these are the signs in a good colt, having also the beauty good disposition
of the body, as to have a lean small head, black eyes, wide nostrils, short
ears, and straight, the chyne of his back large and soft, and not long, his
mayne thick hanging on the right side, a large breast and open, with strong
muscles and sinews, his shoulders large and right with round sides, his back
bone even, his belly gant, his stones and cod close small, his rains large
descending, his knees round small, not turning inward, his legs right and
straight, his buttocks round, his thighs thick and strong, his tail long
with big crumpled hair, his hooves hard and high smooth and round, his fore
top above very small, al his body big, hie, straight, and well in lifting his
feet, fair to see in length, round according to his body. Also to be pleasant
and soon chaft, sudden gentle and meek again, for these coltes of such
nature do soon obey the man, and will patiently endure labour travail. If a
colt when he is fold do not cast his milt, husbandmen say he will not live
long, but die suddenly in few years after, and some colt will cast two miltes,
no horse that lives xii. years hath any milt within him. Also for the taming
or breaking of a horse colt when he is of two years he may well be tamed and
broken for the use of the house, but for the field or journey, he must be of
iii. years old. and then after iiii. hes may be taken to travel, and look
also from time to time how the marks do change in his body. The age of a horse
is known by his hooves, and tail, and bars in the ruff of his mouth, but
chiefly by his teeth, for a horse of two years old and half, will cast his
two foremost teeth above, and also under, and when he is iiii. years, the teeth
which we call dogs teeth fall, and so comes other: and before the sixth
year, the great teeth or chewing teeth above do fall, and on the said year,
the first teeth that fell, are returned whole again, and on the seventh year
all are filed up again without having any hollowness in the teeth, and from
the seventh a man may not well know of his age, yet about x. years his teples
will begin to be hollow, crooked, and withered. therefore some do take up the
skin to hide the same, and being old, his brows will wax long, and gray
haired, and his teeth grow long and black. Also when as your horses are in
health, and yet wax lean, ye shall fat them soon with dryde wheat or barley,
but ye must give this like a mash in wine or ale, and by little and little to
make them have continual appetite, mix therewith the bran of barley, until
ye shall accustom them to eat beans, and pure barley.

Also ye must each day, chafe his body as ye do to some men, Chafing his body.
in rubbing them up and down with a cloth, and often so covered and rubbed,
doth profit them much, and also to be lead and rubbed with ones hand on the back
is better then to give them much meat, for rubbing doth profit, preserve, and
keep both strength of body and legs, for fault of rubbing many soarnes grows
on the legs of horses in travail, and this I will counsel you, if one lead
his horse in a raynye time from his labour into the stable, he must see that
the place be dry, and that their hooves be not wet, or stand in cold
wet places, for that both will cause them being hot, to founder, or to have
an ague. If the stable be well planked with oak, or if the earth be often
cleansed, and laid clean straw thereon, for horses oftimes being hot, they
catch diseases, in being weary and standing on the cold ground, specially when
they are not strong, then see the more unto them: for when they sweat, to give
them meat or drink, doth hurt them, but when they are cold ye may then
without danger give them meat or drink, but after Drink or meat.
his drink, stir him a little, and he shall do the better, and then ye may
give him provender or other meat: and when they have rested long they chafe
them suddenly which is not good, and for your weary beasts ye must let them
rest, and put of sallet oil into their throats with a horne, or fresh grease
with wine: and against cold, ye must give them things to vomit, and frote
their heads, and ridge bone with wine or strong ale, or grease melted and warm
rubbed thereon. If your horse cannot peace, give him oil mixte with wine, and
chafe him in the flanks, and on the rains. If that serve not, put or give him
garlic with ale: also they say, to bruise garlic and rub his yard, is good
against let of vrin. A piece made of honey and salt put into his yard, or live
flies, or a little frankincense, or squirt the juice of betony into his yard.
Or give him warm water, or wash his yard with warm vinegar. All these are
good remedies when he cannot stale, or when his vrin burns in the inner part
of the bladder, or when he hath a hot water.

Also when a horse hath pain in his head, ye may know it by dropping of his
urine, and in falling and flagging of his ears. His neck, and head, heavy
hanging downward, and pain in the head.
then ye must let him blood on the vain under the eye, and squirt into his
nostrils warm water, and that day give him no meat, on the morrow fasting ye
shall give him warm water, and then some grass, and litter him well with old
hay, or soft straw, at night again give him warm water, and some barley mixed
with two pound of fetches, and so by little and little let him come to his
ordinary feeding, Also against pain of the eye teeth, or grinding teeth, ye
shall fume them with hot vinegar, and some do hold it to the teeth with a cloth
on a sticks end, and so rub them therewith. This is good also when there is
any inflammation or swelling in them. Also if his shoulder be hurt, or that he
have lost blood, then shall ye open the vain in the middle, betwixt his two
fore legs, and rub his shoulder with the said blood, mixte with the fine
powder of frankincense, but let not to much blood for weakening him, and lay on
the place his own dung, and bind it fast with some thing, and ye shall on the
next day again draw some more blood in the same place, and use it as before,
and then give him no barley, but a little hay, and on the third day unto the
sixth ye shall give him in the morning vi. ounces of the juice of leekes, mixed
with a pound of sallet oil, and after the sixth day then walk him a little,
and lead him forth to some place to make him swim. Then do nourish him well
after for a time, and he shall do well.

If your horse is troubled with choler, his belly will swell and will be hot,
nor he cannot then vent beneath, and then ye must rake him with your hand, and
cleanse the natural conduits which are stopped, and take forth his dung, and ye
shall give him sauin, stauesaker, and salt boild and mixed together, in putting
to a little honey, and minister it in at his tuel like a glister or
suppositorie: which will move and purge forth al the choler. Some do beat iii.
ownces of mirre, with iii. pintes of wine and gives it with a horne: and to
chafe and rub his tuell with tar and old grease. Other do wash his belly
with falte water of the sea, or water and salt. As for other purgations, they
do commonly give in powders, and pills, which must be given with good
discretion, according to each disease, his medicine. Which ye shall understand
more thereof at large, in M. Blundeuils book for horses, howe and when to
purge them, therefore I here pass it over.

Against the bots or worms in the guts, when the horse is troubled therewith,
the signs are: he will oft wallow and lye down for pain, and rise suddenly
again. Also he will bow his head towards his side or belly, and stamp with
his feet, and frisk with his tail often, the next remedy is, put your hand
into his tuell and draw forth his dung, and wash his belly with sea water, or
strong salted water, and caste in his throat three ownces of the roots of
capers beaten with half so much vinegar, and that will kill all worms and
bottes. Some take hot embers and put it in running water, then strain it and
give it warm with a horne, and walks him after half an hour, and ties him up
with the bridle: and others take fenegreke, and bays, licoras, and turmericke,
Drinks for horses.
of each a halfepeny worth, of anniseseeds a pennyworth, with a quantity of
brimstone in powder, beat all these small together, and put them in a quart of
ale, and give it fasting warm, and walk and use him as before, keep him
warm al that day after: or a pint of milk, with a sponful of soap. Some give
sauin chopped among provender, or a ry shelf: or the fine powder of brimstone in
warm milk: some other do let them blood fasting in the ruff of his mouth,
and that is the best for a mare that is with foal, and to let her Mare with

her stronger things, it were dangerous for the colt, except it were strong,

them mans dung hot, and annoints the bridle therewith, and chafes him thereon,
and maluesy also is good fasting: for the cough newly taken, they take lentile
peas, clean made, dried and beat to powder, and put thereof in warm water,
and so given a pint, Use him thus three days, and give him grass, and tender
branches of herbs. For an old cough, they heal with vi. ounces of the juice
of leekes, mixed with a pound of oil olive, and so give it with a horne, and
give him grass to eat after, and to anoint his grief with vinegar oil mixed
together. If it help not, then chafe him sometimes with sal niter alum mixed
together with a feather, of each (...) like, with some vinegar. If there be
pushes or blisters on his Pushes and blisters.
body, ye shall frote them so hard in the sun that they bleed, they mix of
the root of ivy with so much brimstone, of tar and alum, put al together,
and therewith heal it. For the cough some say, take a hedgehog, cast him into
an oven, dry him to powder, and always mix of that powder with his provender,
which will help at length any cough. Or to take a handful of box leaves small
chopped, and mix it with a peck of ground malt, and sees it in a gallo or two
of fair water, and let the horse drink thereof milk warm, and give him
white water for two or three days after, or a handful of groundsell, small
shred with the powder of licoras, and anniseseedes, of each a quantity, and so
give it warm in a quart of ale: then ride him softly after and keep him warm
for two or three days after.

of his body, they do use to wash them with warm water, and then to rub and
chafe them with grease, and salt melted together, so long till the matter ripe
and issue out: such sores oftimes do kill horses, if there be not (in the
beginning) some remedy found. Some do annoynt them with oil of Cedar, or of
Lentyles, or with nettle seeds, mixed with sallet oil, or the oil of a whale,
or the dropping of salt tunny: and chiefly the grease of a seal fish. But if
the sores be old, ye must have stronger things, as to boyle of betony herb,
and brimstone powder, of ellebory, of pitch, with as much old grease, and with
this they do heal all old sores, in racing them first with a sharpe iron, and
then to wash them with peace, and so to anoint. And sometime if it be
festered, to cut it to the quick, and then to draw it with medicines, as
shall be made with tar and oil, or such like which will clenes and fill
again the place, and when the hair shall be full again and closed full with
hair, then it shall be good to chafe the place with soot of a cawdrone, and
butter. and to heal a nauelgall, or sore back, take soot of a chimney, and
yest mixed together, and plaster it therewith, which will heal without any other
thing, in shifting it once a day. For rising of the skin or raising thereof.
Take two great onyons, and boyle them in water, with hounds tongue herb, then
being hot, take a pound of salt, and mix it with strong vinegar, putting
therein the yeolke of an egg, then mix all together, and rub the place
therewith, and ye shall see the experience. And for his back that is chopped and
swollen, ye shall first wash him with peace hot, then anoint him with fresh
butter, and lay thereon a little hay wet in cold water, and so clap your saddle
thereon, and let him rest so al that night, or anoint it with butter, then put
on the wet hay, and your saddle. Some clap these to hot, horse dung, then the
saddle, but take the grounds of ale or beer, and boyle it well with mallowes,
and clap it hot: but if the skin be through chaft, so that it do water and is
very moist, ye shall have ready in a bag filed with the powder of brier
leaves finely beaten, and put a little of that thereon, and it will dry it, by
the morning, and it will heal it also, without other thing. Also for sore eyes
which may be heald with the meal of wild tares, called oreb. And the creuices
and chops on the eyes are healed, with fasting spettle, and a little salt, or
the powder of a dry bone, and mixed with burned salt, or the seeds of wild
parsnips in powder, and put in a cloth, and blosh it in his eyes: and all the
griefs of the eyes are healed by mixing the juice of plantaine with honied
water, or if ye have not that, take honey, and time, mixed together. Also for a
sore eye, take strong nettles, do stamp them and strain them with beer, and
squirt thereof into his eye twice or thrice, then blow in a little powder of
sandiuer, and let him take no cold of his eye, till it be hole. If ye must
needs ride him after, it were good to keep a cloth before his eye, to defend
the wind, and it were good to let him blood under the eye, and then dress him
once or twice, and it shall suffice: for blood in eyes take the white of au
egg, and clap it to, or the juice of Selandine to anoint, and it is good
against any stroke, and also it is good to make a tossed of bread and dip it
with white wine, and clap it to his eye, and use it often, or to let blood
under his brows: and to keep the flies from his eye, or other sore, ye shall
melt tar and oil, or tar hogs grease together, and strike thereof all
about.

Sometimes a horse will cast blood at his nose, which doth weaken him much, and
is gotten by some strain, or such like, they staunch it by blowing in at their
nostrils the juice of Coriander, or bruise the leaves of peruincle, and put
thereof in his mouth, and let him chew it in his teeth, and that will stanch
bleeding of the nose.

Sometimes a horse will loose his taste, which comes of sorrow. The remedy is:
Take iiii. ownces of the seeds of nigilromana, beat with vi. ounces of oil
olive, mixed with a pint of wine, and make him to swallow it down. The
dispositition of vomit: they use to take it away, in making them often to
swallow a beaten head of garlic, with three parts of wine.

Against appostumed or pestilent sores, it shall be good to pearce them with a
hot iron, rather then with a cold, then plaster it with healing medicines.
Pestilence in mares.


Also there is a pestilence, which causes mares suddenly to wax lean, and
so pine away. If any such do happen, ye shall put in their nostrils four
pintes of Fish brine, called garume. If the grief be great, they take six
times so much, and this will make them to purge and cast out al phlegm at their
nostrils.

Sometimes mares will be in a rage, but not often, which is to be noted, how
that sometimes they happen to be in a hot rage, that is: when they see their
image in the water, they Mares in a rage.
are suddenly taken with love, in so much that then they forget to drink or
eat, and in so burning doth become dry. The signs are, when she runs over
the pastures as she were chaft or beaten, and looking oft about her, as though
she desired something.

They use to heal this folly, in leading her to the water again. For when she
shall see her self in the water as she did before, she doth suddenly forget
her first image that she saw: and this is often among mares. Thus will I here
leave a little of them, and speak somewhat of moiles and their natures.

Who so hath a desire to nourish asses and moyles, they ought diligently to
search for the fairest and best males, and likewise the females to bear
coltes, for if they be not both well disposed, those which shall come of them
shall nothing preuaile. Ye must therefore choose the mare under ten years,
and to be large and fair, and well membred, to abide travail: and let her
bear easy burdens for hurting the seed within her belly, and not to be
one^e beautiful of body, but good also of spirit and stomach, and when the
seed is long or it take life within her body, or being long ere she foal,
scarcely about the end of xiii. months, is a token of some let.
Notwithstanding the moil colt takes most after the ass that begat him,
rather then after the life and nature of his dam, and yet ye shall not find it
true in all mares, no more then is properly in all horses. For sometimes
experience doth deceive a mans judgment in him which he chooses. For
oftentimes stallions of their own nature and race, are marvelous in condition
and form. And whereas the mares are but small and fair, commonly they bring
more males then females. Nevertheless the coltes do increase or diminish after
or according to their dams. Some stallions are ill to see to, and yet shall
be great coltes of great price. And some do yield a worthiness unto the fruit,
more then other some. But they are more colder and not so hot of desire, and
are not joined in love but very hardly with the mare. And these sort of
stallions must have mares of the like nature: For the like nature is more
familiar to conceive then others. Yet the ass never begets an ass, nor the
moyle never begets moyles: and for this cause they do often suffer the
stallions to mount on the mares, to put them in more heat, and to take them
suddenly away again: Which shall make the horse to be more eager of the mare,
which before he little past of, and this is to be noted by the way, those which
have their kidneys hot, are always more desirous, then those which have
their stones and kidneys cold, which is as well in man, as in beasts.

There is another sort of stallions which are in a rage in their fiery heate,
which are so devilish and froward, that thereby they are soon marde, if they
be not wisely governed and handied. And often they break their halters and
cords in gnawing and eating them a sonder, and leaps on mares with foal, in
biting them by the neck and back.

Now to correct such, ye must put them into a horse mile, and there to make him
sure, and use him a little to labour Hot stallion^
gently, and so ye shall make him to leave his furiousnes. So when he hath left
it, yet thereupon let him not be suffered to cover until he be in
sufficient heat thereunto. For this is of greater importance, that the sprite
of these beasts are naturally heavy and sleepy. But by moderate exercises
they will be the more liuelyer to travail, and then ye may let them cover,
that by the secret efficacy of hidden nature, their fruit may be the more
pleasenter. Also a moyle doth not engender with a she ass, or mare, but a she
ass with a horse, or a wild he ass with a mare. Certain authoures which I
will not hide, as Marcus Verro, and before him Democritus, and Mago, have
said, that in Africa there is no marvel, or yet a monstrous thing to see
their moyles to bear, no more then the mares in this country. The most fair
and largest cattle among all moyles, are those which are begot of asses, and
may well be compared unto those which are gotten of wild asses. If it were
not that they are so troublesome, wild, and hard to govern and rule, like unto
their sires, there were none like them.

Wherefore those stallions that shall come of that race, shall be better, and
so from time to time alter. For if ye rover a mare with a horse that was
begot of a wild ass, or tame, he shall keep their bigness and modesty
like their sier, with like strength and age unto their first race. And those
which are gotten betwixt a horse and an ass, shall bear the name of their
parents, as to say horse moyles: For they will resemble like unto their
dams. Therefore if it better to have moyles of an ass stallion, which by
experiences come of a good and fairer race, then otherwise. He must be chosen

breast, and full of sinews, his thighs fleshye, his legs well trust and black
of colour or spotted. The asses are commonly of a mouse dun coloured hair. But
that is not a pleasant hair for a moyle: Therefore in general it is good to
take good heed thereof, that ye be not deceived by your eye, for even like as
we shall see the fleece of a Lamb, which comes of a ram with a spotted
tongue, so likewise, the ass hath hair of diverse colours on his brows and
ears, and thereby often they make the moyles of diverse colours: Therefore when
ye have diligently considered of your stallion, yet nevertheless ye may be
deceived, for beside these foresaid marks, sometimes they have moyles by other
coloured horses which they know not, and yet the same may be as well esteemed
as other, which comes of no other cause but from their first parents, and
generation, which by mixing with others hath been almost destroyed, and yet by
the seed of the horse is renewed again to his first estate. And the ass which
I do write of, as soon as she hath foled, it ought to be taken away from
her, and privily to be set to the mare which hath a colt, so that she know
not thereof, which must be done in the night, and set in a dark place. But
first take away the mares colt, and put to the other, but in ten days she
will not let it suck, therefore ye must help it in the mean time, the one as
well as the other, as ye shall cause. Or else take the urine, or milk of the
one, and rub the coltes therewith contrary, and at length they will love and
use them for their own. And this young stallion colt so nourished of the mare,
shall take a love unto mares herafter. And though oft times they be nourished
with their Dams milk, yet being but young, and having the usual company
among mares daily, he will thereby the better love them, and so will he serve
well your mares, but let him not cover them before he be three years
Covering of young mares.
old. And at such convenient times, as grass may feed him well, and
sometimes with sheues of barley, sometimes of good mashes to drink of bran and
wheat: or of wheat sed, or barley sod, and let him not first cover a young
tender mare, which hath never been covered before. For in the mounting on her,
she will often strike him with her feet, and thereby he will take it
scornfully, which shall make him to cast a continual hate to all other
hereafter, and therefore they put some other unto the young mare to put her in a
heat, and not to cover her, but with him. And when ye Place to cover
shall see her desirous to stand, then take him away, and put to the young
stallion and let him cover her. Also it shall be good to have a place made with
boards descending downward before, that she may the better take the horse,
and not fly aside, or turn from the horse when he covers her. Some do
manacle her fore feet to the hinder on both sides. And by this descending
place, a lowe ass, or horse may cover her the better, and more easier. And
after being thus covered with an Ass, or other Horse, then in the year after
that she have fold, ye shall not by and by cover her again with another,
but in that year let her nourish her foal, which foal shall be the better
hereafter to do any purpose: therefore let her not be covered again so
soon. And when that colt is a year old, take him from his damme, and put
the mare in such pastures as you shall seem good, in woods or in mountains,
to harden her hooves, whereby she may the better travail hereafter. And
always he moyles are better to bear the packsaddle, then then the she
moyles, yet she moyles are more quicker, and nimble, and most meet to bring
coltes: But they are both good to travail with the burden, and also to labour
the earth, if it were not that these kind of cattle are somewhat to high for
that purpose. Therefore commonly they use a temme of Oxen to break the
grounds before.

And for the burden some do say a mare is weaker then a gelded horse, a
gelding weaker then a stoned horse, and a horse weaket then a moil. For the
moiles commonly (as they say) will carry v. or vi. hundredth weight, and
therewith they will travail thirty miles a day. For both horse and moiles are
beasts of a great strength, if they had understanding no man should be able to
rule them, and also they say a horse or moyle hath no brains, but in the
place thereof, he Horse without brains.
hath as it were a bladder filed with wind, and no brains therein, or other
thing, but like a white water. Thus I leave of horse and moiles, and here I
will speak of the ordering of horse in travail.

How the husband or carter should order his horse in travail by the way, or
other wise.
TO show somewhat the duty of carters, which carters must have always
patience, in moderate using of their horses, at al other times he ought to
bear a love always to his cattle, so that his cattle may love him, not
fearing them to much, let him never use to beat them with the stock of the
whip, but to whip them with the lash, and use them to the sound thereof, and yet
not often for dulling of them: in travail use them sometimes with fierce words
more then with stripes. Your loitering horses touch before the other, and the
free horse touch him least of all, but at a great need. Also a free horse
ought to be haltered short, or else he will soon spoil him self in straining
continually, he will soon be lame, broken winded, or blind. And use all the
other at times when you shall see cause, and let them not in travail by the
way, draw or labour so much as they may, touch not a horse with the whip over
his back, for fear of his eyes, and also he that is behind him, but touch on
the legs of the near side, and so ye shall avoid danger thereof, nor to draw
to much for thereby ye may soon dull and tyer them, specially in a young
horse, and after travail truss them up to the tuell, for taking cold. Ye must
also every morning use to rub and to kembe them, for therein a horse doth
delight, and it will make them more lustier, and fresher to labour, and in
summer the like if they be howsed, or if they be at grass also: and water them
not, but at their accustomed hours, and after as they have journeyed in
summer, wash often their feet with cold water, and if ye can, sometimes with
wine, or ale and butter, which will supple and strengthen their sinews, or to
bath them with the lies of wine, which will likewise supple and strengthen
them, and after to rub their legs with butter or neruoileor nets foot oil, and
if they be shod, ye shall bind to their hooves dung mixed with men's vrin, and if
their feet be hot, or have the gout, ye shall then wash their mouths with
vinegar and salt mixed together, and for that time give them no hay nor other
forage as straw or otes, nor Hot feet or hoof.
yet of litter, but well cleansed, nor let them be shod till they be well. Also the
carter must use daily to see that his harnaise be just and meet for every horse
according to his stature, that he may therein labour the easier. And also those
harnaises may be well looked unto from time to time, and all things belonging
thereunto: as halters, brydles, headstalles, collers, hawmes, traces, pipes,
wanties, packsaddels, backwanties, belly wanties, with tack, or shoottle pin,
tied to every hawm The horse cart and harnaise to see to.
with a string, to be the readyer at need, and each of the belly wanties to
have a cross pin, or ferrell of wood, to be always ready to fasten and loose,
and to have all things whole and sound, not to be broken or faulty against any
time of occupying, and to be well hanged upon hooks clean from the ground,
that horses tread not thereon, or that dogs gnaw no part thereof, and every
horse harness placed by him self, ready to harnaise at all times. Also the
carter ought to have skill how to mend his harnaise, to stitch and sow it when
any part or parcel thereof decays, and to have his packsaddle, thread and
whitlether always ready, or other great thread wherewith to prepare to help
the same again, and to have always with him his nawle, and pannell needle.
The carter ought also to have knowledge in shooing his horse, that when any
shoe fall loose by the way in travail, he ought to have hammer and nailes
ready to fasten it on again, for loosing, or to set on some other, he ought to
have always shoes and nailes with him, for by that means he may save his
horse oftimes from danger of surbat, graueling, or prickking with some nail,
or cut with some stone, such like: for to have experience in shooing is a thing
soon learned, there is small danger, but in pricking or clowing with a nail,
or to drive it nie or in the quick, whereupon among all skilful smiths, this
proverb is said, which is, before behind, and behind before: which meaning is,
the most dangerous nailes to drive in the fore feet, is the two hindmost
nailes, and in the Proverb.
hindmost feet, the two foremost nailes, the rest not so dangerous so that ye
drive them even. If your shoes be made hollow or rising in the midst, and not
flat to the foot, it will be much better for the horse, to cleanse and void
graueling. For otherwise thou can not cleanse them so well, and they will the
sooner be graueled: therefore see to have shoes always ready against any such
time of need.

Likewise also when thou dost take any journey, with the Preparing the cart.
horse and cart, thou must likewise see that all things belonging to the cart
to be substantial and strong, as thy wheels, and carthodie strong and sure
to bear a burden, and the axeltree likewise. Also see the rath staves and
struts be whole and sound and well furnished, with staves of good strong holly,
hasell, or ash, and to have them ready dried, if any want or break, and all the
shamble staves to be made of good dry and tough ash, which are to bear a
burden from the thyller, and thy cartladder, to be made of good dry ash
also, and surely set thereunto. And let your axeltres be so made that they may
fill close the nathes of the wheels, for when they gaggle or shake, they go
uneasy, and hinder nigh the draught of a horse, and that also is uneasy for
the thyll Horse. And see that your axeltree he well clouted and nayld close
thereon, that the nails tear not the nathes of the wheels. And see also in
like manner the areltree pynnes be sure and strong, for if the axeltree go not
close, they are commonly in danger of bowing or breaking: and let your nathes
and axeltree he well greast, with fresh grease and soap, or snails mixed
together, for that will keep the nathes long cool, and to go more easier.
Which grease ye must always have with you when ye travel by the way, to
occupy when ye shall see cause, and also to have ready roapes ends, or
other small corde, that when any thing do break or cleave asunder: by and by
to mend and piece it again. Thus advisedly travelling on thy way, have an eye
to the fore horse, in lanes specially streets for fear of children and
beasts, but if thou stay, let thy horse stay also, take heed of the
forehorse in these places. Look well to the body horse, and in routs, holes, and
dangerous ways be always nigh unto the thiller, with thy hand nigh his head:
whereby thou may the better rule him upon a sudden, and always look to the
going of the wheels in thus doing. Thou shalt keep thy cart always upright
from overthrowing, and when thou go down a hill, drag the cart behind,
and up a hill, weigh the cart before. And thus doing in considering all ways
and places, posts, and gates, thou shalt avoid oft times the dangers thereof,
which otherwise thou may happen often therewith to be troubled.

Also the carter ought to see well to his horse in travelling, for the horse is
a beast of stout courage, and he loves Belles on the horse.
man, he is delighted with the whistle, drum, or in bells, which belles do not
hang so well at the horse ear, as at his patrell, or on the back wantie, for
the belles hanging so nigh his ears, he cannot so soon hear his driver, and
the Carter must likewise be careful at all times to see unto his horse, y^ if
any do halt or complain by any means, to see by and by unto him, and search
where the pain rests, and to remedy it in time, with such things as he
shall think good. Sometime to lay on their own doung on their pastorns as before
is mentioned, he must also be well advised when the hoof is newly hurt, chafed,
to make him have a sound hoof again, and in taking cold (after his labour)
or when he hath the cough, then ye must cover and keep him warm, and give
him mashes, or if he be more founded by travel in rainy weather, or at other
like times, ye shall clap the roots of Alexander sod in wine unto his
feet, and make him to eat Fenegreke, or Anniseeds among his provender. But if
then he be of full age, it were then best to change him: the carter must also
understand what love one horse bears to another. (For some will not agree
together,) according thereunto place them in the stable. The which stable ought
to be made clean every morning, for a horse loves to be clean kept, and at
night to be refreshed with some clean litter, and the horsekeeper ought to
sleep in the stable: to be ready if any horse break loose in the night and
fight with his fellow. The keeper ought also to look advisedly warily unto his
candle, and to place it in the stable out of al danger, and nightly to hang up
his harness for fear of dogs, or rats, or other dangers of hurting with
horse, and to place them as before is mentioned, and to have them ready against
the morning when he should go forth to labour them: that he slack not the time
in seeking his harness in parts. And when any horse is sick or seem heavy,
then to forbear, not labour him for that time, for fear least he wax worse.
For in sickness a horse is a very tender beast and heavy to any labour,
therefore whenever ye have laboured the, walk them after for taking cold till
they be in good temper, then truss them with straw (as aforesaid) for taking
cold. For thereby breeds many diseases in a horse, which diseases or remedies
shall here follow.

Here I will return speak somewhat of remedies against soreness as comes oft
times to horses. For a moyle or horse Fever.
that hath the fever, ye shall give him to drink rue or Coleworts, but when he
draws his breath short, and doth often sigh withal, then they use to let him
blood on the neck vain, and then take a pynt of wine with half an ounce of
sallet oil, mix therewith some Frankincense, and with a third part of, the
juice of mugwoort give it, and if they have any frets or galls on the
pastornes, ye shall plaster Pastornes freted.
thereon the paste of Barley meal, and open the impostume if there be any, and
heal it with tents of lynt, and such ointments as before is mentioned, with a
pynt and a half of Garum, which I take to be saltfishe water with a pound of
oil olive mixed together, and put it into his left nostril, and put there unto
the whites of three or four eggs. And sometimes they do lance their eyes,
and sometime sear it with a hot iron, and if the blood be descended down
into the feet. They cut it, as the founder of a horse, they give him
bearefoote herb to eat, Hyosciame, called henbane, the seed is good also to
be bruised and given with wine. Against the leanness in a horse, give him
often drinks mixed with half an ounce of brimstone finely beaten, with
Leanness in a horse.
a raw egg, and a penny weight of the powder of mirre, mix al with wine and
give it with a horne. Which is also good against pains of the belly, and for
the cough: also against leanness there is nothing better or so good, as three
leaved grass given, betwixt green and dry, which doth also mightily fat him
more than other hay, and ye shall give of this but little at once. For it will
increase too much blood in the horse, and thereby he may son take hurt.
Also when a moyle or horse is weary and sore chafed, ye shall cast a piece of
grease into his mouth and make him to swallow it, and Weary and chafed.

use as before is written, of medicines for Oxen and mares.

well suffer to tread full on the ground, and will be hot, it comes by
standing dry in the stable, and by straight shoing, or heat. The remedy is, ye
shall race the hoof above from the top to the sole in four or five places, so
that the water may come forth. Some do race it round in the top an inch long
downward, with the point of a shape knife, and then rubs it al well with salt

tarry a day or more, ye must then roll him. If the stiffle bone be out ye
shall feel and see it stick out, then put it in, and bathe him with beer,
and bind his other shamme with a girth as hard as ye can all one night, then
shift it in the morning, then rub and chafe the place, and bind it again.
Use him thus three or four days, and let him stand on the sore leg, this
is good also for any sprain in that place.

If your horse be sprainde of some sinew, ye shall then wash him with the
grounds of ale or beer made warm, Sprainde.
and therewithal to bathe him, in striking it downward, then bind him round
with a hay rope sod therein, and bind him from the fetterlocke up to the
ham, and let it rest all one night thereon. If once do not help, use it
oftener, or take of smallach, Oxeye herb, fluellin, and some sheep suet,

like knots or bunches, as big as half a Wallnutshell, and by following a
vain at length, it will break it self, and run filthy matter, and as many
horses as do touch or gnaw of him, within month shall have the same disease:
or if he do bite any other he will infect him, and if they be not soon
helped, they will die thereof, If any horse have it, avoid him at the first,
if he can: for dangering all the other. This soreness commonly comes of a
corrupt blood and humour engendered in the body, and sometimes it comes of
bruised blood by some stroke, or of some galling or biting with some other
horse, or of tickes, or hog lice (as some do say.) The cure, let him blood
on the vain nigh to the sore, then burn every bunch in plucking them up with
your hand to burn them the better, and leave none vnburned. Then annoynt them
every day with melted hogs grease, till they fall away, then have ready a
pottle of old stale, and boyle it a little with some coperas and salt, and a
handful of strong nettles, and therewith warm, wash all the corrupt sores,
then fill each hole with the powder of flacked lime, do thus once a day till ye
hoales are closed up. If any do ranckle more than others, fill those with
verdegreace. In all this time let him have a small diet of meat, as straw and
water, or sometimes a loaf of bread, for the lower, he is kept the sooner he
is whole, and yoke his neck that he like not his sores, also the less rest
he hath, the better for him. Another remedy, take of mistleto, and stale
peace, honey, black soap, sees these altogether, once a day warm, wash your
horse all over therewith. Use this fine or six days and ye shall see
experience. Another: let him blood in the neck four fingers from the head,
and also on both the sides, and give him this drink. Take a gallon of fair
water, and put therein a good handefull of few, and a spooneful of hempeseed,
and bruise them in a mortar altogether, and sees it till the half be consumed,
and when it is cold, give it him to drink, and this will make him whole.
Another, a very perfect medicine, ye shall cut him two inch long down in the
forehead, and open it in the midst thereof on both sides two inches, and put
therein a tampin made of the inner rynde of Elder bark, and look it lye
cross the cut, for so it will destroy all the venomed humour in his body,
and it will heal him safe and sound.

better with wine, and plaisterwise lay it to, remove it evening and morning.
Also some do stitch y^ eye lids in ye midst with a needle double thread, taies one
down, and the other up, and then with another needle puts out the haw, so far
as ye may stay it on your fingers end: and so cut away al ye hard matter a
penny breadth, but cut not away too much of the wash or fat, and leave also the
black behind, for by cutting away too much fat, ye shall make thereby the
horse blear eyed, and when it is cut away, squirt either beer or wine into
the eye, or blow a little sandiuer into his eye within a day or two after, or

come by taking cold when he is hot vnwalked. Also they come of a corrupt humour,

laying to hot hogs grease, and so cuts them out. Some cuts a slit on both side,
and with a tool of iron breaks the nest of them, and plucks out part and
puts in the hole of nettles and salt, others lay riping things thereunto, as
some barley meal, mixed with three ounces of raisons sod well together in
strong wine, then plaster it thereunto, and change it not till it be ripe, the
lance and so tent it with tets which must be steeped in water, and mixed with
sallet oil and salt, and some do burn them downward with a hot iron in the
midst from the ear to the iaw bone, draws two strokes under the throat, and
then lance it in the midst, and plucks out the kernels with a pair of ^ppers,
so far as he may cut them off, without touching any vain, and then fills the
hole with salt, and if they be rank, take a crop or two of nettles beaten
with some bay salt, and put therein two spoonful of ale or vinegar, the strain

humours grown to that place, and it will grow by beating the horse about the

considering the danger thereof, for that is the weakest and tenderest part of
the head, and by such strokes many Cart horses have that disease, specially in
Winter. Which ye shall soon perceive by swelling of the place, and hanging

quantitye, then temper it al together with the sodden water of lycoras, and make
it so thin that he may easily drink it with a horne, and tie up his head for
an hour space after, that the drink may descend down into his guts: then take
and lead him forth softly that it may work ye better, and not cast it up
again, and let him not drink of four twenty hours after. The second day ye
shall give him fresh grass to eat, branches of willow or such like, that by
eating those cold herbs, it may mitigate the heate of y^ potion. The cure is
hard, if it have gone-long, then shall ye take of these herbs following, that
is, of Venus or maiden hair, of flouredeluce, of ash buds and leaves, of
lycoras, of cardamomum, of pepper, of biting almods, of burrach, of each 2.

put unto it the water that lycoras have bin sod in. Then if this disease do
yet remain, ye shall heal him with this medicine, except it have long grown:
this will heal him. Notwithstanding, there may be diverse remedies given to
help for a tune, as by drinks in helping his guts, also in slitting his
nostryls to take wynd, which perhaps may be a help to continue long, and to
give him a little boiled wheat for three days space. But first ye shall let him
drink of y^ water where in al these herbs have lain a night before, the give it
a boil, and let him drink it milk warm, in taking out al the herbs clean
with a strayner as of paunces, longwoorte, maidenhayre, y^ crops of nettles,

him drink thereof milk warm, so much as he will. Then give him of the wheat
boiled, use him thus five or six days, keep him in a close and cool place,
after let him have grass, this will help him if there be any recovery, this
is good also for any dry cough. Also it shall be good to give him water sod with
lycoras, and mirt with some wine, and let y^ be his only drink for nine or ten
days after. Thus much for the broke wynded horse. The gladers is an i'll disease

ale, then stir altogether and give it him fasting, and ride him softly a
while after, and then set him up and keep him warm, the space of nine days
if ye can, and give him warm water, and he shall do well. Another, take an

outside of the legs, as on the inside, sometimes they will be as big as your
fingers, which comes by travelling too young, or by too heavy burdens, or by
sudden starting and straining his sine was. The cure. Some do heal it by
rubbing it with a hazel stick made cross with nicks, therewith rubs the splint
al over cross. And others do shave of al ye hair, with a stick cut
checkerwise, then lays tar thereon, and rubs therewith twice a day all on
the splint, till it be clean gone. Some do say, to burn is the best, but if he
be not well healed, he may halt continually after. Also some do clip or shave
the hair clean away, on the splint, and then with an awl, al to pricks it

are commonly an inch long, and they Bots in horses,
have red heads, and are as much as your little fingers end. Some are white,
and some are yealwish, being quick in the maw, they will stick fast thereunto:
Also there are 2. other sorts, the one is called lung woortes, and the other is
called trenches. Al these worms breed in the horse by eating of filthy meat,
some do come of a raw matter, by eating green peas, eats, or barley: when ye
horse is troubled therewith ye shall soon perceive, for he will forsake his meat,
in staping with his feet, sometimes trebling, suddenly down, soon up again, will
strike at his belly with his hinder foot, and will often bow his head toward
his belly, and shake his head often. The cure: Take a quart of milk, and mix
it with ten spoonful of honey, and give it him warm, walk him a while after,
and so let him rest with little meat, or none till the next morning, and
suffer him not to lye down, Another: some do annoynt his bit with hot mans

horse will have 2. of one leg nie together, there will be strokes with hair
which doth venom the place, they will cause him to go stiff, and make him to
stumble and fall, which comes of some corrupt blood, but most special for lack
of rubbing and good keeping. The cure: take a bareld hearing with a soft row,
with two spoonful of black soap, half an ounce of alum: beat in a mortar
together, and then lay it to the malander for three days, it will heal it: or
wash it with warm water, shave away al the hair, the scab also, then take a
spoonful of soap, and another of lime, mix them together like a paste, and
with a cloth lay it, and bind it fast on, and use this for 3. days and every
day fresh: after ye take it of, anoint the place with warm oil of roses, y^
by means of the plaster shall take away the skurfe, and when y^ scurf is al
gone, ye shall wash it once a day with the horse own water, or with mans peace,

fetterlock: as well behind as before, they are like soft bladders under the skin,
and gotten by much travel they will payne the horse so, that in harde ways he
cannot well go but halt. The cure: Some do prick it thereon (with a launcet)
the length of a Bean, where it is highest, and so it will come out, but beware
of hurting the sinews,) and ye shall see it like the white of an Egg. Then
take the yolke of an Egg and of oil of bay, as much as a Nut, mix them
together, and plaster it on flax, and lay it thereto, and this shall make
him whole in a day. another. Take the roots of Comine, and beat them well with
salt a little, and then lay it too, and he shall be whole, incontinent. Some
do lay them with rubbing there on with the juice of an onion, or leek blades,
but if ye ride him soon after, they will come again in 4 days. Some do wash the
with warm water, shave away the hair, and race them with the point of a
knife, so heales it as the splint, and others do burn them downward, some do
cut them, and makes the windgall start out, and heals it with pitch, rosen,

scab in the bought of the hough, of the hinder legs, for as the mallander is
in the bought behind of the forelegges, so the selander is in the bought before
on the hinder legs, it comes for lack of rubbing, and by evil keeping
without any rubbing or dressing when he hath travelled, and as ye heal the
malander, so must ^e cure this selander.

The Spauin is an ill soreness to heal, and there be two kinds of them, the
wet and the dry. The dry is a h^rd The spauin in horses.
knobbe as big a a walnutte, on the inside of the hoghes, under y^ joint, and
some will have two spauins appearing on both sides of the joint, which is a hard
thing to be healed, and it will cause the horse to halt. Some do suppose it
comes by kind by the horse that begot him, but it comes by extreme labour,
and heates, by increasing a humour to the master vain, in feeding the place
with evil humour, grows to a hard bone wherein the cure is hard. The cure.
Some do wash it, and then shaves away the hair, and opens the skin upon the
vain a handful above the knee, and cuts away the vain between both the
strings, and where the highest of the spauin is, there part the skin the
length of a date, and with a sharpe chisel half an inch broad strike it clean
away the bigness of an almonde, and take two penny weight of Uerdegreace,
with a Smiths nerual, mix them together well, and put it therein and so
healeit, Another: some do after they have washed and shaven it, race the place
with a sharpeknife, and they take half a dram of cantaradice, with an ounce
of Euphorbium made in powder, with as much oil of Bay, and mix them
altogether, and to lay thereof to the sore the space of 2. days, in shifting it
each day once. Then after two days annoynt it every day with fresh Butter to
make the hair come again. Some do fire him on both sides without tainting,
and so takes up the master vain, and so annoynt it with butter nine days
after, unto the fired place do begin to scall, and then boyle of sage, and of
nettles of either a handful, with four handful of mallowes in water, and then
put too a little butter, and there with bathe him every day once for three or
four day still the burning be whole, let him not wet his feet in this
time.

The wet or soft Spanin grows likewise on both sides of the hough behind,
and is a soft swelling and Soft Spauin.
some do cal it a thorough Spauin, and commoly it is greater on the outside than
on the inside. This will be always soft, and is more easier to be cured, and
cures it, as the harde spauin.

The curb is an il sorenes, appearing on the great sinew, Curb in a horse.
behind under the hough, or camerell place, somewhat beneath the spauin, it
will swell on the sinew, and after a little labour, he will halt thereon, and
then the more labour, the greater grief. And this is gotten by bearing some
heavy burden when as he is young. Or by some wrynch or some great strain, and
that place will show bigger then the other. The cure is is ill if it remain
long. But take a pint of the lies of wine, with two handful of wheaten flower,
with a handful of cumin, then mix them all together over the coals, and
being warm, plaster wise, lay it to the grief, in changing it for the space
of three or four days, once a day, till the swelling do go away, and then
draw it with a hot iron all over, and then plaster it with pitch and rosin
melted together, and so clap it to warm. Some lay flocks it on of the horse
colour, and so plaster it to. Let it remain till it fall of it self away,
and keep his feet dry for nine days or more after. And he shall do well.

The pains is an il sorenes, and soon healed, it breeds in Pains of feet,
the pasturne under his fetherlock, and will grow to a scabbe full of scalding
and fretting water, which comes for lack of rubbing and clean keeping in
that place, after his travail and labour, by some dirty sand remaining in
that place, which breeds a scabbe. Therefore look to your horses that hath
long hair in that place, for they will soonest have it. The cure: Some do wash
it with beer and fresh buttes good and warm. And first they clyppe away all
the hair, saving the fetterlocke: Then they take honey, turpentine, and hogs
grease in like quantity, in mixing them together with a little Bolarmeniac,
and two yelkes of eggs, with so much wheat flower as will thicken it, and
then plaster wise lay it to, and lap it thereon with some other cloth to
keep it fast, and shift it once a day, till it leave watering. Then wash it
with peace till it be dried up. Another. Take and chafe his legs with a hay
rope till they bleed, or wax raw: Then take a little sharpe mustard, bean
flower, and fresh grease, with a little fenigrick, mix all together in a dish,
and make thereof a salve, and therewith anoint his griefs. And when that
place is dry, take honey, and the white of an egg, and fresh butter, temper it
together, and anoint the said place therewith. Let him stand dry, not
laboured nor lead to water till he be whole. Another. If they be green and
new, ye shall take but beef broth, and therewith wash him, and then anoint
it with soap: use this iiii. or v. days and he shall do well. Another. Plunge
his feet in scalding water twice or thrice and bath the sore with hot scalding
water, then have ready a hard roasted egg, cleave it in the midst, and clap it
to as hot as ye can, and let it lye bound all night. Use this once or twice,
and ye may ride him on the next day.

The scratches is a long scuruines right behind the leg. from the fetherlocke
up to the knee or hough: The hair will stare, ye may easily perceive it if
ye take up his leg, and shed the hair, and ye shall see it scurvy all
under. The cure, wash it with men's urine warm, then take black soap, mustard,
and vinegar of each a like quantity, and mix therewith of an ox gall, then
stir them well together, and chafe and rub the place therewith, and bind
thereto a cloth, so use it once a day till it be whole. Then anoint it with
neats foot oil, to supple the the sinews again.

Another. Take the finest hay ye can, and burn it to ashes upon a fair
board, then mix it with neats foot oil. and make a salve thereof, then all
to rub the sores until they bleed almost, and then anoint them with the
said salve, and rope his legs, and keep them dry in the stable, and keep
him so iii. or iiii. days and he shall do well. Another. Take turpentine, honey,
and hogs grease, with two or three yelkes of eggs, with some powder of
bolarmeniac, and bean flower, mix all well together, in shedding the hair,
anoint therewith all over well to the bottom. Use this till he be whole, and
let him come in no wet. This sorenes comes also for lack of rubbing, and
keeping clean after his travel.

The King bone, is also an ill soreness, it will appear above the fore part
of the hooves, and some will be round above the joint, the hair will stare,
and rise on a bunch, and there will resort a thick and a slimy matter, it
comes by some blow of some other horse treading, or by striking one leg
against another, in process of time it will become hard like unto a bone, and it
will make him to trip and halt, and ye shall see it higher then the hoof,
if it grow in any other part of the legs, then it is called a knobbe, and no
ringbone. The cure: wash it well with warm water, and shave that place the
hair clean of, and race it with a sharpe razor and make it to bleed. Then
take an ounce of euphorbyum, half an ounce of cantaradice, and beat them in
fine powder, and take oil of bays an ounce. If the grief be but smally
grown, take the half of each, and boil them all together, in stirring it
well. And with a feather lay it boiling hot on on the sore, and stir him not
for half an hour, then let him be in the stable, and use him thus nine days
in ordering him as ye do for the splint. Then when the hair begin to grow
again, ye shall fire it in down strokes with a hot yro in iii. or iiii. places
like lines, till the skin look yellow, fro the pasturn to the hoof, and then
lay molten pitch, and rosin, on flocks of his colour, and so clap it to, and
let it so remain till it fall of it self away. Also some do say the ringbone
comes of a blood in a young horse, which they help thus. They knit fast a
shoo makers thread above his knees, and let it so remain for a space, and that
will stay the course of the blood, if it come of blood, but this must be done
at first before it grow on the horse foot. Of the foundering of a horse, there
is a foundering in the body, by eating suddenly to much provender before he is
cold, after his travail, which for lack of digestion do breed ill humours,
and takes away his strength, and thereon he will be so feeble, scant able to
stir his iointes, or being down, not able to rise, so troubled with pain
not able to stale. There is a foundering for a horse to stand still in the
stable, and not sturde. There is also a foundering, in letting your horse drink
by the way when he is hot. A saying is: ride him in the water but to the
pasture, and let him drink being hot, he founders, ride him to the knees, he
founders not, ride him to the belly, he founders, which comes by sudden
cooling in his body, which causes a waterish humour to fall down to his legs
and feet, and will make him cast his hooves. Some do founder but before, and
sometimes on all four feet: and some say a horse may be foundered in
traueiling on hot sandy ways, and suddenly to ride him but through a
shallow water, ye may founder him also, by taking cold after a great heat, or
by standing still on the stones or cold ground, he being hot, or in a cold wind.

The foundering in the body, the signs are these, his hair will stare, he will
seem chylly and shrink together of all four, hanging down his head,
forsaking his meat, with quaking after his drink, and within three or four
days he will fall a coughing. The best remedy is to purge him, by some
glister, or by purging otherwise.

The foundering in the feet, the signs are, he will (within xii. or xxiiii.
hours after) crouch on his hinder legs, and Foundering in the feet.
his fore feet will be so stiff, that he is not able to move them, and go as
though he could not well tread on the ground, and ready always to stumble.
Then shall ye immediately garter each leg a handful above the the knee or
hough hard with a list. Then walk and chafe him to put him in a heat, and when
he is warm, let him blood on both the veins on the breast, and keep the
blood, and take a quart or two of that blood, with two quarts of wheat flower,
half a pound of bole armeniac, half so much of sanguis draconis, with five or
six eggs, and a pint or more of strong vinegar: then mix them well al
together, and chafe al his shoulders, back, loins, breast and fore legs
therewith, and then walk him on some hard ground, and let him not stand still:
and when all the gear is dry, ye shall chafe him with more, and renew it
again, and so walk him three or four hours after, and then set him in the
stable, and give him a little warm water mixed with some malt, and give him
some hay and provender, and then walk him again either within the house or
abroad if it be not to cold. And thus ye shall use him for four days, and
when all your ointment is spent, then cloth him warm and let him stand and lie
warm, and let him eat but little meat for iiii. days.

If he mend not then, it is a sign the humour is in his feet, then must ye
take of his shoes and search with your buttres and pare his soles before in the
midst of his toes, till the water and blood come forth, and so let him bleed
well thereat. Then stop it with hogs grease, salt, and bruised nettles, or with
turpentine, and hogs grease so melted together, and laid to with flax, and
some do but stop his feet with stamped nettles, salt, and hogs grease, but first
tack on his shoes, with a leather, and then stop him, and put under the shoe
a thin piece of stiff leather to keep in the stuff, and let him run to
grass, and then shift it once a week till he be whole. If ye let him run a
quarter, he will be the sounder. Also some say, if ye let him blood soon after
he is foundered above his hooves, that will help him from any further danger.
Another way. Others do cut the skin on the insides, or on the fountain of his
legs, the length of a finger, and filles a hollow straw with quicksiluer, and
make it fly abroad, and so let him remain till he be whole.

side of the foot, which will make him to halt, therefore he will covet to go
on his toes. They are small gravely stones coming under the shoo, betwixt the
foot and the calking of the shoo, or chrushes, and by long travail it will eat
into the quick. And whereas the shoe lies flat to the foot, there it will
soon gravel, and will not lightly forth again, and it is soon mended at the
first. The cure: ye shall pare the hoof, get forth al the gravel clean, for
if ye leave any gravel it will breed to a sorenes called aquitter bone, and
then must ye stop him with turpentine, and hogs grease melted together, and
laid on tow, or flax, then clap on the shoe, and keep it stopped, and shift it
every day till it be whole, and let him come in no wet. If ye stop it not well
to keep down the flesh, it will rise above the hoof, and then shall ye have
more business, and put your horse to more pain.

sides thereof, both behind and before, and by long beating and chafing one
foot against the other, he will beat of the skin, and make it to bleed, and
when sand goes in it will fret and chafe it, but he that is a skilful smith
may help it in shooing, if there be any help to be had, for by paring and
shooing he may help it. The cure. Take may butter if ye can, or else new fresh
butter, with a quantity of yellow rosin, as much naruoile, then fry them all
together in a pan, and then let it stand till it be cold, and put it in a pot,
and put to a little cow dung, and anoint therewith, and if ye bind it to, this
will heal the prick of a nail also.

by abundance of seed stopped, and so corrupts in the yard, some geldings are
troubled therewith as well as stond horses, specially those which have a string

shes with warm vinegar, and draw forth his yard and wash it also. Then ride
him into some water up to the belly, make him to swim if ye can in some river,
or ride him deep in water, and turn and toss him therein, that will lay the
heat of his yard. Use him thus once or twice a week, and he shall do well. Or
bath his cods and yard with the juice of housleek, and he shall do well Or wash
his cods with water that kineholme is sod in. If a horse be gald in the
pastorne with shakel or locke, or with some halter, if the place be fretted
sore, ye shall take honey and vardigrease, and boil it together till it wax
red, and therewith anoint the place: (it is very good also for algallings on
the wethers.) and after ye have so anointed it, straw thereon fine clipped flax
or tow, and make it stick the faster on. Use this once a day till it be whole.
Or ye may take that ointment before mentioned against enterfering, and it will
also heal it.

There will be horses and mares oftimes lowsy, which comes Lice on horses.

wherein many make small account thereof, because it may be soon cured, yet they
may soon die thereof. The lice will breed most commonly on the neck: If he

the tail, and sometimes over all the body, and they make him very poor, and
the skin will cleave to the ribs, and he will be always rubbing and froting,
in breaking all his mane and tail, so he will eat well, and his meat doth not
prosper him. The cure: ye shall anoint him with soap and quicksiluer mixed well
together, and to one pound of soap take half a dram of quicksiluer, or the
powder of priuet leaves mixed with oil, and therewithal to chafe him al over.

Some do use to wash the place with warm water, and then shave all the hair,
and race it with a razor, and make it to bleed. Then take cantaradice, and
euphorbium of each an ounce, and put thereto a quantity of soap, and lay it
on the sore, and let him rest in that place half an hour, then lead him to
the stable, and standing without litter, and use him as for the splint before
said. The next day dress him so again: on the third day begin to anoint him
with fresh butter the space of nine days, and make him a bath with three
handful of mallowes, a rose cake, and a handful of sage, boyle them all well
together, and put thereto a good piece of butter, or a pint of sallet oil, and
wash him therewith every day for three or four days and he shall do well.

of ale or white wine, and give it him warm: then rub and chafe him all over
with your hand half an hour space, then set him up warm, and litter him up
to the belly, and cover all his back with a wet sack, or such like, so gird
him and stuff him well about the back. Thuse use hima week space, and give
him warm water mixed with some ground malt. It were good also if ye did
annoynte all over his body with sallet oil, and wine, mixed warm, or with
butter and ale warmde, which is very good to loose and supple the skin.

soon cause him to halt, to try which nail it is, ye shall perceive by
holding the shoe with the pinsars, and strike on that side of the hoof with
the hammer against each nail, and the hoof will shrink whereas the pain is,
then take out that nail. But if he halt by and by after, then take of the
shoe, and open the hole till it bleed, and pour in scalding hot turpentine,
wax, and sheep suet melted together, and then clap on his shoe again, for
so it will little hurt him to travail thereon: but if it first rancle, then
must ye cut out the hole, and use the said medicine daily till it be whole, and
let him come in no wet. Some do but pour in daily of boiling butter into the
raneled hole, and heales it with that only, and other do burn the hole, by
and by with another nail, and that will help also.

The cords of some cold seruse, is a sinew that makes a horse to stumble, and
often tryppe, and ready to fall, and it is before on the further leg, nie the
horse body: and there are few horses but taste somewhat thereof. It is cured in
two places. One is, they slit the top of his nose, and there with a bucks horne
he takes up a gristle and winds it out iiii. fingers, and slits it in the
midst, and lets out blood, then he binds it in two places, three fingers
asonder, and cuts two inches of between, and knits those ends again
together, and then heales him with healing salve, and this shall help him.

Surbat is a disease in the foot, when the hoof is beat against the ground,
and a flat footed hoof being Surbating a horse.
tender is apt unto the grief: Sometime the shoe lying too flat, or the
horse being long vnshod, may soons Surbat: Ye shall perceive it, for he will
halt commonly on both his fore feet, and creep as though he could not go,
like the foundrined horse. The cure is easy. If his shoes be not fit make
them fit, and pare his hoof but little, and make them large and easy, and
hollow, and tack them on with four or five nails. Then shall ye stop his
feet, with bran, and hogs grease boylde together, and laid to hot, and
so with the same cover all his hoof al over, and bind it fast on with a cloth,
in shifting it once a day till it be whole, and give him warm water, and also
let him stand warm and dry likewise till he be whole and sound.

may wax blind by some stroke in the eye, but taken betimes there is remedies.
The cure. If the sight be gone, and the ball of the eye sound, ye shall take
a quantity of may butter, with a quantity of rosemarie, and a little yellow
rosin, with a quantity of Selandine, then stamp all together, and fry them
with the may butter: Then strain it and keep it in a close box, for it is a
jewel for the eyes that are sore, to have it always ready. And this is good

of sandeuer finelye made into his eye: Or blow thereof into his eye. And see
that your horse take no wind or cold of his eye, until he be whole again.
If ye must ride him soon after, put a cloth before his eye of woollen. It were
good to let him blood on the vain under the eye, and then twice dressing will
suffice.

A fistula is an ill sorenes to heal, and often times breeds through
gallings and chafing sores, which for lack of Bistula in horse.
looking to betime, it grows to a fistula. The cure. First search it well
with an instrument of lead, that may bow each way to the bottom of the
wound: then finding once the bottom: If ye can cut it out round to the
bootome with a razor, and take it out, and feel with your finger if there be
any flesh amiss, grystle, or bone perished: If there be, ye must cut it
out. Then mix the powder of verdigrease and honey together, and boyle them
till that it look red, and stir it still for burning to: And being luke
warm, dip a tent of flax therein, and tent him therewith, and lay a
bolster of flax thereupon: If that will not abide, lay on a plaster of
pitch, and sow it fast cross thereon, with a pack thread or other such
like, which ye may so tie it, that ye may remove and open it at all times,
and see that ye change your tent once a day till it leave mattering, and
always make your tent less and less till it be held up: and in the end
sprinkle a little vnslekt lyme thereon to close it up. But if this will not
heal to the bottom, to dry up the matter, ye must pour in some stronger
water, and so use it twyse a day till it be whole.

Another. Take two quarts of white wine vinegar, of camphere half an ounce,
of mercurie precipitate half an ounce, of green treacle iii. ounces; of red

broken. The cure: ye shall let him blood, and boyle that blood with wheat, and
with powder of dried bark of the pomgarnets, then strain it and give it him
to drink, three or four mornings, and let him not travel thereupon. And some
do but let him blood in the pallet or ruff of the mouth

his body will swell and much shake. The remedy is to run him till he sweat,
then straight way draw blood in the pallet of his mouth, and so much as he
bleeds, let him swallow it down hot.

If he bite of adder or snake, ye shall take a live cock and clean him in
the midst, and all hot clap it to the wound. Some take but a pigin, and
open her and clap it to, and thereupon give him drink made with a pint of
strong wine and some salt. Or take the root and leaves and fruit of brionie
burnt to ashes, and give unto the horse a good sponefull thereof in a pint of
good wine.

Also if the horse have eaten in his meat any hen or chicking dung, it will
cause him to have the bloudye flux, or the trenches, which is small worms, or
a crowling in his belly or guts. Therefore keep poultry out of your
stables, if ye love your horses.

Also puddle or dunghill water is vnholsome for a horse Water not good for

blood, and breed a plague. Therefore if ye can, let them drink little thereof.
And against the hen dung, and drinking such water, ye shall use to give them

anounce thereof in a pint of good wine, mixed with a little honeyed water. Then
walk him till his bellyswage, or till he make his dung.

labour: by hunger. And being hot, to drink cold water: Or sudden chafing
after long rest: which things breed the pestilence. It is a disease hard to
know: but when one dies, there will soon follow another. Then the best is to
seperate them. And to make them a drink of bayberies, myrre, aristolochia, and
gentian, with the shaving of ivory: of each alike, made in powder, and give to
each horse a spoonful thereof in a pint of wine, or ale. Use this as ye
shall see cause. Or ye may give them of Triacle in wine, or ground ivy in his
water and meat.

skin will be yellow. Yellows in a horse.
In a young horse it is soon had, by taking of cold after a heate. Or it may
come by stopping of the bladder, or gall: or his liver inflamed. And likewise a
horse gets the black iaundise, if black choler abound in his body. And
then he will not lye but stand.

The cure. Ye shall minister unto him a glister, and rake him, and let him
blood on both sides of the neck, and of the nose. Some do take saffron, and
turmericke and mix them with milk, and gives it warm. But first let him
blood on the nose, or in the roof of the mouth. And then put of the juice of
selandine into his ear, and bind it fast and in twelve hours after, then
ride him a little, and then keep him warm for two or three days after, and
let him have white water warm, and this disease doth often breed the
staggers.

The Staggers is an ill sorenes to heal: It will make the horse to hold down
his head: And also he will reel to and fro, and forsake his meat, and this
proceeds of the yellows, and of a corrupt humour in the brain. His sight
will be dim, and he will be heavy in going.

together, and dip a tent of flax therein, and tent it therewith, and use
this once a day till it be whole, and make the like issue on his poll behind,
and give him warm mash, and walk him softly once a day.

ears, and so bind it fast, and so let him remain and he shall mend.

Another. Put a little of white salt into his ear, and then put in after a
sponefull or two of fair water, and then knit fast his ear that he cannot
cast it out. This is a used medicine for this disease, and a most certain
help.

If any horse chance to be gored with a stake or otherwise, ye shall take
and cast him, and open the wound as much as ye may. Then take fresh butter,
and boyle it over the fire, and boylyng hot pour thereof into the wound, and
make it run to the bottom of the wound if ye can, and let him so lye, that
it may go to the bottom. And then let him rest till the next morning, and
use him so once a day, till he be whole. For this will heal him without any
other thing.

To cast a horse or other beast, ye shall bind first his head with a strong

and rub the teeth and gummes therewith, and they will mend. The fever is
helped by letting blood on the middle vain on his thigh, four fingers under
his tuell, or else take the vain in the neck, and for his drink ye may mix
the juice of purselaue, gum dragant, frankincense in powder, with a few

Also for the shooyng of a Horse, me thinks it is connenient Shoing of horse.
that the husbandman should understand somewhat thereof, although in many
places, they do know better than some Smiths. For in most places of Englande
the Smiths have small skill thereof, but after a common sort: howe to shoe
every Horse as he ought to be, they know not. Which knowledge doth consist
in diverse points, as in good stuff, in making fit, shoes for ouerye horse
foot, in driving the nails right, and also the making thereof in paring, and
leaving the hoof where it ought to be, always having respect thereunto. For
there is as great a respect unto the paring, as in the shooing, because of
the diversity of hooves, for some be round, some long, some short, some
smooth, some rough, some tender, some tough, tome flat, and some hollow: and
broad hooves commonly have narrow heals, which will be soon weak to
travel, or to carry his shoe long: and in going lowe on his pastornes, he
is apt to surbat and gravel. The rugged horse is not so much apt to surbat
or gravel, but it is a sign of intemperate heate, and drought, which makes
the hooves brittle. A long hoof commonly treads on the heals and pastornes,
which breeds wyndegalles. A broad crooked hoof without, and narrow within,
it makes him splayfooted, and treads more inward than outward: going with his
joints close together, makes him to enterfeere, and so become same. A broad
foot inward, and narrow outward is not so hurtful, but on the outside he
will soon gravel. A flat hoof not hollow within, is like to a vnperfecte
hoof. A hollow hoof will wax soon dry, and that causes hoof bound. And
the straight, upright, and narrow hoof, will wax soon dry: except he be
stopped, will soon be hoof bound: which will cause him to be so lame, that
he cannot tread sure. And whereas the frushes are broad, the heals are
commonly weak and soft, so that ye may easily crushe them together, and
those horses will never tread well on stones, or harde ground. And also where
the heals are narrow, they are commonly tender and hoof bound.

The hoof ought to be pared even, that the shoe may fit close and just

more higher than another. And because the weight of the body before lies most
on the heals. Therefore to favour them, take as little as ye may, but the
toes being thick and harde, may be taken the thinner, and the paring of the
hinder foot, is clean contrary to the fore feet: as before is showed in
driving the nails, saying: before behind, behind before, which is, beware
the two hindmost natles on the fore feet, and the two foremost nails on
the hinder feet.

In shooing the fore feet, make your shoes, with a broad web, and with
thick spoonges, meet in all places, Shoyng the fore feet.
somewhat appearing on the outside of the shoe: And when ye nail or set on
the shoe, spare not from the midst foreward, but beware backward towards
the heals, and ye shall pearce the heales wider on the outside of the shoe,
then on the inside, and more distant from the toe, then the quarters, because
the hoof is more thicker foreward then backward, and more hold to be taken,
the nails would be made stiff with square heads, and with sharpe points,
and meet at the head to fill the holes of the shoes, standing a straw breadth
without the shoe, and so will he stand most sure without shaking, and also
will last longer. But that order most Smiths do little regard, but to
dispatch and away, and when they pearce a shoe, they commonly make the inside
as broad as the outside, and their nails are made with such great
shoulders, they cannot sit well thereon, nor enter close into the hoales,
a^ayle well made should have no shoulder at al, but still lesser and lesser
toward the point. For otherwise he will stand so high, and the neck thereof
being weak, soon doth break, or else bend at every light stroke, as I have oft
seen the trial, and the shoe thereby soon lost.

The nails also would be made flatter on the one side Nails to be made.

when ye drive, strike softly first with a light hammer, till it be well
entered. Some do grease the points (for a tender hoof,) to go more easter,
and first ye shall drive the two hoof or side nails of each side one, then
look if the shoe stand right or not, with the spoonges right on the sides. If
not, mend it, and drive your other nails, and set down then his foot, to
see if they be all fit and well placed, and the horse to tread even thereon.
If not, take up his other foot to make him stand more stiffer thereon, and
with your hammer strike where the shoe is scantest, to make it yield that
way. Then drive al the rest of your nails, so that the points on the hoof
may come out even and just, not out of order like the teeth of a saw, and ye
shall clinche, so as the points mayebe hid in the hoof. Some do cut the
hoof a little beneath the nails, and so do clinche. Then shall ye pare and
rape the hoof round, so that it may be even round with the shoe, which
some supposes to be best.

By paring the broad hoof, not yet fully grown flat, it may be helped by

To pare the rough and brittle hoof, he is commonly weaker on the outside,

that is, because they are commonly hoater than others, and their hooves may
be somewhat more opened, to be the more easier stopped with Cow doung, or to

would be wrapped and made smooth, and often to be stopped or anointed with

hath commonly a weak and slender leg. But a short hoof hath commonly a
strong leg, and the long hoof having a weak leg, is forced most to tread
on the heel, and on the pastorne. Ye shall pare the rest like the perfect
hoof, and ye shall shoe him as round as ye canne at the toe, whereby the
breadth may take up the length. If his hoof be narrow, let his shoe bear
somewhat without the sides, in making the heals deeper for eight nailes, and
set the shoe backward enough, because he treads much on the heel, and it
will be the better.

make his shoe strong with a broad web, not piercing the hoales, till ye
have made it fit for his foot, and then make them as ye shall see cause,

Also it have been often seen by negligent and unskilful Smythes, by paring
and shooing, many horses oftentimes have taken hurt. Also by the unskilful and
negligent keepers, for want of rubbing their legs, and stopping their fore
feet: for the hinder feet are commonly kept moist by means of dunglying at
their heals, and wet by their pissing thereon. Whereas the fore feet stand
commonly dry, which makes them to be hoof bound, and brittle hooued.
Therefore a good keeper will see to stop them from time to time with cow

to anoint therewith at all times convenient: and this will make the hoof
tough and strong, and keep them from being hoof bound or brittle hooued. Thus
much have I briefly touched as concerning the paring shooing of horses, with

mare have take the horse and is knit within her, if then another horse do
cover her, he burns her, and she will dye thereof. Also it is not so good for
mares to be covered after the change, for those coltes commonly will be neshe,
and tender, and soon take surfeits, and likewise those mares that are covered
after the full. Also mark in the wane, in what time the mare was covered,
about the same time of the moon she will foal.

to give them in the winter oftentimes chafe. Of all kinds of chafe the
wheat chafe is the best, and most hartiest: but all other chafe mixed
together, as rye, wheat, barley, oats and peas, being well cleansed and given
with dried beans or peas is good. But before ye mix your beans or peas
therewith, ye must sift out all the dust clean from your chafe. Or else it
will breed in your horse, the stopping of the reins and bladder, and also the
cough, il blood to increase.

Of stabling a Horse from grass.
WHen ye take him up from grass in winter, ye shall stable him on a dry day,
and see that he be dry taken up into the house. For if he be wet taken up, (as
some horse masters say) it will make him scabby, and breed him full of lice.
Also if your horse be still fed, and standing in the stable without now and
then riding, or stirde once or twice a week abroad a mile or two, if he be not
thus used, he well wax purcie, and be in danger of perishing his wind. Therefore
to use to ride him a little, it shall be best once a week at least.

The properties of a fair Horse.
To choose a good horse and a fair, he ought to be of a good colour, having a
short hair, a small lean head, with a broad forehead. Also with a merry look,
and wild of countenance, a stout heart, and hardy withal, a small mouth, and
long rainde, with a white in the forehead, and wide betwixt the jaws; with
open nostrils, a round chin, stiff and small prick ears, great eyes, broad
breasted, low brawnde, broad ribde, with round sides, thin crested, straight
backed, with two good fillets, a short rump, fat broad buttocks, with four
good and sound legs standing up right one against the other, small knees,
little round coddes, thin legs short and black, and round footed hollow and
rough, with a short pastorne, a white foot, and great sinews, a stiff dock,
with a long tail, a short trot, well pased, easy to leap on, still chewing
on the bit, soon stirred, swift of foot, to turn on a little ground, and
durable in iournying, these are the chiefest properties in a good and a fair
horse.

Also there be colours of horse which are esteemed one above Colour of horse of
best proof.
another, to travail. The best colour is counted the browne bay with a gold
mouth, and also under his flancks up to his navel of the same colour. Having
rivaled lips, which is a sign of fierceness, and likewise to have for his
beauty, a white in his forehead, or a white feather on his nose, either else a
white foot behind, with a small head, short ears, wide nostrils, great eyes,
broad forehead, long rainde, and thin mane, and the mane hang over the right
side, large breasted, side brawnde, lean and small knees, lathe legged, great
sinews, short pastorne, deep ribbed, short loins, broad hollow footed, with a
swift large pace, small coddes, and standing upright, and open of al four
legs, one against another, and of sight to be sound. And these are counted
the chiefest properties of a good and fair horse.

Sad Sorrel.
ANd next him is the sad Sorrel with a flexen mane, and a flexen tail, having
a wall eye on the farther side, with a black hoof, for then is he like to be
good.

Dapple gray.
NExt him is the dapple gray, with dark dapple spots on his limbs, and
having a hairy neck, with a thin tail, and to have on the one side of his
neck or both, hairy feathers like unto crowns, Then is he like also to be
good to travel.

Fleabitten Horse.
ANd next unto him is the ^leabitten, with a thin crest, having black eine,
black hooves, with the like properties unto the Horse, for then is he like to
labour and also dure long time.

Dunne Horse.
NExt unto him is the Dunne with a black list on the back, and also to have
a thin black mane, and a black tail, and a thick hair, having also rough
coddes and hairy, with other like properties of the browne bay, then is he
like for to do well.

The white Horse.
NExt him is the white Horse, for he commonly is of long life, but he hath a
nise and tender body, and also dangerous to keep: for if he be not well
cherished and clean kept, he will soon alter and decay, yet having the like
properties of the first Horse, he will then labour well and truly.

The mouse dunne.
ANd next unto him is the Mouse dunne, if he have a meal mouth, and rough
coddes, with a thin mane, having the like properties of the first Horse, so is
he then like for to do well.

The black Horse.
THe black Horse is next unto him, with a white in the forehead, or a white
feather on his nose, or else the further foot white behind, then is he likely
to do well.

The cole black Horse.
NExt unto him is the cole black having no white spot on him, which Horse (as
some horse masters say) is perilous to keep: for if he continue long with a
man, it is marvel if he drown him not, or hurt him by some other way, or else
the Horse to come to small profit.

The iron gray Horse
NExt him is the iron gray, which is counted the worst colour, for the iron
gray Horses are commonly faint to labour, and il at al assays, for although he
be fair of body, he may in no wise away with any great labour. As for other
colours skewde or spotted Horse, some chance to be good and some bad, wherefore
there is no certainty in them, but if the sire be good, the other may follow.
Thus much is spoken to be marked of the colour of Horses. Also if ye put a
white Horse to cover a coloured Mare, she shall have commonly a Colt of a
sandy colour, like an iron gray, neither like the sire nor yet the dambe: yet
many Mares will have a Colt like the Horse that gat it.

A Horse without wartes.
THere be some Horse that have no wartes, which is counted a great fault, and
yet that is no manner of soreness, hurt, or disease. But if a Horse want his
wartes on his hinder legs beneath the spauin place, if he then be wild, he
is no chapmans ware, but if he be well broken and tame, and have been ridden
before. Then a saying is, beware the buier: for he hath his eyes to see, his
hands to feel. There is a saying among husband men, for when that horse have
lived so many years, as the Moon was days old, when he was foalde, he shall
suddenly die.

A Horse forspoken a disease.
WHen as your horse eyes doth water, and that he do therewith begin to morn,
it is called of some husbands, forspoken. The remedy is, ye shall take a latin
nawle, or bodkin, and dash it through both his nostrils above, between the
gristle and the bone of his nose, and there will come forth plenty of il water
and blood, which there have been coniealed: when this is done, ye shall stop
both his ears for a day and a night with black wool. So done, then vnstop it
again, and let him blood on both his sides, and also on both the veins under
his ears, and so he shall amend and do well again.

The usual places to let blood.
THe chief places for letting blood are these, the two veins under his eyes,
and the veins between his nostrils, and the gristles of his nose. Also the
veins in the mouth and under the tongue: the two veins of both sides of the
neck which to be launst a handful from the head. And likewise on the shalke
veins. Also the two great vains on the sides, and the two branched veins that
leads from the coddes. And again, the two veins under his tail, these are
the chief and common places which do serve for to let blood against most
diseases. And this I think here shall be sufficient for letting of blood.

Against the Glanders.
THere comes oftentimes unto young horse of four or five years old (by
catching cold after his labour) a kind of glanders, and it will on a sudden
raise aswelling under his jaws and on his jaw bone, which swelling at the
first will beverie harde, without great heate: and there will remain and breed
to some other sore, if ye help it not. The cure. Ye shall take hogs grease,
and make it very hot, and so all hot ye shall rub and chafe the sore and hard
place therewith, twice or thrice a day, use it, and that will mollify it, and
at length it will so break and run, and so heal again.

To heal the mangy on a Horse.
YE shall take of lamp oil, the fine powder of brimstone, of black soap, of
tar, of barrow hogs grease, and the soot of a chimney, of each a like. And
then mix them all well together, and boyle them together, and then anoint the
place therewith as hot as he may suffer it, and use this, and it will help.

Against the mourning of the Chine.
TAke a peck, or half of oats, and boyle them in running water till half the
liquor be consumed: and then put them into a bag, and lay them all hot
upon the navel place on his back, and there let it lye thirty hours, and so
dress him therewith three or four times, and ye shall see experience.

For a Horse that is hide bound.
WHen a horse is hide bound, ye shall perceive it by plucking up his skin on
his sides. If his skin be lose, he is not hide bound, but if it stick
close to his sides or ribs, so that ye can scant take hold thereof, then he
is hide bound, which is commonly gotten in winter by lying wet, and having
small store of meat, which makes him very faint. The remedies are, ye shall
let him blood a little, and then give him warm mafhes morning and evening. And
white water, which is water and malt Mixed together, or bran. And give him
also sod wheat, mixed with bran or sod barley. Use this as ye shall see
cause, and he shall do well.

To plump or puff up a lean Horse, in short time.
THe best means to puff up a lean horse is, to see the barley in water till
it be soft like firmitie, and thick withal, or to see the wheat likewise.
And give him thereof always before his watering, not after: for then it will do
him no good. For this the husband man saith, all dry provender or corn after
watering to be given, and all sod corn before watering, specially barley, and
wheat being sod.

Against any galling or fretting through the skin of a Horse.
IF your horse chance to be fretted with halter or other corde, clean
through the skin, ye shall take but vinegar and soap, and heate them well
together, and stir it with a stick or cloth, and then all to rub and wash
the said fretting or galling therewith: use this twice or thrice a day, and it
will dry it up within two or three days, and it will heal again. For this is
the husband men's common medicine, and well proved. If there be galling on the
neck, ye shall stamp the leaves of bryony, (called the hedge vine,) and mix
it with wine, and plaster it too, and it will help.

How to take out the haw in the Horse eye.
THe haw breadth commonly (as cunning horse Leches say), by rankenesse of blood,
and gross fleam, which by heates doth breed unto a harde white gristle: in
the forecorner of the horse eye, which will at lengh, make him to lose his
sight, if it be not soon remedied. The cure.

The surest and best way to take forth the haw, and not perishing the horse
eye, is this. First, (for the more safety, tramell his legs on the one side.
Then put a pair of barnacles on his nose, and another on his farthest ear,
and so let one hold them fast. Then the master doth put a needle with a
double thread through the top of his ear, on the same side the haw is. And
then from thence, he puts the needle through the edge of his eye lid, on
the midst thereof, and so draw up the lid towards the said ear, and then
fastens the thread and cuts it off. Then knits his thread again, and says
to his man hold fast, (for fear of starting of the horse{is}, the needle head
may put out his eye.) Therefore to work sure is best. Then the master waits
when the horse turns his eye, and when the said haw is most seen, then he
catches hold thereof with his fore finger and thombe, and plucks it forth a
little: and puts his needle through the outer end of the gristle, and so draws
it farther out by the threades end: and then wrappes the rest of the said
thread about his little finger of the same hand, he puts out the inner side
of the gristle which is towards the horse eye, and with a very sharpe knife,
he cuts cross the gristle, and eases finely away the skin and fat
thereof, on the said haw. And also round about it, which is called the wash
of the eye: for if that be cut away, the horse will be blear eide.
Therefore ye must leave all the skin and fat about the said gristle, and
take away but the tip, or out end thereof with the said gristle or haw,)
which the thread hath hold of: but take not too much hold with your needle
and thread. Then being taken forth, cut off your thread that holds his eye
lid, and pick out the ends thereof out of his eye lid and ear, else they
will afterward trouble him, and also pluck away al the long hairs about his
eyes. Then soon after, as the horse eye do gather to some blood and matter:
ye shall take your mouth full of beer, ale, or wine, (and open his eye) and
spirt therein once or twice together, and with the side of your hand strike
down the blood and matter out of his eye. Use him thus three or four times,
until his eye wax clear, and so it is done, ye may give him what meat ye will
after.

For the Trenches and long Worms.
TO kill the trench worm, or long worms, ye shall take the powder of worm
seed finely searst, two spoonefulles, and put it in a pint of malmeste, and
mix it well together, and let it stand to soak all a night, and give it your
horse in the morning, and keep him without meat and drink four hours after,
and he shall do well.

Tongue of Horse to look to.
YOu that use to keep horse, must take often their toongs forth, and see if
there be any thing breeding under his tongue, for a husk of horne, or seed of
haie, which will trouble him, and soon breed to a blaine or other soreness
under the root of his tongue.

Horse eyes often looked unto.
YOu that keep horse, must often look unto their eyes, for commonly when a
horse eye do shine and look with a fiery eye, or fiery colour, he hath
something that troubles that eye. Also let all beware of putting the powder of
burnt salt, or the powder of ginger, into the horse eye, for those (at length)
will make him blind, because they burn.

To kill the maungie on a Horse.
YE shall take of quick silver a quantity, and kill it in oil of bays, mi^ it

quantity of salt, and wormeseede beaten, and then open the horse mouth take
forth his tongue, and put those balls one after another into his throat, and
make him to swallow them: then give him after them a pint of stale ale warm,
then walk him a while after, and he shall do well, or give him of a tanners
fat.

To heal a sore and a galde back, and also to heal the dead flesh.
TAke a handful of Bay salt, a handful of great and small Oatmeal, and put a
quantity of stale thereto, and stir them altogether, and temper it like
pap or paste, and then make round balls thereof: then throw in a hot cole of
fire, and make them red hot, and then cool them, and beat them to a fine
powder, and then straw of that powder all over thereon, so oft as ye shall see
it bare, or shall have any other cause, and this will heal it.

and so give it to the horse. Then chafe him a while after and set him up warm,
and he shall do well again.

him with your fingers under his jaws, ye shall feel as it were a hard roll of
flesh like a gristle. If that come up or nigh to the root of his ears, the it

made in fine powder, three penieworth of quicksiluer well killed with fresh
grease, two peniworth of verdegreace, a quarter or less of a pint of grease,
stir all these together in a vessel, till the grease and other things be
molten with labour, and without fire, and therewith anoint the mangy sore,
but first let him blood, then after two days, wash it with the water that
young broom or At semanacke herb hath been well sod in, and smally chopped,
and mixed with a little powder of soot, and let those sees well together, and

porkes grease, and put to of linseede meal, and plaster wife lay it to,
against the impostume of a cold cause, sees white mints in wine and oil, or
ale and butter, so lay it too. This will destroy and wast a hard impostume.

on, this will waste it also. Again, against a hot impostume, stamp
liuerwort, and mix it with the grounds of ale, it will help, or bruised with
mallowes at ye beginning, mixed with hogs grease, and all hot laid to, will
ripe an impostume, or the grouds of ale or beer, boiled with mallowes, bath it
therewith hot, and plaisterwise lay it on the swelled place, and it will
disperse and waste it away in 2. or 3. days. Also bawme stamped and mixed with
hogs grease, so plaistred, will ripe disperse any cold impostumatio. Against
a hot rising or swelling, bruise of lettise seed, or Popie seed, and mix it
with oil of ree roses, so plaster it on, which will help if it be taken
betimes. Thus much for swollen places and impostumes.

together, and clap it somewhat warm on the place or joint: then take of floxe
and put upon it, for that will clean too and defend it, and this will ripe it
and cause it to run, if any thing will dee it, for there is not found a
better way to help a swollen joint.

Against stiffenesse of sinews and joints.
Sees black soap a pound in a quart of strong ale, till it wax thick, like
tar, then reserve it and when ye shall see cause, use to anoint the sinews
joints therewith, and it will supple them, and bring them again although they be

For a horse that hath a canker in his mouth or throat.
A Horse that hath a canker, or is venomed in his throat and mouth, he cannot
swallow his meat, but it will lie in his jaws on both ^es his mouth, and oft
when he have chewed haie, he will put it out again, and his breath will savor
very strongly before meat, and having this grief he will never prosper, but
pine away at length. The cure. Ye shall cast him, and open his mouth with a pin
of wood, then take a crooked kiffe iron, wrapped with tow on the end, therewith
rake out al the stinking grass or other meat that lies in his jaws, and
under the root of his tongue. So cleansed clean all about, ye shall heat
strong wine vinegar somewhat warm, and wrap your irons end with tow, and
dip it in the vinegar, then al to chafe his jaws on both sides a good while,
and also the roots of his tongue, when ye have so chaft him well. wash his
tongue therewith and so let him rise, because his mouth will be sore for a
week after, ye must give him mashes, and grains hot, or such soft meat, but
no hay, and he will do well again, god willing.

Foundering of a strait shoe.
IF ye let fore shoes remain above a month, if ye so journey him, ye may
founder him, which ye shall perceive in tauell by the way, for he will often
trip on those feet or that foot which is most grief unto him, therefore
remove them betimes, or else he will founder and halt down right: then the
shoe must be removed and let blood in the tooe, and some do stop it with
bruised sage, so set on the shoe again, and let him so rest for iii. or iiii.
days or ye can ride him, the may ye ride him softly and he will do will.

A proverb among husbandmen for the breed of a colt.

If he have three white feet, put him soon away.
If he have two white feet, lend him to thy friend.
If he have one white foot, keep him to his lives end.
To make a horse to scour.
Give him one ounce of the powder of brimstone, finely beaten in a mash, with
some powder of spurge.

Against worms in the coddes.
SOme horse will have worms in their coddes, and when they do abound, if he
be not remedied, he will dye of them. And these are the signs: he will
scratch his belly with his feet, and his hair will stare there, and wax more
grayer then before. If ye help him not before they pearce his belly and guts,
he shall hardly escape. They are bred by evil meat, and fault of drinking
good water. The cure. Ye shall cast into his mouth fasting, the guts of a young
pullet, and make him to swallow it down in holding up his head: do this
three mornings, and let him not eat nor drink of v. hours after very
little. Also some do use to bruise french broom, and give it among good
provender, and salt water to drink. Others do also give the horse of green
branches of willow, or Sallow, or reeds, and in digestion of his meat he
shall cast out those worms.

To help sinews troubled with humours.
BOyle the meal of lineseed and honey in like portion together, with some white
wine, and make thick as a plaster and so put it on: and ye shall see it come
to good proof.

Against shot impoysoned
WHen a horse is hurt by some poisoned iron, or shot, take the sweat of an
other horse, with tosted or burnt bread, mix them together with men's urine,
and make the horse to swallow it down, and put grease of a hog into the wound
with the like mixture, and he shall mend.

Falling of hair in a horse tail.
THe falling of hair commonly is when he hath to much blood, or when he
travels to much on the way, or is beaten on the tail, whereof comes
sometimes scabs with shedding his hair. The cure. If this hap in the
tail, ye shall race the out part unto the midst of the fourth bone or joint
of the tail, and take forth that bone called of some bariuole, which ye shall
take out clean, and betwixt the senture and the body be coctures or strings
some what deep, which ye shall softly touch with a hot iron, and a little
salt, and in each fent ye shall gently put a broach of wood, which must
remaiue ix. days, if they fall not away of themselves.

The canker in the tail of a horse.
THere comes a disease in the tail of a horse, called (in french) Langie: and
will eat the flesh of his tail in manner of a canker, so that the hair will
fall away, for the bones are corrupt. If yet see not unto it betimes, all the
tail will corrupt. The cure. Make a head bolster of cloth very strong for
it, and wet it in vinegar within and without, and so bind it fast on the
sore, and always when it waxes dry, ye must wet it again.

Do this twice or thrice a day, if it be done oftener, it is the better. So
shall ye continue for three or four days, and then ye must heal it as ye
heal a green wound.

For a horse evil disposed and very heavy in travail.
YE shall cut the skin between the fore legs, and then make a ring of a
vine branch, and put it into the cut place betwixt the skin and the flesh,
(like a rowell) and then he shall travel surely again.

For a horse that is to fat to make him lean.
TO make your horse lean, that is very fat, ye shall give him bran mixed
with honey and warm water, and so it shall abate his fatness without travel.

To know the differences betwne a horse bewitched and other soreness.
YE shall mark this in a horse (as in other cattle) that when they be sick
or diseased naturally, the grief will often times alter again by little and
little, and so to mend. Or else it will increase by leisure, and not to come so
vehemently, as when he is bewitched. For the farcie in a horse will rise in
knobs and bunches, and will so continue a long time or they break out. And yet
the horse (so infected) will eat daily his meat: But if he be bewitched he
will eat no meat, because he is so inflamed with such poison in his body, so
that within xii. hours many die, or like to die. Some are stricken with
knobs and bunches rising in their bodies, with lamenes of linunes. Some with
running at their nostrils matter and phlegm. Some their eiesswelling and
hanging out of their head: with phlegm and matter roping and running. Some
suddenly fall and so die. Some run about in fields as they were mad, and
drown themselves in pits and ponds of water, with diverse other infinite ways
they use in bewitching men's cattle, which here I will pass over. But when ye
shall doubt of any such thing: the best is to seek remedy betimes: or the
poison go through his body. For if it tarry any space, it will be past remedy.

Sinews and nerfes broken or bruised.
IF Sinews or nerfes be broken or bruised, or hurt by some sore or otherwise,
ye shall lay thereon the flesh of a tortue, well mixed and beaten, with the
powder of mullen herb. But if the nerfes and sinews be bruised and hurt
within, ye shall then burn it round like a circle with a hot iron in xii.
small circles or less, and so he will mend again.

An ointment to repair the flesh in a Wound.
TO repair and to heal flesh in a wound, ye shall make this ointment. Take
wormwood, pimpernell, callamint or ^ep, of bawme, and wax, of each a
quantity, beat them all together well, and then boil it over the fire until
it be mixed well all together: then couch or steep a piece of linen therein,
and lay it on the sore. This ointment heals marvelous well, and repairs
the flesh again.

To heal the canker on a horse.
TAke the juice of daffadill roots vii drams, the juice of hounds tongue a
like, of vnfleckt lyme iiii, drams, of arsenit powder ii. drams, beat all these
well together, and put them in a new clean vessel of earth close covered, then
boil it till it be all resolved: first wash the canker wound with strong
vinegar warm. Then fill the canker wound twice a day with the said compound,
till it be kilde, and fall away.

Against tyring of a horse on the way.
IF your horse chance to tyer on the way, if spur, and wand will not profit,
ye shall put three or four round pebble stones into one of his ears, and so
knit fast his ear that the stones fall not out, and they will so rattle within
his ear, that he will then go faster if he have any sprite or power. Some do
thrust a bodkin through the midst of the flap of his ear, and put therein a
pin of wood, and ever when he flackes his pace, the rider will strike on that
ear with his wand, and so he will mend his pace thereby.

Also if your horse in travail do wax dull on the way, ye shall siice a
piece of fresh beef, and bind it about his bit, and thereon he will che^ on
the way, whereby he will continue and travel well after.

To help the found ring of a horse
IF your horse be hot riding on the way, and you riding through a shallow
water, letting your horse stay to take but a sip of water, it will founder
him. Ye shall perceive it, for he will often trip under you within a quarter of a
mile riding. The remedy. Ye shall let him blood as soon as ye can, on the to
vain under of all four feet, ye may stop the blood with bolearmeniac, or but
pinch it with your thumb and finger, both parts of the vain, the upper and the
nether together, and that will stanch them, so you may ride your horse again on
the morrow as safe as before. Well proved. But if he be foundered by heat of
travel in hot sandy way, and not soon remedied, it will be long to heal: And
perhaps ascend to the joint of the feather locke, and shrink the sinew, which
will cause him to halt and trip. The remedy: take the roots of nettles, and
hemlock, with elder pills, of each a handful, boil them tender in bores grease,
or fresh barrowes grease, so let him blood in the midst of his foot on the to
vain, then bath chafe his joint and leg therewithal about from his knee to the
fetherlock, and then clap it to, bind a cloth fast to, as hot as ye can, so use
this once a day, till he be well, and this will help: well proved. And anonint his
legs with suppling oils.

For wolves teeth in some horse.
Also some horses have wolves teeth on the upper jaws, that horse cannot grind
well his meat, because the flesh will thrust between, when he would griud, which
will let him greatly for feeding. Which teeth some defile the smooth with a
rape, and so after they will wear smooth, in doing this they do use to cast the
horse.

But if a horse do over reach his nether grinders with his upper, which ye mine
feelle perceive by sight, or by feeling; for his upper teeth will lie over the
nether like a bunch on his cheeks, and that horse cannot eat haie, or hardly
eat any rough meat, but it will lie in lumps in his cheeks, and under his
tongue, which grief is gotten (as some judge) by feding in watery and mamish
groandes in winter, thereon comes looseness of feeth, and when a horse is so,
there is no help or remedy that I can learn but this cast him, and prick
his gums, and so let them blood, then rub them with sage, salt, and so they will
^ast again: so use it viii. or x. days after. For the more surer, but to feed
him with provender is best, as with bread, and grains, bran, ground malt, and
such, which will be costly to keep: but so he will labour and serve a long time
well. In summer ye may put him to grass, and so he will do well. Thus much for
wolves teeth in some horse, and over reaching teeth, and also for loose teeth
in a horse.

Against the blood, or pleurisy of blood.
THe disease of the blood is, some young horses will feed, and being fat, will
increase blood, and so grow to a pleurisy, and some die thereof, if he have not
soon help, he will sometimes stand and eat no meat, his eyes will seem
red, his head and body hot, and he will look heavily, and suddenly in eating he
will fall and die. The remedy is, ye shall let him blood on the liver vain, and
so he shall do well again.

For a horse that is swollen with much wind in his body.
SOme horse with eating certain windy meat or such herbs, will be so swoln
therewith as the his belly would burst, then he will eat no meat, but stand
hang down his head, ready to fall, and so die, if he have not speedy help.

When ye shall see any horse so, the next remedy as I can learn i^ye shall take
a sharpe pointed knife, or bodkin, and arm it so with some stay, that it go
not to deep, for piercing his guts. Then strike him therewith through the skin
into the body, before the hollow place of his haunch bone, half a foot
beneath the back bone, and the wind will come out thereat. Then if ye put a
hollow evil therein, (or some father to keep it open a while,) the wind will
void the better and so heal again. When a horse is so, some do rake him, and
some do ride him, to make him break and void wind: but this hath been proved
the best remedy to save your horse or ox.

Against loose teeth in a horse.
A Horse being grieved with looseness of teeth, he cannot eat but will fumble,
and slaver his meat in his mouth, and may not swallow it down, but chew it and
solye in lumps (for the most part) on both sides his jaws: The most meat he
can swallow is grass, and provender. This disease is gotten by feeding in wet
pastures and wet grounds in winter, and thereby his gums will shrink from his
teeth, and so they will be loose and seem long.

For some horse which hath been howsed in winter, will soon take this griefs,
as the red sorrel, as soon as any other. The remedy. Ye shall let him blood on
the vain under the tail ny the rump, and then rub his gums with sage, tide
on a sticks end. Also ye shall give him for a while, the tender crops of
black briars with his provender, and so he shall do well again.

For worms in the maw.
IF worms be in the maw of a horse. Take great worms and cleanse them, and
shells of eggs, beat these both togesmall with a hammer, and put to a quauite,
and pepper, and so mix them all together, and being warm, put it down the
horse throat.

For proud flesh in a wound.
FIrst ye shall wash the wound with wine, wherein is sob nettle seed Then
straw thereon a little of the ^ine powder of verdigrease: and this will take it
away. Use this as ye see cause.

To make a horse to scour or laxative.
YE shall give him among his provender one ounce of brimstone beaten to small
powder, and this will makes him to scour. Also some give a rye shefe, some make
a drink with polypodium and spurge sod in ale, and the roots of the water
flag stamped, and boil them in ale, and strain it, and milk warm give it,
a pint thereof to each horse, fasting, and keep him warm after.

Another way to heal the mange in a horse.
LEt him blood on both sides the neck, if he be a young horse. Then cut the
skin down the midst of his forehead two fingers broad, or long down right,
then open the skin an inch wide on both sides the cut, and put therein thin
slices of the green root of Ellecampane, or Angelica, which is better. So let
them remain under the skin till the matter rot, then crush it forth in two or
three days, and in xii. days the roots will fall as it heals, and this
will help: but ye must anoint the mange with brimstone in fine powder, with
verdigrease, oil olive, het and mixed all together.

A perfect and proved way to heal the farcy or fashion in a horse.
TAke iii. ounces of quicksiluer, half a pound of hogs grease of verdigrease
an ounce, ye shall first kill your quicksiluer in a bladder, with a spoon full
or two of the juice of an orange, or a limon, in rubbing and chafing them in
the bladder till the quicksiluer be clean killed. Then put your hogs grease in a
mortar, or dish, with your verdigrease, so beat them well together. Then put to
your quicksiluer, and beat the al well together, and so keep it, and when your
horse hath the fashion or farcy, in rising on the veins like knobs and
bunches, then anoint them round, and all over those knots or bunches. Use this
once a day, or as ye shall see cause, for they will go no further, but grow to a
matter, and when ye shall feel them soft, lance them, and the matter will run
out, and so day by and heal again. Also in the nointing him, ye shall put
into each of his ears one good sponefull of the juice of ragwart, some call it
slylote, a weed growing in field: and this will help him in few days.

Against the swelling under a horse jaws.
FOr the swelling under or between the horse jaws: take his own dung hot as
soon as he makes it, and with a cloth bind it fast thereto. Use this twice a
day, and it will be (...) (...) husband ^mixe there with hot boiling peace of
men, and so ^ay it to: and it helps.

To heal a horse hurt with harrowtines or such like, on the legs or other
parts.
YE shall first wash the wounds with mans brin, and sall, then take the soft
down of the stalks of herb benedictus, called the holy thistle, and therewith
fill the wounds or holes, and so let them remain, and ye shall need no other
medicine. For that will heal it alone only without changing. Well proved.

To make a horse stale.
Mix wine and oil together, and rub and chafe it on his loins, or put a
louse into his yard, or put soap in his yard, if these help not, squirt of
honied water sod, then cold, into his yard with some salt. Another present
remedy: If a maid strike him on the face with her girdle he shall stale.

If your saddle do chafe your horse. Take an herb called arsemart, in latin
Parcicaria, stamp it, and lay it to, which is a present remedy.

Teeth changing or falling.
A Horse hath forty teeth: in the xxx. month after his foling, he loses two
above, and two beneath. Again in the fourth year he loses iiii. teeth, two
above, and two beneath, on the fifth year he casts the rest both above and
beneath, those that come first be hollow teeth above. At vi. years his hollow
teeth are filed up, and in the vii. year all the rest are filled up. Of this age
ye can no longer judge by his teeth. But if ye pluck up the skin of his
jaws or cheeks, if they fall soon smooth again, is a sign he is young. But
if they fall wrinkled, he is old. And like of other beasts. The horse grows
not after vi or vii. years, the mare grows not after v. years. And to have
them bring fair colts, let them not be horsed but every other year.

A praise of the sheep.
THese cattle sheep among the rest,
Is counted for man one of the best.
No harmful beast nor hurt at all.
His fleece of wool doth cloth us all:
Which keeps us from the extreme cold:
His flesh doth feed both young and old.
His tallow makes the candels white,
To burn and serve us day and night.
His skin doth pleasure diverse ways,
To write, to wear at all assays.
His guts thereof do make whele strings,
They use his bones to other things.
His horns some shepeheards will not loose,
Because therewith they patch their shoes.
His dung is chief I understand,
To help and dung the plowmans land.
Therefore the sheep among the rest,
He is for man a worthy beast.
FINIS.
The government of sheep, and remedies for such diseases as comes unto them.
AS our chief commodity is to have great cattle, so is there a chief
comditie to nourish, keep and feed small cattle, as sheep one of the
chiefest fruitfullest for the use of man. For of these beasts comes a yearly
fleece, and are kept with small trouble or any other great pain, but in
keeping them from cold in winter, daggin in summer, scabbe, blood, and such
other inconveniences which comes unto them as well as any other catell.

Therefore must ye take some pain to see the kept in fields pastures as well as
in houses. There is no man that loves sheep but will have a chief care of
them, to use and order them as they ought to be, considering all the
commodities ye comes by them, and to keep their houses clean warm in winter,
with their folds also well set and ordered in somer. The shepherd ought to be
of a good nature, wise, skilful, countablo, and right in all his doings,
wherein few is to be found at this present. Specially in villages and towns:
that by their idleness long rest, they grow new to wax stubborn and are given
(for the most part) to frowardness and evil, more then to good profit to their
masters, and evil manered, whereof breeds many thievish conditions, being
pickers, liars, and stealers, and runners about from place to place, with many
other infinite evils. Which contrary was in ye first shepherds of Egipt,
other in their time, for they were ye first inuentours of astrology and
judgment of stars, and finders out of physic, augmenters of music, and
many other liberal sciences.

I cannot tell whether I ought to join the art of knighthood, and the
government of kingdoms, but by their long continuance in the fields, and
many years seeing and viewing out of their cabins, by experiences observed
the course of the stars, the disposition of times, and by long use in marking
the ordered times and vnstedfastnes of days in such sort continuing that the
ancient shepherds became people of great knowledge: As witnesses
Hierogliphiques: and therefore al husbands ought to have a great care in
choosing of good shepherds.

Sheep (as well as others) ought to be the first cattle to be looked unto, if
ye mark the great profit that comes by them: for by these cattle we are
chiefly defended from cold, in serving many ways, in coverings for our
bodies. They do not only nourish the people of the villages, but also to serve
the the table with many sorts of delicate and pleasant weates: In some
countries their milk doth serve in steed of furmentie, of which are the
people of Scithia, called Nomades. And also the greekes do name them,
Galactopotes, that is to say, drinkers of milk: and for so much as these
cattle are tender and delicate, as Celsus doth affirm. Therefore good heed
must be taken unto them for sickness, yet they are commonly in health, except
at some times they are subject to the murren scabbe, or pestilence, in changing
of grounds. Therefore they must be chosen agreeable to the nature of the place
where they shall remain, which is a rule meet to be observed and kept, not only
in these cattle, but also in all other cattle of husbandry, whereof Virgill
saith:

All grounds for all things is not good, nor meet for all beasts to get
their food. For the fat Champion and pasture fields is good to nourish
great sheep: for lean sheep and hoggerslles in closes. And sheep well
fleshed, they shall do well in Forests, and mountains, dry places, and plain
commons: and all severed closes are good and commodious to nourish all tender
sheep, and to make them battle, and so to fat well. There is a great respect
to be had unto the differences of nature, not only in the sorts and breed of
sheep, but also of their colours and choosing them, for experience doth show,
as the sheep of Milesie in Athens be great, very fair, and well esteemed.
Also those sheep of Calabria and of the Appolitans, and those of Tarent, and
now these in France, be more esteemed and praised, and specially the sheep of
Torcello, and next unto these, those of the lean champains as be beside Parma,
and Medena in Italie.

Also the white colour in sheep is very good profitable, as we use here most
in England: For of this colour a man may make many other. And the white will
keep also his colour long. The black and the browne be also well praised,
which be much used in Italie at Pollentia, and also in high Spain at Corube.
The yellow sheep be in Asie, the which they call red sasarned sheep. Truly
tha use thereof we have had already by diverse and many experiences of those
kind of sheep. For in Africa, where they are brought (from the town called
Gaditane, and there about) are wild rams of strange and marvelous colours, with
many other kind of beasts, which are oft times brought unto the people to make
pastimes. Marcus Collumella saith, a man of a singular good wit and
understanding, and very perfect in husbandry, which brought one of those Rams
of Africa with him into France, and did put him in his pastures, and when he
became gentle, he made him to be put unto his yewes, which ram begat in the
beginning all hearie lambs, and like in colour. But after that the said lambs
had been covered again once or twice, their wooli began again to be gentle,
soft, and fair. And at length those lambs engendering with their sheep, made
their fleece and wool as soft as gentle as ours. This Collumella recorded,
that from the nature of the ram, by the alteration of the place and cattle,
they became again to their first estate. And by little and little, by good
order and government, their wild natures be clean changed. So likewise diverse
beasts become soon gentle by well using thereof in husbandry, which afterward
they are found always tame and gentle. Thus I leave here, and and will return
to my former purpose.

There be two sorts of sheep cattle, the better sort is those of the soft
wool, and the other the hairy wool, and for to show howe to buy these
twain, there is many common rules, nevertheless, there is also particulars for
the better sort, the which ye must take good heed of.

The common rules to buy are these, when his wool is white, fair, and long
staple, and plain. Ye shall never choose a very white ram: and yet oftentimes a
white ram will get a black lamb, but a yellow or black ram, will never get a
white lamb. Ye must not choose a ram by his whiteness only, but when the
palace of his tongue is of the same colour of his wool. For when either of
these two do not agree, the lamb is like to be black, or spotted in some
part, as Virgill signifies by these verses. Third book of georgics


The ram among thy sheep out pull,
Though he be white of skin and wool,
Mark well his tongue and thereto see,
If tongue and fell do both agree:
For if they alter in any case,
Their lambs shall follow the self same race.
Likewise the self same reason is of the yellow and black sheep as is before
declared: Which ought not to have their tongue of a contrary colour to their
wool. But in all parts to be like unto the fleece and wool: although the
skin be specky and spotted of diverse colours, it is no matter. And ye must
see that ye buy no ram nor other sheep that hath a thin staple, or small store
of wool: And for the better knowledge to see that they be al of one colour,
principally is to consider in choosing your rams, for the spotty rams will
commonly be seen in the lambs.

The rams are much esteemed when they are hye and long of body, with a large
belly and covered well with wool, Rams esteemed
his tatle long and thick in wool, his forehead broad, his coddes big, his
horns crooked or writhen: and yet these sort of rams are not the best. For
those which have no horns are more better: and those which have crooked horns
do more hurt, for the one dosh annoy the other: and it is yet better to have
their horns crooked and writhen, then to be straight and open. Nevertheless
in countries moist and windy, they were better to have the rams with great and
larger horns, then other without, because it doth keep and defend the
greatest parts of their head from the wind and storms. If the winter be
very stormy in those countries, they choose those Rams: but if it be calm
and gentle, they take those which have no horns. For the horned ram hath
this discomoditie, he feels by nature each part of his body so well armed,
that he desires nothing but to fight with other. And he is more hotter after
the yowes at all times, and more importunate then others: So that he will not
suffer any other ram to cover any troop of yowes, and he will have war
without cause against his fellows, and will not permit or suffer them to cover
any you, although he can do no more himself, and yet he will have all at
his commandment.

But he which is without horns knows he is unarmed, whereby he is not so
ready to fight, and is also of less heat: therefore ye may have the more
rams. The good Ram^to correct.
and skilful shepherd in correcting the heat and fury of such an unsatiable
ram, may by this subtelty. Take a strong board of a foot broad, and fill it
full of pikes of iron, and tie that board to his horns with the pikes toward
his forehead, and this shall keep him from hurting of others, for in giving his
head a stroke, he shall hurt him self.

Epicarmus de Syracusis in Sicilia, which hath diligently written of the
medicines for cattle, he saith: one may appease or abate the fury of such a
ram in piercing his horns by his ears (with a wimble or pearcer) against the
place where as they crook. Also the age of a ram to cover, is best at three
years. And he shall be good unto viii. years, the yowes would be covered
after two years, and then they will be good v. years after, and the seventh
year being once past, then they begin to wax weak will fail in getting lambs
again, as I have said, ye shall not buy sheep unshorn, nor to make to
great account of them which have gray or spotted wool of diverse colours, for
the uncertainty thereof. Thou shalt cast them of as the barren sheep; and
also those which have most teeth, being of three years old. Therefore ye must
choose these of two years, having a great large body, a long neck, and long
deep wool, not rough or stubborn, his belly great and large of body, covered
all with wool, not to be uncovered in any part, nor yet small of stature, his
gums ruddy, his teeth white and even, his skin on the brisket red, and on both
sides ruddy, his eye strings ruddy, his fell loose, his wool fast, his
breath long, and his feet not hot. These are the chief signs of a sound
sheep. Signs of a rotten sheep are these. His belly full of water, his fat
yellow, his liver shall be knotty and full of blisters, and if ye sees it, it
will break in pieces, his sides pale, his eyes pale and dark, his gums white,
and the wool will soon come of: if ye pluck a little thereof. These are the
signs of a rotten sheep or unsound.

Now for to save and keep them, ye shall understand your sheep houses ought to
be made low (like unto a hog sty) and more in length then in breadth, warm
for winter, and not strait of romes, for fear of hurting the lambs, paved
and boarded on the sides, and within the place (in descending) of their urine
and dung. It shall be also good to hang of rose mary, or other sweet and
strong herbs for to take away or kill the sent of their vrin and dung. It
shall be also good to make and set the house open towards the sun at noone, and
to be well covered, for these kind of cattle are tender and cannot abide any
great cold.

Yet although they are housed, they are oftentimes vexed with cold, as reumes,
glanders, coughs, and such, so vexed with cold in witer, as well as with heat
in summer, and before or about their houses, it were good to make a close coa
well and hye fensed, so that they may go forth of their howses in safety to
refresh them. And their Rackes to bes made two foot high from the earth, with
rack staves set nigh together of a good length. And the shepherd must see,
that they be clean kept, and to see that the rackes do stand fast for
hurting any of them.

They must also be kept that they have no water or other moisture, and that
there be prepared of Fearne or dry straw, for those which have lambs to rest
more cleaner and softer, and to see that the rams go not with the Eawes, or
the lambs: nor go with any sick sheep or other beast, and it is better to
let the lambs remain in the house, than to go with their dams a field. And
good to let your best pasture remain for your yeawes nigh your sheep houses.
The shepherd also shall often cleanse the fodering places of his sheep, and
reserve it to litter his kine and horse, and so to keep their houses clean,
whereby their health may be the better preserved, and so in any wise they be
not hurt or annoyed with filthy moisture, for they are tender and nice, and
do love clean places. Ye must also see that they have good store of meat,
for hunger in them breeds the murren. A small stock well nourished,
increases much more profit unto their master, then others with twice so
great a flock enduring hunger. And also the shepherd must often drive them
over changeable pastures and grounds, whereas there Thorns or scratches.
is scant of feeding, and without thorns or bushes, using after the authority
of Virgill, which saith by there verses following.

He that will have good sheep,
Good wool likewise also,
He must provide a shepherd
To lead them to and fro,
From places which are rude.
With many ill thorns and bushes,
And from unwholesome weed,
From brambles, pricks and crushes.
For those scrattes ^e make them to be vnquie^, and to breed scabs, and other
sores, that although they are thorn, yet the thorns will remain in the skin,
and grow to scabs or other sores, and there commonly the wool doth wax
loose and diminish every day, so much more as it doth grow and increase.
These beasts are always in danger of thorns growing where as they are, and
oft times therewith they are tied with hooks and snares, thorns and briers,
which doth tear both wool and skin, and these Cattle being tender and
delicate, thereby leases a great part of their wool, which other ways
would keep it, for their coupling together of them, all other Authors doth
agree, and joins together in one consent, that the bearing Putting the Ram.
or lamming time, is at the Spring, about the twenty or one and twenty of
April. For then the sheep do wax more stronger.

If a yeawe have then a little lamb, it were better if they did tarry unto
June, or longer. Some therefore (without doubt) says, it would profit more
to cover them sooner, to the end that after Harvest and gathering of fruit,
the Lambs feeding all Autumn, shall make them selves strong against Winter
do come, and shall better endure the fasting in Winter. For this cause it is
better to choose Autumn than the Spring, as Celsus reports by the proof
thereof: for he says, it is more meeter for these Cattle to be made strong
before Solstitium, in the midst of Julie, (which is the longest day in
Summer,) than before Solstitium in Winter, (which is in the midst of December.)
And among all cattle, these may be most easiest bred in winter: if the country
be not very cold and wet.

If ye have need to have many male Rams, Aristotle a man of great knowledge of
the works of nature, he commands Male lambs.
to be observed, and to spy out the meetest time to couple and put the Rams
to the yeaws: as in a dry time when the North wind blows. Then (saith he,)
make the flock to go and feed against the wind, and put the Rams unto
them, and they shall have male lambs, if ye will have your yeawes bring female
lambs, put the Rams unto them when the wind blows out of the South. And
Female lambs.
for to have males likewise, they do use to bind the left stone down with a
tender band. And to have females, they bind down the right stone of the
Ram. This is done likewise in great Cattle. also when your yeawes have
lambde are strong lambs, the shepherd that leads them to seek their
pasture, it shall be good to leave behind all the young Lambs. And those
that do suck, are meeter to be sold to the Butcher, than those that have
eaten grass, for they are more sweeter and delicate flesh, and when they are
weaned, there comes more profit by their milk, then when they go with their
Dams, it is also good and profitable to nourish them by the sides of good
towns. For the Cattle of the house is more profitable, than strange cattle.
Also if thy flock of sheep do fail at any time through age, or any other
occasion, thou must then To alter thy^ flock.
renew it in keeping the stock, and looking well there unto, for if thy
stock once alter, thou art like to alter tillage.

To breed Sheep, the office of a good shepherd is, to nourish as many
head of Cattle yearly, as there are to breed.
sick or dead, for ye must understand the Winter, that by vehement and cold
weather, it kills many sheep, the which ye did suppose they would have
outborne the said Winter, which in Autumn they might have been taken well.
And therefore it is dangerous, without ye furnish your stock (from year to
year) with the strongest Cattle, and those that shall casilie bear out the
after Winter. And he that will follow this: he ought to to nourish sheep.
nourish no Lamb under four years, nor above eight years. For these two
ages are not so good to nourish, nor those which come of old Cattle, for
they follow the age of their Parents, or else are always barren, wretched and
weak. The lambing of young yeawes ought to be looked unto, as though they had
midwives: for these Lambing time
Cattle trauelies in Lambing, as well as the woman in child bearing, and
often for so much as they are ignorant of the time, they travel more in the
deliverance of their Lambs. Wherefore the shepherds ought to have good
knowledge and experience of medicines for these cattle, and to help them that
have need thereof, and to take out the lamb wholly together out of the
matrice. For when he lies cross, he must not be taken out, but if ye see
she cannot well be delivered, ye must help the yeawe, and take and cut it
in pieces, and so take it forth without hurting the birth or the yeawe. The
which the Greekes do call, an imperfect medicine, then after when the lamb is
taken forth alive, ye shall raise her and set her on her feet, And also
the lamb, and then let him approach unto the tettes of the yeawe, and open
his mouth and press and make the milk come forth, that he may be
accustomed thereunto. But before ye do this, ye shall draw the yeawe a
little, which the heardinen do call stroking, this is the gross and thick
milk, which is the first milk after her lambing, for if ye draw not a
little thereof, it will somewhat annoy the lamb. Then let him (if he be
weak) be shut up with his damme the two first days after he is lamed,
to the end he may be kept warm, and to know the tette and his damme, until
that he begin to leap and wax more stronger: and to put him in some
warm close place, then after to put him with other lambs, because in being
alone, he will wax lean by too much leaping and playing in his youth. also
ye must advisedly putto the young lambs by themselves, and not with the
strongest for fear in leaping and tumbling to hurt them, and when they are
big, ye may well suffer the lambs to go a field with their dams until
night, and when they shall wax more stronger, then give them grass in their
houses, with the herb Mellilot, also of fine hay or bran: if barley be
good cheap ye may give your Lambs of the meal, and of fetches, and when
they shall wax yet more stronger, ye may in the middaie remove them with
their dams into other Pastures and grounds, and always see that your Lambs
break not forth of your pastures into other grounds, for then they will
always be seeking to have fresh pasture. Although I have spoken of certain
Pastures, never thelesse yet I will here say a little of that I have omitted,
Pasture ground,
which is: the best and most frankest grass is that which grows amongst
errable grounds and furrows, rather than meadows which are wet or moist,
and the grass in marshes, and moist forrestes is not good for sheep, nor so
good Pasture for the feeding of them, and by long use and continuance these
cattle will wax weary noisome thereof: if their keeper do not remedy it in
giving those sheep of salt with their meat, which shall save them and make
them to have an appetite. And in summer it shall be good to have them under
shadowy places, or trees in woods, to the end that by their resting, they
shall have the better appetite, when they return to their Pasture again, and
Drink,
they may then drink, whereby to feed the better. And also to avoid their
surfeits. In Winter, ye must give them haie in their rackes and tares, to
nourish them withal. They do also feed them with Ealme leaves, and of Ash
leaves and such like, which is gathered in seasons convenient, and in Autumn
to feed them with haie of the latter season. For that is more tender, and more
pleasanter for them to eat, than other which is dryer, as that which is first
ripe, the grass or herb called Mellilot, is special good for them at all
times, and likewise for all other Cattle. They use also to have Fetches for
them, which is very good, and to give them of Barlie straw smallie beaten and
short, which is in Winter very good for them when they can have no other meat.
Likewise of Peas holme, is good for them, if they be kept near towns or
villages: and when the time is to drive them to pasture, or to lead them to
drink in the hot Summer, as need requires. I will not be of other opinion,
but that which Virgill hath written, which is:

In the morning tide, lead forth thy yeawes,
For to refresh them, before the son do rise:
The grass being tender, and shining with dewise,
Soon after comes drought, is the common guise,
That after the sun be once four hours hie,
Then bushes do crack, and plains wax dry:
Then sings the Nightingale, with notes plain,
Drive them to the springs of the high mountain.
Also in the middaie the same Poet saith:

In heate now of the day,
To search it is thy charge,
To find thy Sheep some tree,
With branches long and large,
To shadow them withal,
Out of the heate and dust,
As heate and and time do last,
Then let them quench their thirst.
And when the great heate is abated, soon after let the be driven softly to
feed. And saith:

The sun now being set,
In the Evening tide,
All the day before,
Whereas the ground hath dried.
The night now being cold,
The dew descends plain,
On Pastures dried before,
By them refreshed again,
And ye must observe Astrum, which is the star of heate in Summer, when the
Canicular days do begin, to the end that before the midst of the day,
Shepherds ought to conduct and drive his sheep towards the West, after the
midday is past, towards the East, for it is a thing of great importance, to
have the head of the sheep to feed against the Sun, which often annoys
those Cattle when the rays of the sun begin to show on the ground. And
also in Winter and spring time, ye ought to keep them close, till the day
have taken the gellie or netty rime, from Rimes or gellie.
the earth, for in y^ time the gelly is on the grass, which doth engender (as
some say) the scab and a some at their mouths, distillations from the brain,
with heaviness of the head, a looseness of the belly. Wherefore in cold moist
times, ye need not observe but once a day.

Moreover, the shepherd which doth keep them, ought to be wise in governing
them with gentleness, as it is commaded A Shepherd to govern.
to all keepers of cattle whatsoever they be, which ought to show themselves
coductors and guiders of cattle, and not as masters, and to make them go or
to call them, they ought either to cry or whistle, and after to show them the
sheepehooke, but to throw nothing at them, for that doth fear them, nor yet
to ftraie far of from them, nor to sit or lie down. If he do not go, he
ought to stand, and to sit very seldom. For the office of a shepherd is as a
high watchman for his cattle, to the end that the slow sheep do not slip from
the other. And on the plains and meadows when they make no haste, then he may
stay. But in hard empty places of Pasture, the light and young sheep will
outgo the other, and therefore he ought to have an eye always amongst his
sheep, or if any complain by any other means to see them incominent remedied,
and he must see also in their pasturing they range not too fast over the
grounds, for the light and young sheep outgo the other, and stray abroad
in corners, whereby they are in danger the more to be conueyed away, or lost by
some other means, or by killing with dogs and such like, these rules are
common with all cattle. Therefore he that will seem to thrive by the, he must
see unto them warily and wisely from time to time.

Ye must not meddle them of a strange kind with other of Strange sheep
your flock, for those being of a strange kind, they will always stand
gazing about, and will rather seek to fly then feed: or else look on others.
Therefore look unto them, for it is a sign they like not the Pasture or layer
whereas they gaze, but will seek anew. Therefore the Shepherd must have a
great care, use diligence unto the more than the other. For all beasts of wool
are more delicate and dainty than others, therefore they ought to have the
less negligence with their keeper or master, for they are of less coveting
than other cattle, and yet they cannot abide the heate in Summer, nor the cold
in Winter. These cattle are seldom nourished abroad without great danger, but
in houses and closed pastures, and are gluttons and greedy, that if his meat
by some occasion is taken away of others, thereby sometime he will be sick.
Therefore ye ought to give to every sheep, which shall be sufficient of meat
in their rackes for them in Winter, and to give them in their troughs, of
barley and beans ground together, and also dried peas, or Akornes ground and
given with bran, and dry Elm leaves Meat for sheep.
or others as aforesaid, or of three leaved grass, green or dry, or of the
herb Mellilot, or haie of the latter season and such like. Also there is but
small profit in selling the lambs being young, and less profit in their milk,
and they kill those which they cannot well nourish within a while after they he
lambde, and those yeawes which have lost their lambs, they make them to give
others suck, for they make a lamb suck to yeawes: and yet cannot draw forth
her milk, because her own lamb have drawn more oftner, with more strength, to
that lamb which she have lambd nature in her do show a more love. But to the
other, she is but as a nurse to a child, and less given to nourish it, then
her own. Wherefore ye must observe and see to them all the time being but
young, and to be suckled of their dams and other yeawes also. In this kind
of Cattle, it were better to nourish and wean more of males then females.
Although by cutting and gelding of them by unskilful persons, many do perish
and die thereon, for the females commonly are of a more ruder wool, as some
do say. And again before the male lambs be ready to cover the yeawes, they
are gelded, and when they are past two years, they are killed, and their
skins are more dearer sold than any other, for the beauty of their wool.
In Greece, they use to pasture their sheep where as there is no bushes or
briers, for fear (as I have said) that their wool should not be torn off
their bodies: in plain fields a man need not be so careful. (But here me
thinks if I should see my sheep come with torn fleeses, I may ask my
shepherd where they have been, in supposing their il government, amongst
bushes and thorns,) therefore he must be careful when they be in field, for all
the day some do not go with them. And again in the house he ought to have a
more greater care in clensing of them, or any other occasion not to be
foreslewd, in oft opening their wool where as any place seems lose by
scratches or other ways, and then to tar it, some do wash the place with
wine and oil, sometimes they wash them all, if the day or time be not too
hot or cold, and do use it so in some countries three times a year: and
often makes clean their houses, takes away al the moisture of their urine,
which is easy to be done in piercing the bordes or planks with an aulgar, or
clensing the pavements whereas they lye. And not only to have a care of their
doong, but also to keep them beasts and venomous woormes. Whereupon the Poet
Virgil saith:

Let burn of Cedar odorant,
To fume the stall or stable:
To cause the serpents fly there fro,
And void if thou be able.
Whereby thou may them follow,
through such perfuming vapour,
Of Galbanum the smell,
Will cause them fly full sure. Wash sheep. In Devonshire, they neaer wash
their sheep when they clip, but after wash the wool (before they spin it) in
warm lie, and dries it on hurdles.

Full oft have it been seen,
this thing and often proved:
Of litter lying long (they breed)
If it be not removed.
The outrageous venomous worms,
Be dangerous to touch,
Both Snakes and Adders customed,
Do hide them in their coutch.
But now be they once seen,
And perfectly once bare,
Full soon they fly for fear,
To hide them is their care,
They fly away full soon,
In corners of the house.
They creep in at a little hole,
As swiftly as the mouse.
Take stones or staves and kill them,
Ere they increase and double,
For if they wax and multiply,
Full oft they will thee trouble.
If thou can without danger of thy house, oftentimes burn in the house of
women's hair, or hearts horne, for the savour thereof drives away all venomous
worms. As for Shearing.
the time of sheering or clipping, it comes not in all countries alike. For
in some country it comes timely, and in other some later. The best is, to
consider when the sheep cannot endure cold if thou sheer him, nor heat if
thou sheer him not. But at what time ye have shorn, ye ought to noint them
with this medicine. That is to say, the juice of tares Nointing or greasing.
or pulse, luke warm, or of the lees of old wine, and lees of olives, of each
in like portion well mixed together. And therewithal to rub the shorn sheep.
And within three or four days it will be consumed, then if ye be nigh the
borders of the salt water, they plunge them therein. If not, they do wash them
with rain water kept long and vncouerde, and with salt mixed together and a
little boiled. And this shall keep them all well that year from scratching or
scabbinesse, as Celsus reports, and without doubt the wool shall be more
gentler and longer.

The remedies and medicines for Sheep and other cattle.
FOr so much as I have carefully written of the diligence which they ought to
have for the preserving and keeping their beasts in health, now I will declare
how to help them with medicines, which are grieved with any infirmity or
disease. Howbeit, although I have spoken already of the most part of them, I
will yet here repeat a few medicines for great cattle. For as the body is
of great cattle, so is the bodies of the lesser cattle, almost of like
nature. Even so, there is small difference betwixt their medicines, and betwixt
their diseases, nevertheless, whatsoever they are, I will not here let pass or
omit.

If it chance that all your cattle be sick, ye shall do as I have before
commanded of great cattle. (Which I think to Medicines.
be a thing necessary.) Even so here I command again for a Sickness or
pestilence.
singular remedy to change your pastures, your watering places, and to drive
your cattle into other pastures far of. If that pestilence or murreine do come
by great heates, ye must have them unto couertes, shades, and cold places. If
it come of cold, ye must have them in open places against the sun. And ye
must lead them by little and little, and not too hastily, to the end by their
soft going they be not grieved: nor yet too slowly but gently in a mean pace.
For even as they must not be tormented by too much haste, which are already
weary, and avoid with this disease. Even so it is profitable to go meanly,
neither too fast, nor yet too slow: having an exercise, and not to let them
rest or lye. And when ye have brought them to the appointed place, ye must
then part them into many troops or bands, and so let them be looked ever
unto, and being so parted, they are then in more safety then ever they were
before when they were together, because the strength and the infection of the
contagious and pestilent air is not so great in a small troupe of cattle, as
in a great. And also it is more easy to heal a small number then a great:
therefore ye must do this which I have commanded, to the end that ye do not
repent the more, when as they fall all sick together. Or if there be any one
which hath it, then do as before said. Also sheep are more tormented with the
scabbe, then all other cattle, which commonly comes as the Poet Virgil
saith:

When sheep are greatly beaten with rain,
Then frost and cold increases their pain:
Whereby the scabbe, will then increase,
Which ye may kill, with tar and fresh grease.
Or when they begin to have the itch, ye shall anoint him with goose grease
and tar mixed well together, with the tender crops of broom in may: stamped and
boild with goose grease, put unto your tar in like portion. Then make but two
sheads on both sides his back bone, from his head to the tail, and anoint with
the foresaid grease, and ye shall need no more nointing if they be well used
after, and kept from scratches. Also after ye have shorn them, if ye do not
remedy them with the remedy and medicine aforesaid: which is, to wash them
with sea, or salt water, or in a salt river, and Scabbe.
then sheer and rub them as aforesaid, which is good against the scratches
with briers and thorns, which will otherwise grow to scabs. Or if thou
put them in a stable where horse have been, or lacking of meat, whereby
they become lean, which leannes doth cause them to have the itch and scab.
The which as soon as it hath taken them, they never cease to scratch, bite, or
rub the itching places, either with his mouth, feet, or horns, or to rub
against a tree, or other thing, which lice may cause also. If thou see any
one do this, then take him, and open and shed his wool, and ye shall see there
under the skin red, and scratched, or bitten with his mouth, therefore it must
be suddenly remedied, to the end yt al the rest be not infected with the same.
For amongst all other cattle, sheep are most therewith tormented: for ye same
there be many medicines, the which we shall hereafter speak of. Not that ye
can or may use all, because that every country cannot have all, but such as
ye may have shall suffice.

First the composition that I have before expressed, shall Medicines for itch.

olives, the juice of tares or pulse sod, mixed with as much white ellsbory
beaten, which is (...) powder. Also the green juice of hemblocke to anoint (is
good to kill the itch) if it be not in seed. Some do take it in the spring
and beats it, and then strains it into a pot of earth. And unto xviii.
quarts of the said (...) ye, they put in half a bushel of salt, and then to
cover the pot close, and sets it in some doonghill a whole year, there to
be seasoned. And when it is drawn out, they take thereof and warms it, and
therewith rubs the scabby sheep, or any place of their skin so troubled:
but they rub the place before, with some rough thing, or rugged stone for to
make it bleed. Also the lees of olives is good, if it be boiled until the
half be consumed, and then to anoint therewith. Likewise doth the piffe of
men, wherein is quenched of hot burning tilestones, some do boyle it on the
fire until the first part be consumed, in mixing it, with so much of the juice
of green henbane, with two youndes of the powder of tiles, or of cinamond,
also of tar, and beaten salt, and so mingled together, Likewise it shall be
good to use of brimstone beaten fine, with as much tar, in stirring it
altogether over a small fire: and because tar is very costly for poor men,
they make a salve of broom, which Broom. Salve for the scabbe.
is, ye shall take a great quantity of the croppes of broom, with the leaves
and blossoms, let them be chopped small, and then sod in xviii. gallons of
running water, till it wax as thick like a gelley, then take two pounds of
molten sheep suet, with a pottel of old stale, and so much of brine: put all
into the pan with the broom, and stir it well together. Then strain it, and
keep it in what vessel ye will, and so when ye clip your sheep, make it
luke warm, and with some soft thing wash your sheep therewith, and at all times
ye may use this in shedding the wool, and anoint therewith warm, which will
both heal the scabbe, and kill tikes, and shall not be hurtful to the wool: and
those which have sufficient meat, will not lightly scabbe after. Others do
take of ellecampant roots and stamps them, then boils them in running water,
and washes therewith. Some do take oil olive and the powder of brimstone, and
so annoints therewith. But against maggettes, the powder of brimstone and

better medecin. As Virgil in his Georgiques shows, and saith:

With any iron or with staff,

For underneath the skin,
The evil is often hi^:
Where plasters doth not molliffe,
And skin not opened.
If it be not cut, they cut it, and melts of wax and grease together, and
heales it therewith: which grease is also good against the scab, mixing
therewith brimstone powder. Seabbe.

that helps very much, and Virgil saith: For to help the fever, open the

Some shepherds let them blood under the eye, and on the ears. Others lets

if the worm do wax big, it will wax so sore that the sheep cannot well go
but halt. This worm breeds commonly before, just between the two foreclawes,
the head thereof is like a tuft of hairs growing together, and will stick out
before, there is no sheep but hath a show of them naturally, but when they are
small, they never hurt. So when they begin to grow and wax great, then there is
danger: which worm is a hollow skin and all hair within, which ye shall take
forth thus, as some do teach. Cut it above ye foot round, with a sharpe
pointed knife, so beneath, put your finger in the hollow underneath the foot,
and your thumb by it on the top before, and then thrust it up, with the point
of your knife and your thumb gently take it forth whole, for if ye break it,
it is not good, and then anoint the place with tar, and it will heal again
full well. Also others saith, it sticks before in the midst of the foot like
doges hair, staring byright, and within is the worm all hair.

For every galling in the foot, they heal it with far Gall in the foot.

of before. Yet here I will something speak more thereof, which is, the place
in the foot to be cut round, not touching the worm, for fear ye make not an
ulcer thereof uncurable, and in danger of cutting of all the sheep feet.
When this worm shall be diligently cut round as is before said, and so plucked
forth whole without breaking any part thereof, if ye do break her (they say)
she casts such a venomed poison all over the place, (except it be straightway
medicined) al the foot is in danger to be cut off. And therefore look well unto
the taking out thereof. Some, when it is taken out, do no more but drop in the
wound scalding tallow, or of the dropping of a candel, and so lets it heal.
Others do but tar it.

it is good to stamp lungwort, and strain it with a little honied water, and
give it them: and of the juice of Cardus Benedictus, called sowthistle, mixed
with ale warm. This disease comes to them oft in summer for default of
water. Wherefore during the heat in summer, they ought to have water plenty.
For Celsus saith, that if the lights or lunges be once infected, ye shall give
your sheep of strong vinegar so much as they may bear, or else of old vrme of

there is no medicine nor iron may help it: for the one sheep shall but touch
the other, and he shall be inflamed therewith. They have no other thing but to
keep them warm, and nourish them with Goats milk, the which doth cause it
to be more gentle, and doth mitigate the violentes of the fire, and the
burning of the whole flock, that they dye not thereof. Where Dolus Mendesius

monuments and books worthy of memory, the which were falsely named

by as one sheep had it, (they took him,) which grief comes first on the
back of the sheep: and incontinent they make a hole at the entering in of the
sheep house, and there they bury the infected sheep alive, with four feet
upward, and so covers him with earth, and all the rest in coming there over,
will peace thereon. And so (saith he) the disease will go away, and thereby all
the rest shall escape, other remedy there is none found.

aforesaid are very good to purge choler.

or more, to separate him kill him were the best. For the other, as well males as
females, are so nice, that in smelling where he hath sneueled, suddenly they
are taken with the same evil. Yet master shepherds say, it rather comes of
poverty in winter, then otherwise: for it chiefly shows of those which have
been brought low, in winter before. And at the spring time it will show, when
as they begin to mend. And he which have been brought lowest, will have it
most vehement. Some sheep will run at the nose like a thin water, and those
which have it sor^, will have a thick matter or sneuel hang at their nose,
ready to stop their wind, and those are in danger to die, it they be not
soon helped. Some do use to take a stick, and therewith takes out all that
he can get, and so makes them clean when any occasion is, and thereupon they
do amend. Some other do give them the juice of bitony with honied water, and
makes them take it. Also the herb called bucks berde, which grows higher then
that, which is called in latin Picnocomon. This grows in forests and shades,
and hath flowers and seeds like a bucks beard, his leaves like great parsley:
this herb stamped given with wine, is marvelous good against al cold or fleme in
any part of their bodies.

For lambs having the fever or any other grief, if their Lambs sick.
be sick, the shepherd ought not to let them remain with they dams, for fear
of giving them the like disease. Therefore it were best to draw some milk of
the young, and put unto it so much of rain water, and make the sick lambs to
swallow it down. Some do give them of goats milk with a horne, and to keep
them warm for that time.

There is also a certain scab which runs on the chin, the Scab on the chin.
which is properly called of the shepherds the dartars, the which will kill them
if they be not remedied. This kind of scab comes by the negligence of the
shepherds, when as they do suffer them to feed on grass covered with dew
which is evil, and ought not to be permitted or suffered. When this do chance,
ye shall destroy this scab which is on the mousell and lips, like as the
flying fire which was before named: to remedy this, is to take salt, and hysope,
in like portion beat together, and therewith all to fret and chafe the pallet
of the mouth, the tongue, and al over the mousel, or with self heal or (...)
foil: then wash the scab with vinegar, and afterward anoint it with tar and
hogs grease mixed together. Some do mixed a third part of verdigris, two
parts of old grease: and to keep it cool, they use this medicine following.
Some do stamp the leaves of cypress in water, and therewith do wash the pallet
of the mouth and the sores. Some shepherds do judge this kind of scabbe, to
be a kind of pocke, which will commonly be as well on the brisket, as on his
chin: and as they do say, it is taken by feeding after hogs, which have the
swine pocks, which they do but anoint them with tar and hogs grease melted
together, and so they recover again, and if they be not helped in time, one
sheep will infect all the rest in short space. And for the common scab, some
takes the powder of brimstone, with the roots of cypress ^ixt and beaten
together by even portions, and mix therewith also of blancht rasis, of
camphor and wax, and mix it all together, and make an ointment thereof, and
therewith rub the scab thrice all together. Then shall ye wash it all over with
lee salt water mixed together, and then after wash it with common water: but the
common shepherds do take nothing but tar mixed with some fine grease.

There comes a scabbines also among lambs, being half Lambs scabby.
(...) year old, as toward winter or the next fall of the leaf, ye shall in
some places have al your lambs scabby, or the most thereof, which cause is,
(as shepherds do say) when the rams be scabby that gets them, all those
lambs will be scabby at the next fall. They do heal it in greasing them with
tar mixed, with two parts of fresh grease or neates feet oil, or goose
grease if ye can have it, for that is best. There is also another scabbines
which chance some times ^cabbes on the mousell of sheep.
on the mousels of sheep and young tegges, and that comes as shepherds do
say, (where as there is great plenty of furs and gorse,) that by the eating
of the tops and flowers thereof, they prick their lips and mousel. Whereby
comes these sorts of scabs, the which they heal by nointing it with fresh
butter. Some takes the juice of plantaine and fresh grease boiled together, and
therewith anoint them.

mix with oil a little tar, the powder of a burnt daffadil root, or the powder
of the water lilly root, or the root of the water clote, which hath abroad

spring. If they chance to have it at any other time, the give them fene greek

or four leaves of mallowes dried and boiled in milk and given with a horne,
which is excellent: or ginnepar leaves sod in wine, strained and given. Also

these are good against a cough, which makes them lean.

that he will mend the rather, there are diverse things before recited, yet they
heretofore have used only but this tar: whether it have been for lack of
further knowledge I know not. And some do let blood under the eye. Water in

Some sheep will have a turning sickness, which is cause The worm under the

right horn, then the sheep will turn on the left side, if the worm be in the
left horne, she will turn on the rigght side, thus (as they say) always
contrary. Therefore when any sheep turns or bows her head on the left side,
ye shall race all round about the right horne, and then strike it off, then
tar it, and she shall mend again.

shall see him stand and hang down his head, and therewith sometimes quake. Then
if the shepherd can spy it, let him take him and rub all his head and his
ears well, and under his eyes. Then with a sharpe knife cut off both his
ears. And let him blood under both his eyes. If then he bleed well, he is
like to recover again. But if he bleed little or nothing, then it were best
to kill him, and to save his flesh. For if he die himself (which will be soon
after) his flesh is nought, and his skin will be redder then others. This blood
takes most commonly on sheep that are fat and in good liking.

There is in sheep a bladder which will be under the skull Bladder in the head.
in his head commonly behind, when he is troubled therewith, he will come
heavily dragging behind his felows. The shall ye take and search him, and
whereas ye shall find it most softest. There cut the skin a cross, and flea
turn up the four corners. Then with the point of your knife, race the scull
finely, but take heed ye touch not the brain, and so take and raise up parts
of the skull, and then ye shall see a thin skin or bladder, and therein
lies the woormes which are white like otemeale grotes, and are alive. So take
all the bladder whole out: so done, lay the skin fair and close all over
thereon again, and bind thereon eight or nine fold of linen, and keep him
warm and close for the space of a fortnight after, let him take no cold, nor
rain, if he do, he dies thereon, after xiiii. days ye may turn him abroad to
his fellows. This disease comes most unto young sheep, as of two years or
under, not unto old sheep.

take shears and clip the tags away, and cast dry mould thereon. If it then be
the hot time of summer, it were good to rub it over with a little tar, to keep
flies away. Also shepherds should have a little board by his fold side, to lay
his sheep clean thereon, when he do dress him, and his tar bottle to hang
ready thereby, fast on a forked stick, he should not go without his dog and
his sheephooke, knife, shears, and tar box ever with him, or at his fold.

must teach his dog to bark, when he would have him to run. And to run,
and to leave running when he would, or else he is no cunning shepherd. For to
chafe his sheep it is not good: some says, it is a breeder of the scabbe, by
chasing, and then taking sudden cold thereon. Therefore he must learn his
dog when he is a whelp, for then is best, for it is harde to make an old
dog to stoup. Wherefore let them all be taught when they are young.

How to perceive sheep when they wax and are scabby, Scabbe to perceive in
sheep.
ye shall best perceive when they be scabby, by the locks of wool on their
backs, hanging loose, therefore let the shepherd view and oversee his flock
day by day, and so he shall soon perceive if any sheep do break or not.

Sheep will have a scab, which shepherds call the pocks, Pockes of sheep.
and it will appear on the skin, like red pimples or purples, and they will be
broad like spots as broad as farthings, and there dies many sheep thereof,
for lack of looking too betimes. Therefore to handle often all your sheep,
and look all over their bodies, and see if ye find any sheep taken therewith:
ye shall by and by take him from his felows, put him into some fresh pasture.
And then see look daily to the rest of the flock, and draw them as ye shall see
them infected therwt, put them in fresh pastures if they have it, in somer when
there is no frosts, then it shall be good to wash them in water. Remedies also.
Some do take ye juice of nightshade mixed with grease, and there with anoint, or
garlic beaten together with tar, so anoint. Or the juice of pelitory of spain,
or of arthichoke, mixed with strong vinegar, and therewith wash it. Other
remedies shepherds have the which I know not, but these I think shall be
sufficient.

There is also a sickness amongst sheep, which the shepherds cal the wood evil or

in the spring of the year, and takes them most in their legs and in their
necks, so that it makes them hold their necks awry. And the most part of
sheep that have this sickness, within a day or two, thereof will die, except
they have speedy remedy, which remedy is best, to wash them a little, and to
change their grounds or going, and to bring them to feed in some low pasture.
For this grief comes commonly to sheep, on lay and hilly grounds, and full of
fearny grounds. Other remedies there are, which men do use to let blood on the
vain under the eye. Also some do say, that house leek stamped with neates feet
oil, and therewith anoint. Or scallions, stamped and bound to their legs.
Other buglosse, the leaves stamped and bound to their legs.

Sheep in the summer will be troubled with maggets, the fly will blow upon small
occasions. To perceive when any Maggots in sheep.
sheep is troubled therewith, ye shall see by her biting, stamping, starting,
and shaking her tail: and there most commonly it is moist and watery. If it be
nigh the hinder parts or tail, it will be defiled and wax oftentimes green
with doonging. Then must the shepherd clip away all the wool in that place,
to the skin: the to cast a handful of dry mouldy powder thereon, (which he
should have always ready in a bag) to dry up the moisture. Then wipe away
that mould, and whereas the maggots were, lay tar thereon all over. Thus in
the summer ye must every day see well unto them, and mark their feeding and
going.

others. And to make her to love another Lamb, if hers be dead, they use to
take her Lambs skin, and clap it on the other Lambs body, then she will
love the other Lamb, think it is her own. If a Yowes lamb die in the birth,
some Shepherds do take the dead lamb, and rubs another lamb all over

commonly their heads down, and within a while after: they will foam at the

shepherds do use as soon as they spy any sheep reel or stagger, they take

Against the time of yeaning as towards the Spring, shepherds must then take
good heed unto their flock of Yeaning time.
yeawes, or any other having the government of such cattle. Then must the
shepherds cherish well their yeawes being with lamb, for if the yeawes be not
then strong, they will have no force to deliver their lambs, which causes many
abortiues or dead Lambs, and oft times they cannot be delivered without help.
Therefore in that time, good shepherds ought to give great attendance in
some places where great flocks are, they watch in the nights as well as
days, for perhaps three or four yeawes may labour to yeane at one time.
Wherefore, then the shepherd must have help, or else they are like to have
loss of lambs, and where a yeaws cannot deliver her Lamb, the shepherd must
help her in setting his foot on her neck, and with his hands to pluck it
from her gently. If it come with the head forward, then it is more easy to be
taken out. But if the lamb do come with the rump forward, then must ye
shepherd put in his fingers, and put a small corde about the houghes of both
the lambs feet, and so fasten it and pluck the lamb forth. If any lamb do
lie ouerwhart or cross, the must the shepherd with a sharp knife cut the lamb
in three or four pieces, and so take it forth.

Also if any Lamb be like to die when he is first lambde, ye shall open
his mouth and blow therein, Weak lambs new yeaned.
and thereby many have recovered soon after, and done well. Wherefore in this
time of the year, ye must be painful to see your yeawes and to be with
them late at night, and early in the morning, and to see and hearken if any
yeawe do complain or groan, that ye may be ready to help her, Also if
any yeaw have two Lambs and too little milk, thift one lamb as is before
mentioned unto some other yeawe, which hath no lamb, thus ye may do save in

causes: one thing is, whereas the Rams go with the yeawes it needs not, for
they will wax soon dry, so will their lambs be weaned of themselves. The other
cause is, whereas they have no seueralles to put their lambs in, when they
should be weaned. Wherefore he must either sell them, or let them suck so long
as the dams will give them leave, and some say tho Lambs shall never rot,
so long as they suck their Dams, except she want meat. For him that hath
several pastures, lambs Lambs weaned.
would be weaned when they are sixteen or eighteen weeks old, and the better
the yeaw shall take the Ram again, when need shall be. The poor husbands in
many places whereas they use to milk their yeawes, do wean their lambs being
twelve weeks old, they do milk their yeaws v. weeks after more. But those
lambs shall be never so good as the other that suck long, have meat enough
besides, which have bin tried, proves best.

some shepherds tie dog at the four corners of the fold. Some drailes his
dogs about the fold a pretty way of. Others set up shows of dead Dogs

places the shepherd hath his Cabbine going on wheels, to remove here and
there at his pleasure: shepherds need not greatly care for folding but once in
ye year, which is fro July, till after August, except dry countries, for they are
never lightly folded in Autumn nor winter, for in rainy weather they counsel
not to fold, but to stick stakes about on the lands, and thereby the sheep
will sit down by them. Whereby they shall have more room than being together in
the fold, and shepherds say it is not good folding of sheep in any rany
weather.

And also to make your Pens near the field or Pasture side in some dry

more, with gates unto them, that when ye have drawn them, ye may fasten each

them be faulty in any other cause, therein to amend them. For if his pen be
made in parts, he may take and divide them at his pleasure, and when he hath
taken so many as he shall seem needful, he may turn all the rest to

To put the Ram unto the yeawes, if all men do at To put the Rams to
yeawes,
one time is not the best, for then there will loss follow. For him that hath
the best Winter Pasture, or a timely Spring in the year, he may suffer the
rams to go with the yeawes all the year to cover when they will. But in common
Pastures, the Rams are commonly put to the yeawes about holy Rood time: for
then (they say,) the Ram would go with the buck, to have them come more
timely, but the common husbandman may not so do, because he hath no pasture
but the common fields: for him to put the Ram to the yeawes it shall be best
at Michaelmas. And for such poor husbands as dwell among mountains and
hills, having neither pasture nor common fields, but mountains and heathes,
it were better for them to put the Ramm about Simon Iudes day, for because, a
yeawe goes with lamb xx. weeks, then if she lamb too soon or timely in
the spring, having no new grass, she may not give her lamb milk, and for
want thereof, many lambs are lost, A yeaw with lamb.
the yeawes then being poor, having no milk, they will often forsake their
lambs, that in hard countries oft times they die, both the yeaws and lambs:
therefore herein, let every man do as he thinks best.

There is also in the Spring a disease comes to many lambs, which commonly
are of 10. or 14. days old, and is The leaf in lambs.
much in lay pastures, which disease y^ shepherds cal, y^ lease because (as
they say) they will feed most commonly on leaves, chiefly in Oak or the hauthorne
leaf, soon after they will reel and stagger, and some at the mouth, then
they will fall down and so die, whereof I have asked many shepherds, and
they know no remedy for it. Wherefore me thinks it should seem good to try
if the disease do come by any poisoned thing. Then to give the such things as
will deserve poison, as to give the lamb some Treacle in warm milk, or
southernwood stamped and given with ale, or the juice of Aron, called
cuckospit, stamped strained in honied water, given warm, or the root of the
great bur bruised sod in wine then given. All these are good against poisoned
causes. But if this disease breed first in the head, then shall ye minister
things chiefly to purge the head, as the tender buds of Bearefoote beaten,
and the juice mixed with wine given. Also the juice of Sowbread, (in Latin,
Panis porcinus,) the which juice ye shall put into his nostrils, and let it
distill into his head. The which will purge both bis head and brain. Likewise
the juice of garden crosses stamped and strained, and given with wine do also
purge the head. But if the said disease come of the Hawthorn or Oak leaf
only, which leaves be of a harde digestion, and perhaps may cause this
disease, if it should be so. Then boyle Southernwood in wine, and give thereof
to the sick Lambs, or wild mallowes sod in wine and given. Or the herb
Cuckospit boiled in wine and given. Also of Juniper seeds or leaves stamped,
then strained and given with wine. Also Penniryall stamped and strained with
wine or Ale and so given. All these above said are good to make digestion, and
other ways wholesome for the Beast. Thus much I thought meet to write,
concerning the remedies for this strange disease in Lambs. Let Shepherds
thereof try so far as they shall think good.

may avoid the danger the better, ye shall understand there is a grass or
weed, called Spear woort, the leaves are long and narrow like the point of a
spear, hard and thick, the steals hollow, growing a foot and more high,
with a yellow flower, which is commonly in wet places, and there will it grow
most, or where water have stood in the winter. There is also another weed
called Peniwort or penny grass, it will commonly grow in moist marrish grouds,
it grows low by the ground, hath a leaf on both sides the stalk like unto a
penny, thick round, without flower, yet some, do say it bears a yellow
flower, which will (as they say) kill sheep if they eat it. Also all manner of
grass that landfloods do ouerr^ before, a rain is not good for sheep,

some do say) it will cause them to some at the mouth so will be a scab. Likewise
al mildeawd grass is not good, the which ye shall know two manner of way. The
one is by the leaves on trees in ye mornings, chiefly on ye Oak tree. If ye
like the leaves, ye shall find a taste thereon like honey, whereby the
mildewde grass will kill many sheep, rimes on the ground, then if the shepherd
do well, he should not let them go abroad, till the sun have dried up all
those dews. Evil water is likewise not good, and a hunger rot is the worst
rot of all. For therein is neither good flesh nor skin, and being hunger
straued, they eat such as they can come by. But in pastures they seldom have ye
rot, but hurt with mildeawes, yet then they will have much tallow, and likewise
flesh, and also a good skin. They say little white snails be ill for
sheep, other in pastures or fields, there is a rot called the pellet rot,
which comes of great wet, specially in wood grounds or fallow fields, where
they cannot well dry them. Al these are the chief things that do rot sheep,
as the shepherds have found commonly by experience from time to time.

A Ram that hath a black tongue, al the lambs he gettes are like to be black

Stony and marrish ground is not wholesome for sheep, and wood ground is not
very hurtful.

In Summer, sheep ought to be fed in the morning before the heat of the day,
and to let them drink fair water of the Spring. Also in the Spring time, and
Winter, put not forth your sheep before the dews and frost be gone, for that
grass which hath dew or frost, breeds a disease or scabbe.

It is good also to put your sheep in the harvest in stubble ground, for they
will dung well the lands. Note also, if a ground be wet with rain, it shall
not be good to let them lye thereon, but stur them to some higher place.

Again in the month of April may, June, and Iulie, not then to eat much,
but in August, Octobre, November, and December, then to eat well after the
dew is gone, the better to withstand the storms in winter.

Note also that the washing of sheep with salted rain water after he is
shorn, will save him from the itch, and breaking of the wool, and from being
scabbie: note that putting the ram to the yowes when the wind is in the north
will cause them bring males, and putting the ram to the yowes when the wind
is in the south, will cause the yowes bring female lambs. And those yowes that
do drink salt water, do desire the ram the sooner, but ye must not salt
the water before the ramming time, but after: some say, two good rams to a
hundredth yowes is sufficient, and some think the more rams the sooner
speed: but they will serve.

Note also, all things will fat sheep which is mingled with salt water, as
fetches, bran, chafe and such like. Much stirring of sheep doth make them
lean. There is a disease in sheep which is called the spring, it comes with
a swelling in the belly, and foaming at the mouth, and suddenly the sheep will
fall down in the way. The remedy is: Take a quantity of rue, and another of
rosemarie, and boyle them in milk, or in new ale, for that is the better, and
when it is a little boiled, then stamp it, and then strain it, and so give it
milk warm unto the sheep: but before ye give it, prick him under the
tongue and make it bleed if ye can, and he shall do well.

There is also oftentimes a giddines in sheep, which doth take them in their
heads, (as shepherds do judge,) if it be the bladder ye shall find it soft
under your finger, and there ye must cut it as is before said: or the worm
under the horne which is likewise before declared. For any other pain or
giddines, these are special good. Take the juice of ivy leaves and put thereof
into his ear, and bind it fast for casting out. Or the juice of cackcospit in
like case warm. Or the juice of hegtaper called fox glove, put it into the
ear. The juice of wild time stamped with ale, straind and given. Or the juice
of sowbred, (called in latin panis porcinus) distild in at ye nose into the

of age in them.

For the worm in the guts.
SOme sheep will have a long worm in his guts, and also ^lambs of a quarter
old: which breeds of some raw humour, ye signs are, he will forsake his meat,

quantity of ye juice of horehound, with some leek blades albrused, so give it.
Or to give him the powder of wormeseed in some maluesie. Also the powder of

and poverty, and sometimes they may have lice in lying among hogs, and then ye
shall see them rubbing scratching with their horns and so will tear their wool
in many places. The remedy: take quicksiluer kilde in oil olive, or spettle
therewith anoint your sheep: or ye powder of white ellebory, and mix it with
sallet oil, and therewith anoint. Or boil it in vinegar, and wash the sheep
therewith. Or take ye powder of stauesaker and mix it with oil olive anoint

Some shepherds say, yt a horned ram is il to get lambs, for ye yowes are at
lamming time in more danger of deliverance, because ye lambs have long stubbed
horns before they are lambd: whereby in the lambing time they put the yowes in
more danger, therefore the net ram is counted more better.

How for to know the age of a sheep, she being of one shere she will have two
broad teethafore, at the second shere, she will have iiii. broad teeth before:
at the third shere, she will have vi. broad teeth before, and at the fourth
shere, she will have viii. broad teeth before, and thus ye may know the age of
all sheep by their teeth.

Sheep are called (ouis in latin) which word comes of sacrificing in the old
time: The sheep is a beast good profitable for many commodities for the use of a
man, as commoly is known among all men in this country and others. If the rams
be put unto the yowes when the wind is in the north, the yowes will bring
males, and if the wind be in the south, if the yowes he then covered, they
will be female lambs. Also such a colour as the vain is under the rams
tongue, of such colour shall the lamb be when he is lambde: and when old sheep
are moved to generation in vnordinate times (shepherds say) it is a good
sign: And if young sheep be so moved (they say) it is a taken of some general
pestilece among them that year following.

Also Aristotle saith, sheep do commonly conceive in drinking-water, and
therefore some shepherds do give them salt, and do force them to take it,
which doth cause them to conceive the rather, and salt will keep them longer
safe and sound without sickness. They do also give them in harvest Cucurbitas,
and such herbs with salt, which will increase much milk in their vdderns. If
your sheep be made to fast three days and then give them meat, they will
soon after wax fat: in summer cold water coming out of the north springes is
good for them to drink: and in harvest, warm water coming out of the south
shall be good for them, and then to eat in the later part of the day or night
is also good for sheep. And those sheep which are driven and travel far,
do soon wax lean, and shepherds will perceive those that will best endure
out the next winter following, for some sheep are so feeble they are not able
to shake of the ise from their backs, and some will suffer none thereon but
still shake it off. The sheep which be nourished in watery places their flesh
is not so wholesome as others nourished in dry grounds, and those four footed
beasts nourished in moysts grounds with long tails, may worse away with
winter then those with broad tails.

Also sheep with small and thin short wool on their tails may worst away with
winter: shepherds say, the wool of a sheep that is wirried with the wolf or
eat, thereof, it is infected, and the cloth made of that wool will be lowzy.

Sheep also are of less stoutnes of nature, and wit, then other four footed
beasts. The thunder fears sheep greatly, specially if one be alone. If
thunder happen in the evening, or night, it is dangerous to make yowes to cast
their lambs, or if any be alone. Therefore it shall be a good remedy to bring
them all into one flock. Acornes are ill for sheep, and make yowes to cast
their lambs.

Some shepherds say, to shere sheep not before midsomer, is good to make them
have a long staple, for in hot weather the wool of sheep backs doth grow
most.

In folding of sheep, the opinion of some husbands hold, that the peace of
sheep doth heat, help, and comfort the land as much or rather more then doth
their dung: therefore some do will their servants or shepherds to raise all
the sheep in the fold before they let the forth in winter once every night,
and to go about the sides of the fold with a dog, for commonly when as sheep
do see any dog come nie them, they will then dung and peace, and when they
have so done, ye may let them out of the fold, and this order is very good for
your lands.

Against the rot, if you fear your sheep, in wet times, ye shall put them into
a house three days and three nights without meat or drink: then give to every
hundredth one bushel of bran mixed with so much salt laid in troffes, hunger will
make them to eat it, then drive them to the water, and let them drink their
fill. Then let them be chaste with a cur a good space after, and put them then
into what ground ye will for one quarter, and they shall take no hurt: then
must you take them up the next quarter and serve them so again. Thus must ye
use them iiii. times in the year in doubtful times, if ye will save your
sheep from the rot.

Some shepherds do use when they fear the rot, to take them up and to give
each sheep he suspects, a little milk mixed with salt, and to set water by
them, and to keep them so for certain days, which is thought a good way to
preserve them if they be taken in time.

Some shepherds do give his sheep the juice of elder mixed with honied water or
milk given warm a little, which will purge water forth of their bodies, or
iii. drams of the juice of spurge, in a pint of honied water, to give a
quantity thereof. Also plantaine sod in water mixed with some milk and given,
do purge water betwixt the flesh and the skin. Thus much concerning the rot
and water in sheep. Also if sheep be chaste or driven a journey, if then they
will drink salt water, it is a sign they are sound, and will do well.

A good medicine for the stagger in lambs, or young sheep.
TAke of long pepper, of licoras, of annises^des, of hempseeds, and of honey,
of each a peniworth. Then beat all these together, then put thereto a pottell
full of new milk, and stir the honey and it with the rest all together, and
thereof give each lamb or sheep two sponefuls or somewhat more thereof milk
warm. And this will save them for that year. This must be given in the
beginning of May.

To help sheep that have the pox.
YE shall prick the vain under the tail nigh the rump, and let them bleed,
and likewise prick the vain under the right eye, and let them bleed. Then
take strong vinegar as ye can get, and put to so much salt as ye may make it
like a brine, and milk warm give every sheep three good sponefuls thereof.
Use this twice or thrice between two or three days, and it will help. But as
soon as you shall see any sheep infected put him from the rest, and then give
him this drink aforesaid. The pox will commonly begin under the brisket, and
so on the rump, and then it will meet in short time, and so perish.

For the itch or scabbe in sheep.
YE shall boil the herb bearefoot in water, with the roots of camelion noir,
which is the great thistle that hath milk, and wash the scabby places
therewith warm, and it will help them: often proved.

Cutting or gelding lambs.
THe age of cutting and gelding of young lambs (as some shepherds say) is best
in the wane of the moon, the sign and the hour being good, young lambs from
three days old till nine days old, for then they are young and tender and
may easily be gelt. Yet some other do hold, it is better cutting of lambs when
they are more stronger, as of three weeks old or more. But then is more
danger in cutting them. For if they be then rank of blood (as some will be
more then other some) then the blood often will fall into the cod, rains and
belly, and there it will lye and cause the lambs soon after they are cut to
die. Therefore put the fine powder of rosin into his cod, and that will dry
up the quarie blood.

Therefore some do choose out those lambs that be lusty and fair, and cuts
their ears, or lets them blood the day before.

Some shuts them in a house the night before without meat, and then to cut
them. Also a good sure way is this: ye shall cause one to hold the lamb
betwixt his legs, or on his lap, and turn the lamb on his back, in holding
his four feet up right together: But if ye shall see black spots in his
^ankes then cut him not, for he will die, for he is rank of blood. Then let the
cutter take and hold the tip of the cod in his left hand, and with a
sharpe knife cut the top thereof an inch long clean away.

Then with his thumbs and his two foremost fingers on both hands slip
softly down the cod over the stones to his belly, and then with his teeth
holeyng the left stone whole in his mouth, draw it softly forth so lunge as
the string is: So done, then draw forth the other in like manner. Then spit
in the cod, ano anoint his flanks on both sides of the cod with fresh
grease, and so let him or them go.

But if ye draw the stones rashly (as some will) not holding down his cod with
their hands, as before said, and suffers the lamb to struggle, whereby it may
soon break the string of a vain in drawing the stones, which will then
gather to lumps of blood in his belly and cod, and thereof die within two or
three hours after: And when ye have cut them let them not lye, but stir
them up and down after for two or three hours. For the lambs to rest
suddenly after cutting, is not good, nor yet to be put forth suddenly in
cold winds or wet weather. Thus much for the cutting gelding of lambs.

For a sheep that hath lost her quide.
IF a sheep have lost her quide, notwithstanding, sheep will eat all the day,
and cast it up at night again, (which casting will be like to the paunch of a
beast:) for he cannot digest it, and thereby they never prosper, but pine away
at length by little and little. The cure. Ye shall take quide woort, (which
grows among corn, like grounsell,) and bruise thereof a quantitite, then
mark when ye see another sheep chew her quide, take her, and take part of he
quide out of her mouth, and mix it with the bruised quidewoort, and role it in
a little ball, and so give it, and make her to swallow it, and he shall do well.

The red water.
Sheep oftentimes will have the red water, which as shepherds say, is a
certain bladder with water under the tip of his heart, which water scaldes and
consumes the heart, so at length he will die: a good way to help is, every
night before they rest, do ye chase them a little with a dog which will
preserve them from the said water.

Against the gall.
A Sheep when he is troubled with flowing of the gall, ye shall see him stand
shrinking with his four feet nigh together. Then give him half a sponefull of
aquauite mixed mith so much vinegar, and let him blood under the tail, and he
shall mend: and it is good against the red water also.

Herbs evil for sheep.
Herbs, if sheep eat thereof, as sphere woort, which grows commoly in
moist places, and bears a yellow flower, and hath leaves like spear points,
thick and hard to digest. Also black elleborie, will kill sheep or other
cattle if they eat any quantity thereof. There is an other herb called two
penny grass, which grows in meadows, which is as evil for sheep as spear
wort. Again oak leaves, if sheep eat thereof green, it is evil for them,
specially for young lambs, which will kill them: and also yeugh leaves, if they
eat thereof, it will go nigh to kill them: and likewise of other cattle. And dead
grass or rotten fog in low commons and pastures, is evil for sheep, and will
breed a rot in them: and hemlock, and mushromps is il for sheep, and white
snails. Thus much here, of evil herbs for sheep, whereof I have recited part
before.

To help hoggerels if they mislike.
IF young tegges or hoggerels under a year old, do not like, ye shall make tar
warm, give unto each a sponefull thereof, and it will help: but if they be
with lamb it is not good for them.

The turning disease in sheep.
THere is a turning disease in sheep, which causes the to hold their heads on
the one side: some shepherds do counsel. If she hold her head on the right
side, ye shall strike of the horne on the left side of. For under ye horne
there lies a worm, which ye shall anoint with tar, and that will kill it: then
bind a cloth thereon, and so it will do well again.

The tyne worm.
THe tine worm is a sinal red worm, with many legs, much like a hog louse,
and they will creep in grass: if sheep or other cattle do eat one, they
will ^well, and within a day die, if he be not remedied. To remedy him ye
shall take stale salt a quantity, and stur them together, and give it so, and
chafe him a while after: or give him the juice of herb Robart with ale, and
he will mend.

To help the wethering in a you.
Stamp the leaves of mallowes with strong ale and give it: or take stamp
herb grace and strain it with good ale and give the you iii. or iiii.
sponefull thereof, and she shall do well. And the juice of mugwoort will do the
like.

Goats with their nature and feeding.
FOr so much as I have written sufficiently of sheep, I will now here speak
somewhat of goats, which are cattle much desired of in many places.

These kind of cattle desire to have bushes and briars, and alio thorns, and
other trees, rather the to have plain pasture grounds or fields. For they
feed as well in rough and rude grounds as plain places. For they fear
neither brier, rock nor thorne, bush or other wood, and they love very well
low and small trees, shrubs, as also wild trees, crabtrees and such like, or
the wild grass mellilot: also of willows and young oaks, or elms being not
hie.

The bucks have under their jaws two wattles or tufts like a beard, which is
the better to be esteemed of, his body also being large withal, and his legs
great, his neck plain and short, with great hanging ears: his head small,
his hair black and thick, clean and long withal. In many places they dod
shere them to make mantils for soldiers. Also the buck goat when he is of
seven months old, he is sufficient to couple and to cover the females.

For he is of so great a heat, and so knavish withal, that Goat buck wax
soon old.
he will not spare to cover his own damme, though she be yet milch. Through
the which heat he waxes soon old, and before he be vi. years he is nie
spent. For his youthful years being so hot: hath consumed his strength.
Wherefore after v years he is not sufficient to cover the females. The she
goat which doth resemble the buck before mentioned, is greatly to be praised,
if she have great tets with large vddurns and full of milk. In temperate
countries they choose the goats which are without horns. But in countries
windy and stormy which is subject often unto great winds, they take those
which have horns: but in most places ye shall see that the bucks have no
horns, because they are most unhappy in pushing and goring with their horns,
which thing is often dangerous.

These cattle ought not to be above one hundredth in a heard: although that
sheep with wool may be a thousand together in a flock. And also when ye buy
goats, it is better to buy all together out of one company or heard, then to
choose in diverse parts or companies, to the end that when ye would lead
them to pasture, they do not separate them selves into diverse parts: and also
it will be the better for them to agree in their houses. And too great a heat
in summer doth annoy these cattle very much, yet more doth the cold in
winter: for these female goats which do bring forth a kid in winter, through
the cold and vehemecie thereof, it often makes them bring forth abortiues and
dead kids.

Also abortiues comes when they give the in some place nothing but acorns for
their meat. Wherefore ye must not give them but a quantity at once thereof.

The chiefest time to have them coupled or covered with the buck, is in
Autumn, before the month of December, to the end that against the grass and
leaf do spring fresh and tender, then she shall kid and bring forth their
young the better, whereby to have more grass, and thereby to give the more
milk.

Also their houses ought to be paved with stone, or else naturally to be of
gravel of it self all under, for these kind of cattle be so hot they must
have no litter under them. But their keeper to look always diligently unto
them, in clensing them daily in their houses, and in their said houses not to
suffer any fylthye dung, or other moisture to remain, or any other dunghill:
For it is clean contrary against the nature of goats. If the yowes be of a
good kind, they will bring two kids a piece, and some times three at once:
Which is not good nor yet commended when a goat so doth. And also being of two
years, to bring at once three kids. If so then ye must nourish the kids as
ye do the lambs, having but small succour. But the young bucks must be a
little more corrected and kept lowe, to abate their heat and lasciniousnes in
them. But the other ye must give them abundance of milk, and also to give
them Elm leaves and seeds, and of mellylot herb, and of ivy, or the tender
croppes of lentil peas, or other tender branches and crops. Also when a goat
hath kydded, ye shall reserve the most fairest and strongest of the two: (If
that she have two at a birth.) For to replenish always your heard, the other
ye may sell if ye will, or other ways dispose him. Ye shall not give any
kid to a goat of a year, or two years to nourish, for those kids which
they bring within those said times, ought not to be nourished or kept, except
they be of three years, and those which be but a year having a kid, it
ought suddenly to be taken away from the damme.

But those goats which have kids being of two years, ye shall let them
remain till they be ready to sell. And ye must not keep your doaes no longer
then viii. years, because they being sore weakened in so often bearing, they
will become barren. Also their keeper ought to be rough unto them, in giving
them sharpe words, and to be diligent, patient, not angry, and yet bold: For to
go with them through valleis, on rocks, and desert places, through bushes,
shrubs, and such like, and yet not always to follow his heard, as the
keepers of other cattle. But he ought to be always before this cattle. And
to be more careful of them then of any other cattle. For these in feeding
and browsing or pastoring do always obey the bucks, in descending and giving
them place, and therefore they must be looked unto when some do sit, look
the other run not here and there: But see that they rest peaceably and gently
all at their own ease, to the end the yowes having the greatest tettes and
vddurns, do not thereby wax lean or other ways become evil or sick.

The goats are nourished almost of nothing chargeable. Yet they bruise and
feed wholly together as the sheep, and do clime up on mountains against the
heate of the sun, with greater force then the sheep, and they be of more
greater travel and exercise, and are more in strength and stouter of nature.
Wherefore our ancestors did use them as they do yet in mountains, and wild
places, which is counted most meetest for them: And to have their houses and
government as the sheep have, in putting the bucks apart, as they do the
rams: For they are in all things governed as the sheep, and are much
conversant with sheep, in howsing and pasturing alike.

But these kind of beasts are not so meet to be about houses as sheep, for
they are more hurtful unto all manner of herbs and bees: therefore they are
more meeter to be in rougher and barren grounds, as bushes, rocks,
mountains, and such. And some think it good not to have in a troupe or head
above fifty goats, because they will be ranging here and there, and are
foolish cattle and without care, soon hanged here and there, which are in
more danger then the sheep: therefore it is more painfuller unto their keeper,
and not to let them go in cold places, for cold is most hurtful unto them.

Of their diseases.
AS it doth happen to other kinds of cattle to have the pestilence Of
diseases in goats, as pestilence and such like.
or murren and such: and sometimes sick of other diseases, in waxing lean
through pain thereof: also the goats, although they be fat and in good
liking, so much the sooner will they have the pestilence, and be cast down all
at once, and die throughout al the heard except ye divide them, and when it so
happens unto them, it is chiefly by the abundance of pasture or feeding.
Now when soever ye shall see one or two so taken with this disease, ye must
let all the rest blood incontinent, and ye shall not let them feed all the day,
but four hours, and keep them shut close in a pen, or such like thing: To see
if any other do become sick of the same or any other grief, the which shall
be meet to give the of rushes, and reeds, and also the roots of white thorne,
the which ye shall beat well with a pestell of iron, and then mix it with
rain water, without giving them any other thing to drink. If this do not
help, ye must sell them, and if ye cannot sell them, then it were best to
kill them, and salt them. And after a certain time, ye must recover another
heard. But ye must not do this before the dangerous time of this pestilence be
spent, or that year past, as if this should be in winter, ye must abide
until the summer next following after. Or if it be in Autumn, then tarry
until the spring time. And when some of them shall chance to fall sick in
the house, ye must give them the like remedy, as it is before said of the
sheep.

And when their skin shall swell or inflame, and that the goat is full of
water, which the Greekes call Hydropisis, a disease which comes by drinking
too much water. Ye must cut them a little with a sharpe knife under the
shoulder, and thereby draw forth all the superfluous moisture, and then heal
the wound with tar, and after that the she goat hath borne kids, if her matrix
be swollen, or that the secondine (which is the skin that the kids are lapped in)
is not well borne, ye shall make her take a pint and a half of sod wine, or if
ye have not that, ye shall give her as much of other good wine, and to fill and
strengthen their nature with cerot liquid. Now to the end I will not again
recite that which I have already spoken (if any other disease do come unto
them) ye shall help them with such medicines as I have already showed
heretofore in the remedies for sheep.

For goats have the like diseases as the sheep and other cattle, and as they
say, the goats are never without agues, for it is a common disease among them,
and other diseases they catch in their bringing forth of their young kids, as
before is expressed. This I think shall be sufficient here at this time.

There is also in the tefs of goats, as in yowes, a certain The stopping of
the tets.
stopping in some of their tets, which is a hard matter like a straw of
phlegm, which will be in the cundit of the teat, with a little black head,
some will stick so fast that the kid or lamb cannot draw it forth, and so
long they can have no milk. Therefore must the shepherds see to all such
things, at the lamming or kidding time, or else the lambs and kids are like to
starve.

Let the keeper also look unto his goats, that the females be not chaste or
hunted when they be great with kids, for if they be, they will be in danger of
the misturning the kids in their bellies, which causes the kids oftentimes to
die, put the goats in great jeopardy: so likewise with yowes great with lamb,
if they be chaste being great, it turns their lambs in their bellies, and makes
many miscary in lambing time.

Thus much for the keeping and ordering of goats.

If a sheep be bitten with any dog, ye shall clip away all the wool thereabout
nigh unto the place, and then clap on a plaster of pitch and it will heal it.

To heal a tetter which is a dry scabbe.
YE shall take the roots of sorrel wild or tame, slice them and bruise them a
little, and soak them in good vinegar two days and two nights, then rub the
sore therewith iiii. or v. times a day, and then let the roots so remain in the
vinegar still. Use this and it will help. Or take the gum of cheri trees, and
resolve it in strong vinegar, and rub the sore therewith, and this will help.
Also Acerabacca bruised and laid in vinegar to anoint, doth the same. Again,
the herb called pricmadam, growing commonly on walls, stamped with barrowes
grease, and so remain two days, and then anoint therewith, doth like help.
Or bolearmeniac mixed with soap, and then to anoint therewith. All these are
good against tetters, either for sheep or goats.

Lambs cutting, coming late in the year, or kids.
IF ye have any lambs that come in the end of may, or in June, the fly will be
busy if ye then cut them^ to defend the fly, ye shall mix fresh grease and
soot together. (For the soot being sharpe, will keep away the fly) and so
anoint the cod therewith, and he shall do well.

To help goats or sheep that have an itch.
YE shall take of young broom the tendrest ye can get, and put a good
quantity thereof into a pot with chambe^ lye, then stop it close, and so let
it remain: And when as ye shall have any cause to occupy thereof, shed over
the wool on the sheepe^ back, and annoynt therewith, so that it may go down
to the skin. This is soon made and of small charge, and is more better than
tar and fresh grease. For it will fasten the wool, kill the scab, also
destroy the tikes. Often proved quoth Balgroue.

To feed a lamb from the Dam.
A Lamb taken from the Dam, so nourished by hand, he may soon perish, although
ye feed it very well, except ye look unto his dunging. For I have known some
being stopped, die thereof for lack of looking to. Ye shall open anoint his
tuell with butter or oil, and so rake him, or else give him spurge with milk,
or centory in milk.

A proved medicine against the staggers in sheep.
TAke of house leke called Singreene, the root of Dragon, a like quantity,
Some grounds of strong ale, with some new milk, stamp the herbs, and then
boyle them well altogether. Then put thereto a few grains, grossly beaten, and
so let it have a boyle or two after, so let it cool, and give each sheep
two or three spoonful thereof milk warm, and this will help.

FINIS.
The nature and qualities of hogs, and also the government thereof.
THe hog is a hurtful and spoiling beast, stout and hardy, and troublesome
to rule: he is a great rauener for his meat, because he is hot of nature.
Hogs are commonly known to most men: therefore I will here let pass to speak
in every point thereof, but such as shall be most meet and necessary to be
known.

There be of all sorts to be had, but the meetest having and choosing of them,
is the males, and boor pigs, for Choosing of hogs.
they do more resemble the nature of the boor, then the sow. And those that
are large and big of body are most expected, rather then those of long and
round of body. And they ought to have a deep belly, with thick and large
thighs: not having his claws very hye, nor yet very long legs, but thick
and short, with a great thick neck. His groyne and snout short and bending
backward, with a broad thick chine and yet those are most knavishly given,
when they are a year old: for they will engender and desire to cover or to be
covered within every ten months: and so will continue till they be four
years of age: and one Boor is sufficient for ten sows. Also the sows A Bore
is sufficient for ten sows
ought to have a long body, and all the rest of her body like the other
aforesaid of the Bore. Whereas the countries are cold, and subject to frosts,
it is best there, to choose and have hogs which have hye and hard bristles,
thick black. if it be in temperate countries warm against the sun: there
ye may well nourish those hogs which have thin, small low bristles, because they
are commonly more tender then others. Also those hogs which are nourished in
houses towns, are most commonly whiter then others. A sow will commonly bring
pigs until she be seven years old, those sows tha^ brings pigs, most
often in the year, do sooner waxeolde then others: for some young Sow, well
fed, being one year old, will have pigs. The Sows are best to be covered
in the month of February: and when she hath Covering ^es. Sows go with pig
16. weeks.
gone with pig four months or fifteen weeks, then in the sixtenth week,
or beginning of the fifth month, she will farro. Some (as they say) will have
pigs twice, some thrice a year. And when the grass is strong and wet, it
causes them to bring abundance of milk to norish their pigs the better: for
when she waxes dry, and hath no milk to nourish them with, then must ye take
them from her, and see to wean them, and so by little and little they will fall
to eat grass and corn, and such as falls on the ground. And thus in
continuance they will wax more stronger, to eat of all other kind of meat.
This order they chiefly use in villages where great troops of hogs are used
and kept together, bred and brought up in towns, whereby at length there comes
a great profit by them unto the husband. As in places and villages, nigh unto
great towns, or gentill men's houses, in selling the young sucking pigs which
are always ready money unto them: and by this means the Sow is discharged of
her pigs the sooner. Whereby she shall be the readier to bring pigs twice or
thrice a year: and the boor pigs ought to be gelded when they are about six
months old: for then they begin to wax strong in heate, and being vngelt
till then they will grow to be more stouter hogs: and yet they commonly geld
them when they are young under the damme, as being Gelding pigs. spaied Sows.
three weeks or a month old, and some say they will have the sweeter flesh:
but the truth is contrary, (as many do judge,) because they are too soon
weakened in their nature: and therefore they will not be so large hogs. Some
do counsel to geld or spay the sows when they have been often covered, as
of three or four years: and to spay the sows is counted then best. Some
think in spaying them of shots is best, in cutting them in the mid flank with
a sharpe knife, two fingers broad, in taking out the bag of birth, and cutting
it off, and so they do stitch up the wound again, and then annoynt it, and
keep her warm in the sty two or three days after, and those that be spayde
can bring no more pigs, nor the bores will not seek after them, and they will
wax the fatter.

Notwithstanding, I cannot say why they spay them except it should be to fat
them, or where there is want of meat to feed them. For where as plenty of
meat is, better it is there to have them bring up pigs than otherwise. Of
these kind of Beasts ye shall find in all countries christened, and some
are in mountains as well as in plain countries. But the plain and moist
grounds, are far better for them, then the hot and dry grounds. For the
forests and Commons are most convenient for them to feed on. And where there
is great plenty of Oak trees, Beech, Ash, and thorne, of Briars, Hazels, and
crabtrees, wild pear, or Plumtrees, Fearne roots, and suchlike, to feed them
withal, from time to time. For these sorts of trees do not ripe al at one
time, but in diverse and sundry times of the summer, which are almost sufficient
to nourish them all the year long, with help of grass and roots, and some
helps now and then in Winter of other meat.

And where there is want of such trees, ye must have them to other feeding
ground, and the best is to have of dirty, slymie and soft ground, then to
have dry and harde ground. For in the in the soft ground, they may the easier
dig and seek for worms roots in the earth, and to toss and tumble in the
dirty water, which doth them much good in hot time. Wherein they much delight
to tumble them, because ofttimes they would have water to cool them in, which
cooling doth profit them much and eases them of their great heate, which is
a breeder of the meazels. They Roots good for hogs.
do feed in moist marrish grounds, where they have many small and sweet
roots, as flag roots, and the roots of galingale, of rushes, reeds, and
also the roots of Daffadill, which is very good for hogs, knotgrasse and
such like. And likewise in fallow fields they do find store of roots, and
worms which doth make them fat. And as for other grounds covered with grass,
they find diverse sorts of herbs and fruits, so that in diverse parts
thereof, they may have besides, of wild plums, of pears, or hawes, sloes and
nuts, and such like: and whereas ye shall see them have scante of meat, ye
must not then spare your Garners: for then ye must needs help them a mornings
with some meat, and likewise at night with some: for al the day before perhaps
in feeding abroad they have had little or nothing. And therefore all good
husbands should keep plenty of acorns after Michaelmas, to serve them all the
year if they can. Acorns may be kept in Cestorns with water, Akornes kept.
or to be dried and kept in fats, for so ye may keep them from rats and mice:
or to dry them and lay them on dry boardes, and give thereof in their wash, or
dry with some beans or other grain when it is good cheap, and what ye
spend one way, ye may so profit an other way.

Unto sows that give suck, to eat of green herbs, sometimes it doth them
hurt. Therefore in the morning before ye put them forth to feed, ye ought to
give them somewhat to keep them in hart: for much eating of green grass in
the spring, will cause them to be lose bellied, which will make them lean. And
ye should not put hogs together Stying your hogs.
like other cattle, in their styes: but make them partitions therein. And to
put the sows asunder by them selves, and the young pigs by them selves. For
when they are shut up altogether, they tumble, toss, and lye out of order one
upon another, and thereby oftentimes makes the sows to cast their pigs.

Also those husbands that dwell by forests or commons, it were good for them
to have styes in the said forests, and commons, whereby they may at all times
feed such hogs as they shall seem most meet. And there likewise use to
give them their meat, whereby they may within a while forget the coming to his
house, and thereby he shall the less be troubled with them, from time to
time. And it were good to make the walls or hedges of your styes of four
foot hye: for then your hogs or sows can not get over, nor yet others come
unto them. And so open at all times, that the keeper may look into the sty,
and to take account of them at his pleasure, to see if he have all or not, and
to see if any sow do ouerlay, or lye on her pigs, then to remove her, and
see unto the pigs, so long as they be young and tender.

The hoghearde or keeper ought also in keeping of them Hogheard watchful.
to be watchful, diligent, painful, serviceable with wisdom, and of a good
nature: Being very careful to nourish them, from time to time: who ought also
to have in mind the number of all his hogs, sows and pigs, both old and
young: and to have regard and consider the profit and increase of every one,
from time to time. And likewise to take heed of his sows that they take no
hurt, with dogs, or otherways when they are ready to farro: Sows with
pig.
but to shut them up in the styes, that they may farro there, for fear of
casting her pigs. For in farroing abroad, often times many ways they perish,
as with the Fox, or other like chances: which is for lack of looking to in
time. Which to a poor man is a great loss, if he consider all things. Also
when a sow doth farro, the keeper ought to see how many pigs she hath, (for
some sows will eat of them, as soon as she hath farroed them,) and therefore
to look well unto them, and see what they be: and let them not suck of any
other sow, but of their own damme. For if the pigs resort out of the sty,
and go among others, when she lies down to give them s^e, they will suck
with others, which may thereby soon be bitten of the strange sow. Therefore
the best is, to see each sow shut up by them selves, that one hinder not the
other: for at length ye shall not know the higges of the one sow from the
other, except ye mark them.

And among a heard of many pigs, ye must have of diverse marks, to know
which is which. For else it Marking your^ pigs.
will trouble his wits, to know one from an other. And among a great number
it will be a hard and a painful thing to do. Therefore it shall be good to tell
them in going forth and coming in, as before is declared: or to tell them in
entering in at a door, no bigger then one hog or sow may pass alone, in
going in or coming forth. And look that every sow have with her but her own
pigs, and so many as she shall best continue with, to nourish well, which is
not above eight pigs, if she have any more, it were best to sell the rest being
young, without ye perfectly see, that the sow is well able to nourish them:
for if she be not, ye shall soon perceive by decaying of the pigs, for they
will soon wax lean, and every pig will but suck his drene or tette.

To weans pigs, whereas husbandmen have no styes. They wene their pigs in tying
a woollen cloth list about the upper snowte, with a knot in the midst of the

ought to be nourished often with dry and sod barley, for fear least they
being young, should wax lean, or fall into some sickness. Also the
hogheard or keeper ought often to cleanse their styes: for although these kind
of beasts be foul and filthy feeders, yet they do desire to lye clean and
dry in their styes. Thus much here for the nourishing and good keeping of
hogs.

The manner and gelding of hogs, there is two times in the year to geld these
kind of cattle best. One is in Gelding of hogs.
the spring, and the other in Autumn after Michaelmas. The order how they do
geld: one way is thus. They make two cross slits or incisions on the midst
of the stones, upon each stone one, and then put them forth, and so anoint
them with tar. There is an other manner of gelding, which is more gentle, and
more fair: but somewhat more dangerous, if it be not well done. Nevertheless
I will therein show somewhat, and not so leave it, which is: to slit on stone on
the top, and after ye have drawn forth that, ye shall put in your fingers
at the same slit, and with your launcet slit the skin between the two stones,
and by that slit ye shall crush forth the other stone, and so draw him forth
gently as the other aforesaid: and and then to cleanse out the blood, and so
anoint him with fresh grease. And thus ye shall make but one incision or slit on
the cod. But this way is best for other cattle. For of all sorts of catel, a
boar may best be gelded being old. Also against certain sickness, they give
some remedies as hereafter shall follow.

The signs to know best when that your hogs have Fever in hogs.
the fever, is this. When they hang down their heads or hear it aside; or
when they in feeding and pastoring, do suddenly run, and suddenly rest
again, and so fall on the ground as they were astonished and giddy. Ye must
therefore mark which side he holds up or hangs his head, so that ye let
him blood on the ear on the other side: and ye shall also open the greatest
vain under his tail, two fingers from his rump or buttocks. But first ye
must chafe and beat it with some wand or twig, that it may bleed the
better. Then if the infusion (after ye have drawn blood) do begin to
swell, ye shall close it together in binding about the tail, the bark of a
willow or of elm. And after this, ye shall keep him in the house the space
of a day or two, and ye shall give him as much warm water as he will
drinks, mixed with a pound of barley meal.

And also for those hogs which have impostumes or curnels Impostume under the
throat.
under their throats. They ought to be let blood under the tongue: and when ye
have drawn blood sufficient, ye must rub and chafe all his throat and
groine with salt, and pure wheat meal, beaten together. Some do say, there
is not a better medicine then to make them to take with a horne) six ounces of
garum, which ye shall lightly have at the Apothicaries. Then with a small
flaxen corde bind thereunto with ferules of wood, and let them so hang about
his neck, as they may touch the impostume and curnels, and they shall do well
again.

Also when as your hogs do cast or vomit, is a sign Against vomit.
their stomach is not well. Therefore ye shall give them gratings or shauings
of ivory, with a little of dried beaten salt. And ye shall beat their beans
small, and put them into the trough with their other meat before they go to
the field, and they will then remain the more in quiet there.

Also there comes sometimes a sickness amongst these Of a leanness in hogs.
beasts, so that many will be sick together, insomuch ye shall see them wax
lean therewith, and they will not then scantly eat any thing at all: and if ye
drive them to the pasture or field, they will reel and fall down by the way.
And if it take them in summer, they will lie and sleep in the sun all day,
and it takes them as they had litargie, (which is a sleepy Litargie in
hogs.
and forgetful sickness) if this disease then happen, they shut up all their
hogs together in one house, and lets them there remain a day and a night,
without any meat or drink. On the next day after, to those that will drink,
they give them water, in the which is stamped the roots of wild cucumbers. And
so many as have drunk thereof, they will To vomit.
begin to vomit, and by so vomiting, they are purged clean thereof, and when
they have cast and cleansed all the choler and filth within their stomach, then
ye may give unto them, peas, fetches or beans, mixed with salt water, or to
cast of bay salt amongst it, and then they make them to drink luke warm
water. And as it is very evil and pernicious for all beasts (in summer) to be
dry, so is it most chiefly in hogs. Yet I would not have ye should give your
hogs water twice a day, as ye do other cattle, as goats, sheep, and others:
but if ye can in the canicular days, let them feed nigh some river, ponds,
or low marshes. For their heat is then so great, they cannot suffice them to
drink water only, but they must also turn and toss therein, specially in
myery and dirty water, the which doth greatly refresh and cool them,
specially those which have fat and great bellies. And herein nature doth
show them what is good for them.

But if the situation of the place will not suffer and permit, ye must then give
them largely drink from the well, or in such a like place, or else to put
plenty of water into their troughs. For if they have not then all sufficient
thereof to drink, they will have the disease of the lights, which is, to be
pursy, and ptisicke. But this disease is easily remedied by putting in their
ears the juice of pomeile, so called in French. In Latin Consiligo, the which I
take to be the herb called, light woort, or comphere.

Likewise your hogs oftentimes will have the pain of Milt pained.
the milt, which doth oft trouble them: and then they will go aside and crooked
with their bodies, which comes by a great drought as some do judge, but most
by fruit, for when fruits do fall from the trees, and lies on the ground
untaken up. These beasts are so vnsaciable in following the sweetness thereof,
that thereby they engender this disease in the spleen: The which ye shall
remedy it, by making them troughs to feed out of, of the wood in Latin called
Tamarix, which as I think is called in English quickbeme wood. And ye shall
therein use to give them their meat and drink, and that wood will remedy it.
For out of that wood, will come a water or moisture, which will heal the
inflammation of that disease. Sometimes there comes inflammations in the milt, so
that it breeds a pestilence among hogs, which comes by unwholesome times. And
also the rather by their filthy bodies feeding, or else by some infection
through evil nourishment. Therefore it will be good sometime to keep them fasting
all a night in some dark place, to consume the superfluous humours in them, which
they do increase by their ravening greediness. Which I will not here leave, but
to speak somewhat thereof hereafter.

Now as touching the unnatural kind of some of the sows, Sows vnnat^ rall.
there be in some kinds of the which are so rauining, they will not pass to
devour their own pigs, which comes clean against the nature of most cattle:
those are not to be suffered to live, for they be always dangerous to keep.
Sows may endure least hunger, and some of them although they have sufficient
meat, yet they will devour their young pigs, not only their own, but
likewise others. Therefore some doth think it not good to nourish any hog or
sow, with the garbedge and inwards of beasts, as they do in many places
feed them with guts and inwards of beasts, as in butchers houses and such
like. Nor yet a man should not make any estimation of that hog or sow, that is,
desirous to feed on carrion or flesh. For the usual custom thereof, will make
them mankind: and by eating of dead carrion and other flesh, will at length
make them fall to catching quick cattle, and from thence to fall unto lively
creatures, as I have heard of credible persons, say, that sows have taken
young children without the doors, as in barnes, being left alone. Some out of
their cradles being no body in the house. Therefore let every husbandman
beware of the keeping of any such ravening kind of beast. For they are very
tender of nose, and will smell far off.

A hog is very hurtful after two or three years old, therefore kill him,
and if they fall once to eating flesh which To feed a hog fat.
is dead, they will soon fall to other alive, that whatsoever they do once
lay hold off, be it capon, chikin, duck, lamb, or pig, ye shall rather
kill them, or ye make them to leave, or to let it go. And this shall be
sufficient in this place for such ravening cattle.

A way how to feed a hog fat in short time, is, ye shall take him up, and put
him in the sty, and give him neither Measeld hogs to help.
meat nor drink, the space of three days and three nights, and then give
him continually, and let it be changed once or twice a week. And he shall be
so greedy after his great hunger, that he will always be hungry in eating so,
that he will be fat in short time.

A proved way to help your measeld hog, or boar is, ye shall put him up in
the sty, and keep him there three days and three nights without meat or
water, or any other thing. Then take flue or six apples, and in the tops
make a hole, and pick out the cores, and fill each apple in those holes with
the powder of brimstone very finely beaten: and stop the said holes with
pieces of apples, and cast them unto the measeld hog, first one or two, and so
the rest, and being so hungry he will eat them all, then let him so remain
two or three hours after, and then give him a little meat, and no more till the
next morning, and the next morning serve him so again, and give him five or
six apples as before mentioned. Thus use your hog the space of five or six
days, and ye shall see him wax as clean as ever he was before. Also they
do use for the same, to take the lees of soap, mixed with some strong lee of a
buck, and gives of that, and use him as the other aforesaid, and give him no
meat of an hour or two after. And this (as some do say) is counted very
good to help the foresaid disease.

How to keep and save your hogs from being measeld, is this, ye shall use in

canicular days, or days of heate, which is from the midst of July, to the
midst of August. And in these times to give them chopped, (amongst their wash or
other meat) of cold herbs, as of lettis, endiue, succory, violet leaves, of
daundelion, or sowthistle, fumitory, and such like, which are all cold helps,
and will keep them cool: or to chop amongst their meat the leaves of dwale,

and in his throat: that when he do cry, he will rattle in his voice and cry
hoarse. By this ye shall first perceive his infection: and if ye do take forth
his tongue, ye shall perceive the curnels there under, and by this order ye may
perceive any measeld hog. Also (some do say) if you put mustard Mustard is ill

thereof) cause them to be measeld at length, or such like which doth much
heate their blood. Also to keep them from being measeld ye may use to put
amongst their wash, of men's urine, and mix with their wash also of red oker,
called red earth, beaten small to powder. This will likewise keep them from
being measeld. Soap water, and fish water is ill.

or ale and water: and ye must not let him go forth of the sty, not so much
as to see forth thereof, but to open the sty door and to make it clean: for a
hog when he may see forth, he will have so much desire to go abroad, that he
will have no care to feed. There is not so much care to be had in them, as in
other cattle, yet to keep them clean, they love to have it. And so to be fed

with a good quantity, and that will cause him also to vomit. For if it can
make them vomit, they will soon recover again. For by eating either of
henba^e or hemblocke, they are so cold in operation, they will cause the hog to
lye as though he were dead for a time, for they are very nigh unto a cold

is a swelling and inflammation in the throat behind the jaws of the hog, I
can learn no other remedy but this. They do use to slit it in the midst, as
long as the inflammation or sore is, and then flea up the skin on both sides
the slits, so far as the sore is, and then all to rub it with salt within,
and lays tar without, and so he recovers. Some rubs it with nettles and

shall pluck them against the hair. If (when ye have plucked them) they be

Likewise hogs are subject oft to the disease of the mylt, Disease of the

and likewise unto the pestilence, which increases by eating of unwholesome

with certain curnels, which is thought to be a kind of lepre or measelry. For
the which thing, they let them blood under the tongue: if that will not help,
then ye must slit it and use it as ye do for the garget, which is before
mentioned.

Hogs will have the catarre or reume, it will make their eyes to water, and a
moisture ascending up into their heads, Catar in hogs.
and it comes to them commonly by eating of fruit when they fall off from the
trees, or when there is great store thereof, and by easing of rotten fruit,
which breeds a corrupt matter, nigh unto the plague. And likewise it doth
increase catarres, and inflammations in the body. The remedy is, they do use
to give them of old capars, with their wash, or other meat, and they use also
to put amongst their meat, of colewortes, both red and white. And likewise
they put of Thamarix, which I take to be the quick beam tree, or the herb
called Amaranthus, which some do call flowers of love. And for the same, to
take of marsh mallowes, and mix them among their meat, or for to take
liuerwoort boiled in honied water and given. All the other aforesaid are very
good to stay the reume or catarre.

Hogs will have also a disease in the gall, which is called the flowing of the

that it flows in all parts of the body. And besides, will cause a swelling
under the jaws of the swine. The remedy is, to stamp the inner bark of
elder, and strain it with ale or beer, and give it warm. Also some takes a
handful of gall woort, stamp it and strain it, and give it with honied
water. And for the swilling, they do rub and chafe it with beaten salt, and
pure wheat meal mixed together. And some do first cut the skin as before is
mentioned, in fleeing it on both sides, and then to rub it all over on both
sides with salt, and so lets it go, and it will heal so again.

with the measels, to recover him again. Ye shall take your hog and put him
in the sty for a day and a night without any meat or drink. Then take a
quart of stale or old peace, or men's urine that hath been kept long, and
therein put a good handful of red earth, or red oker, made in fine powder,
with a quarter of a pound of black soap: then stir and mix it with the peace
all well together, and then set it unto the hog, if he make dainty to drink
thereof, ye shall then put thereto a quantity of why, if he will not yet take
it, then put in more why, for so he will take it the sooner, if not, force him
to take it: and when he have all drunk it, let him so rest two or three
hours after, and then give him some other meat, not much: and so let him rest
without any more meat till the next morning, and then use him so again, and let
him have so every morning for a weeks space or more, as ye shall have cause
therein, and ye shall see experience good.

give him of beans and peas, and sometimes for change, to give him dry

But if ye will have that your brawn shall feed well and be fair, white and

him cool also from being measeld.

How best to ring your hogs in times convenient, and because hogs are commonly
ravening for their meat, more Ringing of hogs.
then other cattle, it is meet therefore to have them ringed, or else they will
do much hurt in digging and turning up corn fields, spoiling of meadows,
defacing of commons, moyling in parks, turning up closes, disordering orchards
and gardens: and destroying all fine pasture for all other cattle. And in most
places for lack of good order and government. One neighbour, being negligent
and careless, spoils three or four of his neighbours grounds with his hogs,
more in a day, then can be repairde again in half a year. And the cause is
chiefly, for lack of ringing in time convenient, and they spoil and turn up
much fair commons and pasture grounds, in seeking for worms roots, having
grass and feeding enough besides. One hog (as some do say) will turn up and
spoil as much pasture ground in a day, as will pasture ten beasts in ten days,
which is a great loss among poor men, that hath the most feeding for their
cattle on the commons, to have so much pasture ground destroyed. Wherefore the
common saying is, the hog is never good, but when he is in the dish. Proverb.


Therefore me thinks it shall not be here unmeet, to speak something more of
the ringing of them: wherein some men do use to peg them with pegs of holly,
or such like harde wood and horne, but this kind of pegging will not long
endure, for they will soon wear or break asunder. And some do ring them with
red wire, because they will not stand to any further cost, and that is also
soon worn asunder, for red wire is too soft. Others do put rings of iron,
some with horse nailes or strong white wire, in the groin of their snouts, and
those are counted much better to endure, and yet for all those rings they will
break the ground, if it be any whit soft: therefore it grieves them smally as
it should seem.

And some others do slit their groine under, but when that is grown whole
again, they will also dig notwithstanding, for all these ways do smally
preuaile, if they be not looked to from day to day. To cut the gristle asunder
is better.

Some do use (in the spring) to ring and also yoke their hog, at such time
as when they may feed or have bit of grass, and so lets them remain all
the summer, for tearing of hedges, which is thought not unmeet for the
safeguard of corn. Some others, do use to ring them at Michaelmas, and so lets
them remain, (if it be a year of mast) unto November or December, or killing
time, but they do fear hanging in hedges: they do vnyoke them soon after
Michelmas. They do also in some places in Germany (as I have seen) ring them
from the spring all the summer unto December or killing time. So that al the
summer long, ye shall see no meadow ground broken or dug with hogs, except
some rings break or wear asunder: ye may there go a hundredth miles compass
ere ye shall see so much ground dug, turned up with hogs, as ye shall do
here in one common or parish, yet their hogs are as fat as fair as ores, and
they have no other feed but grass, roots, herbs in the fallow fields. And I
was there taught how to ring a hog yt The double ring.
he should lightly never dig or break any meadow ground, though it be light
and soft. Which is, ye shall take a good big white wier, stiff withal, being
two or three inches long or more, according to the bigness of the hogs snout,
and make it sharpe at both ends, bow it staple wise with two corners nigh an
inch wide, then make two holes through his snout of the same widenes, and put
it up through the gristle of his snout, hard unto the bent of the staple: then
with a pair of plyers, bow and turn the points of the wire into the holes
of his nostrils, like a ramines horne. So that when soever he do offer to
dig or turn up any thing, the sharpe ends of the wire in turning, will prick
him always in the tender holes of his nostrils: and so they shall never dig,
but still gaze on the ground continually from time to time, and shall never
offer to dig in any kind of ground, but seek still to gaze. And yet to be at
all times as fair as ores here in Englande, with now and then giving them
some meat at home, in their houses or sties, and somewhat at putting forth in
the morning, and also at coming home at night. Thus ye may keep your common
pasturing grounds always whole vnspoyld or turned up, and your hogs to be in
as good liking, with a little more pain and charge, as the other vnringde. This
kind of ringing hogs, shall be set in figure here under, for the more perfect
and further knowledge thereof. And this shall be sufficient for the ringing of
hogs in this sort. Also to ring hogs they shall not dig, some doth put a
red paste wire under the skin of his snout, an inch from the groine, and
an inch broad, then wrethe it together on the midst of his snout, and it is
done. Some do use to cut asunder the sinews on both fides of his snout, a
ninche from the groine: and when he would dig, the groine of his nose will
fall down.

Here follows a very good way how to feed a Hog for lard.
FIrst, ye shall provide two planks or thick bordes for him To feed a hog for
lard.
to lye on, or else to lie on pauing stones or pavement: and ye shall feed him
with barley and peas, and no beans, and give him no other water but the
tappings and washings of hogs heads. And sometimes ye shall change his meat,
and give him sod barley, and so change his meat often, and when ye see he
begins to glut, which will be within ten days, Then to change his diet,
give him a handful of crabs, and use him so once in ten days. But if ye
think it will be a loss or spoil of meat to give him much, ye may give it
him in a smaller vessel, and a little at once. If ye can make him drunk now
then, that will make him to be a notable fat hog, within three months feeding.
But after one month some do feed him with peas, or dow made of barley
meal, and feeds him therewith the space of five or six weeks and nothing
else, without any drink or other moisture, which is counted the chiefest way of
feeding. Thus much for the feeding of him.

How to kill him is thus, ye shall stick him and scald him as ye do another
hog, and then cut off his head and his feet, and open him in the back, in
making a narrow chine, then open him and take forth his inwards, and then with
a cloth dry away clean all his blood within, and take forth the ribs as ye do
a balribbe, and cut off the gammons, and salt the fillets in a close vessel,
then close and cover it, that no air enter: and in nine days after, ye may
not touch or open it. Then cut all the rest in pieces as ye shall think best,
and salt them in a barrel with fair and dry white salt. Then when ye shall
need to take forth any piece to occupy or sell, put not the rest ye take forth
into the barrel again, for that will fester and hurt the rest. Therefore take
forth no more then ye occupy: and that piece ye take forth to occupy, will
serve and endure well three weeks, being lapte and covered with dry salt, and
ye may keep this lard so in barrel sweet and good, five or six years to
occupy.

using, it will make him clean.

Also hogs will covet to eat of men's dung, pigins dung, Ill for measels.

ill for them.

Pigs that are farroed with teeth, the males of them Aristotles sayings.
passing three years, do not well engender. A hog dies and pines away, if
he leese one eye. A hog will live xvi. or xx. years. Hogs have many sicknesses
in their heads and sides, and being ficke, they will commonly lye in dirty
puddles, and commonly they will lye more on the right side, then on the left. If
ye keep them without meat three days at the first, they will be fat within
forty days. They love each other, and know each others voice, and if one cry,
they will cry all, and will help one another. They grunt sleeping and waking, if
they be fat. And they sleep faster in May, then at other times: and that
comes of mourning or stopping of the brains in that time, more then in other
times. They resolve in summer many humours, in wasting it by too much heate. And
hogs change not their teeth, neither male, nor female. A boar will gender
within the first year, or being of eight months old: and the sow at a year
old. But those pigs will be but weak and feeble, and the first pigs of a sow
will be slender of body. And if she be fat, her milk will be more scarce. The
winter pigs are better the the somer pigs: and those of young sows, worse then
those of old sows. A lusty Winter pigs.
fat boar may engender many times, both in the day and night, and best time is
in the morning. When a sow farroeth, she gives to the first pig the farmost
teat. And a sow in going to the boar again, she will not suffer him to cover
her, until her ears hang downward. To make them go to brim or take the
boar, it shall be good to give them of barley, which will make them take the
boar, and to give them of sod barley, the better for her. Hogs commonly hath
three evils, one is Brancos,

The other is impostumes in their ears, and iowles. And the third is in the

is most corrupt, and that corruption passes by some and some, into the flesh
near unto it, and so to his lunges, and stops them: and then the hog will
die. This evil increases suddenly. And therefore hogheards do cut away the
place first infected, which otherwise will not be helped or held but by cutting.

They have also another sickness, which is, great ache and heaviness in their
heads, and thereby commonly dies. Ache in their heales.
Another sickness they have, which is, the flux of the belly, (which I have
partly showed before) and is a disease hard to remedy. For often it kills
them within three days, Great swine do delight to eat berries, as floes and
blackberries, which doth them good. They also ye delight to bathe them in warm
waters. They are commonly let blood to help them, on the vain under the tongue,
they are made fat with diverse kinds of meats, but some do make them fwel. Some
engenders flesh, and some grease and fatness. And hogs delight in acorns,
which makes them to have good flesh. If a sow being with pig eat much thereof, it
makes them cast their pigs.

strong ale.

To feed or fat hogs (as some husbands saith) with such Hogs grease.
things which will alter their grease, as to feed them with barley, it will fat
and soon puff them up, but their grease will be soft and wasteful. To feed
hogs also with acorns, or beech mast, oaks, and fetches doth the like, and all
other grain, except beans and peas, which will make them to have a hard and
a fast grease, to be fed only therewith.

Another proved way to help a measeld bore or hog is: Ye shall first search
them before ye put them up to be fed, and Measeld to help.
then see, if they be not clean, Take warm a pint or more of cow milk, mixed
therewith so much gray soap as a great tenise ball, and stir it then well
altogether till it be all alike. And being milk warm, give it to your boar or
hog, with a horne, make him of force to take it, in striking it down his
throat till he have received all. Then chafe and stir him an hours space after,
for fear of casting it up again, use him thus three or four days or more,
until ye shall see him clean, and then ye may put him up to fat, and they shall
do well.

And also to make a hog to scour, they do use to give Hogs to scour.

Also if your hogs be lousy, which will come unto them through poverty, and
lack of good keeping in winter. And Lice to kill.
so long as they be lousy, they will not prosper. The remedy is, ye shall take
of quicksiluer, and kill it with sallet oil and fasting spittell, then mixed
therewith of fresh grease, or neats foot oil, and so anoint them all over.
Some meltes soap and tar together, with the powder of stauesacre, and
therewith anoints them. And other some do take but quicksiluer and soap mixed
well together, and so anointes therewith: for lice will keep them lean.

Moreover, if a hog chance to be sore bitten of dogs in Hog bitten.
any part of his body or legs, and thereon do swell, and like to come to an
impostume, to avoid the danger thereof, ye shall all to wash the wound
betimes, with stale, salt, and nettles bruised, or vinegar and mallowes, boiled
together, with some hogs grease put thereto: and therewith all to bathe the
sore, then anoint it with tar and fresh grease mixed well together, and he
shall do well. Use this as ye shall see cause.

A bathe for Swine that have the swine pockes.
THe swine pockes in hogs is an ill sore, for it will run abroad, and is a
scabbe very grievous. They come to hogs sometimes by poverty, sometimes by
lise in the skin, and when hogs have them, they will never prosper so long as
they have them. And one will infect another of them. The remedies. Some do use
to give them the powder of brimstone with stale. A bathe to wash them is this.
Take yarrow, plaintaine, primrose leaves, bryar leaves, old oken leaves of a
year, of water bittonis, of each two handfuls, boil them in two gallons of
runnning water, till they are all tender: and then all to wash your hogs or
pigs therewith, and use this once or more, and it will dry them up: for it is
but a corrupt water, being between the flesh and the skin, and so grows to
a scabbe.

How to spaye a Sow.
YE shall first lay her upon some form or board, then bind her mouth close
with some corde, then lay her on her right side, so that her left side be
upward: and then take your launcet and streepe away the hair two inches long,
three fingers from the hinder leg, and likewise from the edge of her flank:
then with the point of your launcet cut a flope her belly through the skin
two inches long, and a half, so that you may put in your fore finger towards
her back: and there you shall feel two curnels as big as acornes, on both
sides the birth, and with the top of your finger, hooke or draw the one to
the slit: then cut the string with your knife, and so take forth the other
likewise. If then ye can not easily find them, ye shall with your finger draw
softly forth some of the small trailes, so ye shall find them, and then cut them
off, and put in the trayles with your finger again: then strike away the
blood, and stitch up the slit again with a strong thread, but beware her
guts, and then anoint thereon with tar, and so let her go.

And they do use to geld young Boars, in holding Gelding (...) Bore.
them betwixt their knees, the Boars rump upward, and resting upon his fore
feet, and then puts out the right stone, and cuts it cross over the stone on
the midst, and so pushes it forth, and cuts of the string at the right end: and
so do likewise with the left stone, and then anoint them with tar thereon,
and let him go: and they shall do well.

The manner of spaying of Coltes, Sheep, and Sows, whereof I will briefly
speak somewhat more.
YE shall understand that Mare coltes are commonly spayed within nine days
after they are fold, if they be older it is not so good, for they say in
spaying it will be the harder to reach with his finger and to do that thing
well: for in taking forth the birth, if it perish, the colt will die soon after.

Also in spaying a yeawe is dangerous, if ye hurt the bag of birth, or
perish any part of her tallow, she is like to die soon after. The spaying of
a Sow, is not so dangerous as the other, but may eastlie be done in taking
good heed. Also in the spaying of these cattle, when ye have cut the flank
toward the hinder ribs two fingers long slopewise, ye shall put and feels
with your forefinger, on both sides the bag or birth certain knots like
kyrnels or clusters like grapes, which do cleave to both the sides of the bag
or birth under the rains or rump, which ye shall touche them with your
forefinger, and lay them down softly to the wound, and so pluck them out
and cut it off, and cast it away, which is but a small string they hang by.

Thus shall ye do in likewise to the other side of the bag, or birth, when
they be out, cut of the string and it is done. If ye perish the bag or birth,
she will soon die after, what beast so ever it be. Ye shall note also in the
stitching up the wound, if ye stitch the guts withal, she will die soon after
(as I have seen) except she be soon ripped and stitched again, which is done
by rash spayers of beasts in stitching ye guts and the skin together, and so
the beasts will pine away, and die within few days after. Thus much here I
have seen and learned for the spaying of these cattle.

Also the nature and ordering of Hogs.
ASow will have pigs at a year old, and she will continue good six years,
when she is with pig, ye shall put the bore from her, for he will hurt the pigs
in her belly, and make her to cast them. The bore will brim, at six months
old, at eight months, and after three or feure years ye may geld him. A
Sow should not bring up above six or eight pigs, to bring up more: it will
make her soon fail. A Sow great with pig ought to have sties by themselves.
For if a sow do eat her pigs it is no wonder, for swine can least away with
hunger, for they are hoate beasts, a sow should not go abroad in nine or ten
days after her farrowing, ye wrinkled tails of hogs, is sign of sound hogs.
Also after ye cut or geld, give them no drink, and but a little meat. In
spaying, look that the skin be sound, just, and close up, and then anoint it
with a little fresh grease, or fresh butter, note also, if ye pluck bristles
on the back of a hog, if there be blood in the ends thereof, he is not then
in health.

If a hog be sick of a fever, he will hang his head on the one side, and
sudden stay, be giddy and fall, Mark which side he holds his head, then cut
his contrary ear, and let him bleed. Likewise two inches from the rump,
let him blood under the tail, but first with a small wand beat his tail,
and then he will bleed the better. Which blood ye shall stop with the bark of
willow bound about it, so keep him in the sty a day or two after, and give
him warm water mixed with Barley flower. When a Hog is not well, give him
Polypody or Oak fern roots boiled in beer or ale, for that will purge him of
phlegm, and some choler, which commonly swine are most troubled withal. Against
sickness of the lungs, put the root of Fetterwoort through their ears, it will
help them against the mezell. Some husbands say, if ye nail plates of led
in the bottom within their troughs, it will preserve and keep them from being
meazell. Also the common medicine, is alum brimstone, red oaker, and Bay
beries, of each like, and put thereto a handful of hare foot, beaten
altogether with some madder, and put al into a bag, and cast it into their
water or wash which they drink, and so renew it twice a year.

Moreover, some husbands hold opinion that the mezelry to hogs comes not only
thorough heate in Summer, but chiefly by poverty in Winter: also they say, if a
clean bore do brim a meazell sow, he shall become meazell, so like wise a
clean sow being brimde with a mexell Bore, she shall likewise become meazel,
and all those pigs. The best time to kill a mezel bore, or hog, is after the
changes of the moon. For then the curnils will show smallest.

Also they do feed hogs in some part of this Realm very Feeding of hogs in
styes.
fat, only with fig dust of Dates, which will feed them in short space,
some do mix it with warm water, some with why, and some do sees it with
water, and make it thick like a grout, and in other places husbands do
fat their hogs, whereas scant of feeding is, with peas, and they reserve in
leasing their corn after harvest all the charse, darnel, and cockell, which
they sees in water, and make it thick, so feed them therewith. Thus ye may
make in 14. days good bako, of two inches and more thick of fat.

Also there is to be noted, (as some good husbands say,) if ye do fat your
hogs in a closure abroad without housing, it will be long ear they wax
fat, for when a rain doth come, it doth greatly annoy them and hinder
their fatting, for if a hog lye not dry, and warm, and also quiet: he will
not be fat, in a long season.

Therefore when ye do intende for to fat hogs, put not past two or three
at once together in the sty, for when ye put many together, one fights with
another, both at meat and in lying, which will hinder their fatting. And also
to keep them as dark in the sty as ye can. For when a hog may see abroad, he
will remember log for pasture, and is desirous to seek for worms and roots,
which will also hinder their feding. Thus much here for the feeding, ordering or
fatting hogs in the sties.

A good way to fat hogs after the manner of Duchland.
YE shall put your hogs into the house, and keep them hungry at the first.
Then take the roots of turnepes, boyle them in why, if ye can. If not, in
water: and boil therewith of barley, and give them the roots a few at once,
with sod barley among. And when your hogs are used to them, they will eat
them as fast as other meat, and they will be as soon fat with them, as any
other grain.

To help the garget in a hog.
THe garget is a disease commonly among hogs, and as some husbands do say,
it comes of ranknes of blood and they commonly have it in winter as well as in
summer. The best remedy is as aforesaid, but some do counsel it best to slit
him two inches long on both sides of his jaws, and then open the skin a
little on both sides the cuts, and then all to rub it with bay salt within
under the skin, and he will do well again.

If then the flies be busy, ye shall lay a little of tar all over thereon,
and he shall do well.

All some husbands do teach to save hogs from the Let blood.
said garget, they use to let them blood at Michaelmas, and in April, on the
bain under the upper lip. For that is the chosen place to help hogs, if
they droop, or wax sick.

To preserve hogs and save them from being meazell.
YE shall mix with their wash, or why (in the month of June) Of chamberly
and madder, and so give thereof unto your hogs, and use it now and then once
or twice a week, it will preserve them all that Summer, from being mezel, which
cause I have showed before.

If a hog be bitten of a mad dog.
YE shall take of strong chamberlie, and mix it with bay salt, soot of the
chimney, and put therein an addle egg or two, then beat them with a stick
altogether, and make it boyle a little, then rub the place that is bit, as
hoate as ye may well suffer for scalding with a stick, a clout tide on the
end thereof. Use this twice or thrice and he shall do well.

And this will help likewise, for other beasts that are bit with any mad dogs.

The whole footed hogs.
THere is also a kind of hogs in diverse places which hath whole claws, not
cloven as other hogs be. Which kind is commonly very large of body bigger
commonly than other hogs, and the husbandman saith, they are more fruitfuller
than the hogs with cloven feet, will not lightly be mezeld. Therefore they are
in many places much desired of, rather than the other sort. There is of them
about Winsor.

Brimming of Sows.
IT is not so good (as some hogheards say) for any bore, to brim or cover a
sow in the night time, as in the day, for they will not be so large pigs nor yet
like so well, as those which are gotten in the day.

The cause of some Rammish pigs.
YE shall note, if that ye put and stall a bore in any sty, if ye put in young
pigs into the same sty: soon after, all those pigs will taste rammish, like a
Bore pig to be eaten.

To kill Magots.
IF Magots do breed in the ears of hogs after the biting of dogs, or by any
other occasio of their bodies, or likewise any other beast, ye shall take but
honey, and put it in that place, and al the magots there will dye, or else avoid
incontinent, if they live. Well proved.

Another for the same.
IF magots breed in the ear of a hog, or other beast, or in any hollow place
under the skin, ye shall take the juice of hemlock, and pour it into the
hole, and they will die or avoid, and a rotten egg, mixed with the said
juice, will do the like, or the egg alone beaten and powered in, and the egg
addle, is good for the ranckline, or venom of some dogs tooth, after he hath
bitten a beast, to anoint with the said egg.

The stagger or staring disease.
HOgs will have a disease called the stare or Stagger, he will reel and fall
with his hinder legs oft, and will put his head sometimes over his trough, in
eating his meat if he have not soon help: he will pine and die thereof. The
remedy, ye shall see a harde knobbe in the roof of his mouth like a blister,
cut it, and let it bleed, then take the powder of loom and salt, and rub it
therewith, then give him a little peace and so he will amend.

To show some order for the taking of Moules.
For so much as I have heretofore showed the order and government of hogs, I
will not here let pass, but somewhat I will show of the taking of moules, which
is a beast that annoys the grounds of husbandmen very much, and having ye
property to dig and cast within the ground, as the other hogs on the ground,
thereby they may be called a kind of hogs, which may be eaten also. These kind
be so hurtful to grounds, that they will in short space deface and spoil any
fair meadow or other ground, if they be let alone, in casting up hills both
in medes and all pasture grounds. And likewise in your corn fields, in
raising the errable and sowed grounds, that your corn can take no root in
those places, and in feeding also of the said roots of corn, and making
therewith their nestes in the spring time, as I have seen. There is no ground
void but they will soon find it out, although it be compassed with water,
for they wilswim as well as other hogs over the water. And come into Gardens,
Orchards, and houses: and because that husbands with many other have the
government of such grounds, and do not well know the order and taking of
them, whereby many are hurt in then grounds and greatly hindered by them, in
lacking ye knowledge thereof how to take them. Therefore I have here taken upon
me to show somewhat of that order and taking of them, so far as I have known
and understand by others, as shall appear in their places.

To take moules casting in plains.
WHereas moules do cast commonly in plains, medes and such like, if ye should
there take them in trenches, ye should spill much ground in breaking the upper
part thereof. Therefore as some do say, the better way is, where ye see them
cast^, go thereunto lightly and very softly, but go not on the wind side
between them and the wind: For they will soon vent, and hear if ye stamp on
the ground, in coming softly be ready with your mole staff to strike at the
first or second putting up the earth, and strike it with your tines down
right, and mark which way the earth falls mast, if she cast towards you,
then strike somewhat over. If she cast up toward your right hand, then strike
somewhat on the left, and so of the other contrary to her casting up. And by
this means ye shall be always the more likely to strike her. In plain ground
strike down right, and when ye have so stricken down with your tines of your
staff, ye shall so let them remain in the earth. Then pluck out the thong
in the staff that holds the grains, and then take of your staff, and with
the spittle or flat end thereof, dig round about your grains unto the ends
thereof, and there ye shall see if ye have stricken her or not: But if ye have
mist her, leave the hole open and go a little aside, and possibly she will
soon come again to stop the said hole, and then strike at her again. For a
mole loves not greatly to have the air. Or else as soon as ye have stricken and
mist her, if her hole go downward, ye shall pour into the hole a gallon of
water by and by, and thereby sometimes she will come out against the water, for
fear of drawning, and so ye may take them alive or kill them. By this means
ye may take many the sooner, and save your grounds from spoiling, in taking a
little pains, in watching the times of their going forth in the morning to
feed, and also at other times coming home, when they have fed.

How to take moules after the plough.
TO take moules after the plough: Some husbands do teach us thus, ye must
prepare a sledde or dray, with a great vessel full of water thereon, and have
it at your lands ends where ye plow, and then let one go ever after the
plow, and where ye see any moule holes newly cast, being opened with a plow, ye
shall pour therein your pitchards of water, and by and by ye shall see the
moule (if she cannot fly) come out against the water, and so ye may then kill
them. And thus ye may also destroy many moules in your crable lands: which
being let alone they will do you much harm, both in eating the roots, and
stalks of your tender corn, and to make their nests there within the spring
time. Also when as the moules do cast in your corn lands, in the spring time,
or at other times: the best way is the to make your trenches, and so to take
them, as after shall be showed more plainly.

How to take moules that run shallow in the ground.
TO take them when they run shallow is commonly in the spring time, and at other
times of the year after a rain when the ground is soft, but in the spring
time specially, as in March, and April. Then the moules will run most above
and dig very shallow in the ground: and will work so a long space, by bank
sides and in the wrodtes of cartes: and where ye shall see any such newly
wrought, ye shall but tread it down all along softly, and then watch at her
accustomed hours when she comes abroad, and ye shall see her work and stir
up the earth in the said trench. Thus ye may go from trench to trench. They
will commonly work early in the morning, and in the spring between six a
clock and eight, and at a leaven, and in the after noone, about three or
four, and some time at seven a clock.

Then must ye watch diligently, and hearken, and ye shall either hear her work
in the ground, or else ye shall see her move the earth in the trench where she
goes and comes. Then shall ye chop down your broad end of your staff
cross the hole behind her, and with your foot before her, so stop the way
behind with your staff, and before with your foot, and so to take her up with
your spittle. For if ye stop not first her way behind, she will suddenly
run as fast backward as she will forward, and so will pass out at the end
she came in, if it be open she will bolt out thereat, and in at another, and
so ye may soon come to loose her.

Therefore some do think it better to do this, that when ye shall see her in
any such shallow trench being trodden down, then she must make still her way
forward: Then look where ye see her, suffer her to come forward well in the
trench, before ye stop her way: then do no more but chop your moule spade,
cross behind your staff, with your foot, and then take and cast her up.

How to take moules in bush grounds, and also other grounds, as forest,
parks, and such.
THe best taking of moules in rough grounds and most surest way is, to make
trenches and take them therein, as thus: whereas ye do see any moule hath
newly cast, ye shall there make a trench four inches broad, and so long as
ye think good, and there open the earth on both sides, and cast it up, so
deep as she hath gone. Then make it fine and chop it small and put thereof
in again and tread it down softly with your foot in the trench, but not to
hard upon it, for so ye may cause her to forsake the said trench, when it is
trodden down to hard, and she will then take some other way. Thus ye must use
your trenches, in making so many as ye shall think good in what ground ye
will: ye may make your trenches of what length ye list, from a foot to four
foot long. So done. Then must ye take some pains (as before said) in watching
their hours when they come abroad, which (as I have said) is commonly in the
morning by sun rising or soon upon. And in March, and April, they will be
coming home by 8. or 9. a clock, and sometimes about a 11. a clock, and they
will come abroad again about 3. or 4. a clock at after noone. Thus ye must
watch and mark in each ground, what time they do use to come and go.

Also in dry and hot weather a mole will seldom come abroad, but in the
morning, and so remain till the next morning. But against moist whether, or
after a rain, they will come most abroad twice a day, before and after noone:
and they will work very much, if the ground be not to moist: and in frosty
weather then they cannot work abroad, but they work under the roots of trees,
and in thick hedges and bushes.

How to know their succours.
IN winter and wet times, they will lye most in dry banks of hedges, in hills,
and under roots of trees, and will come from thence every morning to feed, and
go abroad (if it be dry) x. or xii. score of from their holds, and when they
have fed an hour or two, they will return home again. Then must ye mark
where they have been, and there make your trenches, or chop the earth down
(with your spittle or broad end of your mole staff) which she hath raised
before and past through: there tread it down with your foot in your trenches
so long as they be, or so far as she hath raised the earth, and the longer ye
make your trenches, the longer she will be in passing through when she comes
into it. Ye may make and place your trenches where ye shall think best in
the grounds. If ye make your trench nie their holds, it shall do best to take
them in going out, or coming home, For there you shall be most sure to have
them. If a field be viii. or x. acres, ye may make therein so many trenches as
ye shall seem good: along by the hedges side or nie the banks and roots of
trees shall be best: For there shall ye soonest take them.

Also where as you make your trenches far asunder, while perhaps ye go to one,
they will pass through an other, and so for that time escape, if ye have no
help but your self, ye shall so loose many. The best way therefore is, when
ye have trodden down your trenches with your foot softly, then ye shall
prick white small twigs at the ends of your said treches, and prick them so
shallow, that they may fall by a little moving of the earth when the mole is
in the trench: and by those falling ye shall see being a good way of when she
is in the trench. Then ye may come softly (on the lie side) and chop down
your mole spade cross behind her, and thrust down the earth with your foot
there behind your spade, and then take your mole spade and cast her up: For
sometimes she will lie still, when she sees she cannot go away. If your
trenches be short, ye may prick a wand in the midst thereof, which will show
when she is half through, which wands are called watches, for they will tell
you when she is in the trench. This way ye may take them most surest in
trenches in all places where ye shall think good. Then tread down your trench
again, and so ye may take diverse one after an other in one trench.

How to know in the spring, the nestes, where moules do breed.
YE shall understand (as some farmers do say) moles do breed but once a year,
and that is in the spring: about March, and April, they go to buck, and
commonly about S. Marks day they do kindle, and will have young.

Therefore from mid March, ye shall view your grounds, where ye may see any
great and high hills, for commonly there they will breed, which hills ye shall
see, both of old and new cast, commonly they which are new cast, they make
their nests in the midst thereof very low, much like the field mouse, and some
will make them in the hedge sides, and in bushes: some in plain fields viii.
score from any bush or hedge, casting a great hill as big as two barrow
stils. And if ye then let them alone till the end of April, soon after S.
Marks day, ye may then possibly take all the young in the nest, and then after
ye may watch the trench for their dam, for she will come unto them to seek
them.

Also ye may trench for the female about her nest, a pretty way of, and so ye
may possibly take her, in coming and going to her nest, before she do kindle:
For if ye spoil her nest, before he have kindled, she will then go far of and
breed in some other place, which ye shall hardly find, or come to take her,
and then when she hath young, she will be very subtle for to take, she will beat
her young from place to place, will not suffer them to bolt nor yet work
shallow: Therefore, it will be the more harder to take them, and she will
commonly have at a time vi. or vii. young.

Likewise all the winter, they will cast against moist weather very much: both
in November, and December being wet and warm withal: and because the days are
short, and the nights long, they will be stirring very early in the morning
sometimes before day light, and late toward night. Therefore ye must watch
their times accordingly when they go out and come home again.

Moules to be driven from place to place.
THere be some which have said, ye may drive moules out of one ground into
another, there to take them, which is, ye shall open their holes whereas they
have newly cast, then ye shall have stamped garlic ready wrapped in clouts of
linen, and so put into their holes, made of the bigness of a walnut, and put so
into the holes at both the open ends thereof, and cover the holes again, and
the strong savor thereof will cause the moules to void from those places: and
by such means (in using the holes as before said) ye may drive them from one
ground to another, and from place to place. Some do use tar, some laurel,
some galwoort or elder stamped, some gabanum fumed in holes, or any such strong
thing of sa^or, which will cause them to fly from thence or those places so
fumed, and ever where ye see her work, still fume that place, and so ye shall
soon drive them away.

How to take moules in pots, set in the earth.
THey do teach also how to take moules in pots of earth, which pots ye shall
set within the ground in their traces or holles where they have gone before, so
that your pots brink must so be set, that it be even with the nether part of
the trench or trace of the moule. Some do cover the pots with turfs of earth:
but let there be no more of the pots brim uncovered, but the breadth of her
trace in the trech or two inches. Some do use to put a live moule into those
pots, or into each pot one: For when they do gender (in the spring) the bucks
will hunt after the doaes, and the doaes will seek the bucks, and then they
will run about on the ground one after the other. And those moules which are
in pots and cannot come out will cry, and the rest will hear wind them, and so
fall unto them in the pots, and there they will cry and fight together.

Again some do counsel in the gendring time to lead or draw a bich moule with
a string about the ground where the pots are set, and so put her into one of
your pots, and the buck moules will find her out by the trace, and so take in
the said pots, but ye must not tread nie her trare, for the they will not follow
her: And by this means ye may take many in the spring time with pots. And to
know which way a mole hath gone, ye shall open her trench a foot or more, then
tread it light down with your foot, and in the ^ds of her trench ye shall set
down a small stick to the bottom of her trench, and let your stick be three
inches without the earth or more. If she come in, the top of ye stick will fall
backware, and if she go out, the stick will fall inward. Thus may ye know
which way she is gone. Again I have hard, in a garden where as the earth is
soft, yt when the mole doth east, at the second putting up he will thrust in his
bare hand and so take them up. Also, where as you shall see moles to make their
passage under the earth in woods, rough grounds, in crossing foot paths, or
between bushes, banks, and such: where ye shall see any such earth cast up:
there commonly they haunt to go and come daily, wherein ye shall do no more but
tread that earth softly down with your foot, or chop it down with your mole
staff and so tread with your foot down softly again, and make your trenchso
long as ye may feel easily her passage. For the longer it is trod down, the
longer they will be in passing through: so there ye need make no other trenches
to take them in, but those, For this order shall do as well as need, if ye watch
their times.

Thus ye may destroy them in woods, and rough grounds in a small time with
taking some pain. And when a mole is in the trench, doth work, if it be hard
trod down, she will go back and come again once or twice, perhaps forsake it.
But let her come a good way in the trench, then clap your staff, or chop
your heel behind her quickly, and the cast her up: for they will lightly turn
back, if they wind you, or hear you stamp. Moreover if ye can bring up a
cur, to go with you when ye take them, so to nosill him therewith, he will
then take pleasure in killing them, and he will find in any ground three moles
against your one. For he will smell and show you where the mole is, which thing
I have seen going by the way side. There is also a trap to take moles in
coming or going at all times: Which engine, ye may see in my books of traps
and engines. Thus much for the taking of moles in all grounds.

FINIS.
For so much as the dog is a very necessary beast for the husbandman, as well
as others, some to profit him, and some to disprofit him, as mad dogs, and
other, whereof I will somewhat speak briefly, and so make an end.
I In hounds and dogs which fall mad, the cause is, the burnt choler hath
the mastrie in his body: which choler being once roasted in them through
vehement heat, it ouercometh the body, and makes him to run mad. For the
black choler which is so strong, it fumes up in his head, infects the
brain, and so from thence goes to all the other members and makes them
venomous.

Therefore if any person be bit with a mad dog, it is the venomous spittle
of the dogs heat that doth infect: And the venom of him which doth bite, is
drawn to the like place wherewith he bites, which is the brain, and there it
works and makes the dog run mad, and if he bite any other person, it
makes him mad also: and such venom is perilous. For in some persons it is a
year hid or it be known, and lightly about the same day it was bitten, the
same day twelve month it comes unto his head; and therewith he goes mad,
and commonly hounds will bark at a mad dog, for they perceive, and will
rather fly him, then to come to him: and this madness among dogs, chances
and falls most in harvest, and canicular days, and days of heat.

His tongue is so venomous that it makes him to reel and stagger, and to
run about gaping and drivelling in holding down his tail always, and
hanging out his tongue. If his drivelling fall into any water, it infects the
same, and who so drinks thereof, is in great danger of being mad.

And the signs after the biting of a mad dog in a man is: They shall have in
their sleep fearful dreams and sights, and anger without cause, and they
will seem to bark like a dog, and fears to be seen of others: And they
fear water most, and be very dainty in all things, which are doubtful
signs to cure. For of him that is bitten, the venom goes from the bitten
place to the heart, from thence to the head, and so to all members as
aforesaid: and the humour is more moist and perilous. And it is also dangerous
to touch those bodies infected, because the vaporation and vehemence of the
venom, and they will corrupt all things near unto them.

Note also, that if venom be taken by meates or drinks, these signs do
follow, the cramp follows very strongly, with swelling in the fingers and
nailes, which is a deadly sign. Or if he also gape, and drivel, his lips
do smart and tingle, or feel a heat in his tongue, without any swelling being
vexed straightly about the heart, his eyes wax dim and dark. When these signs
are, it is time to make hast, or death comes soon after.

The general remedy and medicine is to vomit, or to take a glister to bring it
down. Then take of triacle, and wine that Sowthistle is sod in: Then must he
be purged, and bathed, and let blood at the last. And his diet shall be fat
meates, with fulbards er small nuts, with dry figs, which is also good to
draw, consume and wast venom. Balsamum with woman's milk helps against the
burning and sore ach thereof. Triacle forti^eth the body, and wastes venom.
If triacle cannot be gotten, then take garlic sod in broth with a fat
hen, and drink thereof, for garlic is contrary to venom, and doth aswage
the inner burning thereof, and therefore it is called, the husbandman's triacle.

Also if one be bitten with a mad dog, take a cock or a hen, and kill him, and
slit him straight, and all hot clap it to the place, and it will suck draw
out the venom. The drawers of venowe are these, the flesh of a snake, or
adder, cut and laid to straight. Also calamint, the seed of wild tares, called
orobancke. Sea onions, water crosses, herb grace, salt, Aristolochia nuts
eat with rue, the roots of a sperage the seed also. Balsamum, dinegar, the
milk of an ass, a childes peace, the stones of a hedgehog, the stones of a
stag, or an ass, dried and drunk. Also castoreum, garlic, gencian, mint,
dittan. All these before said are good against venom, and others without
number: and although the danger of venom comes many and sundry ways:
therefore God of his goodness hath provided sundry helps and remedies. A good
way to help the biting of any beast, sheep or other, with a mad dog, or other
venomous beast, Which is, ye shall cut the wound and make it to bleed, that the
venom with the blood may thereby come forth. Some do use to put to lech
worms, to suck out the blood, and to cup or box it, and to give them
triacle, and lay to the wounds plasters, as nuts mixed with garlic, rue and
salt all together, and also nuts alone chewed and laid to the place, and also
triacle with water, of creues of the river made in powder, and drunk: or the
ashes of the said creuis with gentian, is a singular remedy against the biting
of a mad dog. Likewise the juice of caprisolium, called woodbind. Also the
leaves of the wild fig tree: onions and salt, or mint stamped like wise with
salt, and laid to, every one of these aforesaid laid to, and mixed with
vinegar or honey, are sufficient to help against the biting of a Mad dog, or
stinging of other venomous worms: but a perfect remedy is, the oil wherein a
Scorpion hath been drowned, and therein also is sod, and thereof a piece laid
to the place infected, doth help.

Other remedies against the biting of a mad dog. A singular remedy, which
is, to burn the flowers of hany suckles, or three leaved grass, mix it with
eld grease, and lay it to: Or to beat the said flowers with old white
wine, and give it him. Also the roots of eglintine made in powder and laid
thereon: or to make him a drink it with good old white wine. Another: the
horses of elder, or the juice of the leaves to be given with wine luke warm.
Also the juice of plantaine given to drink, or stamped with salt and laid to.
Or the root of the great bur bruised with a little salt and laid to, doth
destroy venom incontinent. Again, the strong nettle bruised with salt, and
laid thereon. Or selandine, drunk with wine, and stamped with salt and laid to.
Or the leaves of horehound stamped and laid to with salt. All these are
special good against the biting of a mad dog. If a mad dog do bite other
hounds or hogs, ye shall give them the juice of plantaine, and let them
blood, and it will help them, but mix it with a little milk, and so give it.

Remedies and medicines to help mangy dogs, as well in their ears, as also
other parts of their bodies.
IN summer commonly the ears of dogs are sore troubled with ulcers, scabs,
and fleas, that many are marde thereby. The remedy is against the scabbines in
the ear, anoint it with oil of bitter almands, and it will heal it: or to
rub his ear with bitter almands smally beaten, but if his ears are sore
within, ye shall then mix therewith tar, and hogs grease, and with the same
do anoint, and ye shall make the ticks and lice to fall, if ye touch them
therewith: ye must not scratch them with your hand, for fear ye make an ulcer
rise thereof.

If a dog have fleas, the remedy is: take of beaten cumin, with as much
ellebory, and mix them together with water, and wash him therewith: or with
the juice of wild cowcumbers, if ye have none thereof, then anoint all over
his body with the lies and old dregs of oil olive.

But if he be mangy and broke forth, ye must beat y^ teaues of mellilot,
sestamine, in like portion mingled with tar, so anoint: and this they say is
good for men also that are scabbed, if the scabs be yet more vehement, ye may
heal it with the juice of the Cedar. Also rue with a corn or two of salt,
beat them together, then take butter or oil put thereunto, and stir them well
altogether, then strain it all out, and annoynt therewith, or sees the green
roots of Elecampane in running water, and make it strong of the roots in see
thing long, and put some soap salt thereunto, wash your dog therewith warm
3. or 4. dares together, and it will heal very well.

Also another, some take green grass beats it into fine powder, mix it with
the powder of brimstone, finely beaten together, and then al well hurt with
fresh grease, then made hot, and therewith anoint. Also another very perfect
and good medicine is, ye shall take an oate sheaf as it come from the field
with his afles thereon, and burn him to ashes, and with those ashes make lye,
and therewith wash your mangy dog twice or thrice a day, and it will help,
often proved: and to let him blood on the gamarel vain behind.

Also another very excellent medicine to kill any itch, either in man or dog,
which is, ye shall take a portio of oil of flower deluce, with a good quantity
of brimstone beaten to a fine powder, and the like quantity of Elecampane
roots dried in an oven, and beat into a fine powder, with a quantity of bay
salt, dried and beaten to a fine powder, then mix all these foresaid powders
with the said oil, and then warm it over the fire, and annoynt therewith. But
if ye scratte or make the skin first to bleed or water, and then to anoint, it
will do the better. Well and often proved. Another, for a magie dog. Take
quicksiluer, Uerdegreace, Wooloyle, brimstone powder, then mix all well
together, and therewith annoynt the dog twice a day. Thus much for the biting
of mad dogs in helping the same. And also helps for mangy dogs.

A bitch goes with whelp fourscore days, and her whelps are seven days
blind, not perfect sight till 21. days, and a greyhound bitch goes 6. weeks
with whelp, her whelps are blind twelve days.
