The work of Pomponius Mela. The Cosmographer, concerning the Situation of
the world, wherein every part, is divided by it self in most perfect manner,

profitable for all sorts of men: but specially for Gentlemen, Merchants,
Mariners, and Travellers, translated out of Latin By Arthur Golding Gentleman.

To the right Honourable, Sir William Cicill, of the Noble order of the Garter,
Knight, Baron of Burgley, Lord high Treasurer of England, and one of her
Majesties most honourable pri^e Counsel, health, honour and prosperity.
INtending long since (my very good Lord) for the benefit and delight of my
Countrymen, to have set forth a description of the whole world in our own
Language, according to the consent of the ancient and late Writers, I thought
this mine Author Pomponius Mela, for his breefenesse, order, and perspicuity,
to be a very fit ground to begin with, for those three parts which were
known in former ages: purposing, therewithal to have added some brief
collection of the late wryters, concerning the description of the other parts,
which being either utterly unknown, or very lightly and darckly glanced at
by the men of ancient time, have since been better discovered and brought to
light, by the continual Nauigationes of the travellers of these our latter
years. And as my meaning and hope was then, to have made this first enterprise
of myn^e as a frame of a buyldinge, to have been set up and finy shed by me
more exactly, afterward at further leisure, according to the small ability of
my poor skill; or as a rough hewn Image, to have been perfected and
polyshed by the industry of some other person of greater reading, better skill,
and longer experience, and finally to have been beautified and furnished with
more particular and large discourses, both of the places and of the notablest
things which either the places themselves do naturally yield, or have been
done or made in them by the famousest personages, whom the wrytinges of our
ancestors have made renowned unto us: So least this work of mine (which hath
slept now many years) might pass away as it were in a Lethargy, whereby I of
the performance, and my Country of the enjoying of any fruit of my duty in
this behalf, might be utterly bereft, and so consequently my said purpose and
the travel taken to the setting forward thereof, should be of none effect at
all: I have caused the Printer to put to his helping hand to the preventing of
that peril, which thing will easily be done, if it may please your good
Lordship (according to your accustomed good will towards such as any way
endeavour, either to further others or to profit themselves, in the knowledge of
liberal Arts) to permit this my travel to shroud it self under the
shadow of your protectyon, that being by your ^uour after a sort quickened and
cheered up again, it may if not grow in time to full rypenesse, yet at
leastwyse yield the pleasure of the infancy, the delight whereof, may chance to
be such as shall provoke some person, ^yther to train it up to full grouth,
or to undertake the doing of some better work of the same kind. And for the
more enlarging hereof with substance and variety of matter, both delectable and
profitable, as far as time would permytte: I have delivered unto the Printer
hereof the Polyhistor of Iulius Solinus, and certain travels of one Andrew
Theuet, likewise translated long a go to be added as appendauntes to this
work of Pomponius Mela, that as they treat though diue^sly, yet cheefely of
one ground, so they may join in one volume to remain together to the behofe
of posterity, under the security of your Lordshyps favour, unto the which I
most humbly commend my self, and these my simple doings,

written this sixth of February. 1584. Your good Lordships, most humble always
to command. Arthur Goldinge.

The first Book of that worthy Cosmographer, Pomponius Mela, of the situation
of the world.
His Preface.
I Go about to entreat of the situation of the World, a cumbersome work,
which in no wise admits eloquece. For in a manner, it consists wholly of
the names of Nations and places, and of the order of them, which is somewhat
troublesome, a matter more tedious than handsome to bring to pass: howbeit
right worthy to be seen and known, as that (not for the witty handling
thereof by the writer, but in respect of it self,) may sufficiently
recompense the labour of such as take heed to it. An other time I will speak
of mo things, and more exactlie. As for now, I will meddle but with the
notablest things, and that breeflie. And first, I will show the plate of the
world, which be the greatest parts thereof, how each one of them lie to other,
and howe they are inhabited. Then will I peruse the outermost of them all
again, and set out the Sea coasts according as they be, both within and
without, and according as the Sea shoots into them, or beats about them:
with an addition of such things as are worthy remembrance, in the natures
of the Countries, and the inhabiters of them. And to the intent this thing may
the easilier be conceived and borne away, the sum of the whole shall be
repeated somewhat deeply.

The division of the world into four parts.
The first Chapter.
ALI this therefore whatsoever it be, which we term by the name of Heaven and
Earth, is one: and in one compass comprehends it self and all other things,
differs but in parts. From whence the sun rises, is called the East: where
it sets, is called the West: his race between them, is called the South: and
the quarter over against that, is called the North. In the midst heer of the
Earth rising in height, is environed round about with the Sea, and being cut
from the East to the West, into two sides, which are named half Spheres, it is
distinguished with five Zones. Whereof the middlemost is encumbered with heate, the
two uttermost with cold, the other two being habitable, have like seasons of
the year, but not both at one time. The Antycthones inhabit the one half
Sphere, we the other. For as much as the plat of the other is unknown, by
reason of the heate of the Zone, which is between them and us: we must
entreat of the situation of ours.

This therefore stretching from the East to the West, and (because it lies so)
being somewhat more in length, than in breadth, where it is broadest: is
enclosed wholly with the Occean, from whence it receives four seas: one at
the North, two at the South, the ^ourth at the West. The other three shall be
mentioned in their places. The mydland Sea, entering out of the West Occean, at
the Streightes of Marocke.
This being narrow, and not above ten miles over, opens the maine Lands,
and enters into them: where spreading far and wide, he drives the shores a
great way asunder, and makes them give room: the which on both sides growing
almost together again, do bring him to such a straight, as he is not full a
mile over: From thence, howbeit very leysurelie he wideneth himself again,
and anon after, wrests thorough a narrower gap than he went before. And when
he hath passed that, he wexeth eftsoones great and huge again, and with a
narrow mouth enters into a poole which comes against him, and (...) either
side of him, bears the name of our Sea into it. All this is called the maine^
Sea.

The gappes and entrance of the Sea where it comes in, we call Streights,
and the Greekes call it Porthmos. Where it flows in wideness, it takes
diverse syrnames, according to the places it beats upon. Where it first
becomes narrow, it is called Now called S. Georges arm.
Hellespont. Where it wideneth again, it is called The Sea of Constantinople.
Propontis. Where it streightneth again, it is called the The Straight of
Costatinople.
Bosphor of Thrace. Where it spreads out again, it is called The great Sea.
Pontus Euxinus. Where it medleth with the Lake, it is called the The Straight
of Caffa.
Bosphor of Cimmeria, and the Lake it self is called The Sea of Zabacca.
Maeotis. With this Sea, and with two noble Rivers, Now called Don.
Tainas and ^ilus, is the whole Earth divided into three parts.

Tanais proceeding from the North into the South, falls well near into the
midst of Maeotis: and right against him falls Nilus into the Sea. Whatsoever
Land lies from the Streightes to these Rivers, on the one side we call
Affricke, and on the other side Europe. That is to say, from the Streightes to
Nilus, Affricke: and from the said Streightes to Tanais, Europe. Whatsoever is
beyond, is Asia.

A brief description of Asia.
The second Chapter.
ON three sides it is bounded with the Occean, which bears diverse names
according to their Coasts: At the sun rising, with the east Occean, on the
south with the Indish, and on the North with the Scithish. The Country of Asia
it self, facing the East with a large and continual front, doth there
spread as much in wideness, as is the breadth of Europe Affricke, and the Sea
that is let in between them both. After it hath proceeded from thence, keeping
his full breadth, it receives out of the said Indish Occean, the Arabian and
Persian Sea, and out of the Scithish Occean, the Caspian Sea: and therefore
where it receives those Seas, it is somewhat narrowed, but by and by it
wideneth again, and becomes as broad as it was before. Lastly, when it is
come to his own end, and to the marches of other Lands, the middle part of it
butts upon our Seas, and the rest of it, runs on the one side up by Nilus,
and on the other side by Now called Don.
Tanais. The uttermost bounds thereof, come down with the channel of Nilus,
along the rivers side into the Sea, a great while together keeps cheek by
cheek with it, as the shore goes. Then steps he forth to meet the Sea as
it comes against him, and there first bends himself with a great bought.
Afterward he bears himself foreward with a huge front, to the straight of
Hellespont. From thence again he bends askew to the Of Thrace.
Bosphor, and bowing likewise by the side of Pontus, turns back, with an
elbow to the entrance of Maeotis: and thenceforth embracing the Lake, as it
were in a bosom, even unto Tanais, he becomes the bank of Tanais, even to
the head of it.

We understand that the first men in Asia Eastward, The fu^thest people of Asia
Eastward.
are the Indians, Seres, and Scithians. The Seres inhabit almost the middle
part of the East, The Setes.
the Indians and Scithians, The Indians and Scithians.
the two uttermost parts: both peoples extending far and wide, and not
only toward the East Occean. For the Indians stretch also into the South, The
s^tuation India.
and with sundry Nations of their own, one by an other, possess all the Sea
coast of the Indishe Occean, saving where the heate makes it uninhabitable. The
situation of Scit^ia.
And the Scithians likewise extend into the North, and to the Scithish Occean,
(saving where they be kept of with cold) even unto the Caspian gulf.

Next unto India is A^ane, The description of the South Countries of Asia.
and Gedrosis, and Persis, even unto the gulf of Persia, this gulf is
environed with the people of Persis, and the other with the people of Arabia.
All that is from Arabia unto Affricke, belongs unto the Ethiopians. The North
coast of Asia.
On the other side are the Caspians, next neighbours to the Scithians, beyond
whom are the Amazons, and out beyond them are the Hyperboreans. The mid land
Country, The middle Countries of Asia.
is inhabited by many and diverse Nations: as the Gaudars, and Paricans, the
Bactrians, and Susians, the Pharmacotrophies, the Bomarins, the Coamans, the
Rophans, and the Dahans. Upon the Scithians, and the Deserts of Scithia, and
upon the Caspian gulf, are the Comars, the Massagets, the Cadusians, the
Hyrcanians, and the Hyberians. Upon the Amazons and Hyperboreans, lye the
Cimmerians, the Scithians, the Eniochians, the Georgians, the Now called
Moscouites.
Mosches, the Corsites, the Phoristes, the Ryphakes, and where the Country
passes along unto our Seas, the Mardes, the Antibaraeans: and from thence
somewhat better known names, the Medes, the Armenians, the Comagenes, the
Murrans, the Vegets, the Cappadocians, the Galgreekes, the Lycaonians, the
Phrygians, the Pysidians, the Isaurians, the Lydians, and the Syrocilicians.
Again, of those that lye Southward, That is to say, Syrians.
Nations of one self sam^ name, inhabit the innermost coasts unto the gulf
of Persia. Upon this gulf lye the Parthians and Assyrians, and upon the other
Of Arabia.
gulf lye the Babylonians. Under Ethyope, the Egyptians possess all the
coast, The Countries of Asia, lying upon our mydland Sea.
along the banks of Nilus, the river of Egipt unto the Sea. Then stretches
Arabia, with a narowe front, to the next Seacoast. From Arabia, unto the bought
that we spake of before, lies Syr^a, and in the very bought itself, lies
Silicia: and without the bought lye Lycia and Pamphilia, Caria, Ionia, Aeolis,
and Troas, unto Hellespont. From thence to the Bosphor of Thrace, is Bithinia.
About Pontus, lye certain Nations with several bounds, called all by one
name, Pontians. Upon the Lake of Maeotis, border the Maeotians, and upon Tana^s
the Otherwise called Sarmatians.
Sauromates.

A brief description of Europe.
The third Chapter.
EVrope is bounded on the East, with T^nais, and Maeotis, and Pontus; on the
South, with the rest of our Sea, on the West with the Athlantish Occean, and on
the North with the British Occean. The Eastern coast thereof, from Tanais to
Hellespont, and all along the bank of the said River, and where it gathers
the bowing of the Lake to the Bosphor, and where it lies with his side against
Pontus, Propontis, and Hellespont: is not only situate directly over
against Asia, but also is like unto it in fashion of shores.

Between that and the Streightes, sometime shrinking a great way back, Of
Marocke.
and sometime shooting forward again, it makes three very great Baize, and
with as many great frontes advances it self into the deep. Without the
Streightes Westward, it is verie^vneuen, specially in the midst: but where
it runs by North, if lies almost as straight out, as if it were drawn by a
lyne, saving only in one or two places, where it retires a great way in.
The names of the midland sea.
The Sea which it receives, in the first Bay, is called Aegaean: that which
follows in the next, is in the mouth of it called Ionishe, and innermore,
Adriatishe: that which is received in the last Bay, we call Tuscan, and the
Greekes Tyrrhene. Of Nations, the first is Scithia, (an other Country that we
spake of before) extending from Tanais, Scithia in Europe now containing
Moscouia, Latuania, Polonia, Russia, c. Macedonia and Thrace.
well near to the one half of the side of Pontus. From hence into a part of
the Aegaean coast, lies ioyntlie the maine land of Macedonia and Thrace.

Then bolteth out Greece, and divides the Aegaean Sea, from the Ionishe Sea.
All along the side of the Adriatishe Sea, lies Ilirike. Greece.
Between the said Adriatishe Sea, and the Tuscan Sea, runs forth Italie.
In the innermost part of the Tuscan Sea, is France, and beyond that is Spain.
These lye from the East to the West, upon the South Europe.
It faces the North also with diverse fronts. For on that side is France
again, extending all the way from That is to say, the Tusoan or Tyrrhene Sea.
our Sea thither. From thence stretches Germany, to the Sarmatians, and they
again to Asia. Thus much as concerning Europe.

A brief description of Affricke.
The fourth Chapter.
AFfricke is bounded on the East part, with the river Nile, Affricke, which is
also called Lybia.
and on the other parts with the Sea. It is shorter then Europe, in as much as
it extends any where against the seacostes of Asia, nor lies side for side
against the sea* coasts of Europe.

Nevertheless, it is more in length then in breadth: and it is broadest, where
it bounds on the River. And as it proceedoth from thence, so rising higher
and higher, with mountains, specially in the middle, it bends askew toward
the West, and gathers softly into a ridge, and therefore in continuance,
grows somewhat narrower: where it ends, there is it narrowest. As much of
it as is inhabited, is exceeding fruitful. But for as much as most places of
it are unmannered, and either covered with barreine sands, or left vntylled, by
reason of the drought of the air and the soil, or else with many kinds of
beasts: it is rather waste, then well peopled. The Sea wherewith it is
enclosed, on the North we call Lybik^, on the South Ethyopish, and on the West
Athlantish. On that side that butts upon the Lybike Sea, next unto Nyle, is
the Province which they call Cyrene. Cyrene.
Then follows Affricke, whereof the whole Country takes his name. The rest
is possessed of the Numidians and Moors: of whom the Moors extend to the
Athlantish Occean. Beyond are the Nigrites, and Pharusians, unto Ethyope. The
Ethyopians possess both the rest hereof, and all that side which faces the
South, even unto the borders of Asia. But above those places that are beaten
upon with the Lybike Sea, are the Lybiaegyptians, and the white Ethyopians, and
the populous and manifold Nation of the Getulians. From thence lies a great
wide Country together, all utterly waste and uninhabited. Then the first that
we hear of Eastward, are the Garamantes, and next them the Awgyles and
Troglodikes, and lastly toward the West, the Athlant^. Innermost (if ye list
to believe it) the Egypanes, Woodwardes, or Wyldemen.
Blemyans, Gamphasants, and Satyrs (scarce men, but rather half Beasts,)
wandering up and down without house or home, rather have the Lands then
inhabit them.

This is the universal plate of the World, these are the great parts, these
are the fashions, and the Nations of the parts. Now that I must speak of the
bounds and borders of them severally, it is most handsome to begin, where our
Sea enters first into the maine Lands, and specially at those Countries that
lye on the right hand, as it comes in, and so to scour the Sea coast in order
as it lies, and when I have perused all things that butte upon the Sea, then
also to cast about those quarters that are environed with the Occean, until
that having travailed about the world, as well within as without, the race of
my attempted work, return to the place where it began.

A particular description of Affricke. Of Mauritania.
The fifth Chapter.
IT is said before, that it is the Athlantishe Occean, which touches the
maine land on the West. From hence as men sail into our Sea, Spain is on the
left hand, and Mauritania on the right. These are the first parts, the one of
Europe, the other of Affricke. The end of the coast of Mauritania, is Mulucha:
the head and beginning thereof is the Promontory, which the Greekes call The
Vineyard.
Ampelusia, and the Afres by an other word, that hath the same meaning. In the
same is a cave hallowed to Hercules, and beyond the Cave a very ancient Town
called Tingi, The Shield of Antaeus the Giant.
builded (as men say) by Antaeus. And there remains a Monument of the thing,
namely, a huge Shield, of the hide of an Elyphant, unable to be weelded of any
man now a days, by reason of the greatness thereof, which the dwellers
thereabouts believe, and report for a certainty to have been carried by
Antaeus, and therefore they honour it as a Relicque.

Then is there a very high Mountain, The pyllers of Her^ules.
set directly over against that which is in Spain, That in Spain is named
Abyla, and the other is named Calp^, and both of them b^ called the Pillars of
Hercules. Upon the naming of them so, Fame hath forged a Fable, that Hercules
cut a sunder those two hills, which erewhiles grew whole together in one
continual ridge, and by that means did let in the Occean, which erst was shut
out by the force of the Mountains, unto the places which it now overflows.
From hence the Sea spreads wider, and through his great violence, eats
winding gulfs into the maine Lands, which he disseuereth far a sunder:
Howbeit the Realm is unnoble, and hath scarce any thing famous in it, it is
inhabited with small Villages, and fendeth forth small brookes: it is better
of soil then of men, altogether vnrenowmed, by reason of the slouthfulnesse of
the people. Notwithstanding, among the things that I may vouchsafe to report,
are certain high Mountains, which being set on a row one by an other, as it
were for the nonce, are (by reason of their number and likeness one to an
other) called the seven brethren. There is also the river Tamuada, and
Rusicada, and Siga, little Cities, and a Haven, which for the largeness
thereof, is sir named the great Haven. The foresaid river Mulucha, is the
bound of the Kingdoms of Bocchus and Iugurth, which were puissant Realms in
old time.

Of Numidia.
The sixth Chapter.
FRom the said river Mulucha, to the bank of the river Ampsaga, lies
Numidia: not so large a Country as Mauritania, but better peopled, and
wealthier. Of the Cities which are in it, the greatest are Cirta, Cirta.
far from the Sea, now inhabited by the Sittians, and in times past, the
Palace of King Iuba and King Syphax, when it was in greatest wealth: Iol
sometime very base, but now very famous, in as much as it hath been the
Palace of Iuba, and is called Hereof the province Caesarie^sis took his name.
Caesarea. On the hitherside of this City (for it stands almost in the mid
shore) are the Towns of Cartenna and Arsenaria, and the Castle Ampsa, and the
gulf Laturus, and the river Sardabale: and beyond it, is the common burial
place of the blood Royal. Then comme Cities of Iasion, and Vthisia, and the
brookes of Ancus and Nabar, falling between them into the Sea: and certain
other things, which to suppress with silence, is neither loss of matter, nor
prejudice to fame. Strange things in the inner parts of Numidia.
Innermost, and a great way off from the shore, (a wonderful matter, if it be
to be believed) the back bones of Fishes, broken shells of Murreies and
Disters, Stones worn, as is wont to be with beating waives, and not differing,
Anchors fastened as in rocks of the Sea, and other such like signs and tokens
of the Sea, flowing even unto those places in times past, are reported to be,
and to be found in the barreine feelds that bear nothing.

The lesser Affricke.
The seventh Chapter.
THe Country that follows from the Foreland of Metagonium, to the Philens
altars, doth properly bear the name of Affricke. In it are the Towns of
Hippo Rhegius, and Rusicade, and Tabraca. Then three Forelands, called the
white Mount, Appollos Mount, and Mercuries Mount, shooting hugelie into the
deep, make two great Baize. The hithermost is called Hippon of Hippo
Diarrhytus, which is a Town standing upon the riuadge of it.

At the other are Laelyes camp, Cornellis camp, the river Bragada, Vtica, and
Carthage.
the Cities of Vtica, and Carthage, both famous, and both builded by the
Phaenicians: Vtica ennobled with the destruction of Cato, and Carthage for the
destruction of it self: now a free Town of the Romanes, and in old time a
striuer with them for their Empire: even now again wealthy, and even now more
famous for her former destruction, then for her present recovery. From hence
the Or Whashe.
Syrt, stand Leptis, Clupea, Abrotanum, Taphre and Naples, as among base
things the famousest. The mouth of the Syrt, The lesser Syrt, or short Whashe.
where it takes in the open Sea, is almost a hundred miles broad, and it is
three hundred miles compass by the banks of it: but it is harbroughlesse and
rough, and partly by reason of the numbers of shallows, quick sands, and
flattes that are in it, but more for the changeable alteration of the sea, in
his ebbing and flowing, it is exceeding dangerous.

Above this is a great Poole, which receives into it the river Triton, and the
Poole it self is also called Triton, Whereof Minerua hath one of her sir
names, The Poole and river Triton.
because (as the inhabiters thereabouts suppose) she was bred there. And they
make the tale to have some likelihood of truth, because they keep holy the
same day, which they think she was borne on, with solemme Ioustes and
Tourneies of young Maidens. Beyond that, is the Town Oea, and the river
Cimphis, which runs through most fruitful fields.

Then is there an other Leptis, and an other Syrt, of like name and nature to
the former, The greater Syrt, or Whash.
but almost half as big again as the other, both at the mouth and in the
compass of it. Unto this belongs the Foreland of Boreon: and the coast
beginning at the same, Loteaters.
(which the Loteaters are reported to have possessed,) from thence forth to
Phycus, (which also is an other Forelande) it is altogether harbroughlesse. The
notable zeal of the Philens, toward their Country.
The Altars aforesaid, took their name of two brethren, called Phile^s, who
being sent from Carthage against the Cyrenians, to make a final end of war
that had been long between them, for the bounds of their Countries, to the
great slaughter of both parts: when covenant was not kept according to
agreement, (which was, that wheresoever the Ambassadors met, which were sent
out of both Cities at a time prefixed, there should be the bounds of both the
Realms) upon couenaunting a new, that whatsoever was on this side, should
fall to the lot of their own countreyfolke, suffered them selves to be
buried quick in this place: a wonderful thing, and right worthy to be had in
remembrance.

Of Cyrenaica.
The eight Chapter.
FRom thence to Catabathmos, is the Province of Cyrenaica, wherein are the
Oracles of Hammon, famous for the assured truth thereof, and a fountain which
they call Sonnewell, A wonderful Hill.
and a certain Mountain, holy to the South wind. For if this Hill be
touched with mans hand, the wind rises exceeding boisterous, and turmoiling
the sands, as it were waters, rages as the sea doth with waives. A wonderful
Well.
The Well at midnight, is scalding whote: afterward by little little, falling
to be but luke warm, at day light it becomes cold: and as the sun rises
in height, it wexeth colder and colder, so that at noone it is most extremely
cold. From that time it gathers heate again, and in the beginning of the
night becomes warm, and as it grows further in the night, it increases
more in heate, so that at midnight it is sealding where again.

Upon the shore, are the Forclandes of Zephyrion and Naust^thmos, the Haven of
Paraetonie, ^
and the (...), Hesperia, Apollonia, Ptolemais, A^moe, and (...) it self,
whereof the whole Country takes his (...) Catabathmos, (which is a slope
valley, shoring down to Egipt-ward) is the uttermost bound of Affricke.

Thus are the coasts inhabited, The manners, apparel, and diet of the people
on the Sea coast of Affricke.
for the most part with civil people, after the manner of our Countries,
saving that some of them differ in languages, and in the serving of their
Gods, which they keep of their own Country, worshipping them after their
own Country fashion. There are no Cities near one to an other, howbeit
there be houses which are called Villages. Their fare is harde and without
cleanliness. The Noble men and Gentlemen go in Cassocks, and the common
people are clad in skins of Cattle and wild Beasts: the ground is their
bed to rest on, and their Table to feed on. Their vessels are made, either
of would or of bark: their drink is milk, and the juice of berries: their
meat is for the most part Uenison, for they spare their Cattle as long as
they can, because it is the only best thing which they have.

The vplandishe folk do yet after a more rude fashion, wander abroad
following their Cattle: The manners of the vplandishe folk of Affricke.
and according as pasturage leads them, so remove they themselves and their
sheddes from place to place, and wheresoever day ^aileth them, there they abide
all night. And albeit that being thus every where scattered by householdes,
and without any law, they consult not in common upon any thing: yet
notwithstanding, for as much as every of them hath many Wives at once, and by
reason thereof many Children and kinsefolke, there never lives any small
company of them together in one place.

Of those sorts of people, The manners of the Athlantes.
which are reported to be beyond the Wilderness, the Athlantes curse the
Sun, both when he rises, and when he sets, as noisome both to themselves
and to their grounds. They have no names severally, neither feed they of any
thing that bears life, neither is it given them to see such things in their
sleep, as other men see.

The Troglodytes, The manners of the Troglodytes.
possessing not any goods at all, do rather iabber than speak, dwelling in
Caves under the ground, and seeding upon Serpents.

Among the Garamants, Of the Garamantes.
also are those kind of Cattle that graze sidling, with their necks awry,
for their horns growing down to the groundwarde, will not suffer them to
feed right foreward. No man there, hath any Wife of his own. They that are
every where borne, of this uncertain and confused companying together, take
those for their fathers, whom they most resemble in countenance and making.

The Awgyles think there are none other Gods, The Awgyles.
but the Ghosts of dead men. By them they swear, at them they ask counsel,
as at Oracles: and when they have prayed what they would have, they lye down
upon their graves, and receive dreams for answers. It is a solemn custom
among them, that their Women, the first night they are married, shall abandon
themselves to the common abuse of all men that come with reward: and it is
counted the greatest honour that may be, to have had to do with many, at that
time: but ever after, they keep themselves exceeding chaste.

The Gamphasantes are naked, The Gamphasantes.
and (...) utterly ignorant o^ all manner of armour: knowing neither howe to
shun a Dart, nor yet howe to throw it: and therefore if they meet any body,
they run away, and dare not either come in company, or (...) communicate
with any other, then such as be of their own disposition and nature.

The Blemmyes are without headdes, The Blemmyes.
and have their faces in their breasts. Satyrs or Woodwardes.
The Satyrs have nothing of man, saving shape. The shape of the Panes or
Gotefeete.
Aegypanes is such, as it is reported to be. And thus much of Affricke.

A particular description of Asia. Of Egipt.

EGipt, the first part of Asia, lying between ^atabathmos and Arabia, draws

from this shore, and runs styll Southwarde, until it bear upon Ethyope
with his back. This Land is always without rain, but yet wonderful
fertile, and a very fruitful mother, both of men other living wights. Of
Nilus, the great river of Egipt.
The cause hereof is Nilus, the greatest river of all those that fall into our
Sea. This stream springing out of the Deserts of Affricke, is neither by and
by sayleable, nor by and by called by the name of Nile: but when he hath come
down a long way, single, and yet rough: about Meroe a very large Island, it is
sheaded into Ethyope, and on the one side is called Astaboras, and on the other
side Astapus. Where it comes together again into one channel, there it
takes the name of Nile. From thence, partly rough, and partly sayleable, it
falls into a great Lake, through which it sweepeth with a violent course, and
embracing another I'll called Tachempso, runs down to Elephant, a City of
Egipt, all the way as yet styll rough and raging. Then at length wexing
somewhat mylder, and now in manner sayleable: first about the Town of
Cercassye, it begins to have three channels. Afterward, dividing it self
once or twice more, at Delta and Metilin, it passes on wandering, and
dispearsed through Egipt, and at length parting it self into seven channels,
and yet continuing very huge in every of them, it falls into the That is
our mid-land Sea.
Sea. It doth not only wade through Egipt, but also overflowing it in the
chief of summer, moysteth it with waters so effectual to engender and
nourish, Water-horsses, and Crocodiles.
that over and besides that it swarmeth with Fish, and breeds Water-horsses
and Crocodiles which are huge monstrous Beasts, it also sheadeth life into
the cloddes, and shapeth living creatures of the very moolde. Which thing is
hereby manifest, for that when he hath ceased flowing, and is fallen again
within his channel, there are seen in the moist fields, certain creatures
as yet not perfect, but then first beginning to receive breath, in some part
having already their full shape, and in part as yet stark earth.

Moreover, Opinions of the flowing of N^le.
it increases, either because the snow, being melted with the great heate,
falls more abundantly from the great high Mountains of Ethyope, then that it
can be received into his banks: or else because the Sun, which in winter time
was nearer the ground, and therefore abated his spring, now in summer time
mounts higher, and suffers it to rise whole and full, as it should be: or
else for that the North east winds, which ordinarily blowing in that season
of the year, driving the clouds from the North into the South, do power
down showers upon the head of his spring, or meeting his stream by the way
with contrary blasts, do stay his course in the coming down, or else
stop his mouths with sand, which they drive to the shore together with the
waives: and so it becomes greater, either because it loses nothing of it
self, or because it receives more then ordinary, or because it utters
less than it should do.

But if there be an other World, and that the Anticthones. go feet to feet
against us in the South, it were not much unlike to be true, that the river
rising in those Lands, after it hath pierced under the Sea in a privy
channel, should vent again in our World, and by that means increase at the
standing of the (...), for as much as it is winter at that time he springs.

demean themselves far otherwise then other men. In mourning for their dead,
they besmere themselves with doong, and they think it not lawful to burn
them or bury them: but by the advise of Poticaries, they keep them preserved
in their privy chambers. They write their Letters awkelie. They temper clay
with their hands, and kneede dow with their feet. Their Women plead matters
in Courts, and look to foreign affairs, and the men spin and card, and
take charge of the house at home. The Women bear burdens on their shoulders,
the men on their heads. When the Parents fall in poverty, the women are
bound of necessity to find them, the men are at choice. They eat their
meat openly, and without their doors, and do their natural needs in the
innermost parts of their houses.

They worship the shapes of many Beasts, The superstition of the Egiptians.
or (to say the truth) the very beasts themselves, some one Beast, and some
an other: in so much as it is a matter of life and death to have killed some
Beasts, even unawares. And when they die either by disease or by mischance, it
is their custom to bury them and morn for them.

The common God of all the people is Apis, a black Bull, marked with certain
spots, and unlike other Bulls in tongue and fail. It is a rare matter to
find one of that breed. For (as they hold opinion) he is not engendered by a
Beast of the same kind, but is conceived by supernatural power of heavenly
fire, and the day that he is calved, is held for a most holy and Feastiuall
day, of all the whole Nation.

hath twice gone down where it now rises.

Of Syria.
The eleventh Chapter.
SYria runs a great way along the Sea^ coast, and very far also into the
mayne Land, and is called by sundry names. The names or divisions of Syria.
For it hight Caele, and Mesopotamia, and Damascene, and Adiabene, and
Babilonia, and Iewrie, and Sophene: furthermore, it bears the name of
Palestine, where it butts upon Arabia and Phaenicia, and where it joins to
Cilicia, it is called Antioche. In old time and a long while together, it was
a puissant Realm: but most puissant when Semiramis reigned over it. There are
surly many notable works of hers, The praise of Semyramis.
but two of them pass all the rest: namely, the building of that wonderful
great City Babilon, and the letting in of the rivers Euphrates and Tigris,
into those Countries which before time were dry. Howbeit in Palestine, there
is a great and strong fortified Town called Gaza, Why Gaza was so named.
for so the Persians term a Treasorie: and thereupon it took that name,
because when Cambises invaded Egipt with war, he bestowed his provision for

that Cepheus reigned, upon likelihood, for that certain old Altars, with

his brother Phineus.

And besides that, for a more assurance of the thing so renowned in verses and
old tales, and of the saving of Andromade by Perseus: they show for a plain
Monument, the excessive great bones of the Monstar of the Sea.

Of Phaenicia.
The twelfth Chapter.
PHaenicia, is renowned for the Phaenicians, a politic kind of men, and
both in feats of war and peace peerless. The first inuenters of Letters,
and of other things.
They first invented Letters, and Letter matters, and other Arts also: as to
go to the Sea with Ships, to fight upon the water, to reign over Nations,
to set up Kingdoms, and to fight in order of battle. In it is Tyre, Tyre.

upon the Sea coast, before it was taken by the Persians.

Between that and the foreland of It may be interpreted fair prospect.
Euprosopon, there are two Towns, called Byblos and Botris: and beyond them
were three other, each distant a furlong a sunder, and therefore the place was
of the number called Tripolis: Tripolis.
Tripolia.
then follow the Castle Simyra, and a City not vnrenowmed, called Marathos.
From thence the Country being not crooked with the Sea, but lying right forth
side by side unto it, bends his shore into the maine Land, and receives a
great Bay. About the which dwell rich people, the cause whereof is the
situation of the place, for that the Country being fertile, and furnished
with many Rivers, able to bear Ships, serves well for the easy exchange
and conveying in of all kind of wares, both by Sea and Land.

Within that Bay, Syria of Antioche.
is first the residue of Syria, which is syrnamed Antioche, and on the shore
thereof, stand the Cities Seleuca, Paltos, Beritos, Laodicia, and Arados:
between which Cities run the Rivers Lychos, Hypatos, and Orontes. Then
follows the Mountain Amanus, immediately from whence begins Myriandros,
and Cilicia.

Of Cilicia.
The thirteenth Chapter.
IN the innermost retreat, there is a place, sometime of great renown, as a
beholder and witness bearer of the discomfiture of the Persians by great
Alexander, and of the flight of Darius: at that time having in it a famous
great City called Issos, whereof the Bay* is named the Bay of Issos, The Bay
of Issos.
but now having not so much as a little Town. Far from thence lies the
Foreland Amanoides, between the Rivers Pyramus and Cydnus, Pyramus being the
nearer to Issos, runs by Mallon, and Cydnus, runs out beyond through
Tarsus. Then is there a City possessed in old time by the Rhodians and
Argiues, and afterward at the appointment of Pompey by Pirates, now called
Pompeiople, then called Soloe.

Hard by, on a little hill, The Tomb of the Poet Aratus.
is the Tomb of the Poet Aratus, worthy to be spoken of, because it is
unknown, why stones that are cast into it do leap about. Not far from
hence, is the Town Corycos, environed with a Haven and the salt water, and
joined with a narrow balke to the firm Land.

Above it is a Cave named Corycus, The Cave of Corycus.
of singular nature, and far more excellent, then may with ease be described.
For gaping with a wide mouth, even immediately from the top it opens* the
Mountain butting upon the Sea, which is of a great height, as it were of a ten
furlongs. Then going deep down, and the further down the larger, it is
green round about with budding Trees, casts it self into a round vault on
both sides, full of woods, so marvelous and beautiful, that at the first it
amazes the minds of them that come in to it, yet makes them think they have
never seen enough of it. There is but one going down into it, narrow and
rough, of a mile a half long, by pleasant shadows and coverts of woods,
yielding a certain rude noise, with rivers trickling on either hand. When ye
come to the bottom, there again opens an other Cave, worthy to be spoken
of for other things. It makes the enterers into it afraid with the din of
Timbrels, which make a ghastly and great rattling within. Afterward, being a
while lightsome, anon the further ye go, wexing darker, it leads (such as
dare adventure) quite out of sight, carries them deep, as it were in a Mine:
where a mighty river rising with a great breast, doth but only show it
self, and when it hath gushed violently a while in a short channel, sinks
down again, and is no more seen. Within is a waste space, more horrible then
that any man dare pearce into it, and therefore it is unknown. It is
altogether stately and undoubtedly holy, and both worthy, and also believed
to be inhabited of Gods. Every thing presents a statelynesse, and sets
out it self with a certain Majesty.

There is an other beyond, which they call Typhos Typhos cave.
cave, with a narrow mouth, and (as they that have tried it do report) very
lowe, and therefore dimmed with continual darkness, and not easy to be
sought out: howbeit, because it was sometime the chamber of the Giant Typho, an
because it now out of hand stifles such things as are let down into it, it
is worthy to be mentioned for the nature thereof, and for the tale that is
reported of it. Beyond that, are two For^landes, that is to say, Sarpedon,
sometime the bound of King Sarpedons Realm, and Anemurium, which parts
Cilicia from Pamphilia, and between them Celendris and Natidos Towns builded
and peopled by the Samians, whereof Celendris is nearer to Sarpedon.

Of Pamphilia.
The foureteenth Chapter.
IN Pamphilia, is a River able to bear Ships, called Melas, Melas.
a Town called Sida, and an other River called Eurimedon. Eurymedon.
At this River, Cymo Captain of the Athenians, gat a great victory of the
Persians and Phaenicians, in a battle upon the water. Into the Sea where this
battle was fought, out of a very high hill looks the Town of Aspendos,
which was builded by the Argiues, and inhabited by the people of the Country
about it.

Then are there two other mighty streams, called Oestros and A sluice or
flood-gate.
Cataractes. Oestros is easy to be sailed: the other hath his name of his
headlong fall. Between them is the Town Perga, and the Temple of Diana, which
of the Town is sir named Pergaea. Beyond them is Mount Sarde^isos, and
Phaselis a Town builded by Mopsus, which is the end of Pamphilia.

Of Lycia.
The fifteenth Chapter.
SVccessiuelie, Lycia so called of Lycus, the son of King Pandion, (as report
goes) annoyed in old time with the fires of Chimera, encloses a great Bay,
between the Haven of Sida, and the Foreland of Taurus. Mount Taurus it self
rising of a huge height at the Eastern sea shore, The description of mount
Taurus.
proceeds straight forth in one continual ridge from thence into y^ West,
with his right side toward the North, and his left side toward the South,
bouding many great Nations* where he runs out in banks, and where he
divides the Countries, he passes to the Sea. As Taurus is the general name
of him whole together, The sundry names of mount Taurus.
so is it also his name, where he faces the East: next he is called Haemodes,
and Caucasus, and ^aropamisus: then Caspian Streights, Niphates, and the
Streights of Armenia, and (where he butts upon our Sea) Taurus again. Behind
his said Foreland, is the river Lymira* Lymira.
and a City of the same name, and a number of Towns of no great renown,
saving Patara, which is ennobled by the Temple of Apollo, sometime like to that
at Delphos, as well in riches as also for the trueness of the Oracle. Beyond
is the river Panthus, and the Town Panthos: the Mountain Crag, and the City
Telmisos, which ends Lycia.

Of Caria.
The sixteenth Chapter.
AFterward follows Caria, inhabited with people of an unknown beginning:
some think them to be bred in the Land, some think they were Pelasgians,
othersome think they were Candians, a kind of people loving feats of Arms
and fighting, so well, that for wages they served also in foreign and strange
wars. Here are a few Castles, and then the two Forelandes of Pedalion and
Crya, and by the River Calbis side, the Town of Caunus, diffamed for the
^thinesse of the inhabiters.

From thence to Halycarnassus, lye these things, certain Towns of the
Rhodians: two Havens, the one named Gelos, and the other Thissamissa, according
to the name of the City that it enuironeth. Between them is the Town of
Larumna, and the Hill Pandion shooting into the Sea. The three Baize on a row,
Thymnias, Schaenus, and Bubessus. The Foreland of Thymnias, is Aphrodisium:
Schaenus enuironeth Hylas: and Bubessus compasses about Cynotus. Guidus
stands in an angle of a piece of ground, enclosed almost altogether with the
Sea. between it and the gulf of Ceranie, in the retreit of Euthana,
Halycarnassus.
is Halycarnassus, a Town inhabited by the Argiues. worthy to be had in
remembrance, not only for the founders thereof, A notable Tomb.
but also for the Tomb of King Ma^solus, which is one of the seven woonders of
the world, and was builded by Artemis^a. Artemisia.
Beyond Halycarnassus, are these things: the shore of Leuca, the Cities
Myndus, Aryanda, and Naples: and the Baize of Iasius, and Basilicus. In Iasius
is the town of Bargylos.

Of Ionia.
The seventeen Chapter.
BEyond the Bay of Basilicus, Ionia win^deth it self in certain Angles, and
first of all, beginning to fetch about the Foreland of Possideum, it enuironeth
the Oracle of Apollo, The Oracle of Branchide.
called in old time the Oracle of Branchide, and now the Oracle of Didymus.
The City Miletus, sometime the chief of all Ionia, both in feats of war
and peace, the Country of Thales the Astrologer, and of Tymothie the Musician,
and of Ana^mander the natural Philosopher, and woorthelie renowned ^or the
excellent wits of others that were borne there: is a^ter a manner called
Ionia. There is also the City Hyppis, where the River Meander falls into
the Sea, and the Mountain Latmus, famous for the Fable of Endymion, whom (as
men say) the Moon was in love with. Afterward bowing again, it enuironeth
the City P^ene, and the mouth of the River Gessus, and anon after as it
casts a greater circuit, so it comprehends mo things. There is the holy
Land called Panionium, so named, because the Ionians occupy it in common.
There is the town Phygela, builded (as some say) by fugitives, to which
report, the name seems agreeable. There is Ephesus, Ephesus.
and the most famous Temple of Diana, which the Amazons are reported to have
consecrated, when they held the souereintie of Asia. There is the River
Cayster, Cayster.
there is Lebedos, and the Cappell of Apollo, Clari^us, which Manto the
Daughter of Tyresia builded when she fled from the Epigons, that had gotten the
victory of the Thebanes: and Colophon which Mopsus the son of the said
Manto builded at the Foreland wherewith the Bay is enclosed, which on the other
side makes an other Bay called Smyrnie, and shoots out the rest with
narrow shanks. From thence it spreads wider, in manner like a Ness, above
the Streightes, on the hither side to Teos, and on the further side to
Clazomen. And because the hinder parts are straightened and knit together
with the nearness of the Sea, with diverse frontes they face diverse Seas. In
the vary Ness, is Coryna. Within the Bay of Smyrnie, is the River Thermodon,
and the City Leuca: and without it is Phocis, the uttermost part of Ionia.

Of Aeolis.
The eighteen Chapter.
THe next Country, since the time it began to be inhabited by the Aeolians,
took the name of Aeolis, The Country about Troy.
whereas before times it was called Mysia: and where it bounds upon
Hellespont, as long as the Troianes possessed it, it was called Trod. The
first City they call Myrina, after the name of Myrinus the founder thereof.
The next, Pelops builded* at his return out of Greece, when he had overcome
Oenomaus. Cyme, Cyme, a Captain of the Amazons.
a Captain of the Amazons, driving away the inhabiters that dwelt before at
Cyme, named it so, after her own name.

Above runs the River Caycus, between Elea and Pitane, Archesilas the
Philosopher.
where Archesilas was borne, that most famous president the Academy, which
affirmed the knowledge of nothing. Then is the Town of Cama, situate in a
foreland: as soon as men are past that, there receives them a Bay of no
small bigness, which bows a great way of and softly withdraws by little
and little into the land, even unto the foot of Mount Ida. The Straight
between the Seas, is sprinkled with a few Cities, of which the notablest is
Cistena. In the innermost part of the Bay, a field called Thebes, contains
the Towns of Adrimittium, Austra, and Teressa, lying one by an other in the
same order, as they be rehearsed.

In the other side is An^andros. Why An^andros was so named.
There are reported two causes, of the naming of this Town so. Some say that
Ascanius the son of Aenaeas reigned there, being taken prisoner by the
Greekes, gave them this Town for his ransom. Other think it was builded by
such as in a tumult and insurrection, were driven out of the I'll of Andros.
These would have Antandros taken for Andros, and the other would have it taken
as it were for a man. The coast following, reaches to Gargara Aslos Towns
builded and inhabited by the Aetolians. The Country about Troy.
Then an other Bay called the Greekishe Haven, winds his banks not far
from Troye, that City most renowned for the wars and destruction thereof.
Here was the Town Sigae^, where the Greekes encamped, during the time of the
war. Here Called also Panthus.
S^amander, running down from Mount Ida, and Simois, Rivers of greater Fame
then stream, fall into the Sea.

Mount Ida it self being renowned with the contention of the Goddesses, Mount
Ida, and of the rising of the Sun there.
and the judgment of Paris, shows the rising of the Sun after an other
sort, then it is wont to be seen in other Lands. For unto such as look out
of the top of it, there appear (almost at midnight) dispearsed fires
glistering every where, and as the day light approaches, so seem they to
meet and join together, until that being assembled more and more, afterward
they grow feawer, and lastly, burn all in one flame. And when it hath so
shined a good while together bright, and like a fire, it gathers it self
round, and becomes a great globe.

The same also appears a great while huge, and joined with the earth, and
afterward by little and little wexing less, and the more it decreases wexing
brighter, last of all it chase away the night, and becoming the Sun,
rises with the day.

Without the Bay, are the Rhetaean shores renowned with the famous Cities of
Rhetaeum and Dardania, The Tomb of Aiax, the son of Telamon.
but most of all with the Tomb of Aiax. From hence the Sea wexeth narrower,
and now no more washes away the Land, but dividing it again, cutteth through
the bank that meets it at the Streightes of Hellespont, and makes the
Lands where it runs, to have sides again.

Of Bithynia.
The nineteen Chapter.
INnermore are the Bithynians and Mariandynes. On the Sea coast are the Greek
Towns of Abydos, Lampsacum, Pa^ion, and Priapos. Abydos is famous for the
intercourse of He means of Leander and Hero.
great Love in old time. The Phocans gave Lampsacum that name, upon this
occasion, because when they asked counsel of the Oracle, into what Country
they should chiefly go, answer was made, that they should there take up
their dwelling place, where it first sh^ned.

Then again the Sea becomes more open, which is called Propontis. The river
Granicke.
Into it falls the River Granike, famous for the first battle that was
fought there, between the Persians and Alexander. Beyond the River, in the
neck of a piece of ground, which is almost an I'll, stands Cyzicum, a Town
so named of one Cyzicus, vanquished in battle and slain (as we read) unawares
by the Minyes, as they went to Colchos ward. After are Place and Scylace,
little Towns builded by the Argiues, on the back part whereof hangs the
Hill Olympus of Mysia, Olympus of Mysia.
as the the inhabiters call it, which sends forth the River Rhindacus into
those quarters that follow.

There abouts breed Snakes of unmeasurable bigness, Wonderful Snakes
wonderful, not for their hugeness only, but also for that when they have
retired into this channel of the said River, to avoid the heate of the
Sun, there putting up their heads and gaping, they swallow in the Birds
that pass over, fly they never so high and so swiftly.

Beyond Rhindacus is Dascylos, and Myrlea, which the Colophonians builded. From
thence are two good measurable Baize. The one of them being nameless,
compasses in the City Cion, a most commodious Mart Town of Phrygia, which
lies not far from thence: the other Bay compasses in the Olbians. In the
Foreland it bears the Chapel of Neptune, and in the bosom the Town of
Astacon builded by the Megarians. Then the Land strikes before again, and
makes a narrow channel for the Sea to pass out at into Pontus: and the
Bosphor of Thrace (as is aforesaid) disseuereth Europe five furlongs from
Asia.

In the very mouth of the Streightes is a Temple, and a Town called This
Town is over against Canstantinople.
Chalcedon. The founder of the town was Argias Prince of the Megarians: the
Idol of the Temple is Iupiter, and the builder thereof was Iason. Here the
Sea spreads it self wide (saving where the Forelandes be) stretching out on
both sides, with a long and direct shore, and then forth bending inward. But
because it extends not so much foreward, it wideneth on both hands, the
bowing inward of it with smooth points until it grow to a narrow issue on
both sides, is as like as can be to a Or a Turki^ bow.

Of Paphlagonia.
The twenty Chapter.
THen follows the Town of Tios, sometime inhabited by the Milesians, but now
altogether Paphlagonish, as well the people as the soil: in the mid shore
whereof almost is the foreland Cerambis, on the hither side whereof is the
river Parthenie, and the Cities Sesamus, and Cromna, and Cytoros builded by
Cytorus the son of Phrixus. Then follows Cimolis, and Armine, which ends
Paphlagonia,

Of the Chalybies.
The xxi. Chapter.
THe Chalybies, who were next neighbours to Paphlagonia, have two right famous
Cities, Amysos and Synope, the place where the doggishe Diogenes was borne:

and the Rivers of Halys and Thermodon. By Halys, is the City Lycast: and
along by Thermodon, is a plain wherein was the Town Themyseyre, and the camp
of the Amazons, and therefore they call it Amazonia, Upon the Chalybies, do

companying with their women in common. They choose their King openly by
voices, and keep him most streightlie in prison and gyves: and if he offend in
misgouernement, they make him fast all a whole day for his penance. But they
are churlish, vnmannerlie, and very hurtful to such as arrive among them.
Furtherfoorth are people less savage, but they also are vnmannerlie and
uncivil as well as the other, which are called Longpa^es, Dischers, and Buxers:
and a few Cities, whereof the notablest are Cerasus, and Trapaesus.
Trebizond.
From thence is a place where the Coast that is drawn along from the Bosphor
takes his end, and so forth bowing himself forward in the bosom of the
shore over against it, makes the narrowest angle of Pontus. Here are the
Colchians: Colchos.
from hence issues Phasis. Here is a Town of the same name that the River is
of, builded by Athenistagoras a Milesian. Here is the Temple of Phryxus, and a
wood famous for the old Fable of the golden fleece. The Ceraunishe Hills, and
the names of the same.


From hence rise certain Mountains, which stretch out with a long ridge,
until they join with the Ryphaean Hills, which running with the one end
toward Euxinus, Maeotis, and Tanais, and with the other of the Caspian Sea, are
called They may be called the Thunder-hylles.
Ceraunii. The same are called by sundry other names, as Taurish, Moschian,
Amazonish, Caspian, Coraxincian, and Caucasean, according to the sundry
Nations that border upon it.

But in the first turning of the winding shore, there is a Town which the
Merchants of Greece are reported to have builded: and because when they were
tossed with a dark tempest, knew not what Land it was, the crowing of a Swan
gave them knowledge, they called it It may be interpreted Swanton.
Cygnus. The residue of it along the waste Sea, is inhabited by cruel and
uncivil Nations, called Black Cotes.

Maeotis dwell the Syndones. In the marthes of the Eniochyes, is Dioscurias

builded by Castor and Pollux, when he entered the Sea with Iason: and Syndos in
the marches of the Syndones, builded by the inhabiters of that Land. Then the
Country writhing aside, and spreading somewhat in breadth, shoots forth
between Pontus and Maeotis to the Bosphor, which running with two channels
into the Lake and the Sea, makes Corocondama almost an Island. There are four
Cities, Hermonassa, Cepoe, Phanagoria, and in the very mouth Cimmerium.

When men are entered here, the large and wide Lake receives them, which
(where it touches the firm land) is enclosed with a bending shore, and where
it is nearer the Sea, being as it were ouer-dreeped with a bank (saving where
the mouth of it is) it is almost like unto Pontus, but that it is not so big.
The coast which bends from the Bosphor unto Tanais, is inhabited by the
Toreates, the Arichies, the Phicors, and (next of all to the mouth of the
river) by the Iaxamathians, which Nations are called by one general name
Maeotians.

the women exercise the same feats that the men do, insomuch that they be not
priueledged from the wars. The men fight a foot with arrows, and the women
fight on horseback. Neither encounter they with weapons, but such as they can
snare with ropes, they strangle with drawing them after them. They marry:
howbeit, to the intent they may be counted marriageable, the matter consists
not in their years, for they abide unmarried until they have killed an enemy.

the Bosphor, and some part also of Pontus are frozen with the winters cold, he
only bearing summer and winter a like, runs always at one staye, both full
and swift. The banks thereof, and the Countries adjoining to the banks, are
inhabited by the Sauromats, which is one nation of diverse peoples, and
diversely named. First are the Maeotians, called the Women-seruers, the
Kingdom of the Amazons. The Budines possess the fat pasture grounds, which
otherwise are but barreine and naked fields. The Gelones inhabit a City

lies a large Country, rough with continual hills, and altogether Desert.
These Arymphaeans live most vprightlie. In steed of houses, they haunt woods.
Their food is berries: and as well the women as the men go bare headed. They
are therefore counted holy: and so far is any man of those so many cruel
Nations from doing them harm, that if other folk fly unto them, they be as
safe as in a Sanctuary. Beyond them rises the Mountain Riphey, and beyond
the Mountain lies the ^oast that butts upon the Occean.

Of Scithia, of Europe.
The first Chapter.
THE marches* and situation of Asia, extending to our Sea and the river
Tanais, are such as I have showed before. Now to them that row back again
down the same river into Maeotis, on the right hand is Europe, which was
directly on the left side of them, as they sailed up the stream: it butts
upon the mountain Riphey* for the same also extends hither. The snow which
falls continually, doth make the Country so vntrauellable, that a man is not
able to see any farnesse into it.

Beyond is a Country of a very rich soil, but uninhabitable

Hamaxobits. Then the coast that runs out askew to the Bosphor, is enclosed
between Pontus Maeotis. The side toward the Lake, is possessed by the
Satarches. The breast toward the Bosphor of Cimmeria, hath the towns of
Myrmecion, Panticape, Theodosia, and Hermesium. The other side toward Pontus
Euxinus, is possessed by the Taurians. Above them is a Bay full of Havens, and
therefore is called the fair Haven, and it is enclosed between two
Forelandes: whereof the one called the Rams head, butts against the
Foreland of Cerambis, which we said before to be in Asia: and the other called
Mayden-hyll.
Parthenion, hath near unto it a town called Cherronesus builded (if it may
be believed) by Diana, and is very famous for the Cave Nymphaeum in the top
thereof hallowed to the Nymphs. Then the Sea fleets under a bank, and
following continually upon the shores flying back (which the Satarkes and
Taurians possess) until he be but five miles from Maeotis, makes a Ness.
That which is between the Lake the Bay, is named Taphre, and the Bay it self
is called Carciuites. In the same is the City Carciue, by the which do run
two Rivers, Gerros Hypacyris, which fall into the Sea in one mouth, but come
from two several heads, and from two several places. For Gerros sweepeth
between the Basilids and Nomades. Then are there woods, whereof those Countries
bear very great store, and there is the River Panticapes, which disseuereth
the Nomades and Georgians. Georgians of Europe.
From thence the land wideneth far, and ending in a slender shank, ioineth
with the Sea shore. Afterward enlarging again measurablie, it sharpens it
self by little little, and gathering his long sides as it were into a point,
grows into the likeness of the blade of a sword laid flatlinges.

Achilles entering the Sea of Pontus with a Navy like an enemy, after he had
gotten victory, is reported to have made a gaming in the same place for joy
thereof, and to have exercised himself his men in running, while they rested
from war, and therefore the place is called Achilles race. Then runs

Axiakes from the Istrians: it springs among the Neures, and falls into the
Sea, by a Town of his own name. But that famous River which parts the
Nations of Scithia from the Natios following, rising from his spring in
Germanie, hath an other name at his head than at his falling into the Sea. The
river Ister, called also Danow.
For through huge Countries of great Nations, a long while together he bears
the name of Danow. Afterward, being diversely termed by the dwellers by, he
takes the name of Ister, and receiving many rivers into him, wexeth huge, and
giving place in greatness to none of all the Rivers that fall into our Sea,

live after a harder sort, and have a country less husbanded. They love war
and slaughter, and it is their custom to suck the blood clean out of the
wounds of him that they kill first. As every of them hath slain most, so is
he counted the iolliest fellow among them. But to be clear from slaughter, is
of all reproaches the greatest. Not so much as their loue-daies, are made
without bloodshed. For they that undertake the matter, wound themselves, and
letting their blood drop out into a vessel, when they have styrd it together,
drink of it, thinking that to be a most assured pledge of the promise to be
performed. In their feasting, their greatest mirth and commonnest talk, is in
making report what every man hath slain. And they that have told of most,
are set between two cups brim full of drink: for that is the chief honour
among them. As the Essedones make cups of the heads of their Parents: so do

The Countries spread very large, and by reason that the Rivers do diverse
times overflow their banks, there is every where great store of good
pasture. But some places are in all other respects so barreine, that the
inhabiters, for lack of would, are fain to make fire of bones.

Of Thrace.
The second Chapter.
NExt unto these is Thrace, and the same extending wholly inward from the front
that bears upon the side of Pontus, even unto the Illyrians, where spreading
into sides, it butts upon the River Ister and the Sea. It is a Country
cheerful neither in air nor soil, and (saving where it approaches to the
Sea,) unfruitful, cold, and a very evil cherrisher of such things, as are
either set or sown. Scarce any where doth it bear an Apple tree, but Vines
somewhat more commonly, howbeit the Grapes ripe not, no come to any good
verdure, unless it be where the keepers have fenced them with boughs to bear
of the cold. It is somewhat more friendly in cherishing of men, though it be
not to the outward show: for they be harde favoured and vncomelie shaped.
Howbeit, in respect of fierceness and number, to have them many and
unmerciful, it is most fruitful. It sends few Rivers into the Sea, Hebrus,
Nestos, and Strymon, rivers, Haemus Rhodope, and Orbele, mountains.
but those very famous: as Hebrus, Nestos, and Strymon. Innermore, it raises
up the Mountains Haemus, Rhodope, and Orbele, renowned with the Ceremonies of
Bacchus, and with the flocking of the Maenades, when Orpheus first gave them
orders, and trained them to that Religion. Of the which hills, Haemus mounts
to such a height, that in the top thereof, a man may see both the Sea of
Pontus, and the Sea of Adria.

termed by sundry names, and endowed with diverse dispositions. Some are
utterly wild and very willing to die, The manners of the Gets, and their
opinions of the immortality of the soul.
namely the Gets, and that is stablished through sundry opinions. For some of
them think, that the souls of them that die, shall return into their bodies
again. An other sort think, that though the souls return not, yet they die
not, but pass into a blessedder state. Others think they die, but that dying
is better then to live. And therefore among some of them, the childebeddes are
sorrowful, and they morn for them that be borne: and contrariwise, the
burialles are joyful, and solemnised with singing and playing, as if they were
high holy days. Not so much as the women, have cowardly or faint courages:
for they sue even with all their hearts, to be killed upon the carcasses of
their dead husbands, and to be buried with them. And because the men have many
wives at once, they plead very earnestly before Judges, which of them may
come to that honour. It is imputed to their good behaviour, and it is the
greatest joy to them that can be, to get the upper hand in this kind of suit.
The rest of the women fall a weeping, and shriek out with most bitter
complaints. But such as are minded to comfort them, bring their armour and
riches to the Hearse, and there professing themselves ready to compound with
the destiny of him that lies dead, or else to fight against it, if they could
come by it, when neither money nor fighting can take place, continue wooers at
the pleasure of the widows whom they like of. The Maidens when they shall
marry, are not bestowed at the discretion of their Parents, but are openly
either let out to be married, or else sold. Which of these shall befall unto
them, proceeds of their beauty and behaviour. The honest and beautiful
yield a good price: the other are fain to buy husbands to marry them. The
use of Wine is to some of them unknown: nevertheless, when they are making
good cheer, as they are sitting about the fires, they cast in a kind of
seed, whose sent provokes them to a certain mirth like unto droonkennesse.

On the Sea coast next unto Ister, is the City Istrople: and next unto that,
Galatis builded by the Milesians, and Tritonice, and the Haven Carry, and the
foreland Tiristris, immediately beyond the which is an other Angle of Pontus,
directly over against the Angle of Phasis: and it were like unto it, but that
it is larger. Here perished Bizone by an earthquake. There also is the Haven
Crunos, and the Cities of Dennysople. Odessos, Now called Me^imbria.
Messembria, Anchialos, and (in the innermost bosom of the Bay, where Pontus
finishes an other of his windings with an Angle) the great City Apollonia.
Apollonia.
From hence it goes with a direct coast, saving that almost in the midst, it
shoots out a Foreland called Thin^a, and turns inward to it self with
crooked banks, and bears the Cities Halmydesse, and Phyleas, and Phinople.
Hitherto is Pontus: and hereafter is the Bosphor, and Propontis.

In the Bosphor, is Now called Constantinople.
Bizance, and on Propontis are Selymbria, Perinthus, Bathynis, and running
between them the Rivers Ergine and Atyras: Then follows a part of Thrace,
where sometime reigned King Rhaesus and Bysanth, a Town builded by the
Samians, and Cypsella, sometime a great City.

After that, ensues a place called of the Greekes, Longvvall, Lysimachia.
and (in the neck of a Ness) the Town of Lysimachia. The Land that
follows, being no where broad, runs forth narrowest here between
Hellespont and the Now called Arch-sea.
Aegean Sea. The Streights thereof they call Isthmos, and the front thereof
Mastusia, and the whole together Chersonesus. It is worthy to be had in
remembrance for many things. In it is the River Aegos, renowned with the
Shipwreck of the Athenian Fleet. There is also Sestos, situate against
Abydos, very famous for the love of Leander. There is also the Country, where
the Persian host adventured to make a bridge over the Sea that parts the one
maine land from the other, (a wonderful enterprise) and passed over the Sea,
out of Asia into Greece on foot, and not by Ship. There are the bones of
Protesilaus consecrated with a Temple. There is also the Haven Caelos, renowned
with the destruction of the Laconish Fleet, at such time as the Athenians and
Lacedaemonians, encountered there in battle on the Sea. There is also
Dogs-graue, The Tomb of Queen Hecuba.
the Tomb of Queen Hecuba, which place received that homely name, either of
the shape of a Dog, whereinto Hecuba is reported to have been transformed,
or else of the misfortune that she fell into. There is Macidos, and there is
Eleus which ends Hellespont.

By and by the Aegean Sea beats hugelie upon a long shore, and with a great
compass fetches leysurelie about the Lands which it seuereth far a sunder,
unto the Foreland of Sumum. Such as sail by that coast, when they are passed
Mastusia, must enter into a Bay: which washing by the other side of
Chersonesus, is enclosed like a valley, with the ridge of a hill: and being
called Melas of the River Melas which it receives, it embraces two Cities,
Alopeconesus, on the one side of the narrow Streights, and Cardie on the other
side. Aenos Aenos.

About Hebrus are the Cycones, The Cycones.

army,) is reported to have measured them by the space of the ground. Beyond,
is the Forelande of Serrium, out of which, the woods of Zona are reported to

the end, was by Hercules cast to them himself. The Tower which they attribute
to Diomede, remains as a remembrance of the Fable: and a City which his

named after her own name. But that City is woorthier to be had in memory,
for breeding of Democritus Democritus.
the natural Philosopher, than for her sake that builded it.

Beyond that, runs the River Nestos: and between it and the River Strymon,
are the Cities, Phillippos, Appollonia, and Amphippolis. Between Strymon and
mount Athos, are the Tower Calarne, the Haven Caprullon, and the Cities
Acantos, and Oesyma. Between Athos and Pallene, are Cleone and Olynthus.

Strymon (as we have said before) is a river, Of the River Strymon.

that it is thought to reach above the place from whence the rain falls. The
opinion hath a likelihood of truth, because the ashes are not washed from the
Altars in the top thereof, but continue^ in the same heap whole as they were
left. This Hill shoots not with an elbow into the Sea, as other Hills do,
but it keeps on whole, and advances with a whole breast, a great length
into the Sea. Where it cleaved to the maine Land, it was cut through by
Xerxes, when he made his voyage against the Grayes, and was sailed over, an
arm of the Sea conveyed through it, to make way for his ships. The neathermost
parts of it, are furnished with small Towns, builded peopled by the Pelasgies.
In the top was the town Acroathon, the inhabiters whereof were wont (by
report) to live half as long again as other men. Pallene is of such a large
soil, that in it are five Cities, with their territories. It rises all in
height, somewhat narrow where it begins, and there is the City Potidaea.
But where it wexeth wider, there are the Towns of Mend and Scione, worthy to
be spoken of, Mend builded by the Eretrianes, and the other by the Greekes, as
they returned from the taking of Troy.

Of Macedonia.
The third Chapter.
THen the people of Macedonia inhabit many Cities, of the which, Pella is the
most renowned, for her two ^oster children Phillippe the subduer of Greece, and
Alexander the conqueror of Asia also. In the shore, the Bay of Mecyberne
between the Forelandes, divides Canastreum and the Haven that is called Cope:
and encloses the Cities of Toron and Physcell, and also Mecyberne, whereof it
takes the name. Scione is next unto the Foreland of Canastre: and Mecyberne
Bay enters somewhat within the Land in the midst, where it gives way like a
bosom. Howbeit casting forth long arms into the deep, it becomes a great
gulf between the seas. Into it run Axius through Macedonia, and Peneus
through Thessalie. A little above Axius, is the City Now called Salonich.
Thessalonica. Between them both are Cassandria, Cydna, Azaros, and Derris.
Beyond Peneus, are Sepias, Cordynia, Melibaea, and Castanea, all of like
renown, saving that Phyloctetes Phyloctetes.
who was fostered at Melibaea, beautifies that town. The inner Lands are
renowned with the names of famous places, and contain almost nothing that is
not notable. Not far from hence is Olympus, and here is Pelion, and here is
Ossa, Mountains renowned with the Fables of the Giantes wars. Here is
Pieria, Pieria.
the dwelling place and mother of the Muses. Here is the ground that Hercules
of Greece trod last upon, namely, the Forest of Oeta: Here is Tempe
ennobled with holy woods. Here lies Lebethra, and the versifying
fountains.

Then follows Greece, shooting forth hugelie and mainlie, and bearing from
the North into the South, till it butte upon the Myrtean Sea. Where the Sun
rises, it faces the Aegean Sea, and where the Sun goes down, it faces
the Ionish Sea. Next that, lies a large Country, named Hellas, which steps
forth with a large front, and anon after is cut off almost by the waste,
with both the Seas: whereof the Ionish enters furthest into his side, until
the Land becomes but five mile wide. Then again the Lands widen on both
sides, and shoot into the deeps, but more into the Ionish Sea than into the
Aegean Sea: and stretching forth, not altogether so broad as they began
(howbeit very great) they become a Ness, which is called Now it is called
Morea.

thereof are fretted, as it were with little veins, and therewithal because it
spreads out a toside with a slender stalk, is very like the leaf of Plane

are put into it, as other waters do: If ye hold brands without fire a good
way off from it, it kindles them. But when men scour the Sea coast, their
way is to sail from the Foreland of Sepias, by Demetrias, and Boion, and
Phtheleon, and Echinon, to the Bay of Pagasa: which embracing the City
Pagasa, receives the River Sperch^us: and because the Minyes (when they made
their voyage into Colchos) launched forth there with their Argosie, it is
therefore had in estimation.

From thence as men sail to Sunium, they must pass by these things: namely,
by two great Baize, the one of Malea, the other of Opus, and in them the
Monuments of the slaughter of the Lacedaemonians: By Ther^opile, Opaes,

The bounds of Megaris, extend even to the Balke, which is so termed, because
it parts the Aegean Sea but five miles space from the Ionish Sea, and
knits Peloponesus unto Hellas, with a narrow balke. In it is the town of

with Chelonates and Araxos. From the narrow balke to Scylleon, inhabit the
Epidaurians, renowned with the Temple of Aesculapius: Aesculapius.
and the Troiezenians, famous for their faithful continuance in league
friendship with the Athenians. Also there are Saronike Haven, and Schaenitas,
and Pagonus. The Towns of Epidaure, Troizen, and Hermion, stand upon this
shore. Between Scylleon Malea, is the Bay of Argolis: between that and
Taenarus, is the Bay of Laconia, from thence to Acritas, is the Bay of Asine,
and from thence to Ichthys, is the Bay of Cyparissus. In the Bay of Argolis,
are the known rivers of Erasmus and Inachus, and the known town of Learn. In
the Bay of Laconia, are the Rivers Githius, and Eurotas. On the head of
Taenarus, are the Temple of Neptune, and a Cave like unto the Cave of Acheruse
Acheruse.
in Pontus, that we spake of before, both in fashion and Fable. In the Bay of
Asine, is the River Pamisse, and in the Bay of Cyparisse, is Alpheus: These two
Baize take their names of two Cities, Cyparissus, and Asine, that stand upon
their shores. The Messemans and Pylians, inhabit the Lands, and Pyle it self
stands near the Sea, and so do Cyllene Cyllene.
and Callipolis. The City Patre, stands upon that shore where Chelonates
and Araxos, run into the Sea. But Cyllene is notable, because men think that
Mercurie was borne there. Afterward Rhion (it is the name of a Bay) falling
like a Lake with full mouth, as it were in at a narrow gap between the
Aetolians and Peloponesians, breaks in even to the Balke. In it the shores
begin to look Northward.

Here abouts are Aegian, and Aegira, and Oluros, and Sicyon: and in the
coasts over against them are, Page, Creusis, Auticyra, Oeanthia, Cyrrha, and
(whereof the name is better known) Calydon, and the River Euenus. Without
Rhion in Acarnania, the notablest things are the Town Leucas, and the River
Achelous.
Achelous.

In Epire, The Bay of Ambrace.
nothing is more noble, than the Bay of Ambrace. The cause hereof in part, is
the Bay it self, which at a narrow gap, less than a mile wide, lets in
a great Sea: and partly, the Cities Actium, Argos* built by Amphilocus, and
Ambrace the Palace of the posterity of Aeacus, and of Pyrrhus, which stand by
it. Beyond is Butroton, and then the Hills The Thunder^ hills.
Ceraunii, and from them the winding toward Adria. This Sea being received
far into the Land, and spreading very broad, but yet broadest where it
pierces in* is beset with the Countries of Now called Sclauonie.
Illyricke unto Now called Try.
Tergestum, and the residue with the Nations of Italie and France.

The Parthi^nes and Dassarets, possess the first parts of it: The next by
little and little, is possessed ^y the Euchelies and Pheakes: afterward, are
they that be properly called Illyrians: then the Pyreans, and Lyburnes, and
Histrich. Of Cities, the first is Oricum, the second Now called Durazo.
Dyrrachium, called before Epidamnum, until the Romanes changed the name,
because it seemed to them to be a forespeaking of evil luck, towards them when
they went thither. Beyond are Apollonia, Salon, Iader, Naron, Now Bruzza.
Tragurie, the Bay of Pola, and the City Pola, inhabited (as report goes)
by men of Colchos, and now (as things altar) peopled by the Romanes. Also,
there are the Rivers Aeas, and Nar, and Danow* which is spoken of before by the
name of Ister. But Aeas falls into the Sea by Apollonia: and Nar, between the
Pyreans and Liburnes: and Ister, through Istrich. Tergestum, which is situate
in the innermost nook of Adria, ends Illyrich.

Of Italie.
The fowrth Chapter.
SOmewhat shall be said of Italie, rather because order so requires, then for
that it needs any setting out: for all things are known. At the Alps, it
begins to mount in height, and as it proceeds, raising it self in the
midst, it runs forth with a continual ridge between the Adriatishe and
Turkishe Seas, or (as they are otherwise termed, between the upper Sea, and
the nether Sea) a great while whole: but when he hath gone far, he splitteth
into two horns, whereof the one faces the Sea of Sicill, and the other the
I^nishe Sea. It is through out narrow, and in some place much narrower than
where it began.

The inner parts thereof are inhabited by sundry Nations. On the left side,
the Carnies and Venetians possess Now a part of Lombardie.
Gallia togata. Then follow Italian people, the Picents, the Frentanes, the
Daunians, the Appulians, the Calabrians, and the Salentines. On the right side
under the Alps, are the Ligurians, and under Appenine, is Hetruria. After
that, is Latium, the Volscies, Campane, and above Lucanie, are the Brutians.

Of Cities inhabited far from the Sea, the wealthiest on the left hand, are
Padua, Padua.
builded by Antenor: and Mutina, and Bononi^, builded by the Romanes: Rome.
and on the right hand Capua, builded by the Thuscanes, and Rome in old time
founded by Shepherds, but now (if it should be treated of according to the
worthiness) an other whole work of it self.

In the Sea coast next to Now called Try.
Tergestum, is Concord. Through it runs the River Timauus: which rising from
nine headdes, falls into the Sea with one mouth. Then the River Natiso, not
far from the Sea, passes by the rich Tow^e Aquileia, beyond which is
Altine. The River Po, The river Po.
occupies a large space in the upper shore. For he rises out of the very
foot of the Mountain Vesulus, and gathering himself at the first of little
springes, runs a while lank and lean: but anon after he so increases, and
is so fed with other Rivers, that at the last he empties himself with seven
mouths. One of these, they call great Po, and he gushes out of it so
swiftly, that beating aside the waives, he carries his stream a great while
in the same sort that he sent it out of the Lands end, and keeps his
channel styll even in the Sea, until the River Ister flushing with like
violence, out of the shore over against him, doth meet with him. Hereby it
comes to pass, that as men sail through those places, where the said Rivers
come on both sides, they draw up fresh water among the waives of the Sea.

From Po to Ancona ward, the way lies by Rauenna, Arm^ne, Pisaure, the
franchised Town of Fane, and the Rivers Metaurus and Esis. And in the very
skirt of those two Forelandes, meeting one against an other, stands the said
Town of Ancona, Ancona, or Ancon, signifies an elbow.
which hath that name given it by the Greekes, because the situation thereof
resembles the bowing of a mans elbow: and it is as a bound between the
Marches of the French and Italian Nations.

For when men are passed this Town, they come upon the coast of Picene,
wherein are the Cities, Numana, Potentia, Claterna, and Cupra: the Castles of
Firmum, Adria, and Truent, with a River running thereby of the same name. From
thence is the Sea coast of Senogallia, unto the mouth of the River Aterne: the
Cities whereof are Bucar and Histon.

The Daunians have the River Tiferne, the Cities Cliterne, Lucrine, and
Theane, and the Mountain Garganus. There is a Bay in Appulia, enclosed with a
whole shore, which is called Vrias, of small room, and for the most part rough
to come unto. Uttermore, is Sypunt, or (as the Greeks call it) Sypius, a river
that runs by Canusium, and is called Aufidus. Afterward are Barium, Egnatia,
and Rudie, ennobled with Ennius, E^ius the Poet
who was of that City. And in Calabria, are Brunduse, Valece, Lupie, and
Mount Hydrus, together with the plains of Salent, and the Sea coast of Salent,
and a Greek City, named Gallipole. Hitherto extends the Adriatishe Sea,
and hitherto extends the one side of Italie. The front of it (as we have
said) splitteth into two horns. But the Sea that is received in between them
both, being once or twice dissevered with thin Forelandes, is not environed
with one whole bank, nor received open and at large on level shore, but in
Baize. The first is called the Bay of Tarent, which lies between the
Forelandes of Sale and Lacinium: and in it are Tarent, Metapont, Heracle,
Croto, and Turium. The second, is called the Bay of Scyllace, between the
Forelandes of Pacinium, and Zephyrium, wherein are Petilia, Caecine, Scyllace,
and Mistre. The third, which is between Zephyrium and Brutium, enuironeth
Consiline, Caulone, and Locres. In Brutium are the Kings Pillar, Regium,
Scylla, Taurian, and Metaure. From hence is the turning into the Tuscan Sea,
and to the other side of the same Land, on the which side are Terine: Hippo now
called Vibon: Temesa: Clampetia: Blanda: Buxent: Velia: Palinure sometime the
name of ye Master of Aeneas Ship, and now the name of a place: the Bay of
Pesta, and the Town of Pesta: the River Silarus, the City Picentia, the
Rocks which the Mermaids dwelt in, the Foreland called Mineruaes Mount, the
fat grounds of Lucanie, the Bay of Puteolis, the Cities of Surrent and
Herculean, the view of the Mountain Vesuuius, the Pompeyes, Naples, Puteolis,
the Lakes of Lucrine and Auerne, the Bathes, Missene* now the (...) of a place,
sometime the name of a Troiane Soldier: Cumes, Linterne, the River Vulturne,
the Town Vulturne, the delectable Sea coast of Campane, Sinuessa, Liris,
Minturne, ^ormie, Fundie, Tarracine, Circes house sometime called Circey.
Autium, Aphrodisium, Arde, Laurent, and Ostia on the hither side of Tyber.

Beyond it are Pyrgie, Anio, Newcastle, Grauiske, Cossa, Telamon, Populon,
Cecine, and Pises, places and names of Hetruria. Then Luna, ^igurum, and
^iguria, and Geane, and Sabatia, and Albigaunum. Then hath it the Rivers Paule
and Varus, both falling from the Alps, but Varus is better known, because it
ends Italie.

The Alps themselves, The Alps.
spreading far and wide from these shores, do first run a great step into
the North: and when they have touched Germanie, then turning their race, they
go forth into the East, and disseuering cruel Nations, extend even into
Thrace.

and the Moutaine Gebenna, into two sides, whereof the one butts upon the
Tuscan Sea, and the other upon the Occean, extends on the one side from
Varus, and on the other side from the Rhine unto the Moutaine Pyrene. The part
that borders upon our Sea, was sometime called Braccata, and is now called
the province of Sauoy and Delphynoys.
Narbone, and is more inhabited and tilled, and therefore also more cheerful.
Of the Cities that it hath, the wealthiest are Vasio of the Vocontians, Vienna
of the Auignion.

Nemausus of the Arecomikes, Tolous of the Languedocke.

the name-giuer and beauty of the whole Province. On the Sea coasts, are a
few places of some reputation. But the Cities stand thin, because there are
few Havens, and all that quarter lies open to the South and South-west
winds.

Nicea touches the Alps, and so doth the Town of Deceate, and so doth
Ragnie.
Antipolis. Afterwards is Iulius Market, a Town builded by the Octauians,
and then forth Athenople, and Olbia, and Glauon, and Citarist, and Halycidon,
the Haven of Marsilles, Marsilles, and the foundation thereof.
in it the Town of Marsilles it self. This being founded by the Phoceans, and
builded in old time among boisterous Nations, hath now brought them in awe, and
made them good neighbours, far unlike to that they were before. It is a
wonderful thing, how easily it then took sure settling, and unto this day
keeps the old custom. Between it and Rhone, lies Marius Ditch, upon the
Sea side near unto the Poole of the Auatikes, That shore carries a part of
the said River into the Sea, in a channel able to bear Ships: otherwise it
is but a rascal bank all stony, where the report goes that Hercules
fighting against Albion and Bergion* the sons of Neptune, and having spent
all his Artillery, called upon his Father Iupiter, who rayned down stones to
help him with: and a man would believe it had rained stones in deed, there
lye so many, and that every where, and so far of.

The River Rhone Rhone.
springs not far from the heads of Ister and Rhyne, and then being received
into the Lake Losan, he holds on his race, and forcing himself whole through
the midst of it, passes out as great as he entered in. From thence being
carried back into the West, he divides Gallia a while, and then turninig his
course Southward, keeps so forth on, and becoming now great with the
resort of other Rivers, and continually wexing greater, runs ^ut at the
Lands ^nd, between the The people of Mount Pelier.
Volscies and the Cauers.

Beyond are the Pooles of the Volscies, the River Led, the Castle Latara, and
the Hill Mesna, environed almost round about with the Sea, and (but that it
hangs by a narrow Cawsie to the Land) a very I'll. Then Soan falling out of

as long as he hath none but the waters of his own spring, runs small and
shallow, and yet a great channel, howbeit not able to bear a Ship any
where, saving where he passes by Narbone.

But when he swells with winter showers, he is wont to rise so high, that
his banks be not able to hold him in. A Lake receives him* named Rubresus,
very large, but where the Sea enters into it narrow mouthed. Beyond is
Leucata, as shore so named, and the Fountain of Salsusa, which sheadeth water,
not sweet, but more brackish than the water of the Sea.

Hard by, is a Field very green with short and slender Reed, A strange
Field.
but floating upon a Poole that is underneath it. That it is so, the middle part
of it plainly proves, which being cut off from the rest about it, swims
like an I'll, and suffers it self to be shooued and drawn too and fro.
Moreover, by those places that are cut through, appears the Sea sheaded
underneath it. Whereupon, whether it were through ignorance of the truth, or
that they were purposelie disposed to make a leasing, it liked as well our
Authors, as also the Greekes, to leave in writing unto such as should come
after, that Fish was dug out of the whole ground in that Country, which in
deed coming out of the deep Sea thither, and there being killed by such as
babbed for them, was drawn dead out of the foresaid holes.

From thence is the coast of the Sardones, and the little brookes of Thelis and
Thicis, which are very noisome when they rise with any rage of water: and
Ruscinum, a Town of the Romanes, and the Village Eliberris, which sometime was
a great City, and now is but a slender Monument of great wealth. Then
between the Forelandes of Pyrene, is the Haven of Venus* in a Bay of
salt-water, and a place called It may be called Herts-walke.
Ceruaria, which is the end of Gallia.

Of Spain.
The sixth Chapter.
THe Mountain Pyrene, first runs from hence into the Britishe Occean: and
then turning with a front into the mayne Land, breaks into Spain, and
shutting out the lesser part of it on the right hand, stretches out a long in
one whole ridge, until such time as having passed a long race through all the
Country, it come to those shores that are butting upon the West. Spain it
self (saving where it bounds upon France,) is environed round about with
the Sea. Where it cleaves unto France, there is it narrowest, then widening
it self by little and little into our Sea and the Occean, and wexing larger
and larger, it runs into the West, and there becomes broadest. It is so
plenteous and fruitful of Men, Horses, Iron, Lead, Brass, Silver and Gold,
that if in any place it be fruitless and unlike it self* for want of water,
yet it bears Flax and A shrub like Broom, whereof they make Cables.
Spart. It is distinguished by three names, one part is called Tarraconensis,
an other Boetica, and the third Lusitania. Nauar, Aragon and Biskay.
Tarraconensis, butting with the one headde thereof against France, and with
the other upon Boetica and Lusitania, thrusts out his sides Southward to our
midland Sea, and Northward to the British Occean. The River Guadiana.
Anas parts Boetica from Lusitania, and therefore The kingdom of Granado.
Boetica looks into both the Seas, that is to say, Westward into the
Athlantish Occean, and Southward into our midland Sea. Portugal, Gallicia,
and castile.
Lusitania lies only against the Occean, that is to wit, with his side into
the North, and with his front into the West.

Of vpland Cities, in Tarraconensis, the famousest in old time were Palenze.
Pallance, and Numance: and now the famousest is Saragossa.
Cae^auragusta: in Lusitania, Emerita: and in Boetica, Astigie Siuill.
Ispalis, and Corduba. But if ye go along the Sea coast, next beyond Ceruaria*
is a Rock which thrusts Mount Pyrene into the deep. Then follows the
river Thicis unto Rhoda, and Clodian to Empuries; beyond which, is Iupiters
Mount: the West part whereof, (by reason of the stones that rise with a little
distance one above an other like greeces) they call Hanniballes Stairs.
Hanniballes Stairs.


From thence to Terragon.
Tarracon, are the little Towns, of Blanda, Illuro, Betullo, Barsilone.
Barchino, Subur, and Tholobie: and the little brookes of Betulo* next to
Iupiters Mount, and Rubricate, somewhat bigger at the shore, between Subur and
Tholobie. The City Tarraco, is the wealthiest of all that stand upon these
coasts. Above it runs a mean River called Tulcis, and beneath it runs
the great river Iber or Ebro*
Iberus. From thence the Sea winds it self into the Land, and entering at
the first with great force, is anon after divided into two Baize, with a
Foreland called Ferrar. The first Bay is named Sucron, which is the greater of
both, and receives the Sea at a very large mouth, wexing styll narrower the
further it goes. It receives Serabis and Duria, and Sucron, rivers of no
great bigness. It embraces other Cities, but the best known are Valentia,
and that famous Town of Saguntum, renowned both for faithfulness, and for the
miseries it endured. The other Bay following* called Ill^ce, hath Alone and
Lucence, and Illice whereof it takes the name.

Heerhence, from those things that are spoken of already, unto the Marches of
The kingdom of Granado.
Boetica, there is nothing worth the writing, except it be Cartagene.
Carthage, which Hasdruball Captain of the Carthaginens^s builded. On those
coasts are base Towns, which are not worth the naming, but for orders sake:
as Virgie, in the Bay called Virgie Bay: and without it Abdera, Suell, Hexie,
Menoba, Malliqua.
Malaca, Salduba, Lacippo, and Berbefull. Afterward follows the The Streights

join the shores of Europe Affricke* together, as we said at the beginning.
They are called the Pillars of Hercules, and both of them (but Calpe more, and
in manner wholly) bear foreward into the Sea. The same being wonderful
hollow on that part that is toward the Sun setting, opens almost his mid
side, where into there shutteth a Bay, which is almost altogether passageable
as far as it goes, and beyond it is a Cave. In that Bay, Carteia in times
past (as some think) called Tarteslus, and Mellaria environed with the Sea, a
Town which the Phenicians passing out of Affricke inhabit, (the place where I
was borne) together with the Towns of Bello and Besippo, The place where the
Author of this work was borne.
occupy the rest of the coast on that narrow Sea, unto Saint Vincents head.
Iunos Mount. This rising into the West into the Occean with a bowing ridge,
and facing the Forelands of Ampelusia which we told you to be in Affricke, is
the end of Europe toward our Seas.

The Isles of the mid-land Sea.
The seventh Chapter.
THe I'll Cales.
Gades, which meets men when they pass out at the Streightes, puts me in
remembrance, cheefely to speak of the rest of the Isles in our mid-land Sea,
before I proceed to treat of the coast of the Occean, and the uttermost
circuit of the maine Lands, as I promised at the beginning.

There are but few in Maeotis, (for it seems most handsome to begin there)
and yet all of them are not inhabited, for they yield not sufficient
sustenance. Heerevpon it comes to pass, that the inhabiters of them, dry the
flesh of great Fishes in the Sun, and braying it into fine powder, use it in
sleede of meal. There are also but f^we in Pontus, Leuke, a very little
Island, situate against the mouth of Boristhenes, is sir named Achille^, Leuce
or Achillea.
because Achilles lies buried there. Not far thence is Aria, Aria.
which being consecrated to Mars, did (as is reported in Fables,) breed
Birds* that cast forth feathers as it had been Darts, and therewith made
great slaughter of such as arrived on that coast. There are six at the mouths
of Ister, of which Peuce Peuce.
is the best known, and the greatest.

Thynnias Thynnias.
facing the borders of the Mariandynes, hath a City, which (because the
Bithynians builded it) is called Bithynis. Against the Bosphor of Thrace lye
two little Isles, The Cyanies or Symplegades.
distant a small space asunder, sometime believed and reported to have run
together, called Cyanies and Symplegades. In Propontis, Proconesus.
only Proconesus is inhabited. Without Hellespont, the notablest (of such as
lye upon the coast of Asia) are Tenedos, Tenedos.
over against the Foreland of Sigaeum, and such as are situate against the
Foreland of Taurus, whereof I will speak in order as they stand, which were
called Macarons Isles, Macarons Isles.
either because they have a happy air and soil, or else because one Macar
and his Uicegerentes, held them under their dominion.

Upon the coast of Trod is Lesbos, Lesbos.
and in it some time were five Towns, Antissa, Pyrrha, Eressos, Ciraua, and
Mitylene. Upon Ionia, lye Chios, and Samos: Chios Samos.
upon Caria, Cos: Cos. Rhodes.
upon Lycia, Rhodes: and in each of these Isles, is a City of the same name.
In Rhodes where ere-while three: The Chelidonies.
Lindus, Cami^us, and Ialysus.

The Isles that lye against the head of Taurus, being cumbersome to sail unto,
are named Ch^lidonies. In the greatest Bay that Asia receives, almost about
the midst thereof lies Cyprus: Cyprus.
which stretching it self from the East into the West, shoots with a
straight ridge between Cilicia and Syria, and is very great, as which
sometime* contained nine Kingdoms. And at this day it bears certain
Cities, whereof the notablest are Salamis, and Paphos, and Palaepaphos, where
the folk of that Country hold opinion, that Venus set first foot a land
out of the Sea. There is a little I'll in Phenicia, I'll Arados.
called Arados, conveyed all in one Town as much as is of it, but plentifully
peopled, because it is lawful for men to dwell, even under other men's roofs.
Canope Canop^.
also is a little one, at the mouth of Nile* called Canopicke. Menelaus
Shipmaister, Canopus, dying there by chance, gave that name to the I'll, and
the I'll gave name to the mouth of Nile, Pharos Pharos.
is now joined with a bridge to Alexandria, but in old time (as is reported
in Homers work) it was dissevered a whole days sailing from that coast. And
if it were so in deed, it may well be conjectured, that Nile hath been the
cause of so great alteration: who bringing mud continually down his
channel (and that cheeflie when he flows) and beating it to the shore,
increases the Lands, and enlarges the plat of them, by growing foreward into
the next shallows.

In Affricke, against the greater Syrt, is Cuteletos. Cuteletos,
against the Forelandes of the lesser Sy^t, are Meniux, and Cercinna: Meniux
and Cercinna.
against the Bay of Carthage, lye Tarichie, Tarichie and Aegates.
and the Aegates* renowned with the Shipwreck of the Romanes. Many mo are
situate against the coast of Europe.

In the Aegean Sea, near to Thrace, are Thasos, Imbros, Samothrace, Scandille,
Polyegos, Scyathos, Halonesos and Lemnos, Thasos, Imbros, Samothrace, Scandill,
Polyegos, Seyathos, Hole^esos, Lemnos*
where the women in old time are reported to have murdered all the men, and
to have held the Realm alone. Lemnos lies over against the Mountain Athos:
the Bay of Pagasa, faces ^cyathos, and embraces Cicyneton. Euboea thrusts
out the Forelandes of Geraestos, Eubaea.
and Caphareum, into the South: and Coeneum into the North. It no where bears
any breadth: and where it is narrowest, it is two miles over: but it is long,
and lies against all Baeotia, being dissevered from the shore thereof, with a
very narrow arm of salt-water, which they call Euripus, a swift Sea* ebbing
and flowing seven times a day, and as often every night, with so unmeasurable
strong tides, that it disappointeth Ships which have the wind full on their
sails.

There are a few Towns in it, as Hestiaea, Eretria, Pyrrha, Nesos, and
Occhalia: but the wealthiest, are Carystos and Chalcis. In Attis, is Helene
known, ^e Helene.
for the adultrie of Queen Hellen, and Salamis Salamine.
better known, for the destruction of the Persian Fleet.

About Peloponesus, yet still in the Aegean Sea, are Phitiusa, and Aegina,
Phitiusa, and Aegina.
situate against the shore of Epidaurus. Against Troiezen (among vnrenowmed
things) is Calauria, Calauria.
renowned otherwise with the death of Demosthenes. In the Myrtoan Sea, Cythera*
is Cythera set against Malea, and Theganusa Theganusa.
against Acritas. In the Ionish Sea, are Prote, Hyria, Cephalenia, Neritos,
Same, Zacynthos, Dulychium, Prote, Hyria, Cephalenia, Neritos, Same, Zacynthos,
Dulychium, Ithaca.
and (which is not to be reckoned among the base sort) Ithaca, most chiefly
renowned with the name of Vlysses. In Epyre, are the Echinades, and the
Strophades, The Echinades and Strophades.
in old time called Plottes. Against the Bay of Ambrace, is Leucadie, and
near unto the Adriatish Sea, Corcyra: and these lye against the Lands of the
Greekes, Leucadie, Corcyra, now called Cortu.
and the Thracians.

But innermore are Nelos, Ol^aros, Aegina, Ca^hon, Ios, Thera, Hyaros,
Hippuris, Donysa, Cianos, Chalcis, Icaria, Pinaria, Nisyros, Lebynthos,
Calydne, and Asine, The Sporades.
and all these (because they lye scattering) are called Sporades. Afthem follow
Sicynus, Cythnos, ^yphnos, S^riphos, Rhene, Paros, Scyros, Tenos, Myconos,
Naxos, Delos, and Andros: The Cyclades.
which (because they stand round, as it were in a circle together) are called
^clades. Above them in the mid Sea, Candye.
Crete, (furnished sometime with an hundred Cities) sends out into the East
a Foreland called Samon, and into the West an other, called the Rammes-head.
But that is greater then Cyprus, it were like it. The same thereof is blazed
abroad* with many Fables: as the (...) of Europa, the Loves of Pasiphae and of
Ariadne, ^he cruelnesse of Minotaure and his death, the works of Dedalus* and
his flight in the air, and moreover* his arrival and death: but most of all,
for that the inhabiters yet do show the Tomb of Iupiter Iupiters Tomb*
with his name graven therevppon, as an ^uident Monument of his burial there.

Of the Cities therein, the best known are Gnosus, Gortyna, Lyctos, Lycastos,
Holopixos, Phaestos, Cydon, Manethusa, and Dictyn^a. Among the Hills, the same
of Mount Ida excells, because it is said that Iupiter was nourished there.
By the same Hill are Asticle, Naumachos, Zephyre, Crise, Gaudos, The Carpathian
Sea.
and three Towns called all by the one name of Musagories, and Carpathus,
whereof the Carpathian Sea takes his name.

In the Adriatishe Sea, Absoros, Celaduse, Absyrtis, Trucon, Issa, Hydria,
Electrides, black Corcyra, Tragurie, Diomedia, Aestria, Asine, Pharos.
are Absoros, Celaduse, Absyrtis, Issa, Trucon, Hydria, Electrides, black
Corcyra, Tragurie, Diomedia, Aestria, Asine, and an other Pharos lying to
Brundusium as the other did to Alexandria. Sicill (by report) was sometime

The same being narrow and sharpe, runs with interchangeable course, one
while into the Thuscane Sea, and an other while into the Ionish Sea, rough,

makes the shape of the Greek Letter called Delta. That which looks toward
Greece, is named Pachynus: that which looks to Affricke ward, is called
Lilybie: and that which enclineth to Italie, and is direct against Scylla, is
called Pelorus of Pelorus a Ship Master, buried there by Hanniball. For when
Hanniball ^ledde out of his Country, as he was passing at way into Syria,
because that to his sight a far of, the shores seemed to join all in one^ as
if there had been no Sea to pass through, thinking himself to be betrayed by
Pelorus, he killed him. The coast that extends from thence to Pachinus, along
the Ionish Sea, bears these notable things: Messana, Taurominium Catina,
Megaris, ^yracuse, and among these the wonderful Arethusa.

It is a Fountain wherein are seen again, The Fountain Arethusa.
such things as are cast into the River Alpheus, which (as we have said)
sinks into the Sea-banke of Peloponesus. Whereupon it is believed, that the
said River mingles not himself with the Sea, but sinking down, carries his
stream in a channel, under Sea and land hither, and here springs up again.

Between Pachynus and Lilybie, are Acragas, Heracle, and Therme. Between
Lilybie and Pelorus, are Panormus and Hymera. Innermore are the Leontines,
Centuripine, Hybla, and many others. Enna Enna.

because that rising in the very heart of the Country, it runs two
contrary ways, and cutting it into two halfes, falls with the one mouth
into the Lybish Sea, with the other into the Thuscane Sea. About Sicill, in the

certain little ones, called Dianium, Iaginium, Carbania, Vrgo, Ilua, and
Capraria. Then are there two great ones, divided with the Hetruscan Sea: of

kinds of hurtful Serpents, and be therefore uninhabitable: yet notwithstanding
when men arrive there, if they bring of the earth of Ebusus with them, as many
as are within the precinct* that is strewn about with that earth, are safe
without peril, and the Serpents (which otherwise would adventure to meet
them and assault them) shunning the sight of the dust (or rather some other
secret^ power thereof) fly far of for fear.

The third Book of that worthy Cosmographer, Pomponius Mela, concerning the
situation of the world.
The uttermost shores of Spain.
The first Chapter.
THE coast of our mid-land Sea is already spoken of, The description of the
Occean, and the opinion^ of the ebbing and flowing thereof.
and the Isles that it contains are spoken of also. Now remains that
circuit which (as we have said at the beginning) is environed with the great
Occean, that unmeasurable Sea, which raging with great tides (for they so term
the mouinges thereof) one while flows into the fields, and an other while
leaving them a great way bare, flies back, from one to an other
successinelie, and not turning by enterchaungeable course, left into one and left
into an other. But when he hath powered himself whole together out of the
midst into all shores, as well of Ilandes as of maine lands, though they be
contrary one against other, he gathers from them again into the midst, and
retires into himself, rushing forth always with such violence, that he
drives back hudge streams, and either takes the Beasts of the Land unawares,
or else leaves the Beasts of the Sea waterlesse. Neither is it yet certainly
known, whether the world cause it with his panting, and utters out on all
sides about him the water that he had drawn in with his breath, for (as it
seems to the learned sort) the world (...) a living wight: or whether there
be some hollow Caves in the ground* for the ebbing Seas to retire into, and to
lift themselves out again when they are too full: or whether the Moon be the
cause of so great fleetings. This is certain, that according to the rising and
going down of the Moon, the course of the Occean varies, and keeps not one
ordinary time, but as she mounts or falls, so we perceive it to go and
come.

When men are come out hither, and pursue those parts that are on the right
hand, the Athlantish Occean, and the coast of the front of Granite.
Boetica, receives them, which lies in manner straight unto the River Anas,
Guadiana.
saving that once or twice it withdraws a little into it self. The Turdules
and Bastule, inhabit it. In the hithermost Bay, is a Haven which they call
Gad^ Haven, and a Wood which they call* Of wild Oly^fes.
Oleastre. Then on the shore* is the Castle of Ebor, and far from the shore*
is the Roman Town Asta, and without the Bay is the Temple and Altar of Iuno.
In the very Sea is the Tomb of Geryon, set rather upon a Rock, then in an
I'll. The River Boetis coming out of the Country of Tarracon, The river
Boetis, now called Guadalquebir.
runs a long while* almost through the middle of this Country, in one
channel as he sprang up at his head. But afterward having made a great Lake.
not far from the Sea, he rises double* as it were out of one spring, and
issues out as great in either of them, as he came in single in his own. Then
bows there an other Bay inward unto the end of the Shore, upon the which
Bay stande^ the little Towns of Olitingie and Onoba.

Beyond the River Anas, Portugal.
Lusitunia (on that side where it looks into the Athlantishe Occean) steps
out at the first with a great bulk into the deep, and afterward shrinking
back again, retires further inward than ^oetica. Where it bears foreward,
it receives the Sea twice into it, and so is divided into three Forelands.
That which is next the River Anas, (because it passes forth from a broad
base, and by little and little grows into a narrow point) is called
Wedge-feeld, or Wedge-land.
Cu^eus Ager. The second, they call Holy Head: and the third, Great Head. In
the Wedge, are M^tylis, Balsa, and Ossobona: In Holy Head, are Lacobriga, and
Hanniballes Haven: and on the Great Head, is Ebora. Between these three Heads,
are the Baize: in the hithermost whereof is Salacia, in the other is the City
Lisbone.
Vlisippo, and the mouth of the River Tagus, which engenders Gold and precious
Stones. From these Forelandes to that part which retired back, is opened a
great winding gap, wherein be the old Turdules, and their Towns: and the
Rivers, Monda and Durius, of which Monda runs out almost through the midst
of the side of the last mentioned Foreland: and Durius sweepeth by the very
root of it. That Front for a while hath a direct shore, which afterward making
a little winding, shoots forth anon again, and then shrinking in once or
twice, proceeds right forth with a direct bank unto the Foreland which we
call Now called the Lands end.
Celticke. All this Coast is inhabited by the Celts, from the River Durius, to
the bought of Gronium, through their borders run the Rivers Auo, Celandus,
Nebis, Minius, and (which bears the name of forgetfulness) Limia. The bought
it self embracing the City Lambriaca, receives the Rivers of Ie^na and Via.
The foremost part of the bought, is inhabited by the Presamarkes, through whose
Country, the Rivers Tamaris and S^rs, having their heads not far one from an
other, do run into the Sea, Tamaris* at the Haven of Artabrie, and Sars at a
Tower renowned with the name of Augustus.

The rest of the Country beyond, is inhabited by the Tamarikes, and Nerians,
who be the last on that coast. For hitherto the shores lye full upon the West:
and from thenceforth, the Land turns with full side to the North, from the
Celtike Foreland, to the Foreland of Scithia. From this Celtike Foreland, unto
the Biscay.
Cantabers, the Coast is almost right out, saving that there be a few small
Baize and little Forelandes. On that coast, are first the Artabers, and
Ianasum, Celtike Nations, and next them the Asturians. In Artabria, a Bay with
a narrow mouth* receiving the Sea into a large room, bends about by the
City Adrobike, and the mouths of four Rivers: whereof two be but smallie
regarded* even of the dwellers by: and by the other two, the Rivers Mearus and
Narius run into Libunca. On the shore of the Asturians* stands the Town of
Naega: and in a certain Ness there are three Altars* which they call
Sestians, which are ennobled with the name of Augustus, whereby they ennoble
these Lands also, which were unnoble before.

Nevertheless, from the River which is called Salia, the coast begins to
draw back by little and little, and more and more to straighten the widenes
of Spain, which yet notwithstanding is wide still, gathering the Lands into
so narrow a room, that between the two Seas where Spain butts upon
France, Spain is narrower by the one half, than where it reaches into the
West. That Coast is held by the Cantabers and Vardules. Among the Cantabers
are diverse people and Rivers, howbeit, whose names can not be uttered by the
mouth of us Romanes.

Through those Countries, comes down the Rivers* Salenos, and Saurium: and
through certain people, called the Autrigones, and Origeuiones, comes down
the River Nesua. The River Deua runs by Tritium* Tobolicum, and beyond that,
Magrada passes by Iu^rissa, and Iason. The Vardules being one entire Nation,
extend from hence to the head of Mount Pyren, and so close up (...) the
Country of Spain.

The uttermost coasts of Gallia.
The second Chapter.
NOw follows the other side of Gallia, whose Coast shouing somewhat foreward
into the deep, and anon stepping forth, wellneere as much into the open Sea,
as Spain had retired back, bresteth the Lands of Cantabrie, and winding about
with a great circuit, turns his side unto the West. Then turning again to
y^ North, it spreads out with a long and straight coast, unto the banks of
the Rhyne. It is a Land very fruitful, theefelie of grass and corn,
pleasant to behold for great Forests. Whatsoever kind of seed can away with
n^ cold, the country yields it not every where, neither is there any great
store of hurtful Beasts. The people themselves are proud, superstitious, and
sometime also they have been outrageous: insomuch that they have believed,
that the Sacrificing of men, was the best and acceptablest thing to the Gods.
There remain yet still some remnants of their foreworne cruelty: insomuch,
that although they abstain from utter ^eaing of men, yet notwithstanding, they
bring them to the Altars, and taste of their blood. Neuerthelater, they have
their kind of eloquence, and teachers of wisdom, whom they call Druides.
These profess themselves to know the greatness and fashion of the world, the
moouinges of the Heaven, and of the Stars, and the will of the Gods. They
teach many things, to the men of chief Nobility in that Nation, privily and
a long time together, even by the space of twenty years, in some Cave of the
earth, or in unseen corners.

One of the things which they teach, is escaped into common knowledge:
namely, that men souls are everlasting, and live an other life after they
be departed out of their bodies: and that is to the intent, that men should be
the better for the wars. And therefore when they burned or buried their dead,
they sent with them an account of their affairs, agreeable to their state
aforetime when they were alive, yea, and also a demand of the debts, which
they owed or had owing unto them: yea, and there were some which did willingly
cast themselves into the fires* where their friends corses were burnt, as
folk that looked to live together with them.

The Country which they inhabit, bears wholly the name of Gallia Comata. Of
Nations, are all comprehended under three chief names, and are limited by
great Rivers. For from Mount Pyren* to the River Geround.
Garumna, is Aquitane, from thence to Seane.
Sequana, dwell the French men.
Celtes: and from thence to the Rheine, inhabit the The people of the Lowe
Countries, as Braband, Holland, Zealand, Flaunders, c.
Belgians. Of the Aquitanes, the most renowned are the Auscianes: of the
Celtes, the Heduanes: and of the Belgians, the Treuires. The wealthiest
Cities, are among the Treuires, Augusta: among the Heduanes, Augustodunum: and
the Auscians, Elusaberris. The River of Geround* falling out of Mount Pyren,
runs a long while shallow* and scarce sayleable, saving when he swells,
by reason of winters rain, or of the melting of the snow. But wh^n he is once
increased* by meeting with the comminges in of the flowing Occean, and carries
both his own waters, and the Occeans also* in their going back again: he
becomes somewhat fulser, and the further he goes, still the wider. At
length, being like a great arm of the Sea, he not only bears ^reat
Ships, but also swelling after the manner of the ^aging Sea, he tosses the
Sailers, and that very cruelly, if the wind and the tide be one against an
other. In this Sea is an Island called Antros, the which the Inhabitants thereof
do think to hang loose, and to be lift up with the rising of the water,
because that when it seems high, it ouerdreepeth the water, and when the
waives are up to their full, they not only environ it as before, but also
overpeer it: and the things which at other times would not be seen for the
banks and hills, do then lye open to sight, as from a higher place.

From the going out of Geround, begins the side of the Land that shoots
into the Sea, and lies right over against the coast of Cantabria. The mid
parts thereof are inhabited by sundry sorts of people, bending downward
from the Santons, unto the Osismians. For from thence again, the front of the
shores faces the North again, and so holds on to the The people of A^toys
and Picardie.
Morines, which are the uttermost people of France. And the Morines have not
any thing that is better ^nowne, then the Haven that is called Calis.
Gessoriacum.

The Rh^in^ falling down from the Alps, makes two Lakes within a little of
his head, namelle, It is called now a days, the lower Lake and Cellar.
Ve^et, and ^t is called Poden-sea, and the Lake of Constance.
Acronie, from thence running a long time whole again, and in one channel, he
is dispearsed asunder again* within a little of the Sea, Howbeit yet
Riuer-lyke styll on the left hand, even until he run out into the Sea.

But on the right hand, at the first he is narrow, and like himself: but
afterward, his banks give way, so as he becomes not a River, but a great
Lake, and having filled the fields, is called Fl^uo, and embracing an Island of
the same name, he becomes narrower again, and falls like a River again
into the Sea.

Of Germanie.
The third Chapter.
FRom henceforth to the Alps, Germanie is bounded on the West, with the
Rhyne, on the South, with the Alps themselves, on the East, with the borders
of the Nations of Sarmatia, and on the North, with the Occean Sea. The
Inhabitants are huge of body, and haughty of mind, and according to the
sauadgenesse that is bred in them, do inure both of them, as well their
minds to battle, as their bodies to the custom of pains taking. In the
greatest cold that is, they go naked, till they grow to mans estate, and
childe-hood is very long among them. The men go clothed in Mandilions, or in
barks of Trees: and be the winter never so sharpe, they not only can endure
to swim, but also have a delight in it. They be at war with their next
borderers, and they pick quarrels to them of pleasure, and not of desire to
reign, or to enlarge the things which they possess, (for they do not
greatly manure the grounds which they have) but to make Countries about them
waste. Force is their Law, insomuch that they be not ashamed even of robbery
and murder: only they be good to Strangers, merciful to suppliaunts. They
be so hard and careless of their fare, that they feed even upon raw flesh,
either new killed, or softened by kneading it with their hands and feet, in
the skins of the Cattle and wild Beasts themselves, after it is stiff for
cold.

The Land is troublesome with the multitudes of Rivers, cumbersome with the
multitude of Mountains, and for a great part vntrauelable for Woods,
Fens, and Marshes. Of Fens and Marshes, the greatest are Su^cia, Mesia,
and Melsiagum. Of Woods, the greatest is Herts-wald.
Hercynia. There are some other also that bear name, but as Hercynia is the
greatest, for it is three score days journey over, so is it also the best
known. The highest of the Mountains, are Taurus and Rhetico, saving those
which it is scarcely possible for the tongue of a Roman to utter.

The notablest Rivers, of them that run forth into other Nations, are Danow
or Tonware.
Danubius, and Rhone.
Rhodanus: of them that run into the Rhyne, Maenus, and Lupia: of them that
fall into the Occean, Emse.
Amisius, Weser.
Visurgis, and Albis. Upon the River Albis, is the great gulf called Codanus,
full of Ilandes, both great and small. The sharpe Sea* which is received into
the bosom of those shores, doth no where bear any great breadth, nor any
likeness of a Sea, but is shed out wanderinglie and dispearsedlie, after the
likeness of Rivers, by waters that run into it, and oftentimes run clean
through it. Where it beats upon the shores, it is hemmed in with the banks
of Lands not far distant asunder, so as it is every where almost of a like
scantling, narrow, and resembling an arm of the Sea, bowing and bending from
place to place* with a long brew. In it are the Cimbrians, and Theutons, and
beyond them the Some think these to be the Pomeranes, and some, to be
Prutenes.
Hermions, which are the uttermost people of Germanie.

Of Sarmatia.
The fourth Chapter.
SArmatia being broader innermore, then at the Seas side, is divided from the
former Countries, by the river Visula, from whence it extends back to the
river Danowe.
Ister. The people in their behaviour and Armour, resemble much the Parthians.
But as their Country is of sharper air, so be they of fiercer disposition.
They abide not in Cities, no nor in any certain dwelling places: but as
pasturage provokes them, or as the enemy fleeing or pursuing, gives them
cause, so do they ever convey their goods and Cattle with them, dwelling
always in Tents like warriors, free unbridled, and so vnmeasurablie fierce and
cruel, that even their women go to battle with the men, to the intent they
may be the fitter for the purpose, as soon as they be borne, their right
paps are seared, that the hand which is to be put forth to service, may be
the more at liberty to strike, and their breast become the more manlike. To
bend a bow, to hunt, and to ride, are the tasks of Maidens. To encounter the
enemy, is the wages of women grown: insomuch, that not to have stricken an
enemy, is counted a heinous crime, and for their punishment, they be enjoined
to live Maidens still.

Of Scithia.
The fifth Chapter.
FRom thence-foorth, the Sea coasts of Asia, saving where the snow lies
continually, and where the cold is intolerable, are inhabited by the Nations
of Scithia, called almost all by one name, vniuersallie Sages. The first upon
the Sea coast of Asia, be the Hyperboreans, furthest North beyond the Riphoean
mountains, under the very North-pole: in which Country the Sun doth not
rise and set daily, as it doth with us: but it rises in the Lenton
equinoctial, and sets not again, till the Harvest equinoctial, by reason
whereof, it is day by the space of six whole months together, and likewise
night, by the space of other six months. The Land is narrow, open to the
Sun, fruitful: the Inhabiters are most upright dealers, and live both
longer, more happily than other men. For they enjoying always feastfull
peace, can no skill of war, nor of quarelling, but do buste themselves about
matters of Religion, specially cocerning Apollo, the first fruits whereof,
they be reported to have sent to Delos, at the first by certain Virgins of
theirs, and afterward by their neighbour Nations, delivering them from one to
an other, styll further further, which custom they kept long time, until at
length it was restrained, through default of those Nations. Their dwelling is
in Woods and Forests: and when suffizance, or rather weariness of life comes
upon them, then decking themselves with garlands, they throw themselves
cheerfully headlong into the Sea* from a certain rock, which unto them is the
honourablest burial that can be.

The Caspian Sea breaks into the maine Land, at the first with a narrow and
long gut like a river, and when it is flown in after that manner* in a
straight channel, it sheadeth abroad into three Baize: namely, into the
Hircanian* directly against the mouth, into the Scithian on th^ left hand, and
on the right hand into that which peculiarly, and by the name of the whole, is
called the Caspian Bay. It is altogether rough, cruel, harborlesse, open on
all sides to wind and weather, and more replenished with noisome Beasts, then
other Seas are, and therefore lesss navigable.

At the right hand as ye enter in, the Scithians sir named Grazyers.
Nomades, possess the Sea shores. Within it to the Caspian Bay, are the
Caspians, the Amazons, otherwise called Sauromats. At the Hircania Bay, be the
Abanes, Mosks, and Hircanians. At the Scithian Bay, be the Amards, Pesiks, and
at the entrance it self, the Derbiks. Many Rivers, both great and small, do
run into that coast: but the famousest is Araxes, which springing out of the
side of Mout Taurus, comes down from the Thunder-hilles in one channel, and
issues out into the Caspian in two. So long as he cutteth through the feelds
of Armenia, he glides calm and styll, so as although ye look never so
wistly upon him, ye cannot discern which way he ^unneth.

But when he comes down into the rougher places, then being pinched in on
either side with Rocks, and the more he is pent becoming the more swift, he
breaks himself against the stones, that lye up in his way, and by reason
thereof, tumbles down with great flushing and noise, so swiftly, that by
reason of his forcible fall, he slyppeth not plum down to the ground
underneath him, but spowteth a far of without any channel, carrying his
waters aloft more then the space of an acre, and bearing himself up in a
hanging stream without channel, at length comes bowing down again like a
bow, and becoming calm again, passing on quietly, and scarce moving, from
thence into the foresaid Bay.

Cyrus Cambises, springing out of the foot of the next hill* which is called
Coraxus, run two sundry ways, passing on a great while through Iberia and
Hyrcania in channels far distant, afterward being received into one Lake,
not far from the Sea, they run out into the Hyrcanian Bay, both at one
mouth. Iaxartes and Oxos pass into the Scithian Bay, out of the Countries of
the Sogdianes, from the Deserts of Scithia: Laxartes being great from his
very spring, and Oxo^ becoming greater by the falling of other Rivers into
him, who keeping his course a while from the East into the West, turns aside
first among the Dahanes, and taking his course into the North, opens his
mouth between the Amards, and Pesikes. The Forests of Hyrcanie bring forth
other ugly beasts, but specially the Tiger, a cruel kind of wild beast,
and so swift, that they be wont even with ease to overtake a horse man* that
is gone away upon the spur, and that not once or twice, but diverse times*
after they have gone back again to the place they came out from. The cause
hereof is, that when the horse men having caught up a whelp of theirs, makes
haste to carry it away, and to eschew the fury of them, when they come
near, doth of policy lay down one of many that he had taken away: the
damme catching up the whelp that was cast down, carries it home to her
kennel, and coming back again doth the like oftentimes, vntyl the robber
have escaped by flight into places of more resort, then the Tigers dare
adventure into. What was beyond the Caspian Bay, was a long time doubtful,
namely, whether the foresaid Occean, or whether some Land incombred with^
cold, having neither bound nor end, were cast out beyond it. But besides,
Homer, and the natural Philosophers, who have affirmed the whole world to be
becleeped with the Sea: Cornelius Nepos, though later in time, yet certainer of
credit, reports the same. And for witness thereof, he sciteth Quintus
Metellus the Swift, declaring that he made such a report as this: namely, that
when he had the gouernemet of the Galliaze as Proconful there, the King of the
Sweuians sent him certain Indians for a present: and that when he asked by
what means they came into those Countries, he understood that they were brought
away by force of tempest from the sea coast of India, and that having passed
over the space that is betwixt that Sweueland, at length they arrived upon the
coast of Germanie. Now therefore remains the maine Sea: but the residue of
that side is frozen with continual frost, and therefore is uninhabited.

The Ilandes of Spain, and of the North-partes.
The sixth Chapter.
AGainst the said Coasts which I have glanced at from the angle of Boetica
hitherto, there lye many vnrenowmed, yea, and also nameless Isles. But of those
which I am loath to overpass, Gades butts upon the dairy Streightes, and being
cut off from the very firm Land by a narrow space, and as it were but by a
River, carries almost a direct shore, where it is nearest the maine Land.
Where it faces the Occean, there bolting out with two heads into the deep, it
shrinks in his mid-shore, in one of the which it bears a wealthy City of
the same name, and in the other a Temple of the Egiptian Hercules, noble for
the builders, for the Religion, for the Antiquity, and for the riches
thereof. The builders thereof were the Tyrians: the holiness of it, grows of
the bones of him that lies buried there: as for the years, what a number is
there of them? The beginning of them, comes from the times of Troy: and
continuance of time, hath nourished the wealth.

Against Lusitania, is Erythia, Erythia.
where we read that Geryon dwelt: and other Isles without peculiar names, so
fruitful of soil, that when Corn is once sown, the seed that sheadeth as
they fell the harnessed, springs up again from time to time, and yields at
the least, seven croppes one after an other, and sometimes mo. On the Celtishe
coast are some, The Tynn^ Mines.
which (because they abound with Lead and Tin) are called all by one name,
Cassiterides.

Sena, being situate in the Britishe Sea, against the country of the
Osismydes, is renowned with the Oracle of the God of the Galls, whose Vows in
number nine, are hallowed to continual Virginity. They call them Gallicens,
and are of opinion, that through the singular wisdom wherewith they are
endued, they raise the seas and winds with their charms, and transform
themselves into what Beasts they will, and heal such diseases as to others
are incurable, and know things to come, and prophecy of them, but not unto
any other, then such as sail thither for the nonce, and come of set purpose to
demand (...) counsel of them.

What manner of thing Britain is, and what manner of folk it breeds, we
shall shortly be able to make more tried report. For behold, our most
puissant Prince is now disclosing of it, which hath so long been shut up,
and as a conqueror, not only of vnsubdued, but also of unknown Nations
before his time, his bringing home the certeintie of his own exploits, to be
declared and published in Triumph, in like sort as he endeavoured to come to them
by Battle.

was known in the time of Mela, the Author of this work.
shooting between the North and the West, it faces the mouth of Rhyne, with a
great Angle, and then withdrwing his shoring sides, butts with the one of
them upon France, and with the other upon Germanie. Afterwards being pulled
back, with a continual bank of a direct shore, it sharpens it self again
into diverse Angles, and is three cornered very like Sicilie, plain, great,
and fruitful: howbeit, of such things as are rather for the food of Cattle,
than for the sustenance of men. It bears Woods, Forests, and very great
Rivers, which ebb and flow after the manner of the Sea, whereof some breed
Pearls, and precious Stones.

It bears Nations, and Kings of Nations, but they are all uncivil, and the
further they be from the mayne Land, so much the more unacquainted with the
wealth of other Nations: only rich of Cattle and Land: and (whether it be for
to beautifle themselves; or for some other purpose) they be stained all their
bodies over. They seek occasion of war, and pick quarrels one with an other
from time to time, specially, for desire of sovereignty, and to enlarge those
things which they possess. The fashion of armed Chariorts, which the Brittons
used in Battle.
They fight not only on horseback and on foot, but also in Wagons and
Chariottes, and are armed after the manner of the Galls. They call those
Chariots Couines, which are set with sithes round about the naues.

Above Britain is Ireland, almost of like space, Ireland.
but on both sides equal, with shores e^elong, of an evil air to ^ypen
things that are sown, but so abundant of grass, which is not only rank,
but also sweet, that the Cattle may in a small part of the day, fill
themselves, and if they be not kept from feeding, they burst with grazing
ouer-long.

The Inhabiters thereof are vnnurtured, and ignorant of all virtues, more then
other Nations, but yet have they some knowledge, howbeit altogether void of
godliness. There are thirty Ilandes, The Isles of Orkenay.
called Orchades, dissevered with narrow spaces, one from an other. There are
seven also called Hemodes, scattered against Germanie, in that gulf which we
called Codan. Of these, like as Codanonia, which the Theutons inhabit to this
day, exceeds the rest in bigness, so also it excells them in
fruitfulness. Those that lye against Sarmatia, by reason of the
interchangeable coming and going of the Sea, and because the space that is
betwixt them, is sometimes covered with water, and sometimes left bare, seem
one while to be Lands, and an other while all one with the maine Land.
Moreover, that in them are Oones, Oones.

which have sowsing ears, so side and large, that they are able to wrap in
their whole bodies, and serve them to cloth them with, being otherwise naked:
besides that, it is reported in Fables, I find it also in such Authors, as I
am not ashamed to follow. Iseland.
Thule is situate against the Coast of the Belgies, renowned in the Poetries,
both of the Greekes and of us. In it, because the Sun rises and sets
far of, the nights are very short: in Winter-season dark, as in other
places, and in Summer lightsome, because at that time the Sun mounting
somewhat high, although he be not seen, yet sheadeth a glimmering light into
the parts near where he goes. But in the heart of Summer, there is no night
at all, because at that time being nearer sight, he shows not only a
brightness, but also the greate^t part of himself.

Talga, in the Caspian Sea, being plentiful without tyllage, hath abundance
of Corue and all fruits: howbeit, the people near abouts, think it
unlawful, and as ill as Church-robbing, to touch any of the things that grow
there, for they think they are prepared for the Gods, and that they are to
be spared for the Gods. Also, against those coasts which we said to be
Desert, ly^ some Ilandes that are Desert likewise, which being nameless of
themselves, are called the Scithish Isles. From these the Coast turns again
into the East, and extends to the Coast that beholds the Sun rising. This
from the Scithish Foreland, lying directly against the same side, first is
altogether vntrauelable for snow, and afterward for sauadgenesse of the
Inhabiters, vnhusbanded.

The Eaters of man^ flesh.
Anthropophages and Sages, and Scithians, dissevered with a Country which is a
wilderness, by reason it swarmeth with wild Beasts. Beyond again be waste
grounds, annoyed with Beasts, unto the Foreland of Tabis, which hangs into
the Sea: far from thence rises Mount Taurus in height. Between them, are
the Seres, a Nation full of upright dealing, as appears by the exchange of
wares. that they make by leaving of their things in the wilderness, and going
their way.

Of India.
The seventh Chapter.
INdia, a Country right famous, which butts not only upon the East
Occean, but also upon the Southern, which we have called the Indishe Occean,
and on the West, is bounded with the ridges of Mount Taurus, occupies as much
space along the Sea coast, as a Ship with full Sails, may pass in three
score days, and as many nights.

It is so far distant from our Countries, that in some part thereof, none of
both the North ways appear, and contrariwise to other Regions, the shadows
of things fall into the South. Howbeit, it is fruitful, and replenished with
sundry sorts of men and beasts. Ants as big as Mastiues.
It breeds Antes, full as big as the greatest sort of Mastiues, which after
the manner of Gryffons, are reported to keep Gold dug out of the innermore
parts of the earth, and to put them in danger of their lives, that dare
adventure to touch it.

Also, Hage Serpents.
there be some so unmeasurable great Serpents, that they overthrow
Elephants, with biting them, and with winding their tails about them. In some
places, the Soil is so fat and fruitful, Honey, Cotton and Reeds.
that Honey drops from the leaves of Trees, Woods bear Wool, and the
Reeds being cl^aued in the midst, make Boats between knot and knot, able to
carry two men a piece, and some three men.

Of the Inhabiters, the Apparel and manners are diverse. Some are clad in
lynnen, The manners and apparel of the ancient Indians,
or with the wool aforesaid, some with the skins of Beasts and Birds:
some go naked: some hide only their privy members: some are lowe of stature
and small: othersome are so tall and hudge of body, that they take the backs
of Elephants, and ride upon them as easily and handsomelie, as we do upon
our Horses, and yet the Elephants are very great and large there.

Some think it good to kill no living thing, nor to eat any flesh. Some live
only by Fish: some kill their neighbours and parents, in manner of
Sacrifice, before they pine away with age and sickness, and think it not
only lawful, but also godly, to eat the bowels of them when they have
killed them. But if they be attached with old age or sickness, they get them
out of all company into the Wilderness, and there without sorrowing for the
matter, abide the end of their life.

The wiser sort of them, which are trained up in the profession and study of
wisdom, ^ger not for death, but hasten it, by throwing themselves into the
fire, which is counted a glory.

Of the Cities which they inhabit (which are very many, Nysa and mou^ Meros.
) the famousest and greatest is Nysa: a^d of the Mountains, Meros, (which is
hallowed unto Iup^er) hath the thief renown. Nysa, because Bacchus is
supposed to have been borne in it, and Meros, because Bacchus was supposed to
have been fostered in the Cave thereof. Whereupon, either good grounded
matter, or else vain report was ministered to the Greek Authors, to say that
Bacchus was sowed in Iupiters thigh.

From the River Indus, to the River Ganges, the Palibotranes inhabit all the
coast. From Ganges, to the Foreland of Iolis, dwell the Nysians, where the
heate is more fervent, then that it may be inhabited, there do dwell Nations
swart, and in manner all one with the Ethyopians. from Iolis to Cudum, the
shores are straight, and the people fearful, and weltering in riches of the
Salt-water.

There is a Foreland called Tamos, which Mount Taurus raises: it is the Angle
of an other part, and the beginning of the side toward the South. There are the
Rivers of Ganges and Indus. The greatness of the River Ganges.
Ganges springing out of many heads in Haemodes, a Mountain of Inde, as soon
as he comes in one channel, becomes of all Rivers the greatest: and being
in some place broader, where he runs narrowest, he is ten miles over, and
disperses himself into seven coasts.

Indus rising out of the Mountain Paropamisus, The River Indus
recey^eth into it other Rivers also, whereof the noblest are Cophes, Acesines,
and Hydaspes, and in broad channel, carries the water that he hath received
out of many streams. Henceforth he almost matches Ganges in bigness.
Afterward, when he hath girded the hill oftentimes with many great windlasses.
He comes down again hudge, straight, and in one channel, until at length
splitting himself to the right hand and to the left, he empties himself at
two mouths, far distant one from an other.

At Tamos, is an I'll called Gold-land.
Chryse: and at Ganges an other called Syluer-land.
A^gyre. The soil of the one is Gold (so have ancient Authors reported,) and
the soil of the other Silver: and so it comes to pass, of most likelihoodde,
that either the names of them are given them of the thing, or else the Fable is
forged of their names.

is reported of Hypparchus, to be either some very great Island, or else the
hithermost part of the other world. But for as much as it is inhabited, and no
man by report is near about it, it shoots near the truth. On the contrary
part, The Gates of the Sun.
there are the mouths, called the Gates of the Sun, so uninhabitable, that
as soon as men enter into them, the outrageous heate of the calm air,
smothers them by and by.

Between the mouths, lies a scattered country, somewhere void of
inhabitants, by reason of the intolerable heate. From thence to the entrance
of the red Sea, lies a way-lesse and Desert ground, more like ashes then
dust, and therefore there run out of it very few streams, and those not
great, whereof we hear say, the notablest are Tubero, and Arusaces. The
Greekes (whether it be because it is of that colour, or because one Erythras
reigned there,) The red Sea.
call the red Sea, Erythran Thalassan. It is a stormy, rough, and deep
water, and nourishes hudge beasts, more then all other Seas.

At the first, it beats euenlie upon the uttermost banks of the earth giving
way, and if it entered not somewhat inner, it were but some broad Bay. But
where it had bowed the banks, it breaks twice in, and opens again two
other gulfs, whereof that which is nearer to the foresaid Countries, is
called the Persian gulf, and the further is called the Arabishe gulf.

Of the Persian gulf.
The eight Chapter.
The gulf of Persia, where it takes in the Sea, comprehends a great mouth,
with straight jaws on both sides, in likeness of a neck: and then the Land
(which every way shrinks in a great space, and every where a like)
enuironeth the Salt-water within the compass of a great round shore, and
makes the likeness of a mans head.

The mouth of the Arabishe gulf is narrower, and the breadth lesser, but the
retreit is somewhat bigger, and the sides much longer. It runs far into
the maine Land, until it attain almost unto Egipt and Mount Casius of Arabia,
wexing less and less wide into a point, and the further it pierces, the
narrower.

From these said things to the gulf of Persia, all is wilderness,

sail, are situate the Carmanians, Carmania, now called Rasigut.
without Apparel, without Corn, without Cattle, and without houses, who
cloth themselves with Fishes skins, and feed on their ^eshe, and are rough
all their bodies over, save their heads. The inner parts are inhabited by the
Gedrosians, and forth on by the Persians. Through Carmania runs Cethis, and
above them run Andanis and Corios, into the Sea.

In that part, that is over against the mouth of the Sea, are the bounds of
the Babylonians, and Chaldyes, and two noble Rivers, Tygris Tygris.

coast. Euphrates, opening an exceeding wide mouth, doth not only pass
forth, from whence he rises, but also falls mainlie: neither doth he by
and by cut through the fields, from place to place as he goes, but spreading
wide into Pooles, and becoming slow with long settled waters abroad without
Channel, afterward when he hath broken out of his brim, becomes a River in
deed, and purchasing banks, runs swift and fomie Westward through the
Armenians and Capadocians, as though he would come into our Seas if Mount
Tau^us let him not. From thence he is turned of to the South, and entering
first into Syria, and afterward into Arabia, holds not out into the Sea, but
one while being great and able to bear Ships, and anon after becoming
lank, dies a pelting Brooke, and no where runs out again with issue to be
seen, as other Rivers do, but soketh away into the ground. The other side is
environed with a Country shooting forth between both the Seas, named
Arabia, Arabia.

possess the greater part thereof next unto the mouth, and the Maces the part
over against the Carmanians. That which lies between the mouths is rough
with Woods and cragged Cliffs. In the midst are certain Isles of which Ogiris
is more famous then the rest, because the Tumbe of King Erithras is in it.

The gulf of Arabia.
The ninth Chapter.
THe other Gulf is enclosed round about by the Arabians. On that side which is
on the right hand as men enter in, are the Cities Carre, Arabia, and Gaudam.
On the otherside in the innermost Angle are, first Beronice between
Heroopoliticum and Strobilum: next Philoteris and Ptolemais, between the
promontories Merouenon and Colaca: beyond them, Arsino^ and another Beronice:

which were destroyed in a battle that was fought against the Cranes for their
Corn that was sown. There be many kinds of wild fowls, and many kinds of
Serpents. Winged Serpents.
Of Serpents the worthiest to be had in remembrance, are those which being
very little (and whose stinging is present death,) are reported to come forth
of the mud of the frozen Fens at a certain time of the year, and from
thence flying in flocks toward Aegipt, are in the entrance thereof
encountered with another flock of Birds called Ibisles, which fight with them
and destroy them. Of Birds the worthiest to be spoken of is the Phoenix, The
Phoenix.
which is evermore but one alone: for it is not conceived by treading or
disclosed by hatching. But when he hath continued the full time of five hundred
years, he brooth himself upon a Nest that he hath timbered of diverse

BEyond them dwell the Ethyopians. The Meriones have the Land which Nylus
embraces about, in the first windlasse that he fetches, where he makes an
Island. Some of them (because they live half as long again almost as we do)
are called Macrobians: and some of them (because they came out of Egipt) are
named Automales.

preciouser* whereof they have the less store. They make their ornaments of
Brass, and their fetters for offenders of Gold. There is a place continually
furnished with meates ready dressed to eat, and because every man may eat
thereof at his pleasure, they call it the Table of the Sun, The Table of the

thither by the providence of God.

There is a Lake, A s^raunge Lake.

and shining as if they were anointed with Oil. Yet is the same droonke also:
and it is so sheer, and so weak to bear up things that fall into it or are
borken into it, that it is not able to bear up the leaves that fall from the
Trees about, but that by and by they sink down to the very bottom. There are
also most cruel beasts, Strange beasts.

have read of them. There are also wonderful Birds, Strange Birds.
as Tragopomones which have horns, and Pegasies which have ears like horses.
But as men sail along the coasts into the Eastward, they meet with nothing
worth remembrance, all is wast, all is full of steep cliffs, and there are
rather banks then shores. From thence is a great Coast inhabited. It was a
doubtful matter a good while, whether there were a Sea beyond, and whether the
land might be coasted about, or whether Affricke being altogether void of
fruit, extended so far as that there were none end of it. But Hanno of
Carthage being sent by his countrime to search the coasts, The voyage of
Hanno Captain of Carthage about the coast of Affricke.
when he had passed out at the mouth of the Ocean, saylinge about a great part
thereof, reported that he wanted not Sea room, but victual. And in the time
of our grandfathers, one Eudoxus fleeing from Latirus King of Alexandria,
passed out of the gulf of Arabia, and (as Nepos affirms) was brought by this
Sea even unto the Gads, The Journey of Eudoxus.
by means whereof some things of that coast are come to knowledge. Beyond
those places which we said even now to be desert, Speechless people.
there are dumb people which use signs in steed of speech. Some have no
sound of tongue: some have no tongue at al: some have their lips growing
together, saving that they have little round pipeholes in their Nostrils
at which they suck in drink: and when they have list to eat, they are
reported to draw in one grain of Corn at once, which grows every where.
There are people towhom (before ye coming of Eudoxus) fire was so unknown,
People unacquainted with fire.
that they were wonderfully delighted with the use thereof, and gladly embraced
the flames and put burning coals in their bosoms, until such time as they
felt it hurt them. Above them the shore fetching a great compass, encloses a
great I'll, wherein are reported to be none but women, heary over al their
bodies, which of their own nature bear children without the company of men:
A strange kind of Women.
and they be of so f^erce and boystous kind, that some of them can scarce be
restrained from struggling, no not even with chains.

This report was made by Hanno, and because he brought home the skins of some
that he had killed: he was the better believed. Beyond this gulf is a high
Hill called of the Greekes Gods Chariot, A Hill called Gods Chariot.
which burns with continual fire. Beyond this mountain is another Hill with
a long ridge fresh and green, lying all along the Sea side, from whence is a
prospect into a Champion Country of much more wideness, then that a man may
see to the end of it. The opinion of the Pannes and Satires Pannes and

night time there appear^ many blazing ^ires, and as it were Camps pitched

Country of these men is a fountain supposed of some to be the head of Nile.
The head of Nilus.
The inhabiters call it Muchull, and it may seem to be all one name with
Nilus, though more corruptly pronounced of the barbarous pople. It nourishes a
River also, which breeds the same kinds of beasts that Nile doth, though
somewhat lesser: whereas all other run toward the Ocean, this only River
goes into the hart of the land toward the East, and no man can say where his
issue is.

Hereupon it is coniect^red, that Nilus being conceived in this spring, and
carried forth a while through wailess^ places, and therefore unknown where he
becomes, shows himself again when he hath proceeded into the East: but by
means of being hidden so lunge, it comes to pass, that men think that this
fountain runs to some other place then to Nile, and that Nile springs
from some other head then from this fountain. Among them is bred a beast of no
great bigness, but having a great and over-great beetle head, and therefore
