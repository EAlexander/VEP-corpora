IOYFVLL NEWS out of the newfound world, wherein are declared the rare and
singular virtues of diverse and sundry Herbs, Trees, Oils, Plants, Stones,
with their applications, as well to the use of Physic, as Surgery: which
being well applied, bring such present remedy for all diseases, as may seem
altogether incredible: notwithstanding by practise found out, to be true.

Also the portraiture of the said Herbs, very aptly described: Englished by
Iohn Frampton Merchant.

Newly corrected as by conference with the old copies may appear. Whereunto
are added three other books treating of the Bezaar stone, the herb
Escuercomera, the properties of iron and steel, in Medicine and the benefit
of snow.

Imprinted at London, in Paules Churchyard at the sign of the Quenes Arms, by
William Norton. 1580.

To the right worshipful Master Edwarde Dier Esquier, Iohn Frampton wishes
much health, with prosperous and perfect felicity.
REturning right worshipful, home into Englande out of Spain, and now not
pressed with the former toils of my old trade, to pass the time to some
benefit of my country, and to avoid idleness; I took in hand to translate
out of Spanish into English, the three books of Doctor Monardes of Seuil, the
learned Physician, treating of the singular and rare virtues of certain
Herbs, Trees, Oils, Plants, Stoner, Drugs of the West Indies, for that the
same book is of high commendation in Spain, and other countries, in such
sort, that in deed it might bring in time rare profit, to my Country folks
of Englande, by wonderful cures of sund^ great diseases, that otherwise then by
these r^edies, were incurable. And having finished ^he same translation, I
determined to dedicate my travail therein, to some rare lover of knowledge,
for the worthiness of the work: and not finding any Gentleman of mine
acquaintance, that was more studious, and more delighted with learned works, or
that more cherished travellers, and lovers of all good knowledge, determined to
dedicate the same to your worship before al others, requesting your
worship to accept the work, and to be a patron of the same, and to take it
into your protection, since the matter is of good substance, and of much value,
and of me, truly f^ithfully translated into English. And since the aforesaid
Medicines mentioned in the same work of Docto^ Mo^ardes, are now by Merchants
others, brought out of the West Indies into Spain^, and from Spain hither into
England, by such as do d^ily traffick^ thither, and that the excellency of
these Herbs, Trees, Oils, Plants, stones, c. have bin known to be so
precious a remedy for all manner of diseases, and hurts, that may hap unto
Man, Woman, or Child, they have le^t of and forsaken very much the old order
and ma^ner of Physic, which was used before that this was known, as things
not of so present remedy for all manner of diseases, as these now late found
owt, are; which by great experience made in Spain, and other Countries, were
thoroughly and effectuously proved and experimented, to work the effects
which are contained in this Book. And thus I leave your worship to the
Almighty, beseeching him to give you long life, and for the Common-wealthes
sake that advancement, that your good nature, and rare virtues do well
deserve. From London the first of October. 1577.

Your worships during life to command: Iohn Frampton.

THE FIRST PART OF THIS BOOK TREATS OF THE things that are brought from the
Occidental Indies, which serve for the use of Medicine, and of the order that
must be kept in taking the root called Mechoacan, wherein are discovered great
secretes of Nature, and great experiences: made and compiled by Doctor
Monardus, Physician of Seuill.
IN the year of our Lord God, a thousand, four hundredth ninety two, our
Spaniards were governed by sir Christopher Colo, being naturally born in the
country of Genoua, to discover the Occidetal Indies, that are called at this
day, the new world, and they discovered the first land thereof, the xi. day of
October, of the said year: from that time unto this, they have discovered many
sundry Islands, and much firm land, as well in that country, which they cal
the new Spain, as in that which is called the Peru, where there are many
Provinces, many Kingdoms, and many Cities, that have contrary and diverse
customs in them, in which there have been found out, things that never in
these parts, nor in any other parts of the world have been seen, nor unto
this day known: and other things which now are brought unto us in great
abundance, that is to say, Gold, Silver, Pearls, Emeralds, Turkeies, other
fine stones of great value. Yet great is the excess and quantity that hath
come, and every day doth come, and inespecially of Gold and Silver, that it
is a thing worthy of admiration the great number of Melons, which have come
from thence, besides the great quantity of pearls which have stored the whole
world: also they do bring f^om those parts, Popingaies, Griffons, Apes,
Lions, Gerfaucons, other kinds of Hawk, Tigers wool, Cotton wool, Grain to
die colou^es with al, Hides, Sugars, Coppar, Brasill, the wood Ebano Anill: and
of all these, there is so great quantity, that there comes every year, one
hundred ships laden therewith, that it is a great thing, and an incredible
riches.

And besides these great riches, our Occidental Indies do send unto us many
Trees, Me^icines th^t our Occidental Indies do send us.
Plants, Herbs, Roots, Iuices, Gummes, Fruits, Licoures Stones that are of
great m^dicinall virtues, in the which there be found, and have been found in
them, very great effects that do exceed much in value and price all the
aforesaid things, by so much as the corporal health is more excellent, and
necessary then the temporal goods: the which things all the world doth
lack, the want whereof is not a little hurtful, according to the great
profit which we do see, by the use of them to follow, not only in our
Spain, but also in all the world.

And this is not too be meruelled at, that it is so, for the Philosoph^r doth
say, Aristotle.
that all Countries do not yield Plants and Fruits alike: for one Region
yields such Fruits, Trees, and Plants as an other doth not: we do see
that in Creta only grows the Diptamo, and the Licence only in the region of
Saba, and the Almaciga only in the Island of Chio, and the Sinamom, Cloves,
and Pepper, and other spices only in the Islands of the Maluca, and many other
things you have in diverse parts of the world, which were not known until
our time, and the people of old time did lack them, but Time which is the
discoverer of all things, hath discovered them unto us greatly to our profit,
considering the great need that we h^d of th^m.

And as there are discovered new regions, new kingdoms, and new Provinces,
by our Spaniardes, The discovery of the Indies.
so they have brought unto us new Medicines, and new Remedies, wherewith they
do cure many infirmities, which, if we did lack them, would be incurable,
and without any remedy: of which things although that some have knowledge,
yet they be not common too all people, for which cause I did pretend to treat,
and to write, of all things that they bring from our Indies, apperteyning to
the art and use of Medicine, and the remedy of the hurts and diseases that
we do suffer and endure, whereof no small profit doth follow to those of
our time, and also unto them that shall come after us: in the betraying
whereof I shall be the first, that the rather the followers may add hereunto,
with this beginning, that which they shall more know, and by experience
hereafter find out.

And as in this City of Seuill, which is the Port and scale of all the
Occidental Indies, we do know of them more, then in any other parts of all
Spain, for because that al things come first hither, where by better
intelligence and greater experience it is learned: so do I, with practice and
use of them this forty years, that which I do cure in this City, where I
have informed my self of them, that have brought these things out of those
parts with much care, and I have made experience thereof, with many and
diverse persons, with all diligence and foresight possible, and with much happy
success.

Of the Anime and Copall.
THey do bring from the new Spain 2. kinds of Rosine, that be both much alike
one to the other, Of the Copal.
the one is called Copall, and the other Anime. The Copall is a Rosine very
white, and of much brightness, it is brought in certain great pieces, which
are like too pieces of Diacitron very clear, it hath an indifferent smell, but
not so good as the Anime: with this Copall, the Indians did make perfumes in
their sacrifices, so the use thereof was frequented in the Temples, by their
Priests.

And when the first Spaniardes went too those parts, the Priests went out to
receive them, Hi^torie.
with little firepots, burning in them this Copall, and giving to them the
smoke of it at their noses: we do use here to perfume with it in diseases
rising upon coldenesse of the head, in the place of Licence, or Anime: it is
hot in the second degree, and moist in the first, it is resoluatiue, and
softneth by some waterish parts, that it hath.

The Anime is a gum or Rosine of a great Tree, it is white, What Anime is.
it draws near to the colour of Licence, it is more oily then the Copall
is, it comes in grains, as the Licence doth, although somewhat greater, and
being broken, it hath a yellow colour, as Rosine hath: it is of a very
acceptable and pleasant smell, and put upon burning coals, it doth consume
very quickly.

It differs from our Anime, that is brought from Leuante, H^w it di^fereth
from ours.

Of the congeled amber.


which is not so white, nor so bright, insomuch that some do say, that it is
spice of Charabe or Succino, which is called Amber congeled, wherewith they do
make Beads, but it is not so, for that the Charabe is a kind of Pitch, that
is found in the Germayne Sea, and it is taken out of the Sea in great pieces,
with a drag of Iron, so that it seems to come forth of some Fountains,
into the Sea, after the manner of pitch, and being come forth unto the cold
air, it congeleth, for because there is s^ene in the same, pieces of sticks,
other superfluities of the Sea, cleaning unto it, and in this they shall see
the error of them, that say that it is Gum of Alamo; and of others, that it
is of the Pinetree.

He^m^au^.
Of our Anime Hermolaus Barbarus, a man most excellently learned doth say,
that it is gather^d about the place where Licence is found, and that land or
soil, A ^arba^ian auth^ur. A place that is call^d Animitin, where our A^ime is
gathered.

The ve^tue thereof.


is called Amintin and therefore the thing is called Anime.

That which is brought from the new Spain, is gathered from certain Trees,
of a reasonable greatness, by way of incision, as the Licence, and Almasiga
are ga^hered: we do use thereof for many infirmities, and principally for the
grief of the head, and pains thereof, caused of humours, or of cold causes,
and for sluffyng in the head, that thereof doth proceed, after evacuation,
perfuming therewith the chambers in the Winter season: and where as are
general infirmities, it doth purify and correct the Air, and they do
perfume therewith their head kerchers, when that they do go to sleep: for
them that do suffer pains in the head, and occasions thereof, it doth
profit to perfume the head of him that is so diseased, it doth comfort the
head unto such as have it debilited, or weakened, and do suffer pains by
occasion thereof: they do put it also in plasters, and in seer clothes,
where as is need of comfort, and to dissolve, especially cold humours, or
windinesse: they do use it also in place of Licence, as well in the perfumes,
as in the aforesaid.

It doth comfort the brain, The complexion that it hath.
applied in the form of a plaster, and even so likewise the stomach, and all
parts being full of Sinews, made after the fashion of a Sere cloth with the
third part of Wax: it takes out the cold of any member, whatsoever, being
applied therevntoo for a long time, with refreshing it. It is hot in the
second degree, and moist in the first.

Of the gum called Tacamahaca.
AND also they do bring out of the new Spain an other kind of Gum or
Rosine, Of the Tacamahaca.
which the Indians do call Tacamahaca, and the same name did our Spaniardes
give it, it is Rosine taken out by incision of a tree, being as great, as a
Willow tree, and is of a very sweet smell, it brings forth a red fruit,
as the seed of Pionia.

How the Indians use it.
This Rosine or Gum, the Indians do much use in their infirmities, chiefly in
swellinges in any part of the body, wheresoever they be engendered, for that
it dissolveth, ripens, and marvelously desolueth them. And even so, it
takes away any manner of grief, that is come of a cold cause: as humours,
and windinesse: this the Indians do use very commonly, and familiarly. And for
this effect the Spaniardes hath brought it.

The property that it hath.
The colour is as the colour of Galuano, and some do say that it is the same,
it hath white parts like to Amoniaco, it is of a good smell, and the taste is
like, insomuch that being cast upon hot burning coals, and giving the smoke
thereof at the nose of a woman that doth swoon, or else hath lost her feeling
by suffocation of the Mother, it doth cause her to come quickly, and easily
to her self. And the Rosine put to her n^uell, Good for the diseases of the
Mother.
after the manner of a plaster, causes the Mother to keep in her place: and
the use thereof is so much amongst women, that the most part which is spent
thereof, is for this effect, for that they do find themselves very much eased
by it, taking away from them all manner of chokinges of the Mother, and
comforting the stomach. Some that be curious do add thereuntoo Amber and
Musk, and so it is better then alone. It is always fixed, without melting of
it self, until that it be al wholly wasted.

And where it doth most profit, is for to take away any manner of grief,
caused of cold humours and windy, and being applied unto them in manner of a
plaster, In any manner of grief.
it takes them away, and dissolveth them with great admiration: it doth
clean in such sort, that until it hath done, and wrought his effect, it can
not be taken away, and the self same it doth, being laid upon swellinges,
for that it consumes and desolueth them, and if there be any desire to ripen
them, it doth it, and that very quickly.

It is also a remedy verified, and experimented, The virtue thereof.
that it doth profit much in Reumes, and Runnings, wheresoever they go, for
it takes them away, putting a small piece of linen cloth with this Rosine,
behind both the ears, or the ear on the part which runs, for that it
doth restrain the running of them: and applied unto the temples of the head,
in manner of a plaster, it doth withhold the runnings and the flux, that
runs to the eyes, and to the parts of the face: In the toothache.
it takethaway the tothe ache, although that the tothe be hollow, by putting
a little of this Rosine into the hollow, and if therewith the rotten tothe be
burned, it makes that the corruption goes no further: and being laid after
the manner of a plaster in the hollowness of the neck, or grief of the
shoulders, it takes away the pains: mingled with the third part of storax,
and a little Amber made in a plaster, for the stomach, it doth comfort it,
and causes appetite to meat, It coforteth the stomach.
it helps digestion, and dissolveth windines: after the same sort put upon
the mold of the head, it comfort, and takes away the pains thereof. In
the Sciatica, or pains of the hippes put thereunto, the effect thereof is
great: In the grief of the h^ad. In the Sciatica.
and likewise it is so in all pains of the joints: and in any payne of the
body whersoeuer it be, chiefly if it come of cold humours, or mixed: For because
with his resolution, it hath parts of binding, which do give a marvelous
comforting in joints, or in hurts of Sinews, In the grief of the joints.
putting that alone, it doth heal and cure them, for great is the
experience, that we have of it, i^genderyng forth with matter: it takes away
an extreme cold: In the hurts of Sinews.
ordinarily it is applied to all griefs: I do mingle therewith the third
part of yellow Wax, for that will be applied the better, and the use thereof
is so celebrated, that the people know no other remedy for any grief, but only
the use of this Rosine, In al griefs.
so that it be not inflammations very hot, and also in them after the first
fury is past, The complexion thereof.
and the fearcenesse thereof, it doth profit much for to dissolve the rest: it
is hot in the beginning of the third degree, and dry in the second.

Of the Gum Caranna.
THey do bring from the firm Land, by the way of Cartagena, Caranna.
and number de Dios, A Rosin of the colour of Tacamahaca, somewhat clear, and
thin, called in the Indians language, Caranna, and this word and name our
Spaniardes have given it, and it hath in manner the smell of the Tacamahaca,
although it be somewhat more strong of smell, it is very oily, and it
cleaves fast without melting, for the clamminesse that it hath. It is a new
Medicine, and brought hither about a ten years past, and the Indians do use
it in their infirmities against swellinges, and in all manner of griefs, and
now in our parts it is much esteemed, for the great effects that it doth
work.

It doth profit and heal the same infirmities, that the Tacamahaca doth, The
virtues.
but it works more speedily, so that many infirmities, wherein the
Tacamahaca doth not so much effect, the Caranna doth easily heal. There was
one that did suffer pains in his shoulders, the wc pains he had suffered a
long time, It heals an old grief of the shoulder.
in such sort, that he could not stir his Arms, having used a great time the
Tacamahaca, yet he was not healed, until he had put thereunto the Caranna,
and thereby in three days he was made whole. In the griefs of the Iointes, In
the griefs of the joints.
and the Go^t Arthetica, it hath a marvelous effect, being applied unto the
grief, so that it be not an inflammation, of very hot humour, for it takes
it away, with much easiness. In old swellinges, as well in humours as in
winds, In swellings.
it dissolveth, in griefs caused by defluxe or running of cold humours or
mixed, it works a marvelous ^ffect: in all pains of the Sinews, and
griefs of the head, and griefs that thereof do proceed, it profits much.
In griefs of Sinews.
Surely, it is a medicine to dissolve and to take away griefs of great
efficacy, and doth make his work with great certainty in new green wounds,
especially of the Sinews: it doth much profit, and greatly in joints, In
new wounds.
in the which I have seen done only therewith very great works: it is an
intercepting to state the flux and running of the eyes, and other parts
applied behind the ears, It stays the running of the eyes

Note.


and in the temples of the head. It is very fatty and oily, and hot more then
in the second degree.

And it is to be noted, that all these Rosines the Indians do gather by way of
Incision, by giving cuts in the Trees, of which forthwith the liquor doth
drop out, and from thence they gather it.

Of the Oil of the Fig tree of Hell.
FRom Gelisco, a Province in the new Spain, they bring an Oil or Liquor,
Oil of the Fig tree.
that the Spaniards have called, oil of the Fig tree of Hell, for that it is
taken from a tree that is no more nor less the our Fig tree of Hell, as well in
the Leaf, as in the Fruit: it is the same that we do commonly call
Chatapucia, or Cherua, it is also milkish as ours is, for that it is more
burning in the Indies for the grosnes of the earth.

The Indians do make this oil, as Dioscorides doth show, in the first
book, the xxx. Chapter, that is, How this oil is made.
do pound the seed, sees it in water, and after it is sodden, then they
gather the Oil that swims upon it, with a Spoon, and this is the manner to
make Oil of fruit and Seeds, and Bows of trees: It is very much frequented
and used of the Indians. As for expression or wringing out the juice, they do
not know how to do it, for lack of knowledge, this kind of oil principally
is better drawn out this way, than by expression. The virtues and effects.
This Oil hath great virtues, as by the use thereof hath been seen, as well
in the Indies, as in our parts, and all that I will say, is of very great
experience, and much use thereof in many persons: it doth heal and cure all
infirmities caused of cold humours, Cures in general.
and windines, it doth dissolve al hardness with mollification, and all
inflammations being windy: it takes away all manner of pain in what part
soever it be, chiefly if it come of any cold cause, It takes away pain.
or windines, for that in this, it makes a marvelous work, dissolving
great windinesse, wheresoever it be, and especially in the belly: and with
this they do heal a windy Dropsy, It heals a windy dropsy.
likewise al kinds thereof, annoyuting there withal the Belly, and Stomach,
taking some drops thereof with wine, or other liquor appropriated, that it may
avoid the citrine water, and make the wind to be expelled: and if they do
put it in any manner Glister, or Medicine, given so it doth avoid out the
citrine water, and doth expel Winds with more assurance than any other
Medicine. In griefs of the stomach and Colike.
In the griefs of the Stomach of cold humours, and winds, and Colicke, it
works great effect, anointing therewith, and taking some drops thereof, and
principally they do this in that mortal disease called the Ileon, which is a
cetrayne filthines that purges at the mouth. It doth avoid fleam
principally, In griefs of the Iointes.
in griefs of the Iointes certain drops of this oil taken with the broth of
some fat foul, it doth empt away the humour that causes the pain, it doth
heal the old sores of the head, It heals soars. History.
that doth yield much matter.

A Gentleman that did vomit his meat the space of many years, did anoint his
stomach with this oil, and therewith did recover never v^mitted again: It
vndoeth opilations.
It doth undo Opilations of the inner parts of the body, of the stomach, of
the Mother, anointing it therewith. And unto young children and Boys, that
cannot go to the Stool, It makes them go to the stool.
anointing the lower part of the Nauill with this oil, it doth provoke them
to the stool: and if they have worms, it doth expel and kille them, chiefly
if they give them a drop or two with milk, or with some fat gross thing.
And for those that have lost their hearing, For the that have lost their
hearing.

In griefs of the Joints. For the members drawn together.

It takes away the Morphewe, marks or signs of the face.

The coplexio thereof.


it causes it to be restored to them, with a marvelous work, as it hath
been seen by many experiences. In griefs of Iointes, and in griefs of
swellinges, so that they come not of a very hot cause, it takes them away
and doth dissolve them: any of the mebers being drawn together, and
anointed with this Oil, they do extend and the Sinews are mollified with
it, taking away the grief if that there be any: it takes away any marks or
signs, wheresoever they be in the face, principally, and the Morphewe which
women many times be troubled withal, the anointing with this Oil, doth take
it away, and consumes it, not with little content to them that use it. It is
hot in the first part of the third degree, and moist in the second.

Of the Bitume which is a kind of pitch.
THere is in the Island of Cuba, Bitumen.
certain Fountains at the Sea side, that do cast from them a kind of black
Pitch of a strong smell, which the Indians do use in their cold infirmities.
Our people do use it there to pitch their Ships withal, for it is well
near like unto Tar, and they do mingle therewith Tallow, to make it Pitch
the better. I do believe that this is Napta, Napta.
which the ancient wryters do speak of. Possidonio says, that there are
two Fountains thereof in Babylon, one white and the other black.

That which is brought fro the Indies, The virtues.
we do use against griefs of the Mother, for that it doth reduce the Mother
to her place. And if it rise on high, then put it to the Nostrils, and if
it come down to the lower parts, putting thereto a wet tent with this Pitch,
it causes it to go upward, to her place: and likewise it doth profit, being
applied to cold Infirmities, as the other Medicines do which we have spoken of.
It is hot in the second degree, moist in the first.

Of liquid Amber, the Oil thereof.
FRom the new Spain they do bring a Rosine that we call Liquid Amber, and
one like Oil that we call Oil of Liquid Amber, that is to say, a thing that
we do most set by, and as precious as Amber, or Oil thereof, both of them
being of sweet smell of good savour, and especially the Oil of Liquid Amber,
which is of savour more delicate and sweet than Amber. What liquid Amber is.
A Rosine taken out by incision from certain trees very great and fair, and
full of leaves, which are like to Ivy, and the Indians do call them Ococol.
They carry a thick rind, of the colour of Ashes, this rind being cut, doth
cast out the Liquid Amber thick, and so they do gather it, and because the
rind hath a smell very sweet, they do break and mingle it with the Rosine,
and when it is burned, it hath a better smell, in so much, wheresoever the
trees are, there is a most sweet smell through all the fields.

History.
When the Spaniardes came the first time, to that place where it grows, and
did feel such a sweet smell, they thought that there had been spices, and
trees thereof.

There is brought much quantity of Liquid Amber into Spain, The use of it.
insomuch that they do bring many Pipes, and Barelles full thereof to sell for
Merchandise, for here they raise profit thereof, to perfume in things of
sweet smells, wasting it in place of Storax, for that the smoke and smell
doth seem to be the same: and also they do put it into other confections of
sweet smells to burn, and such like things. It casts from it so much
smell without burning of it, that wheresoever it be, it cannot be hidden, but
doth penetrate many houses and streets with the sweet smell, when there i^
quantity of it.

It serves much in medicine, doth therein great effect, for that it heals,
comfort, dissolveth, The works and effects of it.
and mittigateth payne applied unto the Mold of the heads by it self, or
mingled with other things Aromaticall, it doth comfort the brains, and takes
away the pains of any manner of grief, proceeding of a could cause laid
after the manner of a Plaster thereunto, it doth also mitigate, and take away
the pains, griefs of the stomach, wherein it doth a marvelous ^ffect,
applied after the manner of a Stomacher. For that it doth comfort the Stomach, A
marvelous plaster.
and doth dissolve winds, and help digestion, and take away rawnesse it
causes the meat to be well digested, it gives lust to eat: it is made of
Liquid Amber, spread abroad upon a sheeps skin, in the form of a
breastplate, mingled with a little Storax, Amber and Musk, it is a Plaster
which doth profit much in all that I have said. There is known of this
plaster very great experience, in this City, for the good effect that it
works: it is hot in the end of the second degree, and moist in the first.

Out of this Liquid Amber, is taken the Oil that is called the oil of Liquid
Amber, Of the Oil of Liquid Amber, and how it is take.
the which in his smell is more sweet, it is taken out of the Liquid Amber when
it is newly gathered, putting it in part where it may distill of it self,
(the more subtle) is the perfectest and best of all.

Others there be that do press it, because the more quantity thereof may be
taken out, they bring it for merchandise, for that they use to dress Gloves
therewith for the common people, and in this trade there is much spent.

It is used in Medicine for many diseases, and it is of great virtue to heal
cold diseases, The use of it in medicine.
for it heals excellently well al parts wheresoever it be applied, it
dissolveth and mollifies any manner of hardness, taking away the pains: it
dissolveth the hardness of the Mother, and opens the opilations thereof. It
provokes the Monthly course in women, and it makes soft any manner of hard
thing. It is hot well near in the third degree.

And it is to be noted, that many do bring this Storax very thin from the
Indies, Note.
which is not so good, for because that they make it of the bows of the trees,
cut in pieces, and sodden, and they gather the fatness that swims upon: and
the Indians do sell the buds of the trees whereout the Liquid Amber is
taken, made in handfuls, do sell it in their market places, for to put
amongst their clothes, which causes them to smell, as of the water of Angels,
for this purpose the Spaniards do use it.

Of the Balsamo.
THey do bring from the new Spain that liquor most excellent, which for his
excellency and marvelous effects, is called Balsamo, an imitation of the
true Balsamo, that was in the land of Egypt, and for that it doth such great
works, and remedy so many infirmities, there was given to it such a name. It
is made of a tree greater than a Powngarnet Tree, it carries leaves like to
Nettles: the Indians do call it Xilo, and we do call the same Balsamo. It is
made two manner of ways, the one is by the way of incision, cutting the rynd of
the Tree, which is thin, giving many small cuttinges, out of the which there
comes a clammish liquor, of colour white, but it is little and most
excellent, and very perfect. The other fashion is, whereby the Indians do use
too take out liquor of the trees, which is a common use amongst them is this:
th^y take the bows and the great pieces of the trees, and make them as small,
as they can, and then cast them into a great kettle, with a good quantity of
water, so boyle them until they see it sufficiently done, and afterward they
let it cool, and gather up the oil that doth swim therevppon with certain
shells, and that is the Balsamo that comes too these parts, and that
commonly is used: the colour thereof is Alborne, which is likened to black, it
is of most sweet smell, and very excellent. It is not convenient, nor it ought
to be kept in any other vessel then in silver, (Glass or Tin, or any other
thing glassed, it doth penitrate and doth pass through:) the use thereof is
only in things apperteining to Medicine, and it hath been used of long time,
well near since the new Spain ws discovered, for that incontinent the
Spaniardes had knowledge of it, because they did heal therewith the wounds
that they did receive of the Indians, being advised of the virtue thereof by
the same Indians, and they did see the said Indians heal and cure themselves
therewith.

When it first came into Spain, it was esteemed as much as it was reason it
should be, The estimation that it i^ had in.
for that they did see it make marvelous works, one ownce was worth ten
Duccates and upwards, and now it is better cheap: the first time that they
carried it to Rome, it came to be worth one ounce, one hundredth Duccats: after
that they brought so much and such great quantity, that it is now of small
value: this comes of the abundance of things. And when it was very dear all
men took profit of the profit of it, and since it came to be of so lowe a
Price, Note.
it is not so much esteemed being the s^lfe same Balsamo, that it was then
when it was worth one hundredth Duccates the ounce. Surely if the Indies had
not been discovered, but only for the effect, to send us this marvelous
liquor, Note.
the labour had been well employed which our Spaniardes (...) until the wounds
be whole, and for this cause the use thereof is a common medicine in all surgery
for poor folks, seeing that as with one medicine all effects are wrought
therewith, that are necessary: it is a common thing to say, that when one is
hurt, let Balsamo be put thereunto, and so they do, it doth heal them. In the
wounds of Sinews it works a marvelous effect, for that it doth both cure
heal. It heals better then any other medicine doth, it resists cold, the
wounds of the head it heals very well, not having the Skull broken, nor
perished.

Any manner of wounds being fresh it doth heal in any part of the body
wheresoever they be, so that there be no more in it but a simple wound. In
joints what manner of wound soever it be, it doth make a marvelous work:
The use thereof is very common in this City, in wounds. For that you have
few houses, but you have Balsamo in them for this effect, so that in wounding
of any person forthwith they go to the Balsamo, for with little quantity
thereof they do cure and heal, and many times with putting of it once every
third day, they find the wound whole. In old sores applied by it self, or
with any other ointment, it doth mundifie, and fill them up with flesh.

In large fevers Paroxismales being laid half an hour before the cold doth
come, upon the mold of the head^ very hot, the patient being very well
covered with clothes, and taking forthwith (...) or six drops thereof in
wine, it takes away the cold, in three or four times doing it. It is of a
sharpe savour and somewhat bitter, whereby are seen the d^y parts and
comfor^atiue that it hath: it is hot and dry in the second degree.

Of the berbe Iohn I^fante for wou^des.
I will not let to write of a certain Herb, which the Conq^erours of the new
Spain do use for the remedy of their wounds, and shottes of arrows, which
unto them was a great remedy in th^ir troubles, and it was discou^red by an
Indian, which was Seruaunt too a Spaniarde called Iohn Infant. He was the first
that used it, they did call it, and do call it at this present day, the Hea^be
of Iohn Infant: this herb is little, they gather it green, and beat it, and
so they lay it simply upon the wound: it doth restrain and stop the blood,
and if it be a wound in the fl^she, it doth cause it to grow together, and
heal^th it by gluing the parts. The wounds of the Sinews, and other parts
it doth comfort, mundifie, and engenders flesh in them until they be whole,
and because they do not find this herb in all places, they bring it made into
powder, for that it works the same effect as well as being green, and the
powder, as some say, doth it better than the herb.

As this herb, so likewise have you many other in all the other parts of the
Indies, that have the same and other properties do work marvelous effects:
and to write of every one of them particularly, it were needful to make a
greater volume, then we do pretend of this that we shall entreat of.

Three things they bring from our Occidental Indies, which at this day be
celebrated in all the world, and with them they have made do make the
greatest works that ever were made in medicine, there were never the like
made, by any other medicine that unto this day hath been known, for that the
nature of al three is to cure infirmities which without this remedy be
incurable, and to work the effects that do seem to be things of wonder,
and these are notorious, not only in these parts, but in all the world: the
which things are the wood that is called Guaiacan, the China and the
Sarcaparillia. And for that it seems that the China doth come from
Portingall, and that the Portingales do bring it from their Oriental Indies,
and not fro ours, I will say what is to be said herafter when we do speak
thereof. And therefore let us begin with Guaiacan, as of ^ remedy that first
came from the Indies, and as first of the best of all, as experience hath
showed, and the use thereof in so many years.

Of the Guaiacan and of the holy Wood.
The wood of the Indies.
THe Guaiacan, that is called the wood of the Indies was discovered forthwith,
when the first Indies were found, which was the Island of Sancto Domingo, where
is great quantity thereof. There was an Indian that gave knowledge thereof to
his Master, in this manner. There was a Spaniard that did suffer great pains of
the Pox, which he had taken by the company of an Indian woman, b^t his servant
being out of the Physicians of that country (...) unto him the water of
Guaiaca, wherewith not only his grievous pains were taken away that he did
suffer, but he was heal^d very well of the evil: with the which many other
Spaniardes, that were infected with the same evil were healed also, the which
was communicated immediately, with them that came from thence, hither to Seuill,
and from thence it was divulged throughout all Spain, and from thence through
all the world, for that the infection was sown abroad throughout all parts
thereof: and surely for this evil it is the best, the most chief remedy of as
many as hitherto have been found, and with most assurance, and most
certeintie, it heals and cures the said disease, if they be well handled:
and this water gi^en as it ought to be, it is certain that it heals it most
perfectly, without turning to fall again, except the sick man do return to
tumble in the same bosom, where he took the first infection.

Our Lord God would from whence the evil of the Pox came, from thence should
come the remedy for them. Since it is known that they came into these parts
from the Indies, and first of all from Sancto Domingo. The Pox be as common
amongst the Indians, and as familiar, as the Measelles be unto us, and well
near the most part of the Indians, both men and women have them, without
making thereof any scruple, and they came first in this sort.

In the year of our Lord God 1493. in the wars that the Catholic King made
in Naples, with King Charles of France, that was called Greathead, in this time
sir Christofer Colon, returned from the discovery that he had made of the
Indies, which was Sancto Domingo, and other Lands, he brought with him from
Sancto Domingo, a great number of Indians, both men and women, which he carried
with him to Naples, where the Catholic king was at that time, who had then
concluded the wars, for that there was peace between the two Kings, and
the hostess did communicate together, the one with the other. And Colon being
come thither with his Indians, the most part of them brought with them the
fruit of their country, which was the Pox. And the Spaniardes began to have
conversation with the Indian women, in such sort, that the men and women of
the Indies, did infect the Camp of the Spaniardes, Italians, and Almaines, for
the Catholic king had then of all these Nations, and there were many that were
infected with the evil. And after the hostess commoned together, the fire did
kindle in the camp of the king of France, of which it followed, that in short
time the one and the other were infected with this evil seed: and from thence
it hath spread abroad into all the world.

At the beginning it had diverse names: The names that they gave to th^ evil
tre^.
the Spaniards did think that it had been given them by the Frenchmen, and
they called it the French evil. The Frenchemen thought that in Naples, and by
them of the Country, the evil had been given them, and they called it the
evil of Naples. And they of Almaine seeing that by conversation with the
Spaniardes, they came by it, they called it the Spanish Skabbe, and other
called it the Measelles of the Indies, and that very truly, seeing that from
thence came the evil in the beginning.

Opinions of this evil.
Amongst the great Physicians of that time, there were sundry great opinions of
the cause, and original of the infirmity. The one sort said that it came of
the evil melancholy meates, that the hostess of necessity had eaten, as wild
herbs, and many garden herbs, and roots of herbs, Asses, and Horses,
and other like things, that engender such like infirmities, corrupting and
burning the blood. Others there were, that did attribute it to the coniunctions
of Saturne and Mars, and they did apply it to the heavenly influence, and gave
thereuntoo diverse and sundry names. Some called it the Leprosy, others Swine
Pox, other Mentegra, others the Deathly evil, others Elephansia, without
certain assurance what disease it was. For they were ignorant that it was a
new disease, and they would reduce it to some already known and written of.
Guaiacan an Indian name.
And now we come to our Guaiacan, whose name was given by the Indians, and of
them very well known, and so they have called it and do call it, in all the
world, calling it also the would of the Indies. Of this would many have
written and much, one sort saying that it was Ebano, others that it was a kind
of Box, with many other names whereby they have named it. It is a new tree and
never seen in our parts, nor in any other of the discoveries, as the country
is new, so is the tree a new thing also.

The description of the Guaiacan.
Whatsoever it be, it is a great tree, of the greatness of an Oak: it casts
out many vows, the rind it doth cast from it being dry, great, and full of
Gum, the hart thereof is very great, it is well near like to black, all is
very hard as much and more then Ebano is. It casts forth a little leaf and
hard* and every year it brings forth yellow flowers, out of the which is
engendered a round fruit, with little kernelles within it, of the greatness of
a Medler: of these Trees there is great abundance in Sancto Domingo.

And after this they have found an other Tree, of the kind of this Guaiacan,
in Saint Iohn de Puerto Rico, which is an other Land near to that of Sancto
Domingo, such an other tree as that is, saving that it is less, the body of
the tree and the bows are smaller, it hath scarsely any heart, or if it have
any, it is very little, and that is in the body of the tree, for that the bows
have none at all: It is of more sweet smell and more bitter then the Guaiacan,
that is now used in our time, I mean that of Sancto Domingo, and for his
marvelous effects, they call it the holy Wood, surely with reason: for that
it is of a better working then that of Sancto Domingo, which is seen by
experience, but even as well the one the other is a marvelous remedy, to cure
the disease of the Pox: of the which and of every one of them a water is made,
and is taken for this infirmity, and for many others in this form.

They take twelve ounces of the wood made small, and two ounces of the Rind
of the same would broken, How the water of the would i^ made.
and they cast it to steep in three Pottels of Water, in a new pot, that will
hold somewhat more, for the space of xxiiii. hours: and the pot being well
stepped, they sees it over a soft fire of kindled Coals, until the two
Pottels be sod away, and one remaining. And this is to be noted at the time
the water is put to it, putting therein one Pottle, they dip in a little Rod,
and do mark howe high the water of one Pottle reaches, and by that measure
and mark they shall see when the two are sod away, and the one Pottell
remains. After the water is sodden, they set it to cool, strain it, and
keep it in a glassed vessel, and forthwith upon the said sodden would, they
pour four Pottels of water, and sees it till one be sodden away, and this
water must be strained and kept apart, and it must be taken in this form.

After that the sick man is purged by the counsel of a Physician, The manner
of taking it.
let him be put into a warm Chamber, and kept from the cold and from air,
and being laid in his bed, let him take early in the morning ten ounces
of Water, of that which was first made well warmed, and let him be covered so
that he may sweat well, let him keep his sweat at the least two hours, after
he hath sweat, let him be made clean from his sweat, take a warm Shirt, and
the rest of his Linen clothes, four hours after he hath sweat, let him eat
Reasings, Almonds and Biscuit, and that in reasonable quantity. Then let him
drink of the water that was made at the second time, the quantity that he hath
need of, and of the self same let him drink in the day time, eight hours
after he hath eaten, let him return to take the first water, and let him take
other ten ounces well warmed, and then sweat other two^ hours, and after
his sweat let him be made clean, and then be covered again with warm
clothes, and one hour after he hath sweat, let him make his supper of the
same Reasings, Almonds, and Biscuit, and drink of the second Water. This order
he must observe the first fiftiene days, except he have some notable
weakness, and in such case her must be succoured with giving him to eat of a
young Chicken, jointly, with the rest of the Diet: and in them that be lean,
that cannot bear so precise Diet, it is sufficient that they take it for nine
days, and at the end of them they may eat a little Chicken roasted, if in case
the sick person be debilited, and that he cannot suffer the Diet, let him have
from the beginning a very small Chicken, going forward increasing in the
process of time, and being past the 15. days, let him return to purge
himself at the sixtiene days end, let him take the weight of five shillings
of the substance of Canafistola, taken out by Strayner or other thing
respondent thereunto, and that day let him drink no strong Water, but of the
simple, and the next day after the Purgation, let him return to the aforesaid
order, taking in the morning and evening the strong water with his sweatinges,
and eating and drinking the same. Saving that in place of a Chicken he may
eat half a roasted Pullet, or somewhat more, and this second time let him take
it for other xx. days, in the which time he may rise, and walk about his
chamber, being apparelled and kept warm. And at the end of them, he shall
return to purge him self an other time, and must have a special care to
keep good order, and after he hath take the water for other forty days,
must keep himself from women and from wine especially: and in place of wine,
he must drink the simple water of the would, which if he will not do, then
let him drink of water sodden with Anise seed or Fenell seed, supping little
at night and eating no flesh.

This is the best way that the water of the wood ought to be taken, which doth
heal many infirmities incurable, The diseases that this water doth heal.
where other Medicines could not work the same effect, this water is the best
remedy that is in the world, to heal the disease of the Pox, whatsoever or
of what kind soever it be, for that it roots it out for ever without any
more coming again, and in this it hath his principal prerogative and
excellency. This water is also good for the Dropsy, for the shortness of
breath, for the Falling sickness, for the diseases of the Bladder, and of the
Raynes, for the pains of the Joints, for all evils caused of cold humours, for
ventositie, and other dangerous and importunate diseases, where the ordinary
benefits of Phisicions have not profited. Chiefly it excells where the evil
dispositions be, that have proceeded at any time from the disease of the Pox.
There be many that with this wood have made sundry mixtures, making Syrups
thereof, and surely with good effect. But my judgment and opinion is, that he
which shall take the water of the wood, ought to take it in the manner as is
above said, without any mingling thereof, for that by expeperience it hath
been seen so to make the better work. This water is good for the teeth,
making them white, and fastening them, by continual washing of them therewith:
it is hot and dry in the second degree.

Of the China.
THe Second Medicine that comes from our Indies, is a root called the China.
It seems that I should slander it, to say that the China grows in our
Occidental Indies, since commonly the Portingales do bring it from the
Oriental Indies.

By this you shall understand, that Sir Frauncis de Mendosa, a wor^hy Knight,
when he came from the new Spain and Peru, showed to me a great Root, and
other little roots, who asked me, what roots they were? I answer ^o that
they were roots of the China, but that they seemed to me to be very fresh.
China of our Indies.
He said to me, that so they were, and that it was not lunge since that they
had been gathered and brought from the new Spain. I marvelled that they had
it there, for I did believe that in the China only it had grown: he said unto
me, that not only there was in the new Spain the China, but that also we
should see brought great quantity of Spicery from the place which that
China came from. History.
And I believed it when I saw the contract that he made with his majesty, to
bring into Spain great quantity of spicery, that he had begone to set and to
plant, and I saw green Ginger brought from thence, as also the China.

This China is a root like to the root of a cane with certain knots within
it, white and some with the whytenesse hath an alborne colour: it is red
without, the best is the freshest, that which hath no holes, if it be
weighty, and not worm eaten, and that it have a fatness as if it were
congeled, and it hath an unsavoury cast. This Root doth grow in the China,
which is the Oriental Indies near to Siria and Sirciana. It grows near to
the Sea, only with the root they help themselves, with the which the Indians
be healed of grievous diseases. And therefore they have it in great estimation:
they do heal al manner of large diseases therewith: and also the sharpe
diseases: especially Agues, with the Water of it, provoking Sweats, and by this
way they heal many. It provokes sweat marvelously.

It is well near xxx. years since that the Portingales brought it to these
parts with great estimation, History.
for to heal al manner of diseases, and especially the disease of the Pox, in
the which it hath wrought great effects, and the Water is given in this
form.

The sick person being purged as is most convenient, The manner how to give
the water of the China.
must take one of the Roots and cut them small unto the thickness and
greatness of a three penny piece, and so being cut, shall way one ounce, and
cast it into a new Pot, and thereupon shall pour three Pottels of Water, and
so shall lye a sleeping there xxiiii. hours, and the Pot being stopped, let it
sees at a soft fire of kindled Coals, until half be sodden away, one Pottel
half remain, and this is to be known by the order of the Measure as
aforesaid, in the water of the Wood. And after that it is cold, let it be
strained and kept in a glassed vessel. There must be care taken, that it stand
in some hot or warm place near to the fire, for that therewith it doth
preserve the virtue the better, and dureth longer time, before it be corrupted.

The sick man being lodged in a close convenient Chamber, Howe it must be
taken.
must take in the morning fasting ten ounces of the said water, as hot as
he can suffer it, and he shall procure sweat, keep it two hours at the least.
After the sweat he shall be made clean, and shall take a Shirt, and clean
clothes, warm them, and shall lye down again two or three hours in the bed
quietly, after he hath sweat. And afterward let him apparel himself, and
being well warmed remain in his Chamber, in the which he shall be kept from
cold the open ay^e, with all the pleasure of good company and conversation: he
shall eat at xi. of the clock, half a Chicken sodden, or a quarter of a
Hen, with a little Salt. At the beginning of dinner he shall drink a dishfull
of Broth, and forthwith eat of the Pullet, eating at the beginning a little,
and he shall end with Marmelade. His drink shall be of the water he took in
the morning, for that here is no more then one water, he may at the beginning
after the Broth is taken, begin too eat Reasinges, without their little
Grains, or Prunes without their stones: their bread must be Crusty, well
baked, or Biscuit. If he will drink in the day time, he may do so with
taking of a little Conserua, and drink of the same water, and being ^ight
hours past his Dinner, let him lye down in his Bed, and take other ten
ounces of the same water, the which being hot he may drink, and procure
sweat: two hours after he hath sweat, let him be made clean, and take a
clean shirt, and clean clothes warm, and after one hour let him sup with
Coserua, Reasinges and Almondes, with some Biscuit, and drink of the self same
water, and last of all eat Marmelade, upon the which he may not drink. Thus
he may continue xxx. days continually, without need of any more Purgation
then the first, and he may sit up, so that he go well clothed, using in this
time all content and mirth, and keeping him self from al that may offend him.

Note.
After that he hath taken this water in this sort, he must keep good order,
and good government for forty days continually. And he must drink no Wine,
but water made of the China, that was before sodden, the which he shall keep
after it is sodden, setting it to dry in a shadowy place, and that China being
dry, must be kept to make water for other 40. days, to drink after the taking
of the first water: seething one ounce thereof in three Pottels of water vn^il
one half be sodden away, and this water let him drink continually. And above
all things let him keep himself from women: and he must always have care,
that as well in the water of xxx. days, as in the water of the forty days,
that the China be steeped in the water xxiiii. hours before it be sodden.

There be many diseases healed with this water, The disease that be healed by
this water.
al kinds of evil of the Pox, all old Sores, it resolves all swellinges and
knobs, it takes away the pains of the joints which they call the Arthetica
Gout, and any other kind of Gout that is in any particular member or place,
and especially the Sciatica, it takes away old pains of the head and of the
stomach. It heals all manner of runninges of Rewmes, it dissolveth Opilations
and heals the Dropsy. It makes a good colour in the face, it takes away
the Iaundies, and all evil complexion of the Liver rectifieth it, and in this
it hath a great prerogative. And by this means these infirmities are healed.
It heals the Palsy all infirmities of the Sinews, it heals all diseases
of Urine, it takes away Melancholy, and all infirmities coming of cold
diseases. It doth comfort the stomach, it doth dissolve winds marvelously,
and also Agues long and sharp, as quotidians: the taking of this water as it is
convenient, so doth it root them out, and take them away. The which thing it
doth by provoking of sweat, in this it doth exceed all other Medicines, and
some will say that in Pestilent Agues, by provoking sweat it heals them. It
is dry in the second degree with very little heate, The complexion thereof.
the which is seen by the other waters of the wood. And as Sarcaparillia which
doth heate and dry, so this doth not, nor leaves any impression of heate.

Surely it is a notable Medicine, in the which I have found great effects
for the Diseases which I have sp^ken of. Note.


Of the Sarcaparillia.
THE Sarcaparillia is a thing brought into our parts since the China. The time
since that the Sarcapillia, came unto us.
It is xx. years since yt the use thereof came to this city. It first came fro
the new Spain, the Indians did use it for great medicine, with the which they
did heal many and diverse diseases.

It is a plant which doth cast many roots under the ground, being of a yard
long, of the colour of a clear Tawny, The description, of the Sarcaparillia
sometimes the roots shoot so deep, that to take them out all, it is
needful to dig a Mans length. It casts forth certain bows full of
knots, that quickly do dry, and we know not that they have carried flowers
or fruit at all.

After that the Sarcaparillia of the new Spain was found, Sarcaparillia of
the Hunduras.
there was also found in the Hunduras, an other sort that was better, and of
better effects: it is known to be of the Hunduras, because that it is of
colour Tawny, and grosser than that of the new Spain, the which is white,
and somewhat like to yellow, and more small, and so the Sarcaparillia that is
most like to black is best.

It ought to be fresh, and in this is all the goodness thereof, The choosing of
it.
it is known to be fresh by not being Worm eaten. For that at the fresh
breaking of it long wise, in the midst it makes a running out to the end,
and casts out no dust, and the heavier it is, the better it is.

The Spaniardes did call it Sarcaparillia when they saw it, Of the name.
for the great likeness that it hath with the Sarcaparillia of these parts. I
have it for certain, that the Sarcaparillia of these parts, and of the
Indies, is all one, and the very same that ours is. The which I have
experimented many times, ours works the effect that the Sarcaparillia of the
new Spain doth, it is like unto that of the Hunduras, but it is of a bitter
taste, and not very sharpe, and the water that it yields hath no more savour
then barley water hath.

The use of this herb at the first did differ much from that which is now in
experiment, H^w it was used in the beginn^g.
for that they gave it as the Indians did, in the healing of their sick
folks, and surely it did work very great effects. But the delicateness of
our time doth require that it should be used and given as the water of the wood
is. At the beginning they took of the Sarcaparilla much quantity, more then
half a pound, did cut it small and break it, and cast it into a quantity of
water, and being well wet they beat it in a Mortar a good while, in such
sort that it was made like a Iellie, and then did strain it, pressing it very
well, for there came out of it the likeness of a thick drink. And of that
they took in the morning hot, one good Cup full, and then the Patient clothed
him self well. And sweet two hours, and if in the day time they would
drink any thing, it should be of the self same thick drink, so made by
expression hot, and then they sweet as much in the morning. This order they
observed for three days continually, without eating or drinking of other
meat, saving only that thick drink, Take this for three days.
taken out by pressing or straining of the Sarcaparillia: after this sort I
gave it at the beginning many times, and surely it wrought great effects, and
many sick people did better recover, then they do now with this other
fashion.

After there was invented an other form and manner to give it, and is that
which is now used, in this sort. The ^s^on how it is now used and given.
They take two ounces of Sarcaparillia, and wash it and cut it small and then
they put it into a new earthen pot, and there upon they pour three Pott^ls
of water, and set it in the water to steep twenty and four hours, and
af^er the Pot being well stopte, it must sees on a soft fire of kindled
coals, until the two Pottels be sodden away, and the one remain, the which
may be known by the order of the measure, that we spake of, and when it is
cold, let it be strained into a glassed vessel, and upon the selfsame
Sarcaparillia that is sod, let there be so much water powered in again that
the pot be filled, let it boyle a reasonable time, and kept in a vessel
glassed.

Now the sick Man being purged, as it seems most convenient, The manner how
to geu^ ^t.
and placed in a warm Chamber, he must take in the morning ten ounces, of the
first water of the Sarcaparillia, and must sweat at the least two hours, and
after sweat he must be made clean from his sweat, and take a warm shirt,
and warm clothes, and the like he must do at night, eight hours after he
hath eaten his Dinner, changing his shirt and hot apparel. He must dine at
eleven of the clock, and sup one hour after he hath sweat, at night eating
nothing but Reasinges, Almondes, and Biscuit, and drinking of the second water.
Let him keep this order fifteen days, and if he be weak, give him a little
roasted chicken, increasing it in process of time, at the least he must keep
his bed niene days at the first beginning, and the rest of the time in his
chamber, kept from cold, and from air, and on the fifteen day he must be
purged, with a soft and an easy medicine, and likewise on the thirty day, in
such sort, that all the order that we have prescribed, be kept, as in the
manner of the taking of the water of the wood is already declared. And likewise
after the 30. da^es, he must have good government, for other forty days, not
drinking any wine, but simple water made of the said Sarcaparillia, and keeping
himself from women. This is the ordinary manner in taking of the water of
Sarcaparillia, which at this day is used. And because I have experience of
other ways that be of great secret, and of great effects, I will write them
here, to the end that all the virtues which are in the Sarcaparillia, may be
set down and declared, seeing it is the Medicine that is most used, and that
we do see in it so great and rare effects.

I do make a Sirupe, that many years hath been celebrated, and had in
estimation in this city, A Sirupe or drink of Sarcaparilla most excellent.
and in all Spain for that it is xxvi. years since I used it first for the
disease of the Pox, for other infirmities: which Syrupe doth not heate nor
inflame, but with great temperature, according to the graduation, works his
good effects. The first, for whom this thing was ordained and devised, was for
Pantelion de Negro Ienoues, who was had in cure by many Physicians, and having
taken the water of the Wood, and other Medicines, was well near consumed: and
with a grievous swelling sore upon his shin bone, and great pains in it,
he took it, and was healed very well. This sirupe I have used in many people
for the infirmity that the Sarcaparilla doth profit for, and the wood and for
many other, and it hath a good effect in working by degrees: for that the
dryness of the wood is taken away, and the heate of the Sarcaparilla: and it
is made in this form.

There must be taken two ounces of Sarcaparilla, and four ounces of Paulo
Sancto, which is the holy Wood, The description of the Sirupe or drink.
prepared as it is said, and three Dozen of Acoseifas, a fruit of Spain,
without their stones, and two Dozen of Prunes, without their stones, and half
an ounce of the flowers of Borage, and an other half ounce of Uiolettes and
some grains of Barley made clean, that is too say, the husks taken away. All
these things let them be cast into three Pottles of water and let them be
sodden on a soft fire, until it come to one Pottell, and then let it be
strained, and unto ten ounces of this decoction let there be put one ounce of
the Sirupe of Uiolettes. Let it be taken hot in the morning, and at night in
the order above said. In the rest of the water, keeping sweet if there be any,
and although there come little, yet they be healed. They may eat a little
Chicken from the first day, with the rest of the diet, drink the simple water
of the Sarcaparilla, which is to be made with half an ounce of Sarcaparillia,
sodden in four Pott^ls of water, until one or somewhat more, be sodden away.

This order doth heal all kind of evil of the Pox, and all the infirmities
that we have spoken of, The diseases that this drink doth profit in.
that the water of the Wood doth heal, and the China, and the Sarcaparillia.
Which to repeat, it shall be too long and too prolixious, because it it is
sufficiently declared before. For surely in this simple water, and in the
foresaid decoction, I have found great effects, a^ well in the infirmities
wherein is suspected the evil of the Pox, as in large and importunate
diseases, in the which the common remedies of Phisic^e have not profited, which
although they proceeded not of the French Pox, yet doth it cure and heal
them, as it is seen by the work of him that uses it.

There is an other Sirupe to be made of the Sarcaparillia, Another drink of
the Sarcaparillia
which is: taking eight ounces of Sarcaparillia being broken or cut, and
seething it in four pottelles of water, until three be sodden away and the
one remain, and into the water that shall remain, to put to four pound of
Sugar, and make a perfect Sirupe. And of this Sirupe too take three ounces in
the morning and three at night, eating good meates, and to sup little, and
drink only the simple water of the Sarcaparillia, The diseases that this
drink heals.
and going abr^ade out of the house, and doyng his buisinesse. There are healed
therewith many diseases without giving any molestation in the healing of them.
And this must be taken till the Sirupe be all consumed.

Also this Sarcaparillia is taken in powder, in this manner. They take the
Sarcaparillia, Sarcaparillia in powder.
and pluck away from it the hear within it, and dry it and grynde it, and
then sift it through a syue of silk, and make it in Powder. Of this Powder is
taken in the infirmity of the Pox, or spice of them, the weight of six pence,
drinking it with the simple Water of the Sarcaparillia taking it in the
Morning, and as night, as much when he goes to bed. He must eat good
meates, and drink no Wine, but the simple water thereof. It shall do well he
be purged that shall begin to use it.

And although that this powder doth heal many diseases large and temporal,
one cure it doth marvelously, which is the salt Fleume of the hands and
feet, in this form. The sick man being purged, and also without purging, if
he cannot otherwise do, he shall take the Powder as it is said, and upon the
salt Fleume, he shall lay with a Feather, The Salt Fleume is cured herewith.
a little of the water of Sublimatum, delayed with Rosewater, that it be very
simple, and after it is laid on all parts where the salt Fleume is, then let
there be put upon it a plaster, that is called of William Ser^e^tis, or Dia
Palma spread abroad thin upon Satin or Taffeta, too be applied in all parts
where the simple water of Sublimatum was put. This must be done every day, for
that in fifteen days he shall be perfectly whole. This doth mundifie and
incarnate, and skin without having need of any other medicine, jointly with the
Powder and the simple water of Sarcaparillia, which we have spoken of. This is
of so great effect, and experimented, as they shall see by the work that shall
use it, for surely they shall be whole thereby.

The use of the water of the Sarcaparillia is so great at this day in this
form, as is said, The virtue of the water of Sarparillia.
that it is applied in any disease, it is come into so much credit, that in
any manner of Reumes or runnings, or windinesse, the evil of Women, of the
Mother, or any other cause or occasion whatsoever, so that it be not in Fevers
or other sharpe diseases, men take the use of the simple Water of the
Sarcaparillia: and this is at this day so put in use, that in like sort you
shall find the simple sodden Water of Sarcaparillia in many houses, as
ordinary water in yearthen vessels, and surely it works great effects, and
doth remedy large and importunate diseases. Truth it is, that the persons
that be hot of complexion, it doth beat them more then is convenient, and
so they cannot drink it, and most of all if that their Liver be very hot,
for that it heats too much.

In women's diseases as well of the Mother, as of cold humours, it works
good effects, and doth m^ruellously dissolve winds. And in persons that be
subject to many evils, and especially of Reumes, and old greeffes and
diseases caused of the evil humours, if they run this course, with the
continuance thereof, they shall receive manifest profit and benefit, and it
doth heal all deseases which they never thought to be healed of. The
complexion thereof i^ hot and dry, well near in the second degree. All
these waters must be given in Summer, or in the end thereof: it is better that
the season exceed in heate then in cold.

Of the blood Stone, and of the Stone for the diseases of the Stone of the
Kidneies and Reins.
Of the blood stone.
THEY do bring from the new Spain two stones of great virtue, the one is
called the Stone of the Blood, and the other is a Stone for the desease of the
Stone in the Kidneis and Rains, The Blood Stone is a kind of Jasper of diverse
colours somewhat dark, full of sprincles, like to blood, being of colour
red, of the which stones the Indians do make certain Hearts both great and
small.

The use thereof, both here and there, is for all fluxes of blood in what
parts soever it be, of the Nose, or of the Menstrues, or of the Piles, and of
Wounds, or of that which is cast out at the mouth. The stone must be wet in
cold water, and the sick Man must take it in his right hand, and from time
to time wet it in cold water. In this sort the Indians do use them. And as
touching the Indians, they have it for certain, that touching the same stone,
in some part where the blood runs, it doth restrain, it and in this they
have great trust, for that the effect hath been seen. It doth profit also
having it holden, hanged, or tied in the same part where the blood runs, so
that it touch the flesh. Of this stone we have seen great effects, in
staunching of blood. And some that do suffer the Hemeroidall flux, have
remedied themselves with making Rings of this stone, and wearing them
continually upon their fingers. And likewyse in the Menstruall flux of women.

The other Stone, The stone for the disease of the gravel stone in the kidneys
or reine^.
which is for the disease of the stone in the Kidneies or Reins, the finest of
them are like unto Plasma of Esmeraldes, which are likened to green with a
Milkishe colour, the greatest are the best: they bring them made in diverse
forms and fashions, for so the Indians had them in old time, some like to
fishes, other like to the heads of byrds, other like to bills of Popingaies,
other like to round Beadstones, but all pierced through, for that the Indians
did use to wear them hanging for the effect to take away the grief of the
stone or stoma^ke: for in those two sicknesses it shows marvelous effects.

The chief virtue that it hath, is in the pain of the stone in the Kidneis and
Reins, and in expelling of Sand and stone. In so much that a Gentleman which
had one of them here, the best of them that I have seen, having laid it to
his arm, it made him to expel and cast out much sand, insomuch that many
times he doth take it away, for that he thinks that it doth hurt him for
to void so much, and in taking it away, he cease to void any from him: and
when he feels the pain of the stone, laying it too again, it doth take it
away incontinent, with expelling of much Sand and small stones. I have seen
it carried to persons that have been afflicted with great grief, and pains
of the said disease, who putting it to them, do forthwith expel the sand
and the little stones, ^d remain clear thereof.

A property hidden.
This stone hath a property hidden, by the which means it works great
effects, to preserve men that they fall not into the pain of the said
disease, and after it is come to take it away, or diminish it. It doth make
the sand to be expelled in great abundance, and likewyse stones. It takes
away the heate from the reins of the back, it profits in griefs of the
stomach, laid unto it: and above all it preserves from the said grief.

My Lady the Duchess for that she had in short space three times, exceeding
pains of the stone, she made a bracelet of them, and used to wear it on her
arm, and sithence she put them to her arm, she never had more pains of the
Stone: and so it hath happened to many other that found the like benefit, for
the which these stones are much esteemed: and now they be not so soon had, as
at the beginning, for that the gentlemen, and rich men have them only, and
with reason, because they do work such marvelous effects. An other stone
there is that doth heal the salt fleume, the which I know by hearesay only,
but I have seen none of them.

Of the VVoodde for the evils of the Reins, and of the Urine.
ALso they bring from the new Spain, a certain would that is like unto the
would of a Pear tree, gross and without knots, the which they have used
many years in these parts, for the pains of the Reins and of the Stone, and
for the infirmities of the Urine.

The first time that I saw it used, may be about xxxv. years past. There was
a Pilot that was sick of the Urine and of the Reins, and after that he had
used it, he was whole and very well. And sithence that time I have seen that
many have brought it from the new Spain, and they do use it for these
diseases following.

For them that cannot peace liberally, The diseases which it cures.
and for the pains of the Reins, and of the stone, and for them that do peace
wi^h pain, and for them that do peace little. And now the thing hath
extended unto opilations, for that the water thereof doth cure and heal them,
both of the Lunges and the Liver, and this hath been found within these few
years, and they do find in it notable profit. The water is made in this
form.

They take the wood, and make it into small pieces very shin: and small as it
is possible, How the water is made.
and then put the into fair water of the Foutaine, leave it so until the water
be sokened into it: and by putting the wood into the water, within half an
hour the water doth begin to change it self into a blew colour very
clear, and the longer that it lies in the water, so much the blewer it
turns, although that the wood be of a white colour. Of this water they do
drink continually, and therewith they use to water their wine, and it works
marvelous and manifest effects, without any alteration, so that it needs
but only good government and regiment. The water hath no more savour then if
there were nothing cast into it, for that the wood doth change nothing. The
complexion thereof is hot and dry in the first degree.

Of the Pepper of the Jndias.
I Will not let to speak of the Pepper that they bring from the Indies, Of the
India Pepper.
which serves not only for Medicine, but it is otherwise most excellent, the
which is known in all Spain, for there is no Gardeyne, nor Orchard, but that
it hath plenty thereof in it, for the fairness of the fruit that it
brings forth.

The description of the Plant.
It is a great Plant, insomuch that I have seen in this City some that was
equal with many Trees. It doth cast forth the leaves green, after the
fashion of Basil of the biggest sort. And it casts forth certain white
flowers, out of the which comes the fruit, the which is of diverse forms:
some Pepper is long, other round, others of the making of Mellons, others of
Cherries, but all is at the beginning when it is not type very green, and
being ripe very red, and with a gracious and good colour.

The use of it.
All the sorts are used in al manner of meates and pottages, for that it hath a
better taste then the common Pepper hath. Beaten in pieces, and cast into broth
it is an excellent sauce, they do use it in al things that the aromatike
spices are used in, which are brought from Maluco, and Calicu^. It doth differ
from that of the East Indies, for that costs many ducats, this other doth
cost no more but to sow it, for that in one plant you have spice for one whole
year, with less hurt and more profit.

The virtues that it hath.
It doth comfort much, it doth dissolve winds, it is good for the breast,
and for them that be cold of complexion: it doth heal and comfort,
strengthening the principal members. It is hot and dry, well near in the
fourth degree.

They do bring from diverse parts of our Indies many purgatiue Medicines,
Note.
that have been found and discovered by continuance, whose works and effects
are great: of the which I will give here a short relation, that it may be an
entrance for to entreat of the root of Mechoacan, which was our principal
intent now to write of.

Of the Cannafistola.
THere doth come from the Ilandes of Sancto Domingo, Canafistola.
and from Sancte Iohn de Puerto Rico great quantity of Canafistola, and it is
so much, that not only all Spain is provided of it, but all Europe, and well
near all the world: for that unto Leuant, from whence it was accustomably
brought, now there goes more Ships laden with it, then come with Iron from
Biskeye. That which comes from our Indies, is much better in comparison then
that which is brought from the East Indies to Uenis, and that which the
Galleons do carry from thence to Genoua, and from Genoua to Spain, for when
the Merchantes brought it hither, it could not be good, for that it was very
small, and also it was not type, and with so long time continuance it became so
corrupted, that it did profit little.

This of ours that they bring from Sancto Domingo and Saincte Iohn is ripe,
great, full, weighty, honilyke, The description of it.
and fresh. In so much that many times it comes in sixty days after it is
gathered, and being fresh, it is of a gracious and good taste, and not of so
horrible smell, as that of Leuant is, and so it doth his work far better,
with more facility.

This Canafistola, and the work thereof is of great security, it purges
gently, without any alteration. The virtue of the Canafistola.
And doth avoid principally Choler, and after Fleume, and that which is in
the ways and the Guts. It doth temper them much that take it, also it
purifieth the blood, it doth many good works in all kind of diseases, in
especially in the pains of the Reins, and of vryne, being taken two hours
before supper. And in reumes it doth much profit, being taken two hours
after Supper, and easily it doth cure the evils of the breast, which have
be^ne of long continuance, griefs of the side, being taken with Syrups for
the breast: and being applied outwardly with the Oil of sweet Almondes, it
takes away the grievous diseases of the Lunges, and griefs of the Reins. It
is good in hot Fevers, and using it continually before supper or dinner, it
stays the engendering of the stone, it takes away the dries. it is moist in
the first degree, it declyneth to heate, although it be little, it is
dissoluatiue, it clarifies the blood, and delay the sharpness thereof, and
of the red colour. There have been in the Indies since it was discovered some
thereof so weighty, that one cod waieth five shillings, being taken out by
the Seen, and four ounces in weight the whole cane.

Of the Purgatiue Nuts.
AT the beginning when they discovered the Indies, they brought from Sancto
Domingo, Of the purgatiue Nuts.
certain Nuts being three cornered, with the which the Indians did purge
themselves, and were unto them a familiar purgation. And afterwards the
Spaniardes, for necessity did purge themselves with them, with hazard enough
of some of their lives, for with the use thereof, many thought to lose their
lives, for that it is a strong purge. And although that it doth make a great
excess of stools, yet doth it also provoke vomit very strongly, and with
much violence, with great faintness and heaviness. Afterward some did
rectify them by costing of them, and then they be not so violent, nor so
strong, neither work with so much cause of faintness. What these Nuts do
purge.
They do purge Fleume very strongly, after colour. It is an excellent Medicine
for the Colike, it doth dissolve winds, and put in a glister it doth
evacuate reasonably.

The manner colour of them is as of our Nuts, with a thin rind, The
d^scription o^ ^he N^es.
of the colour of a clear Bay, they are three cornerd, the carnell within is
white, and sweet, insomuch that for their sweetness, many have been m^eked
therewith. The Physicians do call them commonly Ben, Ben.
of which there are two sorts, one they call great, and the other little.
The great Ben be these purgatiue Nuts, the little Beu be as great as our
Peason, of the which in Italy they make that oil of sweet smell, which they
call Oil of Ben, with the which they do annoynt their hear, and beards for
dilicatenesse. Their complexion is hot in the beginning of the third degree,
and dry in the second. Their weight is of half a dragme unto one, but they
must be tosted.

Of the purgatiue Pinions.
THey do bring from the new Spain certain Pinions or Carnels wherewith the
Indians did purge themselves: The description of them.
they be like to our Pinions, which do grow out of our trees, being great
after the fashio of the wheat of the Indies, the shale is not so hard as ours
is, they are somewhat more black, they be round, and within very white,
fatty, and sweet in taste. They do purge valiantly Fleam and Colour, and any
manner of waterishnes, they are more easy Medicine, then the Nuts be, they do
purge by stool, How they purge.
and by vomit, and if they be tosted they do not purge so much, nor with so
much faintness. They do purge of their own nature gross Humours: it is a
Purgation much used amongst the Indians, being ground and dissolved with
Wine, having first taken preparatives that do attennuate the humour, How they
be taken.
that a man doth pretend to evacuate, and using a convenient Diet. They take
of them five or six more or l^sse, conformably to the obedience of the
stomach, of him that shall take them.

Ordinarily they do tossed them: for so they be more gentle and less furious. It
is needful that he which doth take them, be kept as one being purged.

They be given in large infirmities, and where there be gross humours: they be
hot in the third degree, and dry in the second with some fatness, which doth
take away somewhat of the drynes.

Of the purgatiue Beans.
FRom Cartagena, and number de Dios, they bring certain Beans like to the
fashion of ours, Beans like to ours.
saving that they be somewhat less, and of the colour and making of ours, they
have in the midst of the Bean that doth divide the two halues, one little
thin skin, like to the skin of an oynion.

How they be t^ken.
They do take them from their shale, and from the inner thin skin, and
toste them and make them into powder, and take them (...) Wine: and being made
into powder and mingled with Sugar, one sponeful of the powder is taken, and
upon that a little draught of wine. They do purge without molestation Choler
and Fleam, and gross mixed humours. And amongst the Indians they are of great
estimation, for the easiness that they have in the taking of them. Many
Spaniardes do purge with them with much security, and it is a Medicine more
easy and gentle than that aforesaid.

History.
I have seen many that have come from those parts, purge them therewith, and
it succeeds with them very well, and purges without grief.

Note.
But they must be advised that there be taken from them that little skin that
is in the midst of the two halfes of the Beans. For if they take that, the
strength of it is so much greater and vehement of Uomites and stools, that
they put in great hazard him that shall take them And also they must have care
to cost them, for that it doth prepare th^m, and delay much of the
sharpness, and fearsenes, which is general in this Medicine, and in all the
rest, for that to tossed them is the true preparation of them. After the taking
of any of the foresaid Medicines the patient must not sleep at al: it is
needful that he keep great watch being purged, and in all things which in a
man purged may be convenient.

The Beans be given prepared, in Fevers being large and importunate, and in
diseases of mixed humours, Their work^ and effects.
being gross and in the pains of the joints, they are an universal
Purgation: they be hot in the second degree, dry in the first, there be
given of them from four too six, tos^ed more or less, as the obedience and
sufferance of the belly is of him that shall take them.

Of the milk Pinipinichi.
IN all the coast of the firm land they take out a certain kind of milk, fro
little trees. Of the Pin^pinichi.
like to Apple trees, which the Indians cal Pinipinich^, of the which cutting
one bough, there comes forth whereas it is cut, a certain kind of milk
somewhat thick clammy, and taking three or four drops thereof, it doth purge
valiantly by the stool principally Choleric Humours, and Citrine water, and it
doth work with much vehemence and force.

It must be taken in Wine, or dried into powder in little quantity, for that
the work thereof is of most strength. How it is tak^n.
It hath one property, that in eating or drinking of broth or wine or other
thing forthwith it works no longer, and he that doth take it, hath need to
keep good watch, and good order, It is hot and dry in the third degree.

All these Medicines which we have spoken of, be violent and of great force,
they have not been much used sithence the Mechoacan hath come, for that in it
there is found a work more sure, Note.
and unto this not only we, but all the Indians have run, as unto a purge
most excellent, of the which we will treat now.

Of the Mechoacan.
THe Mechoacan is a root, that it may be about xxx. years that it was
discovered, Mechoacan.
in the province of the new Spain, in the Indies, of the Occean Seas, it is
brought from a Country that is beyond the great city of Mexico, more then 40.
leagues, is called Mechoacan the which Sir Fernando Curtes did conquer, in the
year of our Lord, 1524. This is a country of much riches, of Gold and
chiefly of silver, The riches and increase.
and it is understood that in all that Country is, much silver. For more then
200. leagues, here those Mines be so celebrated, and of so great riches, that
they be called the Cacatecas, every day they discover in the land very rich
mines of silver, and some of Gold. It is a country of good and wholesome air,
and doth bring forth healthful herbs for to heal many diseases, insomuch
that at the time the Indians had the government thereof, the inhabiters there
round about that Province, came thither too heal their diseases and
infirmities. For the said causes, it is a country very fruitful, and of great
abundance of bread, wild foul, and fruits. It hath many fountains, and some
of sweet waters, which have much abundance of fish, the Indians of that
country are of a tauller grouth, The s^ation of Mechoacan.
of better faces than the Borderers are, and much more healthful.

The Principal place of that Province the Indians do cal in their language
Chincicila, and the Spaniardes do cal it as they cal that Realm Mechoacan, it
is a great town of Indians, situated near to a lake, which is of sweet
water, abounding with very much Fish. The same Lake is in fashion of the making
of an horseshoe, and in the midst thereof stands the Town, the which at this
d^y hath great trade of buying and selling, for the great Mines of Plate that
are in all that country.

As soon as that Province was gotten from the Indians, History.
there went thither certain Friars of Saint Frances order, as in a Country so
far distant from their natural soil, some of them fell sick, amongst whom
the Warden, who was the chief Fryer of the house was one, with whom Caconcin
Casique an Indian Lord, a man of great power in that Country, had very great
friendship, who was Lord of al that Country. The father Warden had a long
sickness and was brought in great danger of life: the Casique as he saw his
disease proceed forward, said that he would bring him an Indian of his,
which was a Physician, with whom he did cure himself, it might be, that he
would give him remedy of his disease. The which being heard of the Friar, and
seeing the little help that he had there, and the want of a Physician, with
other things of benefit, he thanked him, and desired him, that he would
bring him unto him: who being come, and seeing his disease, sai^e to the
Casique, that if he took a powder, that he would give him of a root, that it
would heal him. The which being known to the Fryer, with the desire that he
had of health, he accepted his offer, and took the powder that the Indian
Physician gave him, the next day, in a little wine: with the which he did
purge so much, and wi^hout pains, that the same day he was much lightened, and
much more from that time forward, in such sort that he was healed of his
infirmity. The rest of the Fryers which were sick, and some Spaniardes that
were sick also, did follow the father Wardens cure, took of the selfsame
powder once or twice, as oft as they had need of it, for to heal them. The
use of the which went so well with them, that all they being healed, the Friars
did send relation of this, to the father prouincial to Mexico where he was, who
did communicate it with those of the country, giving to the of the root and
comforting them that they should take it, because of the good relation, that
he had from those Friars of Mechoacan. The which being used of many, and
seeing the marvelous works that it did, the fame of it was extended all
abroad, so that in short time, all the Country was full of the good works and
effects thereof, vanishing the use of Ruibarbe of Barberie, and taking the
name thereof calling it Ruibarb^ of the Indies, as all men do now commonly
call it. And also it is called Mechoacan, Ruibarbe of the Indies.
for that it is brought from thence, gathered in the Province called M^choacan.
And not only in Mexico, and in that Country it doth take it as the most
excellent purgation, and best of all other, but also in Peru, and in all other
parts of the Indies, they use no other thing, neither purge they with any
other purge, and they take it with so much trust and easiness, that when they
take it, they think to have certainly their health, so they carry it from the
new Spain, as Merchandise of very great price.

History.
I^ is about thirty and four years past, when I saw it here the first time,
when one Pasquall Catano a Genoues, came from the new Spain, who fell sick
at his coming, and as I did cure him, at the time that I would purge him, he
said to me that he brought a Ruibarbe from the new Spain, that was a very
excellent Medicine, with the which all they of Mexico did purge themselves,
saying, that it was called Ruibarbe of Mechoacan, and he had been purged many
times therewith, and it had succeeded very well with him, and if he should
take any purge, he would take that, of the which he had experience. But I
caused him utterly to forsake the use of such like n^w Medicines, of the which
there was nothing written nor known. And did persuade with him to purge with
the Medicines that we had here, of the which there was so great experience
and knowledge, in written Authors. And he did grant to my words, and purged
himself with a purga^ion that I gave him, eve as it was conu^nient for his
disease. By the which although that there did follow unto him notable
lightness, and profit: yet he was not clear of the disease in such sort,
but that it was necessary to purge him an other time. And when we came to the
second purgation, he would take none other but his own Ruibarbe of
Mechoacan, with the which he did purge so well, that he remained whole, and
without any disease. And although that this ^ffect did like me well,
nevertheless I did not remain satisfied, until many other that came at the
same time, and fell sick, did purge with the said Mechoacan, and it went very
well with them, because they were accustomed to purge therewith in the new
Spain: and seeing the good works and so many thereof. I began to consider of
it, and to purge many therewith, giving credit to the good effects that it
wrought.

And so with these that I did make experience of here, The use in all parts of
the Mechoacas.
as also with the relation, and great credit of them, that came out of the
new Spain (insomuch that the use thereof hath spread abroad, that it is a
common thing in all the world, and they do purge therewith not only in the
new Spain, and the Provinces of the Peru, but also in our Spain, all Italie,
Almaine, and Flaunders) I have sent relation thereof, well near to all Europe,
as well in Latin, as in our native tongue.

The use thereof is so much, The gr^ate quantity of Mechoacan that is used.
that they bring it for chief Merchandise, in great quantity, and it is
sold for great sums of money: Insomuch that a seller of Drugs told me,
besides that which he had sold for the City, he had sold forth of the city
the last year, more than ten kintalles of it, which is a thousand pound
weight, so that now they ask for Ruibarb of the Indies, for that it is so
familiar, that there is no husband man that doth not use it, as a most sure
medicine, and of great effects, because for that kind of purgation, there is
no need of a Physician, as being that, unto which all men give most credit,
as a thing determined and approved for good.

I have talked with many of them that have come from the new Spain, and in
especially with them that have been in Mechoacan, concerning the fashion of
the plant that this root is of, and what form and figure it hath, the which
they do bring from the Country, within 40. leages of beyond Mechoacan, from
a country which is called Colima, and they have so little care therein, seeing
that their principal intent is unto their interest and gain, that they know
no more thereof, but that the Indians in Mechoacan do sell it them, the roots
being dry and clean, as hither they do bring them, and the Spaniardes do
buy them, as a kind of Merchandise, and so send them to Spain.

And surely in this we are worthy of great reprehension* that seeing that
there are in the new Spain, so mani^ Herbs, and Plants, and other things
Medicinable, of so much importance, there is not any that writes of them, nor
is it understood, what virtues and forms they have, for to accord them with
ours: so that if men had a desire to search out, and experiment so many kind
of medicines, as the Indians do sell in their Market places and Fairs, it
would be a thing of great profit, and utility to see and to know their
propertie^, and to experiment the variable and great effects, which the
Indians do publish, and manifest with great proof amongst themselves, which
they have of them: we of our part without any consideration do refuse it,
and such as do know their effects, will not give us relation, nor knowledge
what they are, nor write the efficacy and manner of them.

And going too search after the Place of the Root Mechoacan, History of the
Plant of Mechoacan.
a Passenger that was come from that Province, did advertise me that a France
Friar, that was come from that Country, had brought in the ship where he
came, the proper Herb of Mechoacan green, in a great barrel, and with much
care, which he brought from beyond Mechoacan, and that he had it in the
Frierie of S. Frances of the City. And hearing thereof I did receive great
contentment, and so I went forthwith to the Frierie, and at the door of
Infirmerie, or house for the sick people of this Frierie, there was a thing
like too half a Pipe, in the which there was an herb very green, which they
said was the Mechoacan, that the Friar had brought from the new Spain, not
with little labour. The description of the Mechoacan.
It is an heath that grows creeping up by certain little Canes, it hath a
sad green colour, it carries certain leaves, that the greatness of them
may be of the greatness of a good Porenge dish, which are in compass round,
with a little point, the leaf hath his little Sienewes, it is small, well
near, without moisture, the stalk is of the colour of a clear Tawny. They
say that it casts forth certain Clusters with little Grapes, of the
greatness of a Coriander seed which are the fruit, and do wax ripe by the
Month of September: it casts out many Bows, which doth stretch a long
upon the Earth, and if you put any thing near to it, it goes creeping upon
it. The Root of the Mechoacan is unsavoury, and without biting, The manner of
the root.
or any sharpness of taste. That which we do see at this present of our
Mechoacan, is a root which they bring from the new Spain, from the Province
of Mechoacan, made in great and little pieces, of them cut in pieces, of
them broken with their hands. It is a white Root, somewhat strong, and
mighty, it appears that the pieces be of a great root, without any heart.

The conditions, or elections that it must have, for to be good and perfect is:
that it be fresh, which may be known if that it be not worm eaten, The
electios of the Mechoacan.
nor black, and that it be somewhat white: but the very white is not so good,
and if it be somewhat russet, so that it be the uttermost part of the root,
for that the inner part is somewhat white. In the tasting or chewing of it, it
is without savour, or any manner of biting taste.

It imports to make his work the better if so be that it be fresh, That it
be fresh.
for that the fresher it is, the better it is, and the greater the pieces are,
the better they are conserved. And it is true, that that which is brought in
powder, is not so good, for that it doth putrefy, and lose much of the
virtue, and operation. As also we do see, if we make powder, and keep it, it
doth not make so good work, as when the root is ground, and then forthwith
taken. The root being old doth turn black, and it will be worm eaten with
holes, and become very light. It will keep well rolled in Sere cloth. It is
gathered in the month of October, and it never loses his leaf.

The Complexion thereof is hot in the first degree, and dry in the second,
The complexion thereof.
for that it hath subtle parts, with some bynding, whereby it seems that
his work being done, it leaves the interior Members strengthened, without
debilitation and weakness, which the other Purgatiue Medicines do leave them
in: but rather those that do purge themselves therewith, do remain after
they be purged, more strong and harde, then before they were purged. It hath no
need of rectification, for that we do not see in this root any notable
hurt, only the Wine is unto it a corroboration for the work, for being taken
with Wine, it makes a better work, then with any other Liquor, for that it
doth not cause vomit, and it works the better.

It is given at all times and in all Ages, Easy to take and easy to work^.
it doth his work without molestation, and without the accidents that the
other Medicines soluatiue are wont to procure. It is a Medicine easy to be
taken, for that it hath no evil cast. Only it hath the savour of that with the
which it is taken, for that it is of it self without savour, and so it is
easy for Children, for that they may take it without feeling what it is, it is
so likewise for persons that cannot take Medicines, for it hath neither smell
nor taste. I have purged therewith many Children, and many very old persons,
have given it to men of more then 80. years of age, It is given to children
and old people.
and it makes in them very sure and good work with no manner of alteration
nor change of body, and without being debilited or weakened.

This Root doth avoid choleric humours, gross mixed, and also flegmatike
Humours, of what kind soever they be, and humours putrified and rotten, and of
both colo^rs: The woork^ and effects be marvelous of this root.
it doth evacuate the Citrine water, of them that have the Dropsy, with much
easines. The principal respect thereof is to the Liver, making it clean, and
comforting it, and the Members near adjoining to it, as the stomach and the
inner parts. It doth cure all Opilations of the same parts, and all diseases
caused of them: As the Dropsy, the Iaundies, and jointly with his good work
it rectifieth the evil complexion of the Liver, it d^ssolueth windinesse, and
with easin^sse it expels it, and doth open all the hardness of the Liver,
and of the Lunges, and of the stomach. It takes away old griefs of t^e
head, and mundifieth the brain and t^e Sinews, and emp^ieth out the humours
that be in the head, or p^r^es thereof. In the disease called the Lampa^ones,
which is the Rings Evil, it makes a good work: in old gri^fe^ of the head
called the Megrim, and the Falling sickness, and in all Distillations, or old
runninges, in pains of ^he Joints, both particular and universal, as in the
^ou^ Arthetica, in pains of the stomach, emptying the cause, and consuming
windines. Also in pains of the Uryne Bladder, In griefs of Women.
in pains of the stone and Colicke, of what kind soever it be, it makes a
marvelous work. It cures the pains of women, and especially the Mother, by
emptying and taking away the cause, as namely those causes which come of cold
humours windinesse, and in the griefs of the breast, as of an old cough,
shortness of breath, for using this root oftentimes it takes it away, and
heals it. Also in griefs of the Reins caused of gross Humours, for it doth
empty and expel them.

In griefs of the Pox.
In griefs of the Pox it makes a great work. And it seems that for these
griefs our Lord did ordain it, emptying the humours of them, which for the
most part are cold, and especially when they be waxen old of long time, it
purges them, and doth expel them without any pains, by multiplying the
taking thereof as many times as is necessary, for that in these infirmities
that be old, and of long continuance, Note.
one evacuation is not sufficient, but it is necessary to have many
euacuations, which may be done without danger with this Root: and it is not
to be marvelled at, if that with one eu^cuation therewith doth not follow the
health that is wished for, but that many times it is needful to make often
repetition, to the intent to root up and expel the evil, and naughty humours,
that are the cause of the said disease.

In agewes.
This root doth marvelously empty forth the cause of the l^rge Fevers, and
importunate, and all Fevers compounded, and chiefly in old Fevers, as
Tertians, Quotidians, flegmatike, and in s^ch diseases as commonly come of
opilacions, using thereof at the time that is needful, for that in the like
large and importunate diseases, the Physician must not be content with one
eu^cuation, Note.
but with many, digesting by little and little, and avoiding out by little and
little, seeing that the avoiding out is done with such assurance by this
Medicine so blessed.

He that hath need of it must have a good hart, Note.
and with trust that it will profit him much, which hetherunto we have
experimented, in so many, that with just title all credit may be given to the
good works thereof. We see with how much easines without any accidets, it
works the effects that we have spoken of. it is looked for, that every day
will be discovered greater matters, that may be added unto these.

The Rule and order that must be kept in the administration, and giving of the
Pouders, The order that ought to be kept in taki^g of it.
made of the root of Mechoacan, was learned of the Indian Physician that we
have spoken of, and since it hath been used in diverse and sundry fashions.

The first thing that is required of him that shall take this Powder is, that he
do prepare himself with good diet, It is convenient that there be a preparative
for him that shall take it.
good order, keeping himself from all things that may offend health, and to
use these meates which are most conueniet for him, to dispose the humour that
principally he pretends to avoid out, with some Syrope, that may have the
same respect that the humour is disposed unto the way to be prepared where he
may go out. And for this it is good that he take the counsel of a Phisitio: he
must use Glisters, if the Belly be not obedient at the least the day before he
shall take it, and if by chance he shall need letting blood he shall do it
with the judgment and opinion of a Physician. The body so prepared and ready
to be purged, he shall take this root chosen as we have said, and it must be
ground, Howe these pouders shall be taken.
making Powder of it, of an indifferent sinenesse, and way of it the quantity
that must be taken, as we shall speak of, and put it into white Wine, which
is Sack, as much in quantity as is needful for to drink, and it must be
t^ken in the morning. Wine is the best liquor that it can be taken withal,
and so it is used generally in the Indies, for the Wine as we have said,
doth corroborate and give strength to these Pouders, and because there be some
that can drink no wine, in such case they may give it in sodden water, wherein
Synamon hath been boiled, or Anis or Fenell seed, and if the pure wine do
offend them, it may be delayed with any manner of Water, but the quantity of
the Wine that shall be taken, is so little, that it can^ot offend, nor molest
any person. It may be delayed with Endife, or Langdebeefe water, and because
this medicine is not given in sharpe Agues, but in large and temperate
diseases, Otherwise to give it.
it doth hear the Wine better then any other liquor.

Also they give these Pouders with Conserua of Violets, and with Syrope of
Violets, and it is a good practise: for with his cold and moisture, it doth
correct the little heate, and drought that the Patient hath, and let them drink
upon it Wine watered, or some water as aforesaid.

There is made of this Powder Pills formed with electuary of Roses, There are
made pills of it.
and surely they make a very good work and purge well.

Also they do put it in paste of Wafer bread, or in Marchpaines, and as it
hath no evil savour, so they do not feel it. In Wafer bread.
It serves much for children and for them that cannot take the like things.

The Pills that must be made of this powder must be very little* Note.
somewhat greater then Coriander seed, that they may dissolve the rather, and
not heat, and so they work more quickly and better.

They may be given in the morning and at night, these pouders be received with
most prosperous success, When they shall be give.
being made up with Syrope of Roses of nine infusions, mingling the quantity
that thereof shall be taken in two ounces of Syrope, and surely this mixture
doth make a marvelous work, Wh^t hum^rs the M^choaca^ doth avoid.
for that it doth strengthen, and enforce much the work of the pouders.

It avoids Choleric, gross and fleugmatike humours and permixt, and the
fearcenes of the blood, and so it is a great Medicine, and of marvelous
work: It avoids also most strongly the Citrine water of them that have the
Dropsy, frequenting it many times, giving between one purge and another, that
which may corroborate and make strong the Liver: in Broth it is taken many
times, and makes good work.

This Medicine or purge must be taken in the morning early, and after it is
taken, When it should be taken.
they may sleep half an hour upon it, before it do purge, for that the
sleep doth slay the Uomit, and the natural heate shall make a better work in
the Medicine.

He that shall take these Pouders, if he do fear them, or any other Medicine
purgatiue, and if he fear Uomit, Note.
may use this one remedy, of the which I have large experience, and is, when
he hath taken this purge or any other, let him take the Yolke of an Egg
roasted hot, broken between his Fingers, and put into a course Linen Cloth, and
so round let him put it into the Throat Pit, and let him hold it there,
until that he do begin to purge, for that surely, it will slay the
Uomiting and also the Fumes, that do rise of the purge, and this is no small
content. After that he hath somewhat slept, if he can, at the time that it
begins to work, let him not sleep nor eat, nor drink any thing, but be
in place where the air do not offend him, nor with much company, for that
all the intent shall be for to purge, staying all things that may let the
avoiding out. And he shall be advertised, that one of the greatest excellencies
that this purge hath, is, that it is in the hands of the sick person to
avoid out what quantity of humour he will, the which is a thing that they of
old time did consider much of. And weighing which was surest of purging or the
letting of blood, they do not aleage any other cause more principal, than
that the letting of blood is more sure. Forasmuch as in the letting of blood
we may take out what quantity of blood we lust, not in the purge, which once
being taken, it is not in the hands of the Phisitio, nor the sick person to
let it to do his work, which quality is not in this our purge of the root
of Mechoacan, seeing that with taking of a little Broth, or eating any manner of
thing, the working of it seizes, and it works no more, and so it cannot
exceed nor hurt the patient.

Note.
Surely it is to be holden of much price, that there is food a kind of purge
with so much assurance, and that so mightily doth his work, and is at the
will of him that doth take it. After it hath done what to the patient seems
good, and sufficient, then with a little Broth which he eats, it shall work
and purge no more.

After that he hath purged.
After that the sick person or Physician perceives that it hath made an end
of his working, and hath purged that which is convenient, then they must give
him somewhat to eat, taking at the beginning of his Dinner a Disheful of
Broth, and after a little while let him eat of a Hen, and in the rest let him
govern himself as one that is purged, as well in his drink as in his meat, as
also in the keeping that he shall have of his person. For that day that he
doth take it, let him take heed that he sleep not in the day time nor
drink till Supper, the which Supper shall be light and of some good meates.

What he must do the next day.
The next day let him take a washing Medicine, and some Conserua, and from that
time forward let him keep good order and good government, in al that is
convenient for him.

And if that with once taking of these pouders, the sick man do not heal,
nor avoid from him that which is needful for to be voided, he may take it
again, as many times as the Physician shall see convenient, wherein he shall
have care after that the sick man is purged, to comfort and to alter the
principal members.

Note.
And in this I can hold no precise opinion, for that there be diverse and
variable diseases, and it is needful for them to have diverse remedies, my
intent is no more then to write the use of the Root of Mechoacan, as a thing
of so great importance, and of a purge and remedy so excellent, as nature
hath given unto us.

And if process of time have taken fro us the true Myrre, A good digression.
and the true Balsamo, and other Medicines that they of old time had, of the
which in our time there is no memory, and with the time are lost: yet time it
self in place of them hath discovered and given so many and so sundry things
as we have spoken of, as our Occidental Indies do send us. In especially the
Mechoacan, a purge most excellent and gentle, which doth his work with such
assurance, being white in colour, pleasant in savour, and in smell easy to
take, without any lothsomnes in working, and without that horriblenes, that
other purges have, and without those accidents fayntnes that come at the time,
that they be taken, without that disquietness which it makes when it
works.

This Root hath over and above that, which is said, other properties, and
hidden works, that we do not reach unto, which with the time and use of them
shall be known and discovered every day.

The weight or quantity that is given of the Powder, made of the Root of
Mechoacan, The quantity that is given of it.
is conformable to the obedience of the belly, of him that shall take it. Some
there be that do purge with little quantity. I know a Gentleman of this
Realm, that with the weight of half a Real, which is iii. d. doth purge very
well, and there are other that have need of the weight of xii. d. and others of
the weight of xviii. d. And in this every one ought to measure the quatitie, as
he hath his belly in obedience, more or less. Even so they ought to limit the
quantity conformably to the age of the Patient. For that the Child hath need
of little, the Boy of more, and the strong man of much more, and the Lean of
less, and for this cause the Physician must measure the quantity as he sees
it convenient. Because to the Child he shall give the weight of iii. d. and to
the Boy the weight of vi. d. and to the Man the weight of xii. d. which is
commonly so taken, but to the Woman it is not convenient to give less then the
weight of twelve pence, in this there may be had a consideration, seeing that
it is in the hand of the Physician to take away his work when he doth see
that it excedeth, it is better to give a little too much, considering that with
taking of a few suppings of broth, if it do exceed, the excess may be
remedied.

This is the sum which I have understood unto this day of the Root, which
they bring from the Province of Mechoacan, and when I shall know more of it, I
will write as the time and the use thereof shall give occasion.

Of the quick Sulphur.
WHen I made an end of writing of these last lines, Barnadine of Burgus the
Poticarie, Quick Sulphur.
a man learned and expert in his art, did show me in his shop a piece of
quick Sulphur brought from our Indies, a thing most excellent as ever I saw,
and in our time the like hath not been seen. It was bright like Glass, of
the colour of fine gold, taking a little of it, and casting it into the Fire,
it doth cast from it a very great smell of Brimstone like to green smoke, As
it is.
and the piece it self (smelling thereunto) hath no smell.

They brought it from Quito, with is a place in the province of Peru, Brought fro
Quito.
from a Mine that there was found in certain H^lles, ne'er unto the Mines of
gold. And it is not in vain that the Alcumistes do say, that the matter of
Gold, is the Quickesiluer, Note.
and the Sulphur, that is to say, the Quickesiluer the matter, and the Sulphur
the former and maker. And so this which I saw, was like to a piece of gold
most fine.

They bring from Nicaraga, other Sulphur, but it is russet, like to Ashes,
congeled without colour or brightn^sse, Evil Sulphur.
which is found nigh unto the Uolcan of Nicaraga, the which being cast into the
fire doth cast from it the smell of Brimstone, but it is a piece of earth, and
in nothing is like to that, of the Province of Quito, more then in the smell,
neither hath it that colour of Gold, nor that brightness that the other hath,
which is of Quito.

The same being applied in things, that are convenient for medicine, works
marvelous effects: The thinge^ that i^ profits in.
chiefly being ground, and dissolved with wine, and applied in the night to
them, that have their face red inflamed that be like to Lepers, using it
certain nights, after they have been at the stool, it takes the redness
away, and heals it marvelously, of the which I have great experience. It
heale^h the Skabbes, being dissolved with oil of Roses. Taking the weight of
six pence in an Egg, it heals the Colike. and the Palsy. It is good for
the payne of the Stone, and being taken, it heals the Iaunders.

It is hot and dry excessively, which appears by the friendship, that it
hath with the fire, The complexion thereof.
for being touched with it, it inflames, and makes a flame. It is the
principal matter, of that Devilish invention of Gunpouder, which hath been
the cause of so many evils, and hurts.

Of the wood Aromatike.
ALso the said Barnardino de Burgus showed me a Wood, which to my seeming, I
thought too have been the holy wood, that I mean of Saint Iohn d^ Puerto
Rico, the which was of this manner, and form.

Being in the house of a principal Merchant of this city, making a Medicine in
a Chimney, where they did burn of that wood, the smoke that came out of the
wood did smell much, The smell of the wood.
and gave a very sweet savour, of the which he marvelled much, and asked from
whence they had cast thither that good smell. They of the house told him, that
the good smell was of the wood that they did there burn, and it was that which
did cast that good smell. He took a stick of the Wood, and from it plucked a
slip of the same, which had no smell nor savour, more than other common wood
had, then he took away a little of the rind, and smelled unto it, and tasted
it, and he found a sweet smell most excellent in it, and a Savour no more nor
less then of Maces, or Nutmegs, and much more sharpe, and more sweet, and
of a more pleasant smell and taste, then any Cinamom that is in the world, and
with more liveliness, and sharpness of taste then the Pepper. I tasted it at
the taking away of the rind from the said wood, of the which he had a great
piece of timber, and surely there is not any thing of so sweet smell and taste,
of any thing which we have that with so much pleasantness of smell, and with
such liveliness seadeth forth a flauour as this did penitrate me, insomuch
that tasting a little of it, I carried all that day the sweet smell and savour
in my mouth, being marvelous, as though I had carried there a piece of
Nutmegge.

Histori^.
Of this wood they said, that a Master of a Ship of his, did cut a great
quantity, coming by the Hauana, and in a mountain, they cut much of it, for
the ships provision, and that which did remain they carried to the Owners
hows, there wast it, as I have said. Whereby I do consider howe many trees and
plants there be in our Indies, that have great virtues for medicines, that in
the fuel of the Chimney they spend wood, of sweet odoriferous savour, the
rynde of the which being made into powder, there might be done very great
effects with it, for comforting the heart and the stomach, and principal
members, without seeking after the spicery of Maluca, and the medicines of
Arabia, and them of Persia. Seeing that in the fields untilled, and in the
Mountains and Deserts, our Indies do yield them unto us, the fault is ours
that we do not follow after them, nor seek to do the diligence that is
convenient, for to profit our selves in these marvelous effects, the which I
trust that Time being the discoverer of all things, and good diligence and
experience withal will discover unto us to our great profit.

The end of the first part. God be praised.
The Second Part of this Book is of the things that are brought from our
Occidental INDIES, which serve for the use of Medicine, wherein is treated of
the Tabaco, and of the Sassafras, and of the Carlo Sancto, and of many other
herbs and plants, seeds and licoures, that newly are brought from those
parts, of great virtues and marvelous effects.

Written by Doctor Monardus, Physician of Seuill.

Catholic Royal Majesty.
THese days past I wrote a book of all things which come fro your
Occidental Indies, serving for the use of medicine, and surely it hath been
taken in that estimation, that the things which in it are entreated of do
deserve. And seeing the profit that it hath done, and howe many have been
remedied and healed with those remedies, I did determine to proceed forwards,
to write of the things, which after that the first part was written, have come
from those countries, of the which I have understood, that no less utility
and profit shall come, then of those which are past, for there shall be
discovered new things secrets, which will bring admiration, never to this day
seen nor known before. And seeing that these medicinal things which we do
treat of, the Realms and Countries from whence they come, belong unto your
majesty, and he also that writes of them, is your Majesties subject: I do
desire your Majesty, to receive this travel into your protection, and that
the reward may be such, as for the like works dedicated to your Majesty is
accustomed to be given.

Your Majesties Subject Doctor Monardes*

Of the Tabaco, and of his great virtues.
THIS Herb which commonly is called Tabaco, is an Herb of much antiquity,
and known amongst the Indians, and in especially among them of the new Spain,
and after that those Countries were gotten by our Spaniardes, being taught of
the Indians, they did profit themselves with those things, in the wounds which
they received in their Wars, healing themselves therewith to their great
benefit.

Within these few years there hath been brought into Spain of it, more to
adornate Gardens with the fairness thereof, and too give a pleasant sight,
than that it was thought to have the marvelous medicinable virtues, which it
hath, but now we do use it more for his virtues, than for his fairness.
For surely they are such which do bring admiration.

It is growing in many parts of the Indies, but ordinarily in moist and
shadowy places, Howe it is sown and how it grows.
and it is needful that the ground wh^re it is sown, be well tilled, and
that it be a fruitful ground, and at all times it is sown, in the hot
Countries. But in the cold Countries it must be sown in the Month of
Marche, for that it may defend it self from the frost.



The proper name of it amongst the Indians is Picielt, for the name of Tabaco
is given to it by our Spaniardes, The name of it.
by reason of an Island that is named Tabaco.

It is an herb that doth grow and come too be very great: many times to
be greater then a Lemon tree. The description of it*
It casts forth one steam from the root which grows upright, without
declining to any part, it sends forth many Bows, straight, that well near
they be equal with (...) and at the time as the herb is in the Mortar a
stamping, let there be put to it a few drops of Vinegar, that his work may
be made the better, and after the place is rubbed where the pain is, then lay
upon it one leaf or two leaves of the Tabaco being hot, and so let it alone
till the next day, and then do the like again, or in place of the leaves use a
Linen cloth wet in the hot Joyce. Some there be, that after they have
rubbed it with the staped leaves, do annoynt it with ointments, made for the
like evils, and upon it they lay the leaves or the joyce of the Tabaco. And
surely with this cure they have dissolved great and harde opilations, and very
old swellings. In the grief of the stone, of the Kidneis and Reins, In the
grief of the stone.
this herb works great effects, by putting the leaves into Ashes, or
Embres, hot, that they may warm well, and then being laid upon the grief,
multiplying the use of it as often as it is needful. It is necessary in the
seethinges that are used to be made for Glisters to put into them with the
other things, To put them ^n Glisters.
the Leaves of this herb, for that they shall profit much: and likewise for
Fomentations and Plasters, that they shall make.

In griefs of winds.
In griefs of winds they work the like effect, taking away the pains that
come of the windinesse, applying the leaves after the same sort as is above
said.

The evil of the Mother.
In the grief of women, which is called the evil of the Mother, laying too one
leaf of this herb Tabaco very hot, in the manner as it is said, it doth
manifestly profit and it must be laid upon the Navel. And under it some
do use to put first of al, things of good smell upon the Navel, and then upon
that they lay the leaf. In that which they find most profit, is to lay the
Tacamahaca, or the oil of liquid Amber, and Balsamo, and Caranna, or any of
these unto the Navel, and to keep it too it continually, that it may cleave
unto it, and this works manifest profit in griefs of the Mother.

In one thing, the women that dwell in the Indies do celebrate this herb,
that is, For an evil breath.
in the evil breathing at ye mouth of children, when they are over filled with
meat, and also of old people, anointing their bellies with lamp oil, and
laying some of those leaves, in ashes hot to their bellies, also to their
shoulders, for it doth take away there naughty breathing, and makes them go
to the stool, applying it unto the fundement at what time it is needful, and
if the leaves be ashed it is the better.

Worms, of all kinds of them, it kills, For Worms.
and expels them marvelously, the seething of the herb made into a Syrope
delicately, being taken in very little quantity, the joyce thereof put on the
navel. It is needful after this be done to give a Glister, that may avoid
them, and expel them out of the guts.

In griefs of the Iointes coming of a cold cause it makes a marvelous
work, In evil of the Joints.
the Leaves of this Tabaco being laid hot upon the grief: the like doth the
Joyce laid upon a little cloth hot, for that it doth dissolve the humour,
takes away the pains thereof. If it come of a hot cause it doth hurt, saving
when the humour hath been hot, and the subtle part is dissolved, and the gross
remains, then it doth profit as if the cause were cold, and it is to be
understood, that the leaves being laid, where as is grief of the said cause,
in any part of the body, it profits much.

In swellings or in cold Impostumes, it doth dissolve and undo them, washing
them with the hot Juice, In cold s^ellings.

putting to it a little ball made of the leaf of the Tabaco, washing first the
tooth with a small cloth wet in the Juice, it takes away the payne, and
stays it, that the putrefaction go not forward: in hot causes it doth not
profit, and this remedy is so common that it heals every one.

For C^ilblaines.
This herb doth marvelously heal Chilblaines, rubbing them with the stamped
leaves, and after putting the hands and Feet in hot water, with Salt, and
keeping them warm: this is done with great experience in many.

In Venom venomous wounds.
In Uenom and venomous wounds our Tabaco hath great commendation, which hath
been known but a short time since, for when the wild people of the Indies,
which eat mans flesh do shoot their Arrows, they annointe them with an
herb or Composition made of many poisons, with the which they shoot at all
things that they would kill, and this Uenom is so strong, and pernicious, that
it kills without remedy, and they that be hurt dye with great pains and
accidents, and with madness, unless that their be found remedy for so great an
evil. A few years past they laid to their wounds Sublimatum, Sublimatum in
venomed wounds.
and so were remedied, and surely in those parts they have suffered much with
this vexation of poison.

A little whiles past, certain wild people going in their Boots to S. Iohn De
puerto Rico, to shoot at Indies, or Spaniards, if that they might find the,
came to a place and killed certain Indians, Spaniards, did hurt many, as by
chance there was no Sublimatum at that place to heal them, they remembered to
lay upon the wounds the Joyce of the Tabaco, the leaves stamped. And God would,
that laying it upon the hurts, the griefs, madness, accidents wherewith they
dyed, were mitigated, and in such sort they were delivered of that evil, that
the strength of the Uenom was taken away, and the wounds were healed, of the
which there was great admiration. Which thing being known to the of the
Land, they use it also in other hurts and wounds, which they take when they
fight with the wild people, now they stand in no fear of them, by reason
they have found so great a remedy, in a case so desperate.

This Herb hath also virtue against the herb called of the
Crosseboweshooter, Against the herb of the Crossebowshooter.
which our hunters do use to kill the wild beasts withal, which heath is
Uenom most strong, and doth kill without remedy, which the Kings pleasure
was to prove, and commanded to make experience thereof, and they wounded a
little dog in the throat, and put forthwith into the wound the herb of
the Crosseboweshooter, and after a little while, they powered into the self
same wound that they had anointed with the Crossebowe shooters herb,
History.
a good quantity of the Juice of Tabaco, and laid the stamped leaves upon it,
and they tied up the dog, and he escaped, not without great admiration of al
men that saw him. Of the which, the excellent Physician of the Chamber of his
majesty, Doctor Barnarde.
Doctor Barnarde in the margent of this book, that saw it, by the
commandment of his Majesty, writes these words: I made this experience by
the commandment of the kings Majesty. I wounded the dog with a knife,
after I put the Crossebowe shooters herb into the wound, and the herb was
chosen, and the dog was taken of the herb, and the Tabaco and his Juice
being put into the wound, the dog escaped and remained whole.

taking away that which is superfluous, then power into it the Juice of this
herb, lay upon it the stamped leaves, and being well bound it shall continue on
until the next day that thou shalt return to dress it. After the same fashion
the patients shall keep good order in their meat, using the diet necessary,
and if it be needful of any evacuation by stool, the cause being great, let
it be done what shall be convenient. Note.
And with this order they shall be healed, without any need of any more Surgery
the this herb only. Here in this Country, in this City they know not what
other to do, having cut or hurt themselves, but to run to the Tabaco, as to
a most ready remedy. It doth marvelous works, without any need of other
Surgery, but this only herb. In restraining the flux of blood of the wounds
it procures most marvelous works, for that ye Juice and the Leaves being
stamped, are sufficient to restrain any flux of blood.

In old sores.
In old Sores it is marvelous the works and the effects that this herb
doth, for it heals them wonderfully, making clean and mundifying them of
all humours that are superfluous, and of the rottennes, that they have, brings
up the flesh, reducing them to perfect health, the which is so common in this
City, that every man doth know it* and I having ministered it to many people
as well men as women, in great number, and being grieved of ten, and of
twenty years, have healed old rotten sores in legs, and other parts of
the body, with this remedy only to the great admiration of all men.

The order of the Cure.
The order of the Cure that is to be wrought with this herb, is this
following. For the old rotten sores although they be cankered, let the sick
man be purged with the counsel of a Physician, and let him blood if it be
needful, and then take this herb and pound it in a Mortar, and wring out
the Juice, and put it into the Sore, and then after the manner of a Plaster
lay the stamped leaves upon it, which are the Leaves that the Juice is taken
out of, and this do once every day eating good Meates, and not exceeding in
any disorder, for otherwise it will not profit. And doing this, it will make
clean the evil flesh that is rotten, and superfluous, until it come to the
whole flesh, and it is not to be marvelled at, if the wound be made very
great. For the evil must be eaten up, until it come to the good, and in the
same cure putting in less quantity of juice it will incarnate, and reduce it
to parfit health, in such sort that it accomplishes al the works of Surgery,
that all the Medicines of the world are able to do, without having need of
any other manner of medicine.

This work doth cure old Sores, It cures best the wounds that be rotten
cankered.
with very great admiration: and not only in men, but in brute beasts also.
As at this day in all parts of the Indies, where there are any cattle having
wounds or gaules, and the country being hot and moist over much, doth
soon rot them, and very quickly they come to be cankered, and for this
cause, much great cattle do dye: To remedy this and the worms that do
increase in the sores, Sublimatum doth heal the soars of beasts that be
cankered.
they had for remedy to put into the sores, Sublimatum, for that in this remedy
they did ^de more benefit than in any other, that they had used. And for that
the Sublimatum bears there so high a price, m^y times it was more worth then
the cattle that it heal^. For this cause and for having found in the Tabaco so
much virtue too heal new wounds and rotten, they did accorde and agree
together to use the Tabaco, in the healing of beasts, as they had done in the
cure and remedy of men, pouring the Juice of the Tabaco into the wounds,
washing them therewith, laying upon them the stamped leaves of the Tabaco, after
that the Juice is taken from them. And it is of so great efficacy and virtue,
that it kills the worms, and makes clean the sore, eating away the evil
flesh, and ingendering new until it be whole, as in the other things which
we have spoken of. The like it doth in the gaules of the beasts of Cariege,
the juice being powered in, the beat leaves wherout the juice comes of the
Tabaco, as it is said: although they be cankered, it doth make them clean,
and incarnate them, and cures and helps them. And so the Indians do carry
it, when they journey, for this purpose and effect, and it procures the like
profit, that the juice doth.

I saw a man that had certain old sores in his nose, whereby he did cast out
from him much matter, History.
which daily did rot and canker inward, and I caused him to take at his nose
the juice of this Tabaco, and so he did: and at the second time, he cast out
from him, more then twenty little worms, and afterward a few more, until
that he remained clean of them, and using it so certain days, he was healed
of the sores, that he had in the inner part of his nose: and if he had tarried
any longer, I think that there had remained nothing of his nose, but al had
been eaten away, as it happens to many, which we see without them, And being
writing of this, History.
a daughter of a Gentleman of this City, had many years a certain kind of
drieskabbes, or well near skuruie in her head. I had her in cure and did unto
her many benefits, universal, and particular: and also Masters of Surgery had
done their diligence, and al did not profit. And a Gentlewoman, which had the
charge of her, as s^e heard me speak one day much good of the Tabaco, that
(...) did good, and profitable, for so many infirmities, sh^e sent for it, and
did rub hard the disease that the wench had, that day she was very evil,
and as though she had been fooli^h: and the gentlewoman did not let, in seeing
her after that sor^, to rub her harder, and then the wench did not feel so
much grief, but the dry skabbes beg^n to fall, and the white scurffe of her
head in such sort, that it made clean and healed her head, with doing so
certain days, so that she was healed of her scurvy disease very well,
without knowing what she did.

One of the meru^lles of this herb, and that which brings most admiration,
is, the manner howe the Pri^stes of the Indies did use it, which was in this
manner: The man^ how the Prieste^ of the Ind^as do use th^ Tabaco.
when there was amongst the I^dians any manner of busin^sse, of great
importance, in the which the chief Gentl^men called Casiques, or any of the
principal people of the country, had necessity to consult with their
Priests, in any business of importance: then they went and propounded their
matter to their chief Priest, forthwith in their presence, he took certain
leaves of the Tabaco, and cast them into the fire, and did receive the smoke of
them at his mouth, and at his nose with a Cane, and in taking of it, he fell
down upon the ground, as a Dead man, and remaining so, according to the
quantity of the smoke that he had taken, when the herb had done his work,
he did revive and awake, and gave them their answeares, according to the
visions, and illusions which he saw, whiles he was rapt in th^ same manner,
and he did interpret to them, as to him seemed best, or as the Devil had
counselled him, giving them continually doubtful answeares, in such sort,
that howsoever it fell out, they might say that it was the same, which was
declared, and the answer that he made.

In like sort the rest of the Indians for their pastime, do take the smoke of
the Tabaco, too make themselves drunk withal, and to see the visions, and
things that repr^sent ^to them that wherein they do delight: and other times
they take it to know their business, and success, because conformable to
that, which they have seen being drunk therewith, even so they judge of their
business. And as the Devil is a deceauer, hath the knowledge of the virtue of
herbs, so he did show the virtue of this Herb, that by the means thereof,
they might see their imaginations, and visions, that he hath represented to
them, and by that means deceive them.

Too have Herbs that have the like virtue, Hearbe^ which ha^
is a common (...) I^ias but is also a common thing in the Oriental Indies.
And also in the Portug^ll Indies, for this effect, they do sell the Opi^ in
their Shops, even as they sell Conser^, with the which the Indians use to
ease themselves, of their labour that they take, and to be merry, and not to
feel pains of any great labour of the body, or mind that may come unto
them, and they call it there amongst themselves Aphi^. This Aphion the Turks
do use for this effect. The ^o^l^iers and Captains that go to Wars, when
they labour much, after the time that they be lodged, that they may take their
rest, they receive Aphion, and sleep with it, and remain lightened of their
labour: The most principal people take Bague, and it hath a better cast, and a
better smell, for there is put to it much Amber, and Musk an^ Cloves, and
other spices. And surely it is a thing of admiration, ^o see howe these
Barbarous people do take such Medicines, and how many of them do take them,
and that they do not ki^ them, but rather they take them for health and
reme^ie, for their necessities.

^istorie.
I saw an Indian of those parts, that in my presence did ask an Apothecary
for a quart of Opi^, and I demanded of him wherefore he would have it, and he
told me that he took it to put away weariness, when he felt himself over
much grieved, and afflicted with labour, and he took the half of that which
he carried, for the Apothecary gave him more then a pi^te for twelve pence, and
therewith he slept so soundly, that when he awoke from sleep, he found
himself very much eased of his weariness, in such sort, that he might
continue his labour. I meruelled at it, and it seemed to me a thing of
Mockery, seeing that five or six grains, be the most that we can give to^
sick Person, howe strong soever he be, which being very well prepared,
doth cause many times Accidents of Death. And many years after standing in
the Shop of an other Apothecary of this City, there came an other Indian, of
the same Oriental Indies, and he asked of the Apothecary, for some Opio
called Aphion, the which Apothecary understood him not. And I remembering my
self of the other Indian, caused him to show unto the Indian Opio, and in
showing it to him, he said that it was that which he asked for, and he bought a
quarter of a Pint of it, and I asked of the Indian, wherefore he would have
it, and he told me the same that the other Indian did, that it was because he
might labour, and ease himself of his weariness for that he did bear
burdens, and should help to discharge a ship: wherefore he said he would
take the one half that he might therewith labour, and the other half after he
had laboured, that therewith he might take ease, and rest. Then I gave credit
to the first Indian, of that he said unto me, and since I have believed that
which I have seen and read, in those parts to be a thing in common use, for
the like effects. And truly it is a thing worthy of great consideration,
that five grains of Opio do kill us, and threescore do give them health and
rest.

The Indians do use the Tabaco, for to suffer dries, and also to suffer
hunger, The Tabaco takes away drought.
and to pass days without having need to eat or drink, when they shall
travel by any desert, or dispeopled country, where they shall find neither
water, nor meat. They receive thereof little balls, which they make of the
Tabaco. For they take the leaves of it, and chew them and as they go chewing
of them, they go mingling with them certain powder, Little balls for hunger
and drought.
made of the shells of Cockels burned, they mingle it in the mouth altogether,
until they make it like dow, of the which they frame certain little Balls,
little greater then Peason, and lay them to dry in the shadow, and after they
keep them, and use them in this form following. The manner how to use them.


When they use to travel by the ways, where they find no water nor meat,
they take a little hall of these, and put it between the lower lip and the
teeth, and go chewing it all the time that they travel, and that which they
chew, they swallow down, and in this sore they journey, three or four
days, without having need of meat, or drink, for they feel no hunger
dries, nor weakness, nor their travel doth trouble them. I think that to
journey after this sort, is ^he cause they go chewing continually the little
balls: for they bring Fleume into the mouth, and swallow it into the stomach,
the which doth retain the natural heate, which it doth confirm, and so they
mainteyn themselves thereby, the like whereof we see to happen in many beasts,
for that a great part of the Winter, they be shut up in their Caves, hollow
places of the earth, and pass their time there without any meat, for that
they have to c^nsume the natural heate, of the f^mes, which they had gotten in
the Summer. The Bear being a great and fierce beast, much time in the Winter
remains in his Cave, and lives without meat or drink, with only chewing
his paws, which perhaps he doth for the said cause. This is the substance
which I have gathered of this herb, so celebrated called Tabaco, for that
surely it is an herb of great estimation, for the excellent virtues that it
hath, as we have said.

Hereafter follows a further addition of the Herb called Tabaco, otherwise
called by the Frenchmen Nicotiane. Which herb hath done great cures in the
Realm of France and Portugall, as hereafter at large may appear in
thistreatise following. Nicotiane. Chap. 76.
NICOTIANE, Nicotiane the chiefest among other medicinable herbs.
although it be not long since it hath been known in France, notwithstanding
deserves palm and price, and among al other medicinable herbs, it deserves
to stand in the first rank, by reason of his singular virtues, and as it were
almost to be had in admiration, as hereafter you shall understand. And for
that none such as of ancient time, or of late days, have written the nature
of plants, did never make mention thereof, I have therefore learned the whole
history touching the same, which I learned of a gentleman my very friend, the
first author, inuenter, and bringer of this herb into France: wherefore I
thought good to publish it in writing for their sakes, that have so often
heard speaking of this said herb, and yet neither knew the herb nor the
effects thereof.

This Herb is called Nicotiane, Nicotiane wherefore so named.
of the name of him that gave the first intelligence thereof unto this Realm,
as many other plants have taken their names of certain Greekes and Romaynes,
who having been in strange Countries, for service of their common Weals, The
Queen^ Mothers herb.
have brought into their countries many plants, which were before unknown.
Some have called this Herb the Queenes Herb, because it was first sent
unto her, as hereafter shall be declared by the Gentleman, that was the first
inuenter of it, and since was by her given to diverse for to sow, whereby it
might be planted in this land. Others have named it the great Priors herb,
The grand Priors herb.
for that he caused it to multiply in France, more then any other, for the
great reverence that he bare to his herb, for the Divine effects therein
contained. Many have given it the n^me, Petum, which is indeed the proper name
of the Herb, Petum.
as they which have tra^elled that Country can tell. Notwithstanding, it is
better to name it N^cotiane, by the name of him that sent it into France
first, to the end that he may have the honour thereof, according to his
desert, for that he hath enriched our Country, with so singular an Herb.
Thus much for the name, and now hearken further for the whole History.

Master Iohn Nicot, Counsell^r to the King, being Ambassador for his Majesty
in Portugall, Master Nicot Ambassador for the king in Portugall.
in the year of our Lord. 1559.60.61. went one day to see the Prysons of the
King of Portugall: and a Gentleman being the keeper of the sa^e Prisons
presented him with this herb, as a strange Plant brought from Florida. The
same Master Nicot, having caused the said herb to be set in his Garden, where
it grew and multiplied marvelously, was upon a time advertised, by one of
his Page^, that a young man, of kin to that Page made a s^ye of that herb
bruised both the herb and the Juice together upon an ulcer, which he had upon
his cheek near unto his nose, coming of a Noli me tangere, which began to
take root already at the griffles of the Nose, wherewith he found himself
marvelously eased. Therefore the said Master Nicot caused the sick young
man to be brought before him, and causing the said herb to be continued to
the sore eight or ten days, this said Noli me tangere, Experience of the Noli
me tangere.
was utterly extinguished and healed: and he had sent it, while this cure was a
working to a certain Physician of the king of Portugall one of the greatest
fame to examine the further working and effect of the said Nicotiane, and
sending for the same young man at the end of ten days, the said Physician
seeing the visage of the said sick young man, certified, that the said Noli me
tangere was utterly extinguished, as in deed he never felt it since.

Within a while after, one of the Co^kes of the said Ambassador having almost
cut off his thombe, Experienc^ for wounds.
with a great chopping knife, the Stew^rd of the house of the said Gentleman
ran to the said Nicotiane, and dressed him therewith five or six times, and
so in the end thereof he was healed: from that time forward this herb began
to be famous throughout Lishebron, L^shebron.
where the court of the king of Portugall was at that presone, and the virtue
of this said herb was extolled, and the people began to name it the
Ambassadors herb. The Ambassadors herb.
Wherefore there came certain days after a Gentleman of the Country, Father
^o one of the P^ges of the Ambassador, who was troubled with an ulcer in his
Leg, having had the same two years, and demanded of the said Ambassador
for his herb, and using the same in such order as is before written, at the
end of ten or twelve days he was healed. Experienc^ of an old ulcer.
From that time forth the fame of that same herb increased in such sort, that
many came from al places to have some of it. Among al others there was a woman
that had her face covered with a Ringworme rooted, Experience for the
Ringwormes.
as though she had a Uisour on her face, to whom the said L. Ambassador
caused the herb to be given, and told how she should use it, and at the end
of eight or ten days, this woman was thoroughly healed, who came and
presented her self to the Ambassador, showing him of her healing.

After there came a Captain to present his Son sick of the kings evil to
the said L. Ambassador, Experience for the king^ evil.
for to send him into France, unto whom there was a say made of the said
herb, which in few days did begin to show great signs of healing, and
finally he was altogether healed thereby of the kings evil.

The Lady of Montigue dead of a Noli me tangere in her Br^st.
The L. Ambassador seeing so great effects proceeding of this herb, and
having heard say that the Lady Montigue that was, dyed at Saint Germans, of an
ulcer bread in her breast, that did ^rne to a Noli me tangere, for the which
there could never remedy he fo^nde: ^nd likewise that the Countess of Ruff,
had sought for al the famous Physicians of that Realm, for to heal her face,
unto whom they could give no remedy, How the Nicotiane was brought into Franc^.
he thought it good to communicate the same into France, and did send it to
king Frauncis the second, and to the Q^eene Mothe^, and to many other Lords of
the Cou^ (...) the m^ne^ of ministering th^ same, and howe to apply it unto the
said diseases, ^uen as he had found it by experience, and chiefly to the Lord
of Iarnac governor of Rogel, with whom th^ said Lord Ambassador had great
amity for the service of the king. The which Lord of Iarnac told one day at
the Queen^s table, Distilled water of Nicotiane, singular good for short
breath^. The figure of Nicotiane.
yt he had caused the sai^e Nicotian^ to be distilled, and the water to be
dr^nke, mingle^ with water, of Euphrasio otherwise called eyebright, to one
that was short breathe^, who was therewith healed.

This herb hath the stalk great, bearded and slymie, the leaf large and
long bearded slymie, it grows in branches half foot to half foot, and is
very full of leaves, and grows in height four or five foot. In hot countries
it is nyne or ten months in the year laden, in one self time, with leaves
flowers, Coddes full of ripe grains, which is when they are waxed black, and
to be ripe, which is when they are yet green. It sproutes forth near the
root much, and reuyueth by a great quantity of buds, notwithstanding the
grain is the least seed in the world, the roots be like small threads.

Ground fit for Nicotiane.
Nicotiane doth require a fat ground finely dug, and in cold Countries
very well dounged, that is to say, a ground, in the which the doung must be so
will mingled and incorporated, that it be altogether turned into earth, that
there appear no more doung.

It requires the south Sun, and to be planted by a wall, The Sun fit for
Nicotian^.
which may defend it against the North wind recovering the heate of the Sun
against it, being a warrant unto the said herb against the tossing up of the
wind, because of the weakness and highness thereof.

It grows the better being often watered, and revives it self by reason of
the water in time of droughts. To water Nicotiane.
It hates the cold, therefore to preserve it from dying in the Winter time, it
must either be kept in Caves made of purpose within the said gardens, or else
covered with a double Matte, How to keep^ Nicotiane in Winter.
and a Penthouse of Reed made on the Wall over the herb, and when the South
Sun shines, the door of the place must be opened where the herb is on the
Southside.

For to sow it, The sowing of Nicotian^.
there must be made a hole in the ground with your finger, as deep as your
finger can teach, then cast into that hole 40. or 50. grains of the said
Seed together stopping again your hole, for it is so small a Seed, that if
there be put in the hole but three or four grains thereof, the earth would
choke them, and if the weather be dry, the place must be watered lightly
during the time of fiftiene days after the sowing thereof: it may also be
sown like unto Lettis and other such herbs.

And when the herb is out of the ground, for so much as every Grain thereof
will bring forth his twig, To remove Nicotiane.
and that the little threads of the Root are the one within the other, you
must make with a great knife a great compass within the earth round about
the said place, and lift up the earth together with the Seed, and cast it
into a payle of water, so that the earth be separated, that the little twigs
may swim above the water, then shall you take them without breaking, the one
after the other,

The Sassafras.


Of the tree which is brought from the Florida, called Sassafras.
FRom the Florida which is the firm Land of our Occidental Indies, lying in
xxv. degrees, The Histori^ of the Sassafras.
they bring a wood and root of a tree that grows in those parts, of great
virtues, and great excellencies, healing therewith grievous and variable
diseases.

It may be three years past, that I had knowledge of this Tree, a French man
which had been in those parts, showed me a piece of it, and told me meruels
of the virtues thereof, how many and variable diseases were healed with the
water, which was made of it. I gave at that time no credit to him, for that in
these things of Plants, and herbs, which are brought from other places, they
say much, and know little, unless it be by a man that hath experience of
them, with care and diligence. The tree and the parts thereof liked me well,
and I judged that, which now I do find to be true, and have seen by
experience. He told me that the Frenchmen, which had been in the Florida at
that time, when they came into those parts, had been sick the most of them, of
grievous and variable diseases, and that the Indians did show them this tree,
and the manner how they should use it, and so they did, and were healed of many
evils, which surel^ brings admiration, that one only remedy should work so
variable, and so marvelous effects.

After that the Frenchmen were destroyed, History.
our Spaniardes began to wax sick, as the Frenchemen had done, and some
which remained of them, did show it to our Spaniardes, and howe they had cured
themselves with the water of this marvelous Tree, and the manner which they
observed in the using of it, showed to them by the Indians, who used to cure
themselves therewith, when they were sick of any grief.

Our Spaniards began to cure themselves with the water of this Tree, and it
wrought in them great effects, that are almost incredible: for with the
naughty meates drinking of the raw waters, sleeping in the dews, the most
part of them fell into continual Agues, of the which many of them came into
opilations, and from the opilations they began to swell, and when the evil came
first, immediately it began to take away the lust that they had to their meat,
and then happened to them other accidents, and diseases, as such like Fevers
are accustomed to bring: and having there no remedy to be healed, they did
what the Frenchemen had counselled them, doing that which they had done, which
was in this form.

They dug up the root of this tree, and took a piece thereof, such as it
seemed to them best, they cut it small into very thin and little pieces,
and cast them into water, at discretion, as much as they saw was needful,
little more or less, and they sod it the time that seemed sufficient for to
remain of a good colour, and so they drank it in the morning fasting, and in
the day time, and at dinner, and supper, without keeping any more weight, or
measure, then I have said, nor more keeping, nor order then this, and by this
they were healed of so many griefs, and evil diseases, that to hear of them
what they suffered, and how they were healed, it brings admiration, they which
were whole, drank it in place of wine, for it doth preserve them in health:
They which we^e whole drank it.
as it appeared very well by them that have come from thence this year, for
they came all whole and strong, and with good colours* which doth not happen
to them that come from those parts, and from other conquests, for they c^me
sick and sw^lne, without colour, and in short space the most of them di^. And
these Soldiers do trust so much in this Wood, that I being one day amongst
many of them, informing any self of th^ things of this Tree, the most part
of them took out of their Pockets, a good piece of this Wood, and said:
Master, do you see here the Wood, that every one of us doth bring to heal
us withal, if we fall sick, as we hau^ been there? and they began to praise
it so much, and to confirm the marvelous works of it, with so many examples
of them that were there, that surely I gave great credit unto it, and they
caused me to believe all that thereof I ha^ heard, and gave me courage to
experiment it, as I have done, and as we shall see in the maruelles, which we
shall write of it. And now we come to show the description, and form of this
Tree.

The Tree from whence they cut this Wood, The description of this Tree.
which they newly brought from the Florida, called Sassafras, is a Tree that
grows to be very great: there be of a middle sort, and lesser sort. The
greater sort is of the bigness of a Pine Tree, of a mean height, and well
near to the making of it, for it is straight, casts out no more but one
branch of Bows, after the manner of a Palm Tree, only in the highest part,
or sends out bows after the manner of a Pine Tree, made clean, making of the
Bows which it casts forth, a form of roundness. It hath a gross rind of a
Tawny colour, upon that an other thin rind, of the colour of ashes, and upon
the inner part thereof, the Trees and bows b^e white, and near like to
Tawny. The tree and bows are ver^ light, the rind being tasted, hath an
excellent sweet smell, and it is somewhat like to the smell of Fenell, with
much sweetness of taste, and of pleasant smell, insomuch that a little
quantity of this Wood being in a chamber, fills the air contained in it, and
the rind hath some sharpn^sse of t^st* the inner part hath little smell, the
higher part that co^t^yneth the bows hath leaves, the which be green, after
the ^u^mer of a Fig tree, with three points, an^ when they are little, they
be like to the leaves of a Pear tree, in only showing their points. They be
of colour a sad^e Green, and of a sweet smell, and much more when they be
dry. The Indians use to lay them beaten or stampe^ upon br^ises, or when any
man is beaten with dry blows, and being dried they are used in Medicinable
things. They l^se no^ their leanes, they are always green, if any do dry
and fall, there springs other, it is not known that it hath any flower or
fruit.

The roots of this Tree be gross, or slender, conformably to the greatenesse
of the Tree, The roots.
they be light, but not so much as the body of the Tree, and the bows, but
for the greatness it is notable light.

Note.
The root of this Tree is very superficial, spreading in the upper face of the
soil or ground, (...) so they dig them up easily: and this is a common
thing in the Tree^ of the Indies, tha^ most of them have their roots of small
depth, and if they carry any plant^s from Spain to plant elsewhere, if they
do not set them of small depth in the ground, they bear no fruit.

The best is the root.
The best of all the Tree is the root, and that works the best effect, the
which hath the rind cleaving very fast to the inner part, and it is of colour
Tawny, and much more of sweet smell then all the tree, and his Branches:
the rind tastes of a more sweet smell, then the tree, and the water being
sodden with the root, is of greater and better effects, then of any other
part of the tree, and it is of a more sweet smell, and therefore the
Spaniardes use it, for that it works better and greater effects. It is a
tree that grows near unto the Sea, and in temperate places, that have not
much drouth, nor moisture. There be Mountains growing full of them, and they
caste forth a most sweet smell, so that at the beginning when they saw th^m
first, they thought that they had been trees of Cinnamon, and in part they
were not deceived, for that the rind of thi^ tree ^ath as sweet a smell, as
the Cinnamon hath, and doth imitate it in colour and sharpness of taste, and
pleasantness of smell, and so the water that is made of it, The S^ssafras as
good a^ the Cinnamon.
is of most sweet smell and taste, as the Cinnamon is, and procures the same
works and effects as Cinnamon doth.

The tree grows in some parts of the Florida, and not in others, for that it
is in the port of Saint Elen, and in the Port of Saint Matthew, and not in any
other parts: but when the Soldiers did wax sick, The c^mpl^ction
temperature of the tree.
in places where this tree grew not, either they carried them to be healed to
the said places, or they sent them the trees, or their Roots chiefly, and
therewith did heal them. The best of the tre^ is the root, ^fter them the
bows, and next the tree, and the best of all is the rindes. The complexion
and temperature of the tree and of his bows, is hot dry in the second
degree, the rind is somewhat more hot then the rest, for that it enters into
the third degree, of heate, and dries, and this is manifestly seen in the
water* and so they tha^ shall need of it, must procure to have the roots or
bows, which have the rind, for that which is without it, doth no^ work so
good effects.

The name of this Tree, as the Indians term it, i^ called Pauan^e, and the
French Men call it Sassafras. The name.
I know not wherefore our Spaniardes call it after the same manner, being
taught by the French Men, although that some do corrupt it, and call it
Sassafragia, by the name that we have from thence, they of these parts do
call it Sassafras.

The use of the Root, The use ^y seething.
or of the Wood of this Tree the which w^e have treated of here, is by the way
of seething, in this form the Indians did show it to the French men, and they
unto us: and as the Indians have neither weight nor measure, they have not kept
in those parts any order in the making of the water of this wood, for that
they do no more there than put a piece of the wood, or of the root at their
discretion made in pieces, into the water as they do think best. And they
sees it after their manner, without consuming more quantity, then when they
see that the seething is sufficient: Variety of seething.
so that all they which have come from those parts, are very variable in their
manner of seething, which is no small confusion to them that shall use it, and
likewise to the Physician that shall minister it. That which I do herein. I
will write. I look upon the complexion, and temperature of the sick person,
How the author doth order it.
that shall take and use this water, as also the manner and quality of the
disease, and conformably I make the water, and give it to the sick person,
giving to the Choleric less seething, and less quantity of Wood, and to the
Flegmatike more seething, and more quantity of Wood, and to the Sanguine
meanably: and so after this sort too their infirmities, according too the
qualities of them, for that if it be not done according to this order, they
cannot choose but make many errors in the use of this water, and also it is
convenient that for the mo^e part they keep the use of the diet government
which is necessary for the disease which they pretend to cure. Let none think,
that to take this water without order good consideration, as many doth, there
shall follow health: but unto them rather taking it without measure without
order, ^t shall do unto them much hurt: whereby it seems to me that when this
water shall be ministered, as well in the diseases that it cures, as in any other
whatsoever they be, it is necessary that they go to some learned Physician,
that may dispose the manner and making of the Water, and the order which they
shall observe in taking of it, for that in the Winter it should be taken
otherwise than in the Summer. And otherwise it must be given to the lean
person, than to the strong, and in an other manner it must be taken of the
Choleric, than of the fleugmatike, one order is required in the cold region,
an other order in the hot. Whereby it appears, that it is convenient to keep
order, measure, form in the taking of it, for that there goes no less with
it then health life, considering that we see it have no price in the world, not
to let it alone to the judgment of him that knows it not.

It happened to a gentle woman, History.
unto whom for certain i^dispositions of the Mother, proceeding of great
cold that she had taken, I couselled her that she should take this water of
the wood of Sassafras. And I gave her the order that she should use, in making
and taking of it, which was as much as was convenient for her disease, and
seeming for her. But she took much of the wood, more then I willed her,
seething the water more then I commanded her, she thought that she should
heal the sooner. And as she took it certain days with this strength, she
was burdened in such sort with a very great Ague, that not only it stood her
upon to leave the water, but it was needful to let her blood five times, and
put her life in adventure, so procured infamy to the remedy. After she was
whole, and had prevailed, she returned took the water with the order that I
had first told her, and she healed very well of her disease. It is time now
that we come to the virtues of this wood so excellent, whereof let us speak
particularly of every one of them, as we have known, and experimented them.

In general our Spaniardes in those parts of the Florida, where they have
been and now are, T^e virtues thereof.
do use this aforesaid water sodden at their discretion, for all manner of
disseases, without making exception of any. An^ being sick of any manner of
evil which comes unto th^m, sharpe, or long, hot, or cold, grievous or
otherwise, they ^ure them all by one manner of fashion, they heal all with o^e
manner of water, without making any difference, and the best is that al be
healed therewith, in this they repose so much trust, that they fear not the
evils which are present, nor have any care of them that be to come, so they use
it for an universal remedy, in all manner of diseases.

In one of the things that they have found most profit in this water, It
heals opilations.
was in Opilations, in the interior parts, of the which they came to be
swollen, and to be full of the Dropsy the most part of them. For of the long
and large heates which they had taken, they came well near generally to have
these diseases. And with this water both the swelling and the opilation went
away, and therewith they came to be made whole of the Quotidian Agues, which
the most part of them had. For in going thither the most part of them fell
sick, of these long and importunate Fevers, in the which I have experience by
this Water, being taken as it ought too be, for it works marvelous
effects, and have healed many therewith. For the principal effect that it
hath, It comfort the Liver and the stomach, and doth disopilate.
is to comfort the Liver, and to dissolve Opilations, and to comfort the
stomach, which are the two principal things, that are most convenient for the
Physician to do, that the sick may be healed of the like diseases. For in
these evils it is not to be feared that the humours be corrupted. And if the
principal members be hurt, one of the things that these medicines which are
brought from our Indies do principally, when the water of any of them is taken,
is to comfort the Liver, and to amend it, that it may engender good humours,
for if this be not done, the cure is in vain. And so our Sassafra^ hath a
marvelous property, to comfort the Liver, and to dissolve the Opilations, in
such sort that it doth engender alowable blood.

I healed ^ young man which had an opilation of cert^yne Tertians. H^storie.
And thereof he was all swollen, in such sort that he was well near full of
Dropsy And with purging him many times with Pills of Ruibarbe, and by taking
of Dialaca amongst the said Purgations, and drinking the water of this
Sassafras, continually without drinking of any other thing, he came to be healed
very well, and was clear of his swellings, and opilations. And he did not let
to drink it until he remained perfectly whole.

The manner of curing with this water made of the Sassafras, for the Tertian
Agewes long Fevers, I will show you, and what hath passed in this year, that
I wrote this. There have been many people diseased with the tertiane Agewes,
so importunately, that no manner of medicine was sufficient to take them away,
and to root them out, insomuch that we let many alone, with only good order,
and good government, without helping them any more. They were opilated, and had
evil colour of the face, and some of them were swollen.

And at that time it was, when the Captain general Peter Mellendis came from
the Florida, Peter Mellendis.
and brought him in common, this wood of the Sassafras, and when every man did
so much praise it, many of them that had Tertians, took water of the
Sassafras, keeping the order that the Soldiers gave them, and surely I saw in
that great maruelles, for that they healed many with the use thereof. Not
only of the tertians that so much did molest them, but also of the Opilations
and evil colour that they had. And seeing this, I caused other to take it,
that without counsel durst not do it. And it did very well with them, but it
must be well seen unto how it should be given, and to whom, that the cause
may carry with it both order and measure.

That which ordinarily was done, was to give one cup full of the Water well
sodden, How this water must be g^uen.
in the morning with Sugar or without it, and after to drink the water
continually, that which was more simple, then the first, and as the Physician
shall judge to be most convenient for him that is sick, keeping the conditions
in the taking of this water that we shall speak of.

And surely it is a thing that gives great contentment to heal only with the
drinking of a water, Digression.
it being of a sweet smell, and good of savour which is taken, and drunk
without any manner of grief, and so to do that work which sharpe medicines
and sirupes of evil savour and taste cannot do. And such as did drink wine,
did water their wine with it, th^y found themselves well with it.

In one thing it was seen greatly to profit, which is in the use of this
water, To give appetite to eat.
in them that have lost the lust of their meat, insomuch that it is restored
to them, the lothsomnesse taken from them, by the use of it, so that many did
amend come to their health quickly. And the use of this water doth cause lust
to meat. The Soldiers do commend it with such admiration, that some came to
leave it, and not to drink it, for because that it caused them to have so
great hunger, that they could not withstand it. And because there was no such
abundance of meates wherewith they might satisfy their hunger, which the water
was cause of, they would not drink it, as not having sufficient for their
maintenance, for they did all use it for a drink in steed of wine, and it
was a great remedy for them, that by it they became whole, as appears by
them which came from those parts whereas they do use it.

In the Hauana there is a Physician, whom they take for a Man of good
understanding in these causes, How a Physician of the Hauana doth use it.
who did cure many of them which came in the Fleet from the new Spain sick,
with only the use of this water, without giving or making for them any other
Medicine. And it did very well with them, for that many were healed therewith,
and he gave them to drink as much as they would, all the day, and at Dinner
and Supper, and in the morning he gave a Cup full warmed, to them that could
not go to stool with a little Sugar not very white, and it wrought very well
with them, for their going to stool. And to other he gave Medicines of this
water only and Honey, it made a good work. I cured here some that were in cure
in the Hauana. And being ordered in this manner, they which came not well healed
thence, were here fully healed.

In griefs of the head, and in pains thereof being very old, which proceed
of any cold cause, In the h^adache.
the taking of this water hot in the morning well sodden, and at dinner and
supper, and in the day time simple with good government as well in the meat
that is eaten, as in the rest of all other things, and doing this for many
days, it cures and heals them marvelously. It is convenient for him that
shall do this, that he purge himself first, and in the time that he must take
it, that he receive certain Pills of Hiera simplex, he hath no need to keep
himself close neither in his chamber, nor in his bed. He that shall take
this, it is enough that he go well clothed, and that he keep himself from the
cold and air, and that he use to eat good meates.

In griefs of the breast caused of cold humours, this water doth profit much,
and opens the ways of the breast. In evils of the breast.
It consumes moisture and fleames, it stays the flux, the running which
comes from the head to the breast. It must be taken in the morning hot, and
drink continually simple, for besides the ordinary drinking in the morning, it
must be drunk simply for a long time. For these simple waters as they do
their work by little and little, so it is needful that they be continued for a
long season. It is good that there be put some suggar too it, that it may make
the better work.

In griefs of the Stomach when the cause is cold or windy, after that the
universal euacuations be made, In grie^es of the Stomach.
taking this water in the morning strong, as it is s^id simple, at other times,
it takes them away and heals them, chiefly if there be any old grief, for
that I have given it for this effect, to men that many years did suffer most
grievous pains in the stomach, and with taking the water in the morning hot
for certain days, and continuing with the simple water for a long time, and
taking once every week pills of Hiera simplex, many people were healed thereof
very well. And thus we have declared howe that the use of this water restores
the appetite lost, and gives lust to meat.

In the weakness of the stomach, and in the lack of natural heate, For the
weakness of the Stomach of them which do not digest their meat, and for them
which do vomit their meat.

In the grief of the Stone.


where that which is eaten is not consumed, it works great effects, and
helps digestion. It consumes winds, which are the cause of indigestion, it
takes away a stinking breath, and from them that do vomit their meat, it
takes away that evil custom, so that they eat little, and use continually to
drink this water without wine. And above al other things, it makes a good
breath, and a good smell at the mouth.

In the disease of the stone of the Ridneis and reins, the use of this water
hot when they have this grief, doth greatly profit, and much more using it
continually simple by it self, or with wine, for that it doth preserve that
the pain come not so continually nor so grievously. And also it makes him
that doth use it, to cast out much Sand, where the stones be engendered. It
causes to cast out gravel stones.
And also it causes the stones that are in the reins to be cast out, and
stays the ingendering of them, for that it consumes the fleames, of the
which they be principally engendered, and the winds that be many times the
causes of the pains.

For whom the use of this water is not convenient.

Of the wood for the stone.


To them which have the burning of the Urine, to such as have great burning at
the time that they make their water, do feel great heat, unto such is not
convenient the use of this water, for because it is hot.

Al such should use of that wood, which I have written of in the first part of
this History, which is excellent, for such as suffer the like burninges and
pains. For the stones and sands, for al such evils coming of heate, the work
is marvelous that it doth, saving that if there be any stone in the Bladder,
from which place proceeds the like burning, for in such a case none of these
waters do take effect: but only the Surgeons Raser when the Stone is great,
is that which doth profit, as I have seen in many. And while it is said it
is a stone, it is no stone, death hath come unto them that had it, whom if
they had been opened in time, might have lived many years, as we have seen in
diverse of sixty years and more who have bin opened, and lived until they came
to eighty years and more.

And I advertise you, that this wood, which I call of the Uryne, and the stone,
doth make the water blew, The wood of the Urine will make the water blew.
for if it do not make the water blew, it is not the right wood. And now they
bring a wood, which makes the water yellow, and this is not it which doth
profit, but that which makes the water blew, and this hath the covetousness
of them caused, that bring it, because they have seen that it is well sold in
this city, for the manifest profits that it doth, in these griefs of the
Urine, by tempering the Reins, and the Liver, and procuring many other
benefits, they bring of all the wood that they find, and sell it for wood of
the stone. The same hath happened in the Mechoacan, which when it came to be
worth twenty Ducats the pound, they laded so much from thence of it, some
not being ripe, other not being right, that when it is come hither, it works
not the effect, that th^ good and well seasoned w^s wont to do. Wherefore it is
needful to see to that which is taken, that it be the same, and that it be
well seasoned. ^alse Mechoacan.


That which is very white, is not such as the yellow is, in mine opinion, for
that which is yellow, we see that it m^keth the better work: it may be
that the very white is not of it, or hath not the perfection that the good
hath. And coming to our water of Sassafras, It prouo^eth Vners.
it provokes Urine, it makes them to Uryne well, which have the impediment of
it, chiefly if it come by humours of col^e causes. I did know a Priest, which
came in this fl^ete from the Florida, who being in those parts, did make water
very evil, and cast from him stones, some times with very much grief, and some
of them did put him in hazard of his life, when he was in the Florida, as he
drank of the water of Sassafras ordinarily, as many other did in the place of
wine: he avoided many great small stones, without any pains, and after that
hither unto he hath found himself whole, and very well of this evil, by
drinking the simple w^ter of this wood ordinarily, and watering his wy^e
therewith. Many do drink of this water for the same purpose, and they cast
out much Sand, and do find themselves cured therewi^h.

In the which be lame.
In them that be lame or creeples, and in them that are not able to go, nor to
move themselves, as for the most part that infirmity comes of cold humours:
by taking this water hot in the morning, and procuring sweat all that he can,
eating things of diet, and drinking the simple water continually, and using it
many days: we have seen many healed. And it is to be noted, that in taking
of this water, there is nothing to be observed, as in other waters: but when
they shall take it hot, if any sweat come, to keep it, and after this they
may rise and go well clothed: it is not needful of any thing else, but of
this and good order, and to eat good meates, and if they sweat not, it makes
no great matter, but if they sweat not, they shall be healed: I know a
Captain, one of them which came from the Florida: and he certified me that
he was so weak in all his body, that his Soldiers carried him upon their
shoulders, for that in any other manner he could not stir, and he was in a
place where the tree of Sassafras was not, and he sent for it and toke the
water, and therewith sweat for certain days, and afterward he took it
simply, and he was restored to his perfect health, and I did see him whole,
and well.

In the toothache, this wood being broken and chewed with the tooth that is
grieved, In the toothach^.
and leaving that which is chewed in the hole of the tooth, which is grieved,
if it have any hollowness, and although that it have none, yet it takes away
the pains marvelously, with experience done upon many.

In the evil of the Pox, In the evil of the Pox.
it works the same effects that the rest of the waters, of the holy wood,
the China, and the Sarcaparillia doth: taking it as these waters be taken
with sweates, putting up more or less, the decoction of the water, and the
quantity of the wood, as the complexion is, and the disease of him that shall
take it. For that in cold humours Flegmatike, it makes a better work, then
in them that be Choleric: and so in the Pox that be of a long time, it
makes a better and greater work, than in them that be of small continuance:
and more where there be knobs, and moisture of matter, old griefs of the
head, with the order as is aforesaid. The simple water.
And in these evils the simple water is continually taken for a great time, and
it works great effects, chiefly in them that be lean, which be altogether
weakened debilited, with the use of many Medicines.

Many which have the Gout, have used, and do use to drink of the Water of
this tree, In the which have the gout and the evil o^ the Joints.
some of them taking it hot, as we have said, and others simple continually
by it self, and watering their wine therewith. That which I have seen, is that
which in the old kind of Goutes, doth neither good nor evil, and if it do
any good, it is to comfort the stomach, and to dissolve win^inesse, to give
them some lust to their meat, the rest of the benefit that it brings, is to
them that h^ue bin sick but short time, if the cause proceed of cold, unto
whom it procures notable profit, but if the humour and cause be hot, it doth
them no good, but hurte^h them, infl^ming and causi^g them to have greater
pains.

In one thing I have seen it in many people to bring notable profit, with the
continual use of this water, and it is in them which have foul diseased
hands, For them that have foul hands.
which cannot exercise them, as they were wont to do. I healed a Gentleman
which could not write, that when he went to write, his hand fell down by
little and little, and the pen also, after he had begone to write not past
five or six letters. And he toke a Cup full of that, which was last sodden
in the morning, and after he drank it, he continued two hours in his bed,
and after he rose and went about his business. And he did eat at his dinner
good meates, and at his Supper used diet, and drank the simple water of the
self same Sassafras, and he was healed very well: having spent a great sum of
money on Physicians and Medicines, which did not profit him any thing, until
he came to be remedied in the order as is aforesaid.

The water h^t makes a man go to the stool.
Many did certify me that, which now I find by experience, and learned of
them that were sick in the Hauana, and could not go to the stool, that the
Physician which is there, did cause them to take in the morning fasting a good
Cup full hot of the water of the Sassafras, and it did soften the belly,
and they went to the stool very well, which we have seen here to be true by
experience. And there was a Soldier which certif^ed me, and proved it, with
others of his company, For the going to the stool by indigestio.
that having stools by indisgestion and rawnesse of stomach, for want of
heate, it took them away, with taking of one good cupfull of this water every
morning fasting, and so with drinking it continually, but that which he drank
every morning, he drank it cold, and y^t nevertheless he was healed very
well of the flixe, which he had many years. I^ the evil of W^n.

The eu^ll o^ the Mo^h^r (...).




I^ griefs of women the water of Sassafras doth greatly profit, and in
especially in that which is called the evil of the Mother: and where there is
windinesse, it consumes diss^eth it, and also any manner of cold of the bel^y,
and it dissolveth the swelling of it, curing any manner of disease which
proceeds of the Mother. And this is so experimented, and so put in use, that
many have been healed with this water, that never thought to have recovered
health. And in the withhelding the Monthly course that comes, not to women,
this water makes a marvelous work, by provoking and making it come in them
that wholly do lack it, In stopping the courses of Women.
taking one Cup full of this water in the morning: drinking it ordinarily at
dinner, and at supper, and in the day time being more simple, then that in the
morning, using good regiment, and doing other things which may help the
water, that it may be provoked. And unto them also to whom it doth not come
well, it brings manifest profit, taking the water in form as is aforesaid,
keeping them the time that they take it, from such things as may offend them:
and being used it doth disopilate, and make a good colour in the face, as it
is seen by the experience of them that do use it, having need of it. Let them
beware if they have much heate, or be of a hot complexion, Where as i^ much
heate this water i^ not convenient.
in such case let them moderate the quantity of the wood, and the seething of
the water, as is convenient, and this is easy to be done, by seeing howe it
goes with them at the beginning, with the use of it, and according thereunto
they may rise or fall, as it seems to be necessary.

Some women do use of this water, for to make them with child, To ma^e women
with child.
and in some it hath wrought the effect as it is well known. That which I can
say, is that a gentlewoman, being many years married, without having
children, took this water, for that her husband used it for certain evils
of Opilations, and of an agewe that held h^m, with certain sits of a double
tercian which he had, and he continued with the taking of it in the Morning
hot, and at Dinner simple, and at Supper, and in the day time, keeping a good
government, whereby it came to pass, that she was with child, and brought
forth a son.

And I understand, that one of the principal virtues that this water hath,
Note.
is to drive away the Mother for this effect, for the most part of women that
have no children, is for the great cold that is engendered within the Mother,
which doth hinder the cause of generation, and as the water rises it
consumes it, comforting the place and dissolving the winds, that are the let
of it: I am sure that it will manifestly profit, as we have seen in them
which do not bring forth children, for having too much heate and dries, to
whom permit not the use of this water, for because it will not profit them,
and if they do take it and feel hurt thereof, let them not put the fault in
the water, but in their complexions, seeing that it is not convenient for them.

This water doth make fat.
The use of this water doth make fat, and this is certainly known, for we
have seen many lean and sick, that have taken it, and have healed of their
evils, and have recovered much more flesh, better colour, as those people that
come from the Florida, do praise it very much: they they al say, that the use
of this water doth make fat, and it happens so to many, and not only it
heals them of their diseases, but also makes the remain with a good colour.
And so it seems by the that come from that country, for that they come al
fat, and of a good colour, who I believe as they w^re very sick, so that they
were very lean yellow, when as they were healed of their infirmities which
they had, they gathered flesh, and became of a good colour, ingendering in the
Liver good blood, by the which the members were ^etter maintained, than when
they were sick. And surely it i^ a great thing that this water should work
this effect, co^sidering that it is hot and ^rye, if it were not for the causes
that are above said. And I have seen many that entered i^, to ta^e the water
of the wood, lean, and with an evil colour, to come forth strong and fat,
and of a good colour, eating no ot^er thing then Res^nges, Almondes, and
Biscuit.

In pestilent and contagious diseases, which we have seen* In P^stil^n^ and
corru^ ay^es.
in the time of the Pestilence past, there were many that desired to drink it,
to preserve them from that evil. And we did see that none of them which used
it, were wounded of the disease, that then reigned. Many did use to carry a
piece of ye Root of the Wood with them to smell to it continually, as to a
Pomander. For with the smell so acceptable it did rectify the infected air: I
carried with me a piece a great time, and to my seeming I found great profit
in it. For with it with the chewing of the rind of the Cidron nor of the Lemon
in the morning, and in the day time, to preserve health it ha^h a great
strength and property. And it seems to me, that I was delivered by the help
of God from the fire, in the which we that were Physicians went in, blessed be
our Lord GOD that delivered us from so great evil, and gave us this most
excellent tree called Sassafras, which hath so great virtues, and works such
marvelous effects as we have spoken of, and more which Time will show us,
which is the discoverer of all things. It shall do well to show the
quantity of the wood, and also the quantity of water, wherein it shall be
sodden, to prescribe a rule in weight and measure, in effects, and
temperatures, for them that are hot, and others that are cold.

I will tell you the order that ought to be kept in ta^ing the water of this
excellent wood, How (...) water ought to be ma^ in general.
which must be made conformably to the disease of him that shall take it, and
accordin^ to the quantity and comp^exion of the sick body. For v^to the
Choleric Person the water ought to be given less sodden, and with less
quan^itie of wood, and to the flegmatike more sodden and with more quantity,
of wood. So the diseases should be considered of. U^to them that are very cold
the water ought to be given more sodden and with more quantity of Wood. And
unto them th^t be not so col^e, but do participate of some heate: the water
ought to be given less sodden, with less quantity of wood. The like shall be
done in the hot or cold times, in the age of the person, or the most causes
making to this respect and proportion. And for the more light, I will here set
down the manner how this water ought to be used, the which shall serve to show
how that they may rise or fall therein, coformably to the opinion which shall
seem good to every one. For in these infirmities that be very cold, they must
set up the water in quillates, both in seething and also in quantity of the
wood. And in the diseases that are not so cold, or that do participate of any
heate, they must set the water lower, in Quillats, seething it less, putting
in less wood, the manner and order of the preparing it is this.

You shall choose the freshest wood that may be had, and that which hath a
rynde. The manner to make it in particular.
For that wood which hath not the rind, is not good, nor takes effect, you
must procure that it be of the root, for that is the best of the tree for
these effects and cures, and for the diseases which we have spoken of. And if
in case there be no root, then the bows are the best that grow in the higher
part of the Trees, and in case the bowe^ lack, then is the tree good, if so be
that the one and the other have the rind of the root, let there be taken
less in quantity thereof, more of the bows, much more of the tree, which must
be double to the quantity of the root. Now let us speak of the bows as of
a thing in the midst, between the root and the tree, being that which
continually they do bring, of the which you shall take half an Ounce, and cut
it as small as may be. And it must be put into three Pottelles of water in a
new Earthen pot, The order ho^ to make the strong water.
and there lie a steeping two hours: and after it must be sodden at a fire of
Coals, until the two parts be consumed, and t^e one rem^yne. And after it
is cold, let it be strained and kept in a glassed vessel, The ^im^le wat^r.
and upon those small cuttinges of wood that have been already sodden, let
there be poured other three Pottels of water, and let it sees until half a
Pottell be consumed, and no more, after that it is cold, let it be strained
and kept in a glassed vessel. Let the first water be taken in the morning
fasting, half a Pint hot, and then keep your self warm, and procure sweat,
then change your self into hot clothing, and wipe your self from the sweat.
And eat of a Hen roasted, dry fruit, and Conserua, and drink of the second
water at Dinner and Supper, and in the day time. And then rise and go well
clothed, and fly from all things which may offend you. And at night make a
light Supper, and eat dry fruit and Conserua, but eat no flesh at night,
and drink of the second water. And this you may do for as many days as you
find your self grieved: and if you find your self well with the use of this
water taken in this manner, proceed forward until you be whole, if not, then
continue in taking of the strong water every third day, drink of the simple
water continually. After this order it may be given in all diseases, that we
have treated of, and it will profit. But many will not submit themselves to
this labour, which truly is the best of all others, that which is most
convenient. They may make ^he simple water in this form.

Let there be taken half an ounce of the wood, little more or less, with the
conditions aforesaid, The s^mp^e water.
and let it be made into small pieces, and sees it in three Pottels of water,
until half be sodden away, rather more then less. And of this water you may
drink continually, at Dinner and at Supper, and in the day time, and surely
taken in this order it doth and hath done mauellous works, and most grea^e
Cures, in long diseases, and importunate, taking it and ^eeping a good
gouernem^nt in y^ur Meat and other things prohibited. And howsoever it be,
being drunk so simple, it procures great profit. They that cannot forbear
t^e drinking of wine, may water their wine therewi^h, for it will rather make
it of a better taste and sweetness, for this water hath a most sweet smell,
and taste, and above all, it works marvelous effects, as we have seen and
do see in diverse and sundry diseases, in the which ordinary remedies of
Physic do not profit, with the great examples which we have hereof.

Note.
And it is to be considered, that principally it doth profit in lunge and
cold diseases, and where there is wyndines, other evils, that run this course,
which shall be known forthwith by him that shall have need of it, use it. And
one thing is to be understood, that using it in the order as is aforesaid,
although that he which takes it have no need thereof, it can do him no
hurt, but rather if it be well considered, it will manifestly profit him in
the time that he shall take it, yea, although he leave the taking of it when he
sees that he finds not the profit which he desires, nor that it hath done
him any hurt or harm during the time that he hath taken it.

CARLO SANCTO Of the Carlo Sancto, a root brought from the new Spain.
THey bring from the new Spain within this three years a mauellous root of
great virtues, The root of Carlo Sancto.
which is called Carlo Sancto, the which a father of S. Francis order
discou^red and published in the province of Mechoacan, being taught by an
Indian of that country that was very wise in such things, and a man of
great ^xperience, in the virtues of them. In the fir^te part we have
decla^ed that there be many Medicinadle H^ar^es, which have great secretes,
and virtues. Where it gro^eth*
This ^ur Carlo Sancto grows in that Province, in places which are v^rie
t^mperate, which ^e not dry nor ver^ moist. The form and figure thereo^ is
like to our wild Hop^ of Spain, The ^rme ^.
for it c^rrieth a Lease as they do, and it r^nn^th up by any ot^er t^ing that
is near unto it, and if it have nothing to lea^e v^to, then it c^eepeth all
along upon the ground: the colo^r is a sad gr^ene, it car^ieth neither
flow^e nor fru^t, the smell that it hath is little, The col^r. The sm^.
and acceptable to some. Out of the Root s^ri^geth a gross tree, and it
casts forth other Roots of the greatness of a finger: it is white in
colour, The ro^te.
and hath a Rind which falls from the inner part, the heart of it is
marvelously wrought: for it is compounded of certain small boards very
thin, The heart is marue^us.
and they may be divided by one and one, the root hath a pleasant smell, and
being chewed, it hath a notable bitterness, wi^h some sharpness of taste: T^e
virtue is in the rin^e of the r^ote.
this root hath his virtue in the Rind.

In the ships that he now come, there c^me the satin: p^e of it, and now there
is more knowledge of the virtues t^erof then before there was. Many of them
that came in this flee^e from the new Spain, do speak much good of this
root. But he that speaks most of it, is a Gentleman that came from
Mechoacan, brought a good quantity of it with him. That as he reports, also
what we have experimented of it, we will speak of, and also of the complexion
and tempera^ure thereof, which is hot, dry, in the first part of the second
degree.

^.
The principal effect that this Root doth profit in, is in ^mes and runninges
of the head, for it causes them to flo^e out of the mouth, and ^ringeth them
from the head, ^y (...) a little of the Rind of the Root, a good time, but it
(...) be t^ken in t^e mor^ing fasting, it boydeth out much (...), ^ h^mors from
ye head, that would go to the stoma^e, (...) othe^ parts, but before this be
done, it is convenient, that ^ be purged. ^.


(...) ^hat chew it, w^ich can eas^ly vomit, do vomit with chewing of it, it
causes them to cast out much Choler and fleume, and much more it makes them
vomit, if they take the decoction of it, for it makes the humour to come up,
which is in the stomach with much easiness. The roo^e comfort the stomach,
and also the gummes by chewing of it, and it fortifies the teeth, It
comfort the teeth, (...), keep them from worm eating.

In diseases of women it provokes Purgation. It dissolveth winds and
comfort the stomach,


and doth preserve them from woormes, and that they rot not, nor corrupt. It
makes a good smell in the mouth, and because it is bitter, it is convenient
after that you have chewed it, that you wash your mouth with wine, that the
bitterness may be taken away.

In the infirmities of women chiefly, where opilations are, and lack of
purgation, the powder of the rynde of the Root doth dissolve them, and takes
them away, and makes their purgation to come down well with the use thereof.
It must be taken with wine, or with water, sodden with Coriander, and Cinnamon,
which they must drink, whiles they do take it: it dissolveth winds, and
comfort the stomach, whiles they use it, they must annoynt their Belly with
the oil of Liquid Amber, and Dialtea of equal parts, and first they must
be purged, and take heed that they keep all good order, and good government.

In the evils of the heart, In the evil of the heart.
chiefly being joined with the Mother, the said pouders and the water sodden
with the rynde of the Root, do work very great effects. They must take
the powder in the order as is aforesaid: and the weight of twelve pence of the
root, cut small and sodden in one Pottell and a half of water, until half
be sodden away: and then they must cast into it the weight of two shillings
of the ryndes of Cidrous being ^rie, and the weight of twelve pence of Cinamom
made in powder, and give it certain seethinges with them, and then strain it:
and they must take every morning a small vess^l of six Ounces of this seething
with Sugar, because it is somewhat what bitter, or without it as you please:
and it is to be noted, that before you begin to use it, you must make the
universal euacuations, which shall be convenient.

This Gentleman says which brought this Root, t^at it profits much, in
the disease of the Pox, In the evil of ^e Pox.
taking it in Powder, or the seething of it: which I have not experimented, for
that we have so many remedies for this evil, that we have made no experience
thereof: he saith that it is to be taken without keeping, more, then when they
be taking the water, or powder, and that then they keep good order and good
government in their meates, and in all other things.

In the falling sickness, a strong disease, and well near incurable, they say
that it hath a great property, and works great effects: In the falling
sickness.
taking the powder of the rind of the root, with wine or with water, as is
most convenient for him that shall take it. I counselled one here, who was
more then forty years of age, and had had it of long time, to take it, and
hitherto he hath not felt more then to vomit with the powder, when he takes
it, and he casts up much Choler, and his faintness is not so great as it was
wont to be. It seems to me, that it cannot take it away. For it should work
that effect in them, that do not pass twenty and five years, who unto that
time have remedy. I will prove it upon such: it would be no little good, that
it might work the effect that is spoken of it.

In griefs of the Head, they use this root in those parts, In griefs of the
head.
as a great and sure remedy. I will tell what hath passed. The first time that
I saw this root, was in the power of one which was sick, who came from
Mexico, and he brought it for a great thing, saying: that he healed there with
and took away the pains of the head, which he had certain days, and he
asked me if that he should use it. I tasted of the root, and it seemed to me
as I have said, and I counselled him that he shoul^ use it, as they had willed
him to do in Mexico, and so he did chew it in the morning, and it took away
the pains of the head, which a long time had molested him.

After this, a passenger told me, which came in the Ship, where the
Gentleman was that brought a quantity of this root, and he chewed it well, did
disfleume therewith, and immediately it took away the payne, he showed me a
little that remained thereof, which was the same that I saw, and since that,
some have used it, and it hath done very well with them.

In the toothache, they that have brought it into Spain do much esteem of it.
In the toothache.
And being in the lodging where this man was which brought the root, the host
of the house certified me, that having the toothache very grievous, it took it
away from him with chewing the rind of the root, on the same side where the
tooth was which grieved him, disfleming therewith as much as he could. And I
being one day in the Custom house curing a Genoues which was there, an other
of the same Nation complained unto me of the toothache, and we caused to be
brought some of the said Root, and in the presence of as many as were there,
he chewed the rind of this root, having very great pains, and he avoided
much Fleume, and in disfleming it began to take away the pains, and before he
went from thence he was thoroughly cured. Certain days past I had a grief in
one tooth, so that it pained me all one Night, and part of one day, and I
gathered in a garden which I have in my house, c^rtaine leaves of Tabaco, and
also the aforesaid root, and I chewed both together, and disfleumed, and the
pains went from me, and returned no more to me, being more then six months
after I was pained therewith. This is the effect, that I have obtained of this
Carlo Sancto, which being so little time known, is sufficient. The time will
discover the rest, and as we shall understand more of it, so so we will give
notice thereof.

Of Beads, which be called the Beads of Saint Elen.


The Beads of the roots of saint Elen.
FRom the Florida they bring certain round Roots which are called the Beads
of Saint Elen. And they take this name by reason that they grow in a place of
that Country that is so called: they are great large Roots, divided into
several pieces, The form of them.
and cuttinges, every piece by it self, they remain round as Beads, which
being bored in the midst, they make of them Beads for to pray upon, which the
Soldiers do hang about their necks, for a thing of great estimation. They dry
them, and they are as ha^de as a bone, on the outward part they are black,
and within white, and the Rind is joined in such sort, that the heart and it
is made alone, they are wrought after they be dry, and this Root being
tasted, hath a sweet smell, with a good taste. And it seems by the taste that
it is a kind of Spyce, for it i^ like to Galanga, they are of the thickenesse
of a mans thombe, somewhat less, the Plant hath a great stalk: the Bows do
spread by the ground, The ^lant.
and cast out the leaves broad and great, and very green. It grows
commonly in moist places, the complexion thereof is hot in the end of the
second degree, and more dry the^ in th^ ^ir^t, th^ ver^ues thereof are these.

The Indians use t^e herb beaten between t^o st^nes ^hen they pretend to
wash themselves, ^
^ubbing ^l their body with it: for they say that i^ knit^eth their fl^h
t^g^t^er, and comfort them with his good smell. And this they do for the
most part every day, for the great profit that they f^nde in it.

In griefs of the Stomach, the Indians do use it, In griefe^ of the ^ma^ke.
by taking the Powder of it, and our Spania^ds also take it, for the same
purpose, receiving it in wine, being ground small, of the which I have seen
notable experience in some.

In the grief of the Stone of the Ridneis or Reins, the Powder of this Root
works a known effect. In the ^rief^ of the ^tone in t^e (...) or ^eines.
For that some have taken this root made into Powder in wine, having the
grief, and it hath taken it away. And I marvel not at al that his manifest
quatitie is sufficient, to work the like effects.

In griefs of the Uryne of them that cannot peace well, In griefs of the V^i^.
by taking the Powder, it doth profit, and expel it. A thing used of many that
have come from those parts, for that they have proved it in the like evils,
and here hath bin seen the same experience. And one that had a stone which h^e
could not avoid from him, used certain days the powder of this root, and
did easily avoid the same. A ^uldier brought Beads at his Neck, made of
these roots, and m^t with me^ one day, and asked me if I knew tho^e Beads,
and of what they were made, he said it was told him that they w^re ^oote^ of
Gentiana. But I declared v^to him, that the ^des ^ere made of certain roots,
that ^ of ^aint Elen, that they were not made of Gentiana* a^d then he told me
great virtues of them, ^ t^e (...) v^r^ rare that the use of the had wroug^t
^hi^h I did believe: for it seem^th well, in the root that they ha^e great
Medicinal virtues, according to their fashion, and sweet smell, and by that
which I had experimented of them.

Of the Guacatane.


THey have brought in these Ships ^n herb from the new Spain that the
Indians cal Guacatane, The description of the Guacatane.
and it is like to our wild time, saving that it hath no smell, it is a little
herb, whitish, I know not whether it carry Flower or fruit, the herb I
have without the root: the name that it hath amongst the Indians, is as
aforesaid, and the same name the Spaniardes also have given it. The Indians do
use it for their infirmities whereof we will speak, and for the same the
Spaniards do use it likewise there in the Indies, and they also which have
brought it hither, with notable profit.

In the disease of the Piles.
In grief of the Piles they use it in this manner: they grind or stamp the
herb very small, and wash the Piles with wine, in the which there is sodden
this herb, and if there be heate in them, they sees it in water, with that
hot seething they wash them, and then they dry them softly, and cast the Powder
of this herb upon them, surely the effect that it works is marvelous. Thus
after I saw the good efects thereof, I much esteemed the herb.

Whenever you have any grief of cold or of windines in any part of the
body wheresoever it be, In griefs of cold and windines.
apply Turpentine unto all parts, wheresoever the grief is, and cast the
powder of this herb being small ground upon it, and lay a Linen cloth upon
that, that it may cleave fast as a Plaster, in such sort, that it be not
taken away, until the grief be gone. And of this there is manifest
experience, by them of the Indies, and also by us of Spain. The powder of this
herb cast upon little sores, and especially in the secret places doth
mundifie, and heal them.

Of a certain kind of Barley.


THey bring likewise from the new Spain, a kind of Barley, which they cal
small Barley: they give it this name, for the likeness which it hath unto our
Barley: for it casts out an ear like unto it, and in the veins, the seed
is shut, but it is different from it in qualities virtues: for that this small
Barley, is the strongest poison, It is most strong and mighty poison.
which at this day in herb, or plant hath been seen, insomuch that it
works the same effect, which Sublimatum doth. And wheresoever it is needful
to burn, or eat away dead or rotten flesh, putting the powder of this seed
thereto, it will do the like work that any burning Iron shall do. It
extinguishes and kills any canker, howe strong soever it be, it kills and
expels Worms, It kills th^ Canker. It kills worms.
wheresoever they be, it eats flesh which is nought and rotten, taking it
from the sores, and making them clean from such evil flesh.

The Indians for that they had no Sublimatum, nor other remedies which we
have, It eats rotten fl^sh.
when they should use the like, they had and have this seed most strong, and
surely so it is, and they do use it, as a remedy most strong, and of great
efficacy. This powder must be laid too, by little and little, more or less,
Howe it must be ministered.
conformably to the greatness of the evil, applying things defensive, which is
used to be laid too, when as the like remedies are used.

In old sores and filthy, where it is needful, In old filthy sores where it
is needful that they be cleansed.
that naughty rotten flesh be eaten away, with taking of this Seed, and
grinding it, and dissolving it well with water of Planten, or of Roses, weating
in the clear water that shall remain upon it, some small clothes, or in
place of the small clothes, lint of fine Linen cloth, weate in the water, it
cleanses the sore, eating the evil flesh in such sort: for howe evil, old,
and filthy soever that the sore be, it leaves it clean, and being laid to
the flesh, it doth soder and heal them, and after this is done, you must use
the Medicines which have virtue to engender flesh. And the effect of this seed
is no more then to mundifie, make clean, and to take away the superfluity of
the wound.

The self same effect that this seed works in us, it works in beasts
also, In Beasts it works the same effect, and better.
which for the most part have very evil sores, that be cankered, and full of
Worms, the seed being laid unto them, if the cause be so great, that it
doth require it: or the water of it, as it is said, makes the like work, as
we have spoken of, and better, using always the defensiues as is convenient,
where such Medicines be applied, for that it is a Medicine most strong, and it
hath need of them all.

I will show you what happened to me with it. An Indian brought me this seed
with many other herbs, History.
and going about to discover them and being come to this seed, I took a
grain and put it into my mouth, to prove it. He that brought it, as one which
knew it well, kept back my hand, would not suffer me to prove it: for all that I
parted with my teeth one grain, which is no greater then one grain of hemp
seed, but some deal lesser, and bears some likeness of it: at the time that
it came to the point of the tongue, the seed being parted, made me a blister
upon it, which dured with me certain days: I commended it to the Devil, and
then I believed what they had certified me of it. I began to make experience of
it, and it wrought more effectually then was spoken of it. It is hot in the
fourth degree, and more if there be any more degrees.

An herb which heals the evil o^ the breast. An herb which makes a woman
to cast from her a dead child. Two maru^llous herbs.
Also I have an Herb which being sod, and the water of it taken hot, heals
the evils of the breast: I know not the name of it, but in the remembrance of
them which came, it was written.

And an other which enforces to cast out the dead child of the belly: of thi^
the Indians have great experience for this effect, and once in these countries,
it hath profited.

They brought me two dry herbs, which I would have been glad to have seen
green: the one of these being in the field in all his force, if a man or woman
do put their hands upon him, forthwith he falls down dead upon the ground.
And the other lying abroad upon the ground, in touching it to gather it, it
shutteth it self together as a Cabagge of the Country of Murcia, Things
marvelous, and of much consideration.

I have black Eleboro, brought from the Province of Mechoacan, like to that of
Spain, Black Eleboro.
and working the like effect.

Certain days past, a young man which took counsel of me, that came from
the Prouice of Quito, History.
and being with me, there came unto me a neighbour of mine, saying, that his
daughter was very sick of the Flixe, and I had her in cure, and her disease
increased with blood, requesting me that I should go to visit her. The
Indian which was with me, asked me if they were stools of blood, I said yea:
and he said unto me that he would give her a thing, that being made into
powder and taken, would take them away forthwith, that in the Province of
Quito, it had been experimented many times. The Father of the sick maiden,
went with him to his house, and he gave him certain pieces of a fruit, which
seemed to be of a great tree: of the one part they were very smooth, and of
colour yeallowe, and of the other they were very sharpe and very red,
insomuch that they seemed of a purple colour. They were ground small, and he
gave the powder to the sick woman, with the water of the head of Roses, once
that Evening, an other time in the Morning, and immediately the Flixe did cease,
from tha^ time waxed better, whereby she came to be whole.

And as for the man I never saw him, after he gave it to her*

To the right Worshipful, Master Doctor Monardus, Physician in Seuill.
RIght worshipful famous Doctor, it will seem a new thing to your worship,
that I being not learned, not of your profession, do write to you in things of
your faculty, being a Soldier that have followed the wars in these Countries
al my life: I have done this, because I am affectioned to your worship, by
reason of a book which you have compiled of the medicines which are in these
parts, of the virtues benefits, that by the have bin received, which are so
great that I cannot declare the, as they deserve. And by means of your book we
have order how we should use the remedies which we have here, for before we did
use the without rule or measure, so that neither they did work effect, nor with
them the people were well remedied, which now is to the contrary, by means of
your books, there hath been people remedied, that never thought to have had
remedy nor health. It is more then 28. years unto this day, that I have gone
watering by al these Indies, where are many things of those, which your worship
doth write of in your book, other things also which have not bin brought
thither, for because the Physicians that come to these parts, are nothing
curious. They apply not their eye to the universal wealth, but to their own
particular, for they come only to enrich themselves, for the most part they be
ignorant people which pass to those Indies, they do not esteem of the good
which they might do. And though that I have no learning, I am affectioned to
men of learning, so I am to your worship, for that I understood of your books,
and for the same that you have in these parts, which is great, although I
know you not, yet I was willing to take these pains, which is a contentment
to m^* You write in your book, giving knowledge of the Bezaar stone, set down
the signs of the beasts which have the: which being considered, we have
happened upon a kind of beasts that live in the moutaines of this country,
which are much like to sheep or kids which your woorship speaks of, which
are in the Indies of Portugal, which breed have these stones, of the which
there are many in this country, in the mountains, cold countries. They are
for the most of a dark red colour, they are fed with healthful herbs, whereof
is great plenty in the mountains, where these beasts do feed they be very
swift, insomuch that they cannot be hunted, but with the hand Gun: they have
no horns, and in that only they do differ from them of the East India, for
in all the rest they are the same.

The 15. day of June in this year of 1568. How they have found the Bezaar
stones.
I certain gentlemen my friends went to the mountains, to hut, we were a
hunting five days, and we killed some of those beasts, which I have spoken of.
And as we went for this purpose, thinking that they were of the kind, of the of
the East India: we carried your book with us, we opened one of them, the
greatest that we hunted, and oldest we cold find, we found no stones in his
belly, nor in any other part of him, nor any other thing, whereby we bel^eued
that they were not the same kind of beasts with those of the East India. And we
asked of certain Indians that went to serve us, where these beasts had their
stones, as they are our enemies, would not that we should know their secrets,
they answered us that they knew nothing of these stones, until one boy which
was amongst them being an Indian of the age of 12. years, seeing, that we were
so desirous to know the same, showed us the secrete of the (...) have bin used
since that hunting, that I have spoken of, which were the first that have bin
discovered in the world for the use to heal diseases: we do trust that with
them will be done marvelous works, according as they have begun to do the.
all this is owing to your worship, seeing that by your book we had knowledge to
seek them, to discover them, to take them out of these beasts, which had them
so hidden within them, that surely there is much owing to your worship, for
discovering unto us so great a treasure, as this is, which is the greatest that
hath bin found in these parts, whereby our nation is much bound to you, likewise
al the world, because al men shall profit by the, the rest of the secrets which
you have set down in your book, which brings unto us great profit. And in
recompense of the benefit which I have received, I send here to your woorship a
dozen of stones, by the return of Iohn Anthony Corso, the rich Merchant, which
if they come thither, your worship may make experience of them, in many
infirmities, for you shall find great effects in them. By the same return also
your worship may advise me of them, any thing that shall please you to command
me, I will do it, as one that is most affectioned to you, because you are
curious and learned, for doing so much good to the world, in those things
which you have written published. Heerewithall I send you a small Chest, in the
which come certain Frisoles, which you may command to be sown in the
beginning of Marche, that the cold do not hurt them, which send forth a
plant like unto beans, but somewhat less, which have certain veins where
the seed is. Half a dozen of them eaten with salt, being of the taste of green
beans, they purge valiantly, evacuate the water of him which hath the dropsy,
without pains. The self same effect it works if that they be dry, making
the into powder, taking the with wine it is needful that meat be made in a
redines: for if they work to much, by taking more then they should be, with
eating any thing incontinent, the work will cease.

Also I send you an herb, An herb for the Reumes.
which grows in these plain countries, clounge to the ground like unto
grass, which is of great virtues for many infirmities, chiefly for them which
are grieved with Reumes and Fleumes in the throat, taking them away easily
with great benefit, and in this, griefs of the head Reumes chewing it, they
do dissleume very much: they call this herb after my name, because I use it
for the like evils, for that an Indian did teach it me, which knew much of the
virtue of herbs.

Also I send your worship a fruit of a tree which is of great profit, A fruit
of a tree of gr^at vertu^s.
these trees be not found in any country but in this they are of the
greatness of an Oak, of those in Spain: it hath many virtues, for the rind,
being made in powder, and cast into any sore which is needful to be made
clean, it makes it clean, afterward causes the flesh to grow, heals it.
And rubbing the teeth with this powder, it makes the clean very well, being
laid upon the gummes, if the flesh be taken away, it doth incarnate them, if
the teeth be loose, it makes the fast. Seething the leaves of this tree well
in water, washing with the water thereof any manner of swelling, which hath any
sore, or that is thereof cankered, it takes away the swelling, and impostume.
And making some small linen clothes weate in this seething, laying them warm
upon the medicine, which is laid upon the sore, or upon the powder that is
made of the rind: it makes the sores to heal more quickly, causing that
there come no humour to them. Out of the said tree comes a Rosine, which is
of sweet smell, and serves to perfume in many diseases of the head, to make
plasters for many e^ils, and here I send it to your worship. Of the fruit
the Indians make a certain drink, which is for them very health^ul. Your
worship may command them to b^e sown, for I would be glad that they should
grow, for it will be a thing of much delight, for the profit that it brings
in Physic, and for the novelty of the tree, for at al times it hath a very
good smell. I brought into this country a black woman, which I bought in Xerez
de la Frontera, and there did appear upon her when we came hither certain old
sores in her legs, which were of long continuance, and coming to the Land of
the Margareta, and being very sorowefull for the sores which my black woman
had, an Indian told me that he would heal her, and seeing that she had no
other remedy, I delivered her to the custody of the Indian, that he might
heal her for me, and immediately he toke a fruit, which is common in that
country, and al people ingeneral do eat it, which is of the greatness of an
Orange, it hath a stone like unto a Peach. This stone the India did burn, and
made it into powder, for the stone is hard, can not be ground, without burning
of it: and he cast the powder of it into the sores, which she had full of much
rotten flesh, and very filthy, which with the powder were made clean and very
well, and it took out al the rotten flesh to the bone, and after it was
clean, with lint and a little powder laid too it, they began to be filled with
new flesh, until they were full of flesh, and she was healed very well. And it
is to be considered, that the little kernel of the stone hath so much venom,
malice in it, that if any person or beast do eat it, he dies forthwith
without remedy, as though he had eaten any manner of venom cursive, as
Sublimatum, or any other Poison.

In the Town of Posco where I dwelt certain years, there was an Indian, A
cure with the sweat of blood.
which did cure the Indians and the Spaniards of any manner of grief or disease
that they had, with anointing their Iointes and the parts which did grieve
them, with the juice of a certain herb, forthwith he wrapped the in many
clothes, they did s^eate at the joints pure blood. And also in the sick part
where he did lay the juice, and as they went sweating he made clean the blood
with a Linen cloth, until he perceived that they had sweat sufficiently, with
this he healed many diseases that were incurable. And I am able to say, that
many did think that they had waxed young again, and were more strong and young
than they were before. He fell sick, for al that we could do with gifts and
fair words, and fierce words, and threatenings, he would never tel us what
herb it was, nor show it to any man in this country. There is found a kind
of tree, that is of soft Timb^r, the Indians will make no fire of it, although
you kill them. For that they say, if any of them come near to the fire that is
made of this tree, or receive the smoke of it, he remains impotent, for
women. And they have this so certain in persuasion, and it is so verified, that
you shall not make them to come near the fire, that is made of that tree, for
any thing in the world, for they are so carnal that they will none of this.

They heal in these countries any swellings which are in thee feet or legs,
caused of cold humours, Centella, an herb good for the swelling of the feet
or leg^.
with an herb called Centella, which being stamped and laid to the swelling,
there arise certain Blisters, by the which there comes forth great quatitie
of water humours, until it leave th^ Foot, or the leg dry. I have seen great
experience by these euacuations, amongst the Indians, for they use them much,
I have seen some Spaniards use it, and were healed of th^ like diseases.

In the year 1568. in the Province of Chile, they did cut of fro certain
Indians being prisoners, the calves of their legs, to eat them, they roasted
them for that purpose, that which is of more admiration, they applied unto the
place where they were cut, leaves of certain herbs, there came not out a drop
of blood, and many did see it. And this was done in the City of S. Iames, in
the presence of the Lord Don Garcia de Mendosa, which was a thing that made al
men marvel at it.

There are to be found here very few herbs and trees like unto those of
Spain, for that the earth doth not bear them: but in the new Spain there
are more of them than in any other part of the Indies. For when it was
conquered, they found many trees and herbs and Plants like unto those of
Castile, and birds and beasts likewise. We ha^e here snakes which bring
admiration to such as see the, for they be as great as men, which are for the
most part tame, do no hurt. Here are Spyders as great as Oranges, very
venomous. It rains Toads as great as those of Spain, which the Indians do
eat roasted, for they are a people which eat al kind of venomous beasts.
There be so many buytres, which breed in many Ilandes, that are in the sea,
near to the land, that they eat up the Cattle, and such numbers of them that
it is wonderful, and as the keepers of them be black so they care little for
them. One thing doth make me marvel, that the kine which are bread in the
moutaines, being brought to the plain ground, do al dye. I saw a friend of
mine that brought 300. Kine to be weayed, they staid a time before they were
weighed, and by little little, in one month there remained not one, but al died.
And that which is more to be marvelled at, is, that they died al trembling,
and consumed. Some there be that do attribute it to the mountains which is a
country most cold, and it rains every day, and in the plain country where
there is no rain, but it is hot, and as they move from one extremity to an
other they dye, that truly is a thing worthy of consideration, to see howe
that in the space of eight Leages, little more or less, which are of plain
ground from the coast to the mountain, by a long vale of more then one
thousand Leages, it never rains in them, and in the mountains it raynes
every day.

Your worship shall understand, that the eight day of October in this year,
there came hither a Cousin of mine, called Alonso Garcia, a good Soldier,
Against the he^rbe whic^ the Indian^ do use.
who tell^th us that he hath found an herb which is good against the venomous
herb, which the wild people do v^e. Which herb doth kill without remedy,
and these valiant people of the Indies do use it in their wars. And likewyse
those that dw^l from the Charcas towards Chile, and live like unto wild
people, maintaining themselves only by hunting, and flesh of mankind, who
have killed with their arrows which are poisoned with these venomous herbs,
an infinite number of Spaniardes* which they say be not good to eat, for that
their flesh is hard, so that when they kill them, they keep them to wax tender,
three days or four days. But with this herb that is now found, the hurt
shall be much remedied, that they do make. Howbeit our people do not much
fear them, but only the herb which they shoot withal, for that it makes
them to dye by madness, without any remedy. And now with the recoutering
herb which they have found, they are al gladned. They say it is an herb
that carries very broad leaves, which are like to the leaves of Planten of
Spain: which being beaten laid to the wound that is poisoned, kill the venom,
and immediately take away the accidents, which the venom of the herb
procures. They take it for a great matter in that country, that they have
found such a remedy. And you shall understand that the couter herb was found
in the same country, where the herb of poison was: I think it be also in
other parts, but there where the hurt is done, our Lords will was to discover
the r^medy.

I note unto your worship these things, to the ^nde by them ye may consider,
howe many more herbs* and plante^ of great virtues like to those, this our
Indies have, which we have not yet attained v^to, for as the Indians are a
naughty kind of p^ople, and our enemi^s* so (...) and being tasted and used
between the teeth they are pure Earth. The stone hath neither savour nor taste,
rather it doth cool then heate, and they be ordinarily as great as beans, or
bigger. For the most part there are both great and little of them, and it
seems well by them that they have medicinal virtues: many persons bring them,
which are now come in this Fleet, who come to me as though I were the first
discoverer of them. They declare marvelous effects of the, that i^ seems
wonderful. I brake one and gave it made into powder, to a boy, of whom it was
said that venom had been given to him. I cannot tel whether any other
benefits done unto him, or that healed him, but he was well recovered. I will
use it in other infirmities, and what I find of their operation, and the rest
of the medicines, which shall be newly discovered, I will show in the third
volume, which I will write of this Medicinal history, wherein shall be
expressed things marvelous, and great secretes of Physic, that may give
contentation to al men, and much more to the sick, that shall be healed with
them. Of one thing you must be advertised, that which is here written, part
of it we have learned of them that have come from those parts, and brought
knowledge of them hither: and part is attributed to their complexion, and
qualities, what they may do: and part we have experimented: and in all have
this consideration, that al these things which are brought from our Indies, be
for the most part hot, and see that you use them in this quality, in all
causes wherein they shall be needful. And it is needful that there be some
advertisement given hereof, since the use of the things doth so import it.

Of the Dragon.

laid upon the belly, or given in glisters, or taken by the mouth. Made into
powder, it stays the running of the head, and to the lower parts applied, in
any manner of flux of blood, it doth retain and slanch it. It sodereth and
gleweth wounds together, which be fresh and new made. It lets that the
teeth fall not out, and it makes the flesh to grow on the bare gummes. It is a
marvelous colour for Painters. And besides this, it hath many other virtues. I
do mean to sow some of the seed, to see if it will grow in these parts. It is
temper^te.
It is thought that the blood of Drago is temperate, with little heate.

There was a gum given unto me which they bring from the firm land of the
Peru, Gum to purge them which have the Gout.
wherewith they purge them, which have the Gout in those parts, they put of
it as much as a Nut into distil^ed water, and let it stand all the night in
steep, and in the morning they strain and wring it, and take that water,
which must be the quantity of two Ounces: and the patient must remain without
meat, till the midst of the day, and therewith they purge the humour, which
causes the Gout. I saw a Gentleman who came in this last Fleet, use it,
which he brought for remedy of this evil, who was full of the Gout, and
with using this evacuation, he finds himself well, and the Gout doth not
come to him, as it was wont to do, for that it came to him very cruelly, and
often: and he gave me as much as a small Nut, and would give me no more,
and I gave it in the order aforesaid, to one which had the Gout, and he had
three stools with it. I know not how it will prove, it were needful to have
more quantity, for to proceed foreward, in more experience thereof: but it
will be brought hither by others, as they have done many other things. It
hath a go^d taste in the taking, for that it hath neither smell nor savour, it
makes his work without pains. It is hot in my opinion, in the first degree.
I know not what manner of thing the Tree is, wherout they take it, for he
which brought it, knows not so much himself.

Of the Armadilio.


THis beasts portraiture I took out of an other naturally made, which was in
the Counting house of Gonsalo de Molina, a Gentleman of this City, in the
which there is great quantity of Books of diverse Authors, and the fashion
and form of many kinds of Beasts, and Birds, and other curious things,
brought from the Oriental Indies, as also from the Occidental, and from other
parts of the world. And great variety of coins and stones of antiquity, and
differences of arms, which with great curiosity, and with a noble mind, he
hath caused to be brought thither.

of the stone in the Kidneies.
they are al somewhat heavy. Of these stones they have in the Indies great
^xperience: giving them made into powder, unto those that suffer the grief of
the stone in the Kydneies, and to them that cannot peace, and to them that
cannot cast out the stone of the Reins, and of the Bladder, being of such
greatness that it may not pass out. This is a thing amongst the Indians very
common, and well known: and likewise amongst the Spaniardes, which dwell in
those parts and they which come hither aver it plainly, and affirm it to be
so. I have tasted it, and it seems a thing unsavoury, but I have not proved
it, nor applied hitherto, in time it shall be done, we will give some reason
thereof.

They bring also from the new Kingdom and from the province of Cartagena,
Turpentine of Cartagena.

Better then ours.


a certain Turpetine, very clear, of sweet smell, much better then that they
call de Vetae, which they bring from Venice: it hath all the virtues that the
good Turpentine hath, it works the selfsame effects, better, and with
greater efficacy and readiness.

Here hath been used of it in wounds, and it is a thing marvelous to see the
good work which it doth, especially in wounds of joints and Sinews,

Moreover they bring from the selfsame parts Caranna, of Cartagena, Caranna of
Cartagena.
purified so clear that it is like to Crystal, and surely it is better, it is
applied unto much better effect then that which hithervnto hath come, and
makes better works, and is of a more sweet smell, and more excellent in
operation.

Of the Flower of Mechoacan.


MAny persons of them which came now in this last Fleate from the firm land,
Mechoacan of the firm Land^.
brought very good Mechoacan, better then that of the new Spain, gathered in
the Coast of Nicaraga, and in Quito: yea, since the Mechoacan was discovered,
in the new Spain, they have found the selfsame herb and root in those
parts which I do speak of. And they use it to purge, and it doth marvelous
works, and they use it in those countries and in al the firm land, as they did
use that which was brought from the new Spain, with marvelous success.

From the Cape of Saint Elen, Furious Mechoacan.
which is in the same coast, they bring another kind of Mechoacan, but it is
very strong, and being taken it causes great accidents of vomits and
faintness, with many stools, and for this cause they cal it Escamonea, no man
uses it, because it brings (...) by incision, which comes forth like to a
white tear or drop, most clear, with a marvelous sweet smell, declaring well
the marvelous effects, and Medicinal virtues that it hath, of the which we
have treated in the first part. And that Balsamo which is made by seething, as
we do there show, we see the marvelous effects that it works, with so
great and marvelous virtues, that it brings admiration to the whole world,
with many other marvels which hetherunto we have seen, that be there spoken
of. And greater will these works be, that shall be done with the Balsamo
which they now bring, made by incision: seeing that one drop of this is more
worth then two Gallons of the other, as it is manifestly seen by using of
it.

The Balsamo of the Indies which is made by incision, is better then that which
was in Aegipt.
And surely that which was in Egypt, and failed so many members of years past,
I believe that it had not more virtues then this. And I am sure that this is of
greater virtue and effects then ever that was of. I have the fruit of this
tree, which is little, according to the greatness of the tree, and it is a
grain as great as a white Peas, the taste of it is a little bitter, it is
shut into the end of a little ^od of the length of a finger, being narrow,
white, and thin, of the thickness of vi. d. It carries no more but one
grain in the end, which is the fruit that the Indians do use, to perfume
them withal, in griefs of the head, and in Reumes. Surely the Balsamo is a
marvelous thing, and it shows well in it self what it is, In griefs of the
head.
according to the works thereof.

They bring moreover from the firm land a Turpetine, or Licor, Turpentine or
O^le of Deabeto.
which is called Deabeto, and it is gathered from certain trees of mixture,
they be not Pine trees, nor Cypress, for they be higher then our Pine trees,
they are as straight as Cipresses trees. In the highest part of the tree, it
brings forth certain bladders of two sorts, the which are great and small,
and being broken, there comes forth of them a marvelous liquor, which
falls drop after drop, and the Indians gather them with great deliberation,
and they receive the same drops which be in the bladder into a shell, and
always have shells lying under the bladders, whereou^ they distill, and it is
a thing done with such leisure, that many Indians do gather very little al the
whole day.

The Licor serves for all things that the Balsamo doth, The virtue thereof.
it heals very well wounds, it takes away cold griefs, and windy. Some
do take it for the griefs of the stomach, caused of cold humours, or for
windines, with a little white wine. And it is to be understood, that the
Balsamo which is made by seething, or that which is made by incision, Note.
and this or any other manner of Liquor of these of the Indies, which is to be
taken by the mouth, ought to be taken but in little quantity, which must not
be more then four or five drops, and it must not be taken in the Palm of
the hand as it is said, but putting a little wine or Rose water into a spoon,
and pouring upon that the drops of Balsamo, putting the spoon well into your
mouth, and letting the Licor fall in, so that it touch not the tongue. For taken
with it, or touching it, the savour and taste is not removed away in a long
time: it procures an euell taste, in such sort, that for this only cause many
do abhor it, and will not take it, and from others it hath taken away the
lust of their meat, by receiving it and touching it with the tongue.

Of long Pepper.


Long Pepper.
ALso they bring from Cartagena, and from the coast of the firm land, from
Nata near to Veraga, a certain kind of Pepper, which they cal long Pepper,
which hath a sharper taste, then the Pepper which is brought from the Oriental
Indies, and bites more then it, and is of more sweet taste, and of better
smell, then that of Asia, or the Pepper of the East India: it is a gentle spyce,
to dress meates withal, and for this purpose al the people in that country
do use it.

History.
A Gentleman gave me a platter full of it, for he brought a great quantity of
it for the service of his Ritchin, because they use it in place of black
Pepper, and they take it to be of a better taste, and more healthful. I have
tasted it, and it bites more then the black Pepper doth, and it hath a more
sweet taste then it hath. I have caused it to be put into dressed meates, in
place of the Oriental Pepper, it gives a more gentle taste unto the meates that
are dressed therewith.

It is a fruit that casts out a high plant, of the greatness of a gross
Packethreed, The description of it.
and the lower part near to the root, is as great as a little stick, that is
very small: and upon it are joined the little grains, very near together, as
though they were wrested one within the other, which causes the greatness
whereof we spake: and being taken away from the little stick, the stick
remains bare and whole: and it is green being fresh, but the Sun ripens
it, and doth turn it black, and so they bring it into these parts. It
grows in the coast of the firm land in Nata and in Cartagena, and in the
new kingdom: in all these parts they use it, as I have said. It hath the
Medicinal virtues, which the Oriental Pepper hath that we use. The complexion
thereof is hot in the third degree.

And going to visit a child, the son of this Gentleman, History.
which gave me this Pepper, being diseased of the fire in the face, I commanded
him to be let blood, and that to his face they should apply some little cloth
with Rose water, and the herb Mora: he said to me that he liked the
letting of blood well, because the boy was of Sanguine complexion, but as for
that which should be laid to his face, he had wherewith to heal it in short
time: and he commanded to be brought forth, a thing like unto a cake, as
great as a mean platter, the outside was black, and within yeallowe, and
being brought well near two thousand Leages, it was moist, and he dissolved
a little of it with Rose Water, and laid it to the boys face. I was desirous
to know what it was, he said, that when the work was seen what it would do,
he would tel me whereof it was compounded. The next day I returned to the
sick, and his face was so amended, that I marvelled at it, and immediately he
was washed with Rose water, a little warm, and he remained as though he had
not had any evil therein at all.

The cake was made of certain Worms, which the Indians take out of the
ground, Of what it was made.
and they make them fat, giving them to eat leaves of a certain kind of
corn, that they have there called Maiz, and after they are fat, they put
them into a frying pan of earth, and sees them therein, and as they take of
the skumme, they strain it, and sees it still, until it be thicker then an
ointment, after the fashion and manner as he had it there.

They bring also from the Charcas certain Roots, that be like to the Roots
of flower de Luce, Roots against venom venomous things.
saving that they are smaller and they smell much like the leaves of Fig
tree: they call these Roots in the Indies, a remedy against the venomous
herb, for being made into powder, and taken with white wine, it is a thing
of great strength, and of the greatest virtue, that is there against venom, of
what manner or quality soever it be, so that it be not cursive as Sublimatum,
M^lke good against poison.
or the like: and as for that kind of poison, with only drinking of much Milk
they be remedied.

This Root being taken, causes the venom to be cast out, which is eaten or
drunken, or any manner venomous humour, coming of any evil degree, or cause
whatsoever, which is as well done by vomit, as by sweat. If th^re be any small
Worms, or long Worms in the body, it kills, and expels them: and if you
have any suspicion, that there have been given you any venomous morsel,
whether it be venom or witchecraft, it expels it: in which there is so
much trust in those parts, that they take it for a marvelous remedy, for the
things aforesaid. The root being tasted, it hath a sweet relish, with some
sharpnes. It seems to be hot in the second degree.

From the coast of Nicaraga, and of Nata, they which come in these last ships,
from the firm land, bring a certain kind of purge with them, that surely by
the taste is easy to be taken, and it works well, and without any payne,
principally it purges Choler. It is the fruit of a tree very great, after the
manner of Thornish Chestnuts, which have within them Chestnuts, saving that they
prick not, but be plain* within those prickles there be some like to
Chestnuts, made clean without shale, well near square, which divide
thems^lues asunder, by means of a little skin, every one into two parts, and
so they are covered with it, and when they be taken occupied, that little skin
is plucked away, they are made clean fro it, for that being taken with it, it
procures most dangerous accidents, and vomits, much faintness and infinite
stools: and without it the Chestnut is a purgation very gentle, and they purge
easily, and without pains: if they be tosted, then they will purge less: if
they be green they eat them: or being beaten in a Mortar, they take them with
wine, or with the broth of a hen: if ^hey be dry, they make powder of them,
any manner of fashion. They do their work well, and with much assurance,
keeping the order that ought to be kept, by them which be purged, and the
humours being prepared, as is convenient. They are hot in the first degree.

Of the Sarcaparillia of Guaiaquill.
IN the first part we declared, howe that they brought Sarcaparillia from
Peru: Of the Sarcapari^lia of Guaiaquill.
which we use in some persons, and it works great effects. And because
there was but little of it and soon done, we returned to that of the H^nduras
which is that we have spen^ hi^herto. And ning as much as they can drink at
once, or at diverse times, and after they cast themselves into a sweat, and
they sweat so much, that it runs by the Bed in great quantity. After
that, they take clean clothes, and eat of a Hen, but they drink of no
other thing but of that juice which they took out of the rynde of the
Sarcaparillia, as well at Dinner, as at Supper, and they must eat very little
at Supper, likewise at Dinner. And they must procure to keep themselves from
the Air and from the cold all that they can, although in that Village of
Guaiaquill, wherein be about fifty houses, or few more, the most of them are
Cotages, of little safeguard, and the Walls be made of Canes, and there be no
Chambers on high, but only below: they dwell all in places of little defence.
Being in this order and small comfort for lack of Conserua and dry fruit,
which were necessary, yet in eight or nine days they are made whole of all the
diseases, that are healed with the Sarcaparillia, and of many others which
should be very large to speak of. It is sufficient that there go no Man from
thence which returns not whole, although he had never so grievous a disease,
so that they be not sharpe Agewes: For in that case the cure hath no place, or
in any other sharpe disease. All other diseases it heals with marvelous
success, as it is seen by the great number of people which come thither, and
go away whole of the diseases, which they bring thither. But it is needful
that he which doth enter into this cure, be strong and not weak, for if he be
weak, he cannot suffer so great sweat, without great peril of his person.

Another way to take it.
For these evils they have another manner of Water, that is, taking four
ounces of Sarcaparillia, rather more then less, for that there they use
neither weighty nor measure, but do put all at discretion, and they take away
the rynde from the Sarcaparillia, and break it, without putting it in Water,
if it be green, and if if it be dry, then they break it put it in water,
until it be made soft: this rynd being without the heart, they sees in 4.
Pottels of water, little more or less, and they sees it until half the
water be diminished, rather more then less: and of that Water they drink as
much as they can in many times, or at one time, and forthwith they betake
themselves to sweat, and although they sweat not so much, as they sweat with
the first water, yet they will heal, they move their clothes, they eat of a
Pullet, they keep themselves from the cold and air, and at Dinner and Supper,
they use the self same water, for that in one day they consume one seething:
this people take it in this manner fifteen or twenty days, in this sort also
they are healed of all their evils diseases, to the great admiration of the
people. And for the use of this Sarcaparillia they do not except any disease,
unless it be fevers or sharpe diseases: these people purge not at the beginning,
as we do here, nor in the midst, nor in the end of the cure, for there is
no other Physician nor medicine, but certain women which be there, that give
the water: they are women Physicians, and therefore they take away, and put to
as it seems good unto them.

That which I do note in this business, is that they sees the Sarcaparillia
without the heart: that they use not but of the rynde, which seems to be very
well done, very conformable to good Physic, for the parts of the roots which
be harde, should be taken away, as things superfluous, and without virtue
profit, which rather do let and disturb, that it cannot work that effect
which is desired in it, the virtue is in the rynde: and this is that which we
do commonly use when we will profit our selves by it. And so from
henceforward, The manner how to ma^e the water of the rynde of Sarcaparillia
when I shall ordain this water for any that have need of it, I will use the
rynde only.

And thus I ordain it at this present. Which is to take four ounces of
Sarcaparillia, and too take away the heart,

BEing in company with Iohn Gotierres Telo, a gentleman very excellent, Treasurer
of ye Contratatio house, a passenger which came fro the Florida, gave him a
piece of Ambar Grese, very excellent, saying that he brought it from the
Florida. I took it, brake it, it was perfect grese, of a very good colour, and
in the uttermost part it was black, and I asked him that brought it, where he
had it: he said, that he gathered it in the coast of Florida, and that they
have it commonly of the Indians, that gather it in that Coast, and they take
much pleasure in it with great delight, and contentment anointing their faces
with it, and other parts, for the good smell which it hath. And surely it
makes me marvel to see, that in our Occidental Indies, there is so
excellent Ambar, and that the time hath discovered it unto us, and that there
hath come from those parts not only so great riches, of Silver and Gold,
Pearls, and other precious stones, but that also now they bring us such
excellent Ambar Grise, a thing so esteemed in the world, so much used for the
health of the body, and so necessary to cure and to heal withal, so many and
diverse infirmities, as we will speak of being a thing which for the delicacy
of mankind, is an ornament, cotentment with very much serves for use. I do
understand also that other Passengers brought of the like Ambar, and some in
much quantity, of which I was very glad, and the first piece that I saw was
very suspicious unto me, and after that I had seen more, Ambar is not the seed
of the Whale, but a Gum.
then I believed that there was of it, in those parts, which is found cast up
unto the coast.

Some there be which think that it is the seed of a Whale, as it hath been
an ancient opinion, which is false, as Simeon Archiatros a Greek author doth
show, saying that the Ambar in diverse places doth spring, Simeon a Greek
author.
they be his fountains from whence it doth spring, as those of Pitch Licor:
the worst is that which these fishes do taste, and swallow down, c. The same
it seems Serapio doth understand, and besides this Simeon a Greek, and
Actio, I find no other Greekes that make mention thereof, but it is treated of
by the Arabies with as great ignorance and confusion as may be seen.
Whosoever by them will verify what Ambar is, it is to be determined upon,
that it is a kind of Pitch, that comes forth of springs Fountains, that are
made in the depth of the Sea, and coming forth to the air, the Licor being
gross doth congele, and wax hard, and is made the Ambar which we see, as many
things else which are in the lower part of the Sea, are soft tender, but being
brought out into the air are made harde. As we see in the Coral, which in the
lower parts of the Sea is soft and tender, Coral.
and by bringing it into the air is turned into a stone: and the Ambar whereof
the Beads are made, in the lowe parts of the Sea is white, and being come
forth into the air, turns hard and stony, and is Pitch, Ambar congeled.
which comes forth of a fountain, which is in the Germaine Sea, whereby the
barbarous opinions are confounded, that say the Ambar is the seed of the
Whale. And the cause whereof this ignorance came, was this, for that Ambar was
found in the Whales, and other fishes, Amb^r found in the Whales Maw.
and therefore men said that it grew of it own nature in their mawes, and as
this Pitch rises up to the highest parts of the Sea by reason of the lightness
thereof, the Whales do devour it, thinking that it is a thing to be eaten, and
so men find it in their Mawes. For if it were seed, it would be found in other
parts of their bodies, where it is natural to al beasts. In my time was taken a
Whale, in the coast of the Canaria that had more the one hundred pound weight
of Ambar within him, and after that they killed many, and found none.

They that come from the Florida say, that there be Whales by those coasts,
Whales of the Coast of the Ambar.
and that they have killed some of them, and found neither Ambar nor other
thing in their Mawes, more then fishes: also in the young Whales which are very
great, although they have killed them, that they found nothing in them, for
that the Indians do fish for the. and take them with the greatest cunning
that may be imagined, which is after this manner. One Indian takes a long
cord, and strong, made with certain gins, and ships himself in a little
Boat, and makes toward the Whale where he sees him coming with his young
Whales, and goes to one of them and leaps upon him, and casts his snare
upon his snow^. The strong young Whale when he feels this, he goes down to
the depth of the Sea the Indian hampered fast with him, for they are great
swimmers, and can abide long in the water: and the young Whale as he hath need
to breath, returns up to the height of the Sea. And in the time that he
comes up ward, the Indian carrying with him a sharpe wedge, and putting it
through his nose where he breaths, he strikes the wedge into him with his
fist, in such sort, that the young Whale cannot cast it from him, and when he
comes up on heigh, the Indian gives him corde, and takes his boat, and
goes after the young Whale, and as he cannot breath, he ch^keth him easily, and
he comes to the land. It is surely a delicate and marvelous hunting,
wherein they have so much cunning, that a great Lizard or Crocodil of xxiiii.
foot, the most horrible and cruel beast that is in the Sea, one Indian doth
kill. Some say, that the Ambar is made of certain fruit growing by the Sea
side, where Whales be, and in the Month of April and May, when it is in
season, of sweet smell, the Whales do eat it, and of that the Ambar is made,
as if the fruit so eaten, would be converted into an other thing then into
blood and flesh. There be many other opinions, concerning this matter what
Ambar should be made of, which are confuted all: and it is to be
understood, that it is a kind of Pitch which springs from Fountains that
there are in the depth of the Sea, in particular parts of it, as we see
there be of Petrolio, of Napta of Sulphur, and of many other things, as in our
Occidental Indies, of diverse other Licors: Which is best Ambar.
the best Ambar is that which is most like to a red colour, the white is not so
good, and the worst of al is the black.

Ambar hath great virtues, and serves in the world for many things, and so it
is a substance of great price: The virtues of the Ambar.
for that which is good is worth at this day, twice more the the most fine
Gold. For the contentment of man, and for the delicateness of the world, it
serves for many things: The medicinal virtues thereof.
with it they make Beads, and fine perfumes, and odorous smells, and water of
Angels of most sweet smell, in diverse forms and fashions: with it they dress
gloves of diverse sorts, make Oils and licors of most sweet and delectable
smells: it serves for meates drinks, in diverse and sundry forms, which to
report, would be a large process.

In medicinal things the virtue thereof is great, and it profits very much
in our Medicines, for it enters into the most principal matters of Physic,
which are compounded in the Poticaries Shops, as well Electuaries, as
Confectios, pouders, pills, Preparatives, Ointmets, plasters, many other
things, that receive great virtues thereby: of the name of it, there is made a
confection called Dia-Ambar. The virtues which it hath in particular are great,
and of great effects, for that with it are healed diverse and sundry diseases.
And this the Arabiens did teach us: for of the Greekes only Simeon, and Actio
wrote a few words of it, and also Actuario made the like mention of it:
These three authors being Greekes, lived after the time that the Arabiens did
write, and they made some record of the Medicines, and things which they
wrote of, whereof the ancient wryters made no mention one of them is Ambar,
which the old Physicians knew not before the Arabiens, for they made no
mention of it.

The virtue thereof is to heal, dissolve, comfort any manner of way, The
complexion thereof.
wherein it is applied: For that the coplexion thereof is hot and dry, with some
fatness, and it hath virtue to mollify, make soft, with other virtues that it
hath besides.

And being applied to the Brains, in the manner of an ointment, It coforteth
the brain Sin^wes.
and melting it with the Pestel of a Mortar being hot, and mingled with the
oil of the flowers of Orenges, in this sort it takes away the grief of the
head, it comfort the Sinews, it dissolveth any manner of cold which is in
them, with a great prerogative and help, as well in it own form as in making a
plaster of Al^pta M^scata, which is made of certain compounds, that it be
applied continually to that part.

What the smell of the Ambar doth.
Smelling unto it in the piece, or making a Pomander of it, mingled with Musk,
and Lign'aloe, it comfort the brains, and opens the understanding: in the
one sort, or the other, being applied unto it, it makes a good memory, and
helps the understanding that it may be better and more perfect. And it is
convenient that we use it more then women, for the hurt which the good smell
doth unto them, which be grieved with the Mother, for they ought not to use
it, if there be not a descending of the Mother to the lower parts: for in such
case it were convenient to smell much to it, for it causes the Mother to rise
up to his place, with the good smell, taking some evil savour by the inferior
parts. And likewise by smelling unto it, it comfort the heart, and makes
the Spirits valiant and strong: and for this purpose it profits, being
carried about one, and smelling to it, in the time of the Pestilence, and in
corrupt airs, to resist the corruption, and malice of them, with the virtue
and sweet smell thereof.

It is a marvelous thing to understand howe much the Ambar doth profit and
succour them, which be old, The Ambar is a great remedy for the that be old.
in what manner or sort soever they use it: although with it excellent smell it
comfort the spirits, and the brains of the head, yet it makes thin also
Flegmatike humours, which do continually abound. And some say, that the use
of it holds back age, and conserveth that it go not forward, and it is good
that such do use it in their meates, and in sweet smells for their apparel
and Chambers, and applied to the brain and heart, and that they hold it to
smell in their hands continually: and that it be put into the wine, wherewith
they shall wash their hands and face: for it is a marvelous thing howe much
it comfort, and gives strength, wherein I have seen marvelous effects,
they which are old and crooked, and do use it, shall perceive what great good
it will do them.

In pains of women, it is a marvelous remedy, In pains of women.
mingled with the Lode stone, and Galuano, made in little plasters laid upon
the nauil, to keep the Mother in his place, and for the rest of the pains of
it. Chiefly by smelling to it continually, it profits women that the mother
may come down. And if it rise up, putting into it a Tent of Cotton woll,
dissolved with oil of Liquid Ambar, it makes it come down. And being put
into the mouth of the mother in women which do not bring forth children, for
the coldness that is in them, it is most excellent. I use to take this
confection: which is compounded with Ambar two parts, and the scraping of
Ivory, one part ground small, half a part of Lignaloe made into powder, and
a little Musk: of the which make Pills, and they must take three, that may
way three pence, from three to three days: applying moreover the little
plaster, which is spoken of, to the nauill, and the tent into the mouth of the
mother: surely it doth profit much, the universal euacuations, being made,
and it must be used many days.

For the evils of the stomach.
The Ambar profits much in the diseases of the stomach, and for the coldness
of it, if there be a plaster made thereof, and of Alipta Muscata, and of
Storacke, after the manner of a breast plate, and laid to the stomach: and
likewise of the self same thing Pills being made and mingled with wine, of
sweet smell, and taken in the morning fasting. For it dissolveth winds, it
takes away any manner of cold which is in the stomach, it helps digestion,
it gives appetite, and lust to meat, and this is convenient for him that is
cold of complexion, or for that which causes the hurt of the stomach, that
comes of cold: and therefore it should be convenient for them that be old,
and cold of stomach.

It comfort the heart, and heals the diseases thereof, principally if they
come of windinesse, For the evil of the heart.
or of cold humours, being taken by it self, or mingled with Lignaloe Musk, in
manner of pouders, or pills. For that the Musk, as Anerois says, comfort
more then al other sweet smells that are in the world, for that the sweet
favour, and comforting smell thereof prevails more, then al other smells. In
what manner of way soever the Ambar is applied, by it self, or with other
things, in infirmities of the heart, it profits, much applied thereunto
outwardly, and in any manner of sort taken, it doth comfort and strengthen,
and dissolve any humour that is in the body.

I do cause Ambar to be ground, which being well mingled with yeallowe wax
molted, and made into a thynne cake, and laid to the heart, doth profit much
in the evils of the heart, Of them that be Melancholic.
chiefly if they come first of windinesse, Melancholy, or of any other cause
whatsoever, so that it be not hot.

The Ambar is very profitable for them that be Melancholic, for it makes them
very merry, taking away the causes of the evil, and dissolving the windinesse
thereof which there are very many grieved with al: and unto such it is good to
be ministered, and to use it after the manner of Medicine, mingled as we have
said, in the mornings: and also to use it laid upon the heart, and upon the
brains, and in meates, for surely I have seen great effects wrought in them
that have frequented it.

Where there is corruption of air, It rectifieth the air.
the Ambar doth rectify it by it self, or mingled with things of sweet smell,
the place being perfumed with it, where men should remain, principally in
the time of winter, and unto such as do suffer cold Rewmes, in cold times:
chiefly perfuming their kercheifes, wherein they sleep, with it, or with some
mixture thereof, perfuming the Chamber likewise, for it is a marvelous thing
to see the good work it doth make.

And likewise it doth good to them, which have the palsy, For the that have
the Palsy.

For them that have the falling sickness.


or weakness of Sinews, perfuming themselves with it, or with the mixture
thereof.

Those that have the Falling sickness, by giving to them at their noses, when
they be in their trance or paroxismos, the smoke thereof, it makes to awake:
and wearing it about them, smelling to it continually, the trance doth not
come so quickly, nor so strong. And unto those which suffer the disease of the
Palseye, by anointing their head with it, and all the upper part of the skull,
it brings manifest profit: for that the Ambar is a thing that comfort the
Sinews and brain, more then any thing that we know.

One property the Ambar hath, that brings admiration, The Ambar doth make
drunk.
and Simeon Secto a Greek author doth report, that if any smell to it
before he drink wine, it makes him stand as if he were drunken* and if it
be put into the wine, it makes him drunk indeed, in such sort that a
little wine mingled with Amb^r, causes drunkenness, which I have seen by
experience, in the house of a great Lord of this Realm, where for
delicateness, and daintiness, they had a S^lte seller of Ambar, as also Salt
to cast into meates: and to a Jester there was Ambar cast into his wine, and
he was made very dr^nke with it. Many other things ^here were to treat of
Ambar, but because I would not pass the limits of my purpose, I leave (...)
write of them, and the r^ther, for that in the third part we will declare
that which we mean farther to say of them.

The end of the second part.
THE THIRD PART OF THE Medicinal History, which treats of the things that
are brought from our Occidental Indies, serving for the use of Medicine.
Wherein there is mention made of many things Medicinal, that have great
secrets and virtues:

Now newly set forth by the said Doctor Monardes, after that he had made
the first and second parts.

Of the Cinnamon of our Jndias.
IN the year of our Lord 1540. Francis Pissarro provided to make toward his
brother Gonsalo Pissarro governor of the province of Quito, the Spaniards wet
thither with a good will, they went also unto the country that was called the
country of the Cinamo, with is an other province beyond Quito, and the Cinnamon
was much spoken of amongst the Spaniardes, for it was understood of the Indians
that it was a thing of great riches,

Gonsalo Pissarro departed with 200. Spaniards, and it happened to him evil in
his journey, The history of the conquest of the country, where the Cinnamon
grows.
for it was a sharpe country, without vittaile, with great travel they came to
that province called of the Indians Somaca, where the Cinnamon grows, which is
right under the Equinoctial line.

The trees which bear it, are of reasonable greatenesse, they carry a Leaf
like to Laurel, they be al the y^re green, and they never loose the leaf,
which is a thing common to all the trees of the Indies. The description of the
trees, and of the fruit.
They bear their fruit unto the likeness of a little Hat, that hath his
Cup and sides as great as a piece of eight Rialles of Silver, which is four
Shillings, and some greater, it is of the colour of a dark tawny, as well
without as within, it is smooth in the inner part, and sharpe in the utter, in
the highest part of the Cup it hath a stalk, whereby it hangs in the tree,
it is as thick in the side, as a piece of eight Rialles of Silver, and the
uppermost part is fuller of body, and being tasted, it hath the same
pleasantness of taste that the same Cinnamon hath, which they bring from the
India of Portugall, and in like sort there r^mayne^h in the mouth the same
sweet smell, and taste, that the same Cinnamon of the East India hath, there
remains in the mouth the same sweet smell and taste, with some dryness: the
selfe-same it doth being ground, respiring out from it the same smell, which
the most fine Cinnamon hath. And in the meates wherein it is put* it gives the
same taste savour that the Cinnamon of the East India hath. The trees have a
gross rynd, but without taste, savour or smell of the Cinnamon. I cannnot tell
if the little inner rynd have any, only the rynde I have seen with the fruit,
as it is described: they say that the leaves being beaten, give out s^me smell
of Cinnamon, only the virtue, sweet smell and taste, is in the fruit, which is
contrary to ^he Cinnamon, that is brought from the Oriental Indies, for only
the Rynde of the tree is that which hath the sweet savour and pleasant smell,
as we do all see. And true it is, that some is better and of more sweet smell
and taste, than othersome is. For although that they are all one sort of trees,
which bring forth the Cinnamon, yet some have the rind thin, and that is the
best Cinnamon, and others have it gross, and this is not so good: and thereof
it hath come, that there be some which do distinguish the Cinnamon into diverse
kinds. For one sort they call Cassia, and an other Cinnamon, and an other
Cassia lig^a, and it is all one kind of tree, that brings them forth: but
that the diversity of the place brings forth one more fine than another, and
so Cassia and Cinnamon are al one, Cassia Cinamo all one.
for that they differ not, but only in the names, for all is Cinnamon, thin,
and fine, and whereas you find written Cassia, may be put Cinnamon; and where
you do find Cinnamon, Cassia.

This our fruit that is called Cinnamon, profits in Medicine for many
things: Virtues which it hath in medicine.
being taken and made into powder, it comfort the stomach, and it
dissolveth winds, it takes away the evil smell of the mouth, it is an
important remedy for the grief of the stomach, it is cordial, it makes a
good colour in the face, and Cassia in dressed meates is used even as Cinnamon is,
because it works the like effect, that it doth: by taking the Powder of
this fruit with wine, or water made for the nonce, it provokes the purgatio
of women. It is hot in the third degree, and dry in the first, but with
notable comforting, by reason of the dry parts that it hath.

Of the Ginger.
DOn Francis de Mendosa, Don Francis de Mendosa,
Son unto the vice Roy Don Anthony de Mendosa, did sow in the new Spain
Cloaues, Pepper, Ginger, and other spices, of those which are brought from the
Oriental Indies, and that which by him was begun, was lost, by reason of his
death, only the Ginger did remain, for it grew very well in those parts, and
so they bring it green from the new Spain, and other parts of our Indies,
and some they bring dry, after the manner of that of the East India.

The Ginger is a Plant which carries his Leaf like to L^rio, somewhat more
narrow, with the same greenesse: The descriptio of Ginger.
the Root is as it seems, some greater than other, and when it is green, it
burns not in the mouth, wherefore being made small into pieces, it is put
into Sallettes, for because it gives them both taste and smell. They sow it, of
the seed that it brings forth or of the same little Root, and of the one
sort and of the other it waxes great: and after the Root is grown great,
they take it forth, and dry it in the shadow, where no moisture doth come,
for that is it which doth corrupt him, and for this cause they bring it in
dry earth and made in Conserua, although that here it may be very well made
of that which is dry, burying the Root at the foot of a place where many
(...) led Imperial, being abroad below and narrow above, and by the mouth of
them there grows out certain Buds, which are his Leaves, which cause him
to show very fair, and these Buds are sown, and of them grow the
Plants, which carry the Pinnas, and one Plant carries not more than one
Pinna, in the highest part thereof: it grows green, and as it ripens, it
turns yeallowe. They take from it the Rynde, which is very thin, for to
eat, that which it hath within it is white, and soft, and melts in the
mouth, with a very good taste, and sweet savour: saving that it hath many small
karnels round about it, which it is needful that you cast from you when you
eat them, which are of a Purple colour. The smell thereof is like to a kind
of Quince, and where there is a Pinna ripe, he smells like to a Quince over
all the House where he is.

The virtues thereof.
They take them to be good for the stomach, and likewise for the heart, and to
restore the appetite lost: it is a general fruit in all parts of the Indies,
and much esteemed. They are to be eaten at the beginning of meat, they use to
eat them in the hot after Noones: for they say that they do refresh: they are
cold in my judgment: they brought two sorts of them, the one dry, the other
in Conserua. The dry did serve for no other purpose, but to see the figure and
the form of them: in Conserua, they have a good taste, although somewhat
sharpe: they ought to be made in Conserua when they are green.

Of the Guaiauas.
The description of the tree which doth carry the Guaia^as.
THey brought me from the firm Land the seed of the Fruit which is so much
esteemed by the Indians, as also by the Spaniardes, which they call Guaiauas.
The trees which carry this fruit are of a reasonable greatness, they cast
out their bows dispersed. They carry a leaf like to the manner of Laurel,
the flower of it is white, according to the fashion of the flower of Orenges,
saving that it is somewhat greater, it is of a sweet smell. This tree yields
much fruit, wheresoever it be sown, and doth multiply and spread so much
abroad, that they take it to be evil for the ground where it grows, for
that in many pastures the people do loose the feeding of their cattle by
reason of them. And they weue themselves one together with an other like
Briars: the fruit which they carry is like to our Apples, of the greatness of
a Pippin, it is green when it begins first to appear, and as it ripens,
it turns yeallowe. In the inner part it is white, and in colour russet, and
being cut, hath four places divided, where it hath the seed, which is like to
the seed of Meddlers, being very harde, and of colour tawny, al the stones
within have no karnel, they are without any savour. And to eat these Apples,
they pare them from the Rind, the fruit is wholesome, and of good digestion:
when they be green they are given to them that have the Laske, for they
restrain and bind much, and when they be very ripe, they make the belly very
laxaatiue when they be of a good seasonable age. They are good roasted for them
that be whole, and for the sick, for being so roasted they are more healthful:
and better, and of pleasanter taste. And the best of them grow in trees which
are tilled. The Indians use the leaves in seething, with the which washing
their feet that are swollen, they cause them to abate, and the inner parts of
the body being stopped or opilated, being washed with this seating, do
disopilate. It seems to be a cold fruit, and therefore they give them
roasted to them which have hot Agewes. It is a very common fruit in all the
Indies.

Of the Cachos.
ALso they did send me the Seed of a plant or herb, The description of
the Cachos.
which the Indians do much esteem, which they cal Cachos. The Cachos is an
herb very reddish in colour, it carries a round leaf thin, it casts out
a fruit like to a Berengena of Spain, where the seed doth grow: it is very
small, and of a Russet colour, it hath a taste without any sharpness, only in
the mountains of Peru this herb is found,

The Indians do much esteem it, for the medicinal virtues that it hath, The
virtues thereof.
it makes one to peace well where the lack of Uryne is, it doth expel the
Sand and Stones, which grow in the reins. And moreover they say, that the
use of it doth break the stone from the bladder, if the Stones be soft, that
they may be dissolved, with taking very little quantity of it, and of this
they have so many examples, that they cause me to marvel at it, because I
think that the stone in the bladder cannot be expelled, but only to cut it
out is the remedy, for that no Physic can dissolve him. They say that taking
the seed ground with some water, made for the purpose, causes it to be cast
out in Clay, and being come forth it returns to be congeled, and turns it
self into a stone.

Only to a young man I saw this happen who had a stone in the bladder,
History.
and I being certified of it by the Master Surgeons that had felt him, and of
the accidents which he had, caused him to be carried at the beginning of the
Summer, unto the Fountain of the stone, and in two months after that he
was there, he came whole from thence, and brought in a paper all the clay
which he had voided from him at times, being of stone dissolved into pieces.
We will sow the seeds, although very little, only to see the effect wrought
by them, which as they say is in a cause so great, and if it do grow, we will
use of it.

Of the flowers of blood.
I Sowed a seed which they brought me from the Peru, The description of the
herb, and the flower.
more to see the fairness thereof, then for any Medicinal virtues that it
hath. The herb comes to be of the height of two spans, little more or
less, bows it casts out straight with certain round leaves, very green
and thin, in the hiest of the bows there grows a flower being yellow,
very high in colour, and only it bears five leaves, and in the midst of
every leaf there is figured a drop of blood, so red and so firmly kindled
in colour, that it can not be more. This flower hath at the foot of it a
stalk very long, which comes out a good space from the flower. It is a
flower very beautiful, which doth adornate gardens, it grows very well of
the seed, or of the plant, and being tasted, it hath the same savour and
taste that the Mastuesso hath: it is notable hot.

A rind of a tree for the Room.
AMongst the things with they sent me fro the Peru, there is a thick rind,
which seems to be of a great tree, and being tasted, hath a sharpnes of taste
with some dryness: the trees grow at the side of a river, where this rind is
taken of, which is twenty and six Leagues from Lima, and they are not found
in other parts of the Indies, but only there. The tree is after the fashion
of an ^ime, as well in the greatness, as in the leaf. The Indians when they
feel themselves laden with Reumes, The use thereof.
or have the Cough, or any pains of the head, they make powder very small of
the rind of the tree, and take it in at their noses, and it causes them to
purge much at them, and with this they clear themselves of the evil: which we
have experimented, by taking the powder in at the nose, and it makes them to
purge notably. It seems to be more then hot in the second degree.

Of the Pacal.
IN the same River there grows an other tree, The use thereof.
which the Indians call Pacal, which tree is lesser then that we have spoken
of before: the Indians do use it made in Ashes mingled with Soye, it takes
away any manner of sore or skabbe in the head, howe grievous soever it be, as
well those which grow in the head, as in the body: as also it takes away the
marks of the said skabbes or sores being never so old. Hither they sent me
a little of the wood, wherewith the Ashes are made, that we might make
experience of it.

Of the Paico.
THey sent me an herb which in the Peru they call Payco: they be certain
leaves after the manner of the leaves of Planten, of that making and
greatness, and as they come dry they are very thin: and being tasted, they
have a notable biting, so that thereby they seem to be very hot. And being
made into powder and taken in wine, they take away the grief of the stone in
the kidneis, which comes of windinesse or cold causes: The vertue^ thereof.
and being sodden and made into a plaster, and laid upon the grief, they
take it away also.

An herb for the evil of the Reins.
LIkewise they sent me another herb, which profits much in the evil of
the reins, when it comes of a hot cause. The vertue^ thereof.
The Juice mingled with the ointment of Roses amongst it, and one of the leaves
or more, if it be needful, laid upon it, is good for an inflammation, the
juice thereof being put, and it profits much, for it doth resist the
inflammation, and mitigate the payne. The leaves which they sent me, be like
to small Lattice, with the same greatness, and being tasted they are of an
evil savour: it seems to be some herb notable cold.

Of a fruit which grows under the ground.
THey sent me from the Peru, a fruit very good, that grows under the earth,
and very fair to behold, and of a very good taste in eating. This fruit hath
no root, nor doth produce any plant, The description of it.
nor plant doth produce it, but that it grows under the ground as the Turmas
do grow under the earth, which are called the Turmas of the earth. It is of
the greatness of half a finger round, and round about it is wrought with a
very fair work, it is of a bay colour: It hath within it a little kernel,
which when it is dry, makes a sound within, like to an Almonde: the rind of
it is tawny, and somewhat white, parted into two parts like unto an Almonde.
It is a fruit of good savour and taste, and eating of it, it seems that you
eat Nuts.

Where it grows.
This fruit grows under the earth, in the coast of the River of Maronnon, and
it is not in any other part of al the Indies. It is to be eaten green and dry,
and the best way is to toste it. It is eaten always after meates, as fruit
eaten last of all, because it dries much the stomach and leaves it
satisfied, but if you eat much of it, then it brings heaviness to the head.
It is a fruit in great reputation, as well amongst the Indians, as the
Spaniardes, and with great reason, for I have eaten of them, which they have
brought me, and they have a good taste. It seems to be a temperate fruit.

Of the fruit called Leucoma.
THey brought me likewyse a fruit of a tree which the Indians call Leucoma,
It is like to Chestnuttes.
which is like unto a Chestnutte of these of ours, as well in colour as in the
greatness, as also in the whytenesse that the Chestnutte hath. It seems that
within it is another thing. I did not break it to see what it was, because
they brought me but two of them, the one I have sown, and the other I have
for to sow at an other time. This fruit doth bear a tree of much
greatness, for it is of timber strong and harde, it casts forth the leaves
like to Madronno, which is a red berie, growing in the Mountains of Spain.
This fruit serves to be eaten, for that they say it is of a good taste, good
for the laske, because it is very dry: they say it is a temperate fruit.

Of the Beads stones to wash withal.
THey sent me a little Chest made of Cork full of round beads stones and
black, of great beauty, so that they seem to be made of the wood Ebano: and
they be a fruit which a small treee bears, How it is fruit.
being more crooked then straight, after the manner of briars: and it carries
a round fruit as great as a Nut, covered with a certain fleshinesse clong
thereunto, which being taken away, there remains a round Bead stone, and so
round that it cannot be rounder, of black colour, most harde, that it can not
be broken.

This fruit serves in place of Soap, in such sort, that two or three of
these with hot water are of more effect to wash withal, and to make clean
clothes, Soap.
then one pound of Soap: and so it raises the some, and works al the
effects that Soap doth, and so they proceed washing by little and little, until
only the Beadstone do remain, which is that which this fruit is fouded on,
al are pierced through: and there are made of them Beads to pray upon, which
seems to be made of Ebano. They dure a long time, for as they are Beads so
hard, that they break not: this fruit is so bitter, that neither beast nor
bird comes too it, for the bitterness thereof. I have sown some of the
Beads, and they have grown, and they cast out from them fair leaves very
great. I trust that they will bring forth fruit, for now the plants are very
little, but in time I hope they will yield it.

Of the Crabs of that Country.
A Gentleman which came from the firm land certified me, that having had
certain continual Agues in that country, History.
he came to be in a consumption, and was counselled to go to certain Ilandes,
which are between Puerto Rico and the Margareta, for that there is in them
great quantity of Crabs, and they are the best of the world, because they
are maintained by Pigeons Eggs, which go thither to lay, and of the young
Pigeons that are there, that he should eat no other thing but these crabs
sodden, and he was healed very well: and although he had eaten much flesh of
Popingeies for that purpose, they did not him so much good, as the Crabs did:
and in them that are consumed, they have a great property, as Auenzoar saith,
and not only they profit such by manifest quality or degree, but also by their
particular property which they have, for the same purpose.

Of the Cardones.
Because I should see the strangeness of this Herb which is the Cardones
of the greatness of a torch of eight square, and wreathed like unto it, they
brought them unto me. It hath a Medicinal virtue, The medicinal virtues
thereof.
that being newly beaten in a Mortar and put into Sores, it heals and
sodereth them forthwith. And well near I my self had need of it, for this
purpose, for that one of the thorns that it hath, did prick me. They are
strong as Needles which did hurt me. It seems to be a strange herb.

Of an herb for such as are broken.
THey sent me a little of an herb, and by reason it was so dry it came small
broken in pieces, so that the figure of it could not be seen, which they wrote
was marvelous for them that are broken, whether they be children or men that
have that kind of grief, and in those parts they have it for a sure thing,
and it is used by one Indian, by applying this herb green, upon that which
is broken, being men or children. And it makes thereupon a certain binding
very strange, without need of any manner of Brich, made for the purpose, for
they may go so fast and so swift being bound therewith, as though they had a
pair of Briches, as one told me that had bin healed of the like disease, with
the herb, and with the manner of bynding. I have understood that if the manner
of binding be as good as this man speaks of, it is sufficient to heal
without the herb, or any thing else, by reason that I saw a man of C^rdona
which healed all persons that were broken with only the bynding that be made
of them, without using unto them any manner of brich. And this is certain, that
there be some here that were healed and cured by him.

Of the Veruaine.
ALso the same Gentleman wrote unto me from the Peru, that in the Rivers of the
Mountains of that Country near unto them, there grows a great quantity
of Veruaine, like unto that of Spain, with the which the Indians do profit
themselves in their cures, The virtues thereof.
for many infirmities, and in especially against all kind of poison, and for
such as say that there hath been given them a morsel, or the like thing.

I spake here with a Lady which came from the Peru, and she certified me that
having been many years sick, History.
and being in cure with many Physicians, she went to an Indian, that was known
to be a man that knew much of herbs, Worms.
unto whom the Indians did put themselves in cure, he gave her to drink the
juice clarified of Veruaine, which she her self made, and within a few days
after that she had taken it, she cast out from her a worm, she said it was a
vearie Snake, of more then two spans long, and very great, and his tail
was parted, and after she had cast him out from her, she was well and whole.
And she counselled a Gentleman which was in the Peru, that was continually
sick to take it, and he took it in the morning with Sugar, for so she had
taken it, because of the bitterness that it hath, and he cast out a great
number of long and small woormes. and one like to a white long girdell, and
since that time he hath very well his health. And this she counselled other
Persons which were sick, to do, that had suspicion, too have woormes, and
with the use of the said juice they cast from them many, and they were healed.
And it was so certainly, and she showed me a Seruaunt of hers, and it was
said that according to the greeuousnes of a disease, which he had, there was
given unto him certain things of witchcraft, and with the juice of the
Veruaine that he took, he cast by vomit many things out of his stomach, of
diverse colours, and it was said that it was that wherewith he was bewitched,
which being cast forth, he remained whole, and of that which touches
witchcraft I will speak what I have seen. Witchcraft


I saw a servant of Iohn de Quinatna Duenas, being Aburgales, A notable
history.
who did cast out at his mouth in my presence a great bundell of ^eare, of a
browne colour, very small, and he had in a Paper more then twice as much,
which he had cast up two hours before, and he remained as though he had cast
up nothing at all, more then the alteration that he had, to see, that he had
cast up such stuff.

Iohn Langins an Almayne Physician, Iohn Langius history.
and very well learned, saith that he saw a woman that complained much of
payne in her stomach, did cast out many pieces of glass, and pieces of Earthen
Platters, and of fish bones wherewith she remained whole.

An other case like unto this Beneuenius speaks of in his book de morbis
mirandis, but that which I do most marvel at, Beneuenius history.
was, that a labouring man suffering great pains in his belly, so that no
medicine could profit him, did cut his own throat with a knife, and after
that he was dead, they opened him found in his belly great quantity of hear,
the like whereof he that I have spoke of did vomit, with many other pieces of
iron. These things I do attribute to ye works of the Devil, for that they cannot
be reduced unto natural causes. The Ueruaine is like that of Spain, all the
year it is green.

Of the Mastuerco.
I have an herb brought from the Peru, which they call Mastuerco, The
virtues.
it is a little herb, doth carry certain small leaves that are round, which
being beaten in a mortar, and the juice of them put into any manner of wound,
doth refresh, comfort and heal, curing it forthwith, and the use of it is not
more nor less then the use of the Tabaco, in wounds which he freshly made
washing them with the juice, and laying the beaten leaves to them, and being
tasted it seems that it is notable hot.

Of the small wild Lattice.
LIkewise they brought me from the same parts an other herb, which they
call wild Lattice: the leaves be like to Lattice, the colour is a sad
green, it hath virtue too take away the Toothache, It takes away the
toothache.
receiving the seething which is made of the leaves, and holding it in the
part where the grief is, and putting a little of the juice in the tooth,
which is grieved, for so it takes away the pains, y^ leaves which are staped,
after the juice is taken out, must be laid upon it, being tasted it is most
bitter. It seems to be hot in more then the first degree.

Of the liquor which is called Ambia.
IN a great Cane they sent me a Liquor which springs out of a fountain that
is near to the Sea side, it is of the colour of honey, as thin, the smell is
like the Tacamabaca, they say and also they write, that it hath great
medicinal virtues, The medicinal virtues thereof.
chiefly in the healing of old diseases, and those which come of cold causes.
It takes away the pains in any part of the body, proceeding of cold or of
windinesse. It takes away the cold in what part soever it be, it doth comfort
and dissolve any manner of swelling, and it works all the effects that the
Tacamabaca and the Caranna do, and so they use it in those parts, in steed of
them: you may not touch nor handle it with your hands, unless you have them
wet, and wheresoever it be put, it sticks fast, that it cannot be taken away,
unless it be wasted with long time. They sent me this little for a show,
because they do esteem it greatly, therefore they sent it as a thing very
precious. It seems to me hot in the third degree, with notable clammines.

Of the tree that shows whether one shall live or die
IN the year of our Lord, 1562. When the Earl of Nieba was in the Peru, he had
there a gentlewoman wc was married that served him, her husband waxed sick of a
grievous disease, an Indian of great reputatio seeing her to be in much sorrow,
said to her, if she would know whether her husband should live or die of
that disease, he would send her a Bow of an herb, that she should take in
her left hand, and hold it fast, for a good while: and if he should line, then
she should show much gladness, with holding the Bow in her hand: and if he
should die, then she should show much sadness. And the Indian sent her the
Bow, and she did as he had willed her to do: and the bow being put into her
hand, she took so much sadness and sorrow, that she threw it away from her,
thinking that she should have died thereof, and so he died within a few days.
I was desirous to know if that it were so, and a Gentleman of the Peru that had
been there many years, did certify me and said that it was of truth, that
the Indians did this with their sick people. It hath put me in admiration, and
in much consideration.

Of the Granadillia.
FRom the firm Land they brought me certain Fruits which are herbs which
they call in the hills of the Peru where they grow, Gra^a^illias, The
description of ^he Granadillias*
and this name the Spaniards did give them, for the likeness fashion that they
have to our Grana^as, which we call (...) they sent me, is of a red colour,
somewhat dark, and it hath a good smell.

Of the Bezaar stones of the Peru.
ALthough in the second part I treated of the Bezaar stones, that have been
found in the mountains of the Peru, for that they have been sent me by the
first discoverer of them, the best of as many as from those parts have come,
yet I would say in this third part some thing of them, which he sent me for
knowledge, saying: that because I wrote of them they had kno^ledge of them: and
the book which I wrote of them, was the guide to find and discover them, as
we have said, as he shows by his letter, which we have set in the second
part,

Those which he sent me too prove be very excellent in their coullour,
making, and greatenesse, whereof I have broken some, and find them as
excellent as those of the East India: and so they prove in powder, or in one
little grain as the other do, and in coullour well near they are the same.
Truth it is, that those which have this quality and goodness, and have all
the qualities that the Bezaar stones ought to have which are fine, should be
those that are taken out of the beasts, that are fed in the Mountains, for
those which are taken out of them that are bred in the plain grounds, are
not so good, nor have any Medicinal virtues, because the Beasts a^e not
maintained by those healthful Herbs, whereby these stones are engendered,
for as they be Beasts and chew tha^ which they eat of the juice, that
proceeds from the herbs, the stones are engendered. Which thing that
Gentleman gave well to understand, who was the first discoverer of them, who
did see where they lay, and were bred within the beast, and with his own
hands made the Anatomy of him, Where thes^ stones do grow.
and wrote unto me that the Bezaar stones are growing in those beasts, after
the manner of a guard made of flesh, of the length of two spans, little more
or less, and of three fingers breadth, which is joined near unto the Maw of
the inner part, and in the guard the stones are set in order one after an
other, like unto button holes, in a coat, in this form.

How there are set in order.


And they open that guard of flesh being closed, and take out the stones, that
surely it is a marvelous thing to see, what Nature hath created there, for our
health remedy of our evils And as I have understood, that these which are
brought from the East India, be found after the same manner, so I speak the
truth, for they bring very many which are false, that amongst one hundred
there are not to be found ten that are true, and their wryters of the East
India do confess, that there be made many indeed which are false.

The people of the East India take them cut also of a certain kind of Goats,
They of the Oriental Indies.
that be for the most part red as ours be: they are the best stones which
are take out of y^ cattle, which go in the Mountains of Persia: and likewise
they take them out of other Goats, that go in the plain Countries of Malaca,
and these are not had in such estimation, nor have the goodness nor the
virtues that they of Persia have, because those Goats of Malaca do serve for
cattle to be eaten, and they be not maintained by healthful herbs of the
mountains, as they that (...) yet it takes away the accidents of it, the
faintness sadness, In quarterne Agewes.
and the grief of the heart, which in these Fevers are common. Surely they
feel with the use of it notable profit, in al long and importunate diseases I
do give it, they find profit in it, In long evils.
chiefly those which stand in fear, of any malice of disease, or windinesse,
whatsoever it be. For I have seen, that in this it hath a great property,
and of this it comes, that it is good to cast into pourges, some grains of
it, that if the Pourge do carry venomous qualities, it may rectify them, and
amend them, and if not, it gives force, and strength to the heart, and they
work the better. In the oriental Indies they have a custom to purge
themselves twice every year, and especially the noble people of estimation, and
after they have purged themselves, they take every morning fasting four
grains of the Bezaar stone, A custom of the Oriental Indians.
with Rose water, or with water made for the purpose, and they say that this
doth conserve their youth, and strengthen the members, and preserve them from
diseases: and it is a good use, for it cannot choose, but do them much good.
For Worms they give this Stone with most happy success, and surely I have
given it to many people, and especially to Children, and Boys, that are
tormented with this evil, and I have seen such works as are not to be
believed, if they were not seen. I give it by it self, and also mingled with
this powder, in this form.

I do take herb Lumbrigera the wayght of twelve pence, Pouders to be
meruelled at for the worms, and al kinds of them.
the seed of Santonico the wayght of six pence, the Horne of a Heart burned,
and the seed of Verdolagas, and Carlina, of every one the weight of three
pence, and the Bezaar Stone of the Peru, the weight of three pence: of these
things let there be small Powder made, and let them be well mingled. These
Pouders are marvelous and of great effect, to expel Worms, and very much
experimented in many people, and they have wrought in this case great
effects, and they must be given in the morning fasting, as to the Physician
shall seem good, according to the age of him that shall take them, using some
Medicine of Milk, and Sugar two hours after they be taken. And unto
children being sick of it, we give this stone mingled with milk; and without
it, if they do suck, and it doth a marvelous work: and to them that be in
years, by it self, or mingled with other things appropriated for the
disease. In conclusion, we give this stone in al long diseases, and
importunate, where the ordinary medicines have not profited, in which it doth
manifest profit, and if it do no profit, yet it can do no hurt.

Of the Fig trees of the Peru.
Fig trees being carried from Spain to the Peru, have increased so well in
that Country, that there is great plenty of them, where they cary many and
very good Figs, of all sorts. And you shall understand, that in that
country there are certain kinds of Uermyn, which are called Spyders, and
wheresoever they be, they do spin, and make Nets as they of Spain do.
Spyders.
These kind of Uermyn be great, and come to be as great as Orenges, and
they are so full of poison that which one stinging they kill, unless there be
used great remedy. And if it be long time without remedy, and that the
Poison go up to the hart, there is nothing that can be done that will
benefit, but he must die without remedy: and for this there is found a
remedy in the Fig trees, which is a marvelous thing, that as soon as the
Indians or the Spaniardes do feel themselves bitten by this evil Spider,
they go to the Fig trees, and put unto it the Milk which comes forth of
the Leaves of them, two or three times to the place, that is bitten, and this
works so great effect, that it remedies it which is so poisoned, with the
venom that the Vermin did cast into the sore, and the accidents be remitted
which they suffer, to wit, great griefs and soundings, remaining only to heal
the place bitten, and as it is little, so it heals forthwith, although they
procure to keep it open a long time. And Gods will is, that at all times this
remedy should not lack, for the Fig trees never loose their leaves,
throughout all the year they are always green.

Of the Coca.
I Was desirous to see that herb so celebrated of the Indies, so many years
past, which they call the Coca, wc they sow and till with much care, and
diligence, because they use it for their pleasures, which we will speak of.
The description of the Coca.
The Coca is an herb of the height of a yerd, little more or less, it
carries leaves like to Arraihan, somewhat greater, and in that Leaf there is
marked an other leaf of the like form, with a line very thin: they are
soft, and of colour a light green, they carry the seed in clusters, and it
comes to be red when it is ripe, as the seed of Arraihan, when it is type.
And it is of the same greatness, when the herb is seasoned, that it is to be
gathered, it is known in the seed, that it is ripe when it is of some rednes
like to a blackish colour, and the herb being gathered, is put into Canes
and other things, that they may dry, that they may be kept and carried to other
parts. For that they cary them from the high Mountains, to other places, as
marchadise to be sold, they barter and change them for Mantelles, and Cattle,
and Salt, and other things which run like money amongst us they plant the
seed in Almaciga, and from that they take them up and set them in other
places, into Earth that is well laboured or tilled, and made convenient to set
them in by their lines and order, as we do set here a Garden of Beans, or of
Peason.

The use of it amongst the Indians is a thing general, for many things, for
when they travel by the way, The use of i^.
for need and for their content when they are in their houses, they use it in
this form. They take Cokles or Oysters, in their shells, and burn them and
grind them, and after they are burned they remain like Lyme, very small
ground: then they take the Leues of the Coca, and chew them in their Mouths,
and as they chawe it, they mingle with it some of that powder made of the
shells in such sort, that they make it like to a Paste, taking less of the
Powder then of the herb, and of this Paste they make certain small b^wles
round, and lay them to dry, and when they will use them, they take a little Ball
in their mouth, and chawe it, rolling it from one place to an other, procuring
to conserve it all that they can, and that being done, they take another, and
so they go, using it al the time that they have need, which is when they
travel by the way, and especially if it be by ways where is no meat, nor
plenty of water. For the use of these little Balls takes the hunger and
thirst from them: they say that they receive substance thereby, as though they
did eat meat. At other times they use them for their pleasure, although they
labour not by the way, and they use the same Coca alone, chewing it tossing it
in their mouths, from one side to another, until there be no virtue remaining
in it, and then they take another.

When they will make themselves drunk, Note.
and be out of judgment, they mingle with the Coca the leaves of the Tabaco,
and chew them all together, and go as they were out of their wits, or as if
they were drunk, which is a thing that doth give them great contentment, to
be in that sort. Surely it is a thing of great consideration, to see howe
desirous the Indians are to be depryued of their wits, and to be without
understanding, seeing that they use thus the Coca with the Tabaco, and al to
this end, that they would be without understanding, and have their wits taken
from them, as we said in the second part, when we treated of the Tabaco.

Of the diverse colours of the ground.
A Marvelous thing it is, and well to be considered, the diverse colours of the
grounds which are in the fields, in the countries of the Peru: for that
looking a far of you shall see many parts of grounds of diverse colours,
which seem to be clothes of diverse colours laid to dry in the Sun: for you
shall see one part of the ground Green, and an other Blew, and forthwith
an other yellow, and white, and black, and red, and so of other colours, all
which are Mineries of diverse Earths. Of the black I can say that they sent me
a little that there with I might make Ink, which being cast into water or
wine there is made there of very good Ink, wherewith one may write very well,
but it is somewhat blew, which makes it of a better show.

The red ground hath been a thing of great riches, for that which hath been
taken out of it, for it is a Minery most excellent, Quick silver.
of which is made quick Silver, and there out is taken such quantity of it,
that there are carried to the new Spain, Ships laden with it, which is a
riches so great, that it is not known unto the Indians. It serves them for
no other use then to mingle it with certain gummes, to paint themselves
withal, which they use to do when they go to their wars to show
themselves gallant, and fierce. Every day they discover in those countries
great Mineries of metals, such like things, for they have found out a mountain
of Oker, a mine of Allom, an other of Brimstone many other things which they
do daily discover.

Of the Casany.
I Have caused them to bring me from Sancto Domingo a leaf of that plant
whereof they make the Casani, and they brought it me. The Casani is the bread,
which the Indians so many multitudes of years have maintained themselves
withal, Casani ^s bred in the Indies.
and do yet maintain themselves, likewise many Spaniardes. It is made of an
herb that the Indians do call Yuca, which is of five or six spans of
height, T^e descripti^n o^ the herb and the f^u^t^.
it carries certain Leaves open, spread abroad like to the fingers of an
hand, and every one carries seven or eight points, they are always green,
they are set in a ground well tilled, of pieces cut of from the same plant, the
fruit is after the manner of gross Turnepes, they are of colour Tawny without,
only in the body, for within they are white, they par^ them to use them: and
of this fruit they make Bread in this form.

They make it clean from the Rynde, and grate it in certain Graters, which
are made of Nedles, How they ma^e ^read of the fruit.
and being so grated they put it into a sliue of palm, upon it they hang
things of weight, which are great stones, which make the juice run out of it,
and being well pressed it remains as Almondes beaten: th^y cast this into a
plain frying pan of Earth, that they have put to the fire, and there they
knede it, and make it like to a little cake of Eggs, turning it from one side
to an other, and after it is well kneded, it remains like a Cake, of the
thickness of a piece of silver of four shillings, or little more, which they
lay in the Sun, that it may dry, and these Cakes they use for Bread, which
are of much substance. These Cakes continue long time without corrupting, and
they bring them in the ships which come from those parts, into Spain
without being corrupted, and serve for Biscuit too all the people. It eats as
a thing sharpe, and so it serves, and they lay it to soak in water, or in
broth, or in Pottage, for after this manner they serve themselves better with
it, then to eat it dry. It is needful to have a vessel with water, for to
soak it in.

It is a mauellous thing of the juice which comes out of this fruit, Note
the maruelles of the juice.
which is spoken of, that if any Man or beast do drink it, or any part of it,
incontinently he dies, as with the most strong venom that is in the world:
but if this juice do sees, and be consumed the one half, and so set out too
cool, it serves for very good Vinegar, and it is used as if it were made of
Wine: and if you sees it until it be thoroughly purged and thick, it serves
for Honey, and becomes sweet: you may see how much the seething avails in
these things, seeing that of mortal venom, it makes meat, and healthful
drink. And I will say an other thing which brings admiration: that all this
kind of Corn, which grows in the firm Land which is like to that of
Sancto Domingo, which they call Cacani, is healthful, and the Fruit thereof
is eaten and the Water that comes of it is drunk, without having any
venomous quality, and that of Sancto Domingo, howsoever it be eaten and the
juice thereof unless it be sodden, it kills. And that the disposition of the
place is so great a cause, that that which is healthful and allowable
sustenance in the firm land, the same is mortal venom in al the Islands: as
Columela writes of the Peach, that it was venom most mischievous, Colum^la.
which in Persia did kill men and being brought into Italy it lost that malice
and property that it had to kill, and gives unto us health, and a sweet
juice.

Howsoever it be, having in the Indies so much Mayes, and so common in all
parts thereof, I would not eat Casani, seeing that the Mayes are of as good
substance as our Wheat, and in no part hath either venom, Ma^is
or poison, but rather is healthful, and makes a good stomach. There is bread
made of it, as of the Casani, Bread of Ma^i^.
for they grind it, and with water they knede it, and in a Frying pan of
Earth they bake certain Cakes, which they make of it, and it must be eaten
fresh, as soon as it is made: for being dry, it is sharpe and trouble some to
swallow down, and doth offend the teeth.

The Batatas, which is a common fruit in those Countries, I take for a
vittayle of much Substance, Batatas.
and that they are in the midst between flesh and Fruit. Truth it is,
that they be wyndie, but that is taken from them by rosting, chiefly if they
be put into fine Wine: there is made of them Conferna very excellent, as
Marmolade, and small Morsels, and they make Potages and Brothes, and Cakes of
them very excellent: they are subject that there be made of them any manner of
Conserua, and any manner of meat: there be so many in Spain, that they bring
from Velez Melaga every year to Seuill, ten or twelve Caruelles laden with
them. They be sown of the same Plants that are set, the smallest of them,
or pieces of the greatest in the Earth that is well tilled, and they grow very
well, and in eight Months the roots wax very gross, so that you may eat
of them: They be temperate, and being roasted, or otherwise dressed, they soften
the Belly, and being raw, they are not good to be eaten, because they are
wyndie, and hard of digestion.

Of the Canes which are good for the shortness of breath.
THey bring from the new Spain great Canes, of a Cane that are covered within
without with a certain gum, to me it seems that it is mingled with the
juice of Tabaco, it is heavy. It seems that the Cane is anointed, as a thing
that the clingeth fast, it is clunged well to the said Cane, and it is of a
black colour, and being hard it clingeth not, they kindle the Cane at that
part where the gum is, and the other part of it they put in the mouth, and
they receive that smoke, and with it they cast out from them all fleume and
rottenness, that is in the breast: and this they do when they find themselves
grieved with the shortness of wind, so that they be all ready to choke. I
have seen it done by a Gentleman, who is much pained with it many times, and
receives by it great profit: and did it first with the Tabac^, taking the
smoke of it, and it brought to him the like benefit. And for this cause, I say,
that it seems, to carry with it the juice of the Tabaco, mingled with the one
and with the other. It is done with al assurance, for that we do see it
experimented with manifest assurance in many.

Some being sick of the shortness of breath, that come fro the Indies, For
faintness or shortness of breath.
with it I have seen expel, cast out this rottennes, by taking a little Tabaco
green, chewing the juice of it, with although it be loathsome, it doth them much
good to expel the rottenness fleumes, which are retained within the breasts,
so that they be lightened with it notably. It is a marvelous thing, the great
virtues, and sundry and diverse effects that they do discover of the Tabaco:
for besides that which I have written of it in the second part, of the
marvelous virtues thereof, I determined to make further trial of it, as I have
understood, and seen since that time.

Of the Carlo Sancto.
IN the second part we entreated of the virtues of a Root, that then they
had brought from the new Spain, which they cal Carlo Sancto, now in these
ships they have brought it, with great veneration and estimation: and the root
is called Indica, and they bring written many virtues of it more then they are
woonte too report of the Rosemarie. Now that which hath been experimente^,
and seen since that I wrote of it, I will speak, The virtues thereof.
of this Root, which being made into Powder, given to women that newly brought
Children, who for evil keeping have taken great cold and be numb, it
profits much to provoke them to sweat, and makes them remain clear: it
profits much given with Wine, or water of the flowers of Orenges, unto them
that have a harde labour. There was a Friar which had pains of the Stomach,
History.
and no taste of his Meat, but had an evil breath, and much windynesse, and
all did proceed of cold that he had taken, and little natural heate. He
sod of these Roots in water at his discretion, as the water of the
Sarcaparillia is sodden, and so he drank it continually, at dinner supper for
a long time, and it did so well with him, that he amended his stomach, and
increased the heate of it, whereby he did digest, and consume his meat very
well, and took from him his evil breath, and consumed the winds, and in
taken (...) from two to three Ounces of it, it purges well and easily, and
even as it is good to take, so it is good to work, for that I have purged many
people with it, and it makes a very good work, and purges without pains.
One thing they do evil in those parts, which is, that they never bring them
hither made with good Sugar, if they come so, they would be the better, and of
better taste. They be purges for delicate people, they evacuate the same humour
that the Canafistola doth. Of the Canes of the small Canafistola there is made
an other Conserua very good, which is an excellent purge, Of the Canes in
Conser^.
and delicate: for they take the small Canes, which are growing of a small
time, and sees them in Sugar, and with the seething and Sugar, is taken from
them the sharpness and the dryness which they have, and they are made tender
and soft, and of a very good savour. These being taken, make a very good
work, and purge without grief or molestation, and without all accidents and
faintness that purges are used to procure, for that they are full of good
taste, at the taking of them, and light of working. They are given from two
Ounces to three, I have given them many times with very good success, and have
taken them being sick, and they have wrought very well with me. Of these
Conseruas they bring hither every year from Sancto Domingo, and Puerto Rico
many Barrels full. The Canafistola that is perfect and ripe, is the most
excellent Medicine for to purge withal, of as many as have been known to this
day, and that doth his work best in that which it serves for, and with most
assurance, as it is well known not only to Physicians, but also to all the
world, and doth his work without the hurts and accidents which other
Purgatiue Medicines are used too do, and it is a general Medicine, and
amongst them that are called blessed, is the most blessed of all, whose virtues
and properties we do treat of particularly, in the first part, and that
which we have spoken here, hath been to give relation of the leaves, and
flowers of it, which they have now brought me.

One thing I would they should be advertised of, Note.
that when we are commanded to give Canafistola, to lighten and soften the
belly, and that the common matters may be voided down, is meant that they
should take it a small time before meat be eaten, at the most half an hour
before, for the meat being mingled jointly with it, works with it, and in
this order it makes a very good work, and purges very well, without pains:
which is not done with that which is taken any long time before meat, as two
or three hours before, as now many do use it, for that the meat being
dilated, it makes an end of working. And as it is a thing without strength
and weak, it goes al into vapours, and so sheadeth it self abroad
throughout al the body: if it tarry long, it is converted into meat, and
substance, which I have seen by experience many years wherein I have
practised, that always as I gave it half an hour before meat at the most,
it makes a good work, and if it be given many hours before meat, it
purges, and euacuateth little. Concerning mingling of medicines, which do
purge, with the meat, Hipocrates treats of it in many parts, and Galene in
his Commentaries. And truth it is, that when we will that the Canafistola
should not evacuate, but that the vapours should be spread abroad by the
reins, and all the body, we give it many hours before meat, and then not
working, it performs the effect that we have spoken of.

Of the Balsamo of Tolu.
THey newly bring now from the Firm land, from a Province which is between
Cartagena, Number de Dios, which the Indians call Tolu, a Balsa^o, or liquor,
that is the best thing, and of greatest virtues, of as many things as come
from these parts. They gather it from certain trees, What trees they are
whereof it is gathered.
which are after the manner of little Pines, which cast out many bows to al
parts. It carries the leaf like to Algarrona, al the year it is green,
they are the best which grow in a soft ground well tilled.

How it is gathered.
This Bals^mo the Indians do gather by way of incision, gy^ing certain cuts
in the rind of the tree, for it is thinn^ and soft, and they set underneath
it, near unto the tree, things like to dishes made of wax, which is in that
country black, which they take out of Hives, that certain black Bees do
make in the chappinges of the ground, I have seen brought much of this Wax
into Spain^, Black wax.
and it was spent in Torches, but it was forbidden that none of it should be
spent, for the smoke which it cast from it, had so evil a smell, that it could
not be suffered. They did use this wax in matters of Medicine, for thereof
were made Cerecl^thes, which wrought very good effects, in mittigating grief
of any cold cause, it dissolveth any manner of swellinges, and works many
other good effects. Of this wax the Indians do make vessels like to a
spoon, and set them close to the tree, that they may receive the liquor that
comes out of it, by the places where the cutting^ are made, and from thence
they receive it into those vessels: and it is needful that it be done in
time of great heate, that the cuttinges may cast out the liquor, and in this
time likewise, there soketh out of the joints of the said tree some liquor,
and it is lost because it is so little, and falls into the ground: in the
night time there comes forth none.

This liquor, or Balsamo is very much esteemed amongst the Indians, and is of
great value, and with the notable works which therewith are done, and the
Spaniardes have learned, and by seeing the great works which it makes, they
have brought it hither, as a thing of great estimation, and such a thing as
they buy there for a great price: and they have reason so to do: for one of
the best things that have come from those parts, which have been brought for
Medicine, is this Balsamo, which seems to be better then that of the new
Spain, and in it self appears to have more virtues.

It is of an Alborne colour, very near like to a thing that is gilt, it is not
very thin, nor very thick, The colour manner of it.
it clyngeth fast wheresoever it be laid, and it hath the taste and savour
sweet, and although it be taken, it makes not any horriblenesse, as the
other Balsamo doth: it hath a most excellent smell, like to Limons, insomuch
that wheresoever it be, the good smell thereof gives great contentment, and
it can not be hidden, The works effects of this Balsamo.

How they cure with it.


for a little of it smells much: and if you rub your hand therewith, there
remains a marvelous smell. The works thereof are excellent and very great,
for that it is liquor which is taken out by incision, as they took out in old
time the Balsamo in Egypt: and for al those diseases for which that was good,
this of ours is as good.

It heals al fresh wounds, comforting the parts, and joining them without
making any matter, and without leaving any sign of them. The superfluity that
is in the would must be taken away of what sort soever it be, washed with wine,
joined well in the lips parts thereof, and then the Balsamo laid to it, when
the coldness is out of it, and forthwith a double linen cloth upon it, wet
in the same Balsamo, and so bound that the lips go not a sunder, and
keeping diet, and using letting of blood if it be needful, and not unbinding it
until the fourth day, and they shall find the wound comforted, except that
there be any accident, which causes it to be undone before. And when the
cause is such, that it requires to be dressed every day, by reiterating the
wet Linen cloth in the Balsamo, it will be healed: for the virtue of this
Balsamo is to cause that there be no matter engendered in the wounds, and
especially this Balsamo doth profit in wounds, where there hath been
cuttinges of bones, taking them out that have been divided one from another,
and not touching the rest, for that the virtue of the Balsamo will caste them
out, and having so done, will heal the wound. One of the things wherein this
Balsamo works great effects, is in wounds, and joints, and in cuttinges
of Sinews, in al pricks: for in all these kinds of wounds it makes a
marvelous work, curing and preserving them from extreme cold, and from
running together of Sinews, that they remain not lame. The wounds which do
penetrate, are healed with this Balsamo, being mingled with white wine, and
spouting it into them, and after three hours taking it out again. This must be
done in wounds or pricks, once every da^, that it may go with a moderate
heat. Likewyse this Balsamo serves to be applied, where have been given dry
blows, or brusinges, and for al works of Surgery, where is no notable
inflammation, which being taken away with the Medicines, that are convenient
for it, the Balsamo may then be used.

In diseases that belong not to Surgery.
In evils which belong not to Surgery this Balsamo doth profit much, as in
him that hath the shortness of breath, by taking a few drops in white wine it
profits him much: it takes away the grief of the head coming of a cold
cause, and a little Plaster being laid upon the grief, and wet therewith to
the Temples of the head, takes away all runnings by those parts, and in
especially the evils of the eyes, and Reumes that run into them, being
laid to the foreparte of the head, and it must be good and hot. It takes away
the pains of it, and comfort it, and remedies the Palsy. Some that have
been in a Consumption have used it, taking some drops in the morning,
licking them out of the Palm of the hand, and they have felt notable profit.
And it makes clean the breast very well, it is good to take some drops with
Aqua vitae, hot, before any manner of cold in a Quarterne Ague, or of a long
importunate tertian Ague, anointing with the same Balsamo, mingled with Oil
of Ruda, the Temples of the head, good and hot before the cold doth come. If
with the Balsamo they anoint themselves from the mouth of the stomach to the
Nau^l, it comfort the stomach, it gives a lust to meat, it helps
digestion, it dissolveth Winds, it takes away the pains of the stomach, and
it works far better these effects, if the half of the Balsamo be mingled
with another half of Oil of Spike Nard^ compounded or simple, and so it is
better applied. There is great experience of it in the Indies, for Swellinges
that are in the manner of Dropsies: and mingling it with ointment, disopilatiue
of equal parts, and anointing the belly therewith, chiefly the part near ye
Lunges, there are seen wrought therewith great effects: it dissolveth any
manner of swelling or hardness that is in any part of the body, and being laid
upon any pain that comes of a cold cause, although it be of long
continuance, it takes it away, bringing it to be so small until it fall of it
self, the same it doth wheresoever is any wind. And if it be in the belly,
or in any part of the body, wetting a Linen cloth hot in Aqua vitae of the
best, and applying it to the place, where the grief of the Stone is, and
mingled with Oil made for the purpose, it makes a great work, it takes
away the pains of the Sinews, and when they be shronke together, in a very
hot weather, rubbing them with it, it dissolveth them. The evil called the
Lamparones that are open or shut, it heals. Many other effects this
marvelous liquor works which I have not known, but these which I have
known I do manifest to al the world, that they may take profit by so
marvelous a Medicine, which hath so many virtues as you have heard, and every
day the time will discover other greater.

comparable to the same. The third book shows the mischiefs that grow by
drinking of drinks what, and what Benefit doth follow by drinking our
drinks cold, c. And Sir, finding many thankfully to take my said former
simple travel too you heretofore dedicated: and your Woorship above all desert
of my part too recompense the same, and being earnestly and often exhorted, by
the learned Phisitio Master Doctor Hector Nones to translate these said 3.
Books also, the remanent of Monardes works, to make my Countrymen of England
Partakers of the benefit of the same, I took it in hand, as inflamed with the
great commendations that this Learned Man made of the said three Books, and
especially of the Book treating of the benefit of iron and steel in
physic. And having now thus finished the whole work, I dedicate the same to
your woorship, as to the man to whom I am most bound, and that doth of many
best deserve the same, requesting you too take it in good part to bear with
the base doing of the same. And calling to remembrance of what moment in
sometimes A man of value may be to a common Weal, and howe common in the world
the practise of poison is, what malice reigns now among men, how needful it is
that some kind of persos should fear provide for the worst, and weighing that by
our Persian merchants and by other means the Bezaar stone this great Jewel is
brought into the realm, and may be compassed in this our time for a little
money: And withal, weighing that Iron and steel be things tending so much to the
cure of al diseases, and be the natural home commodities of England and such
as are common, and that are both easily and cheaply to be had by every poor
subject, I have the rather for the ready benefit that might ensue, taken the
dispatch of the translation in hand with purpose no longer to keep the same
out of print: and so I most humbly take my leave, from London the xv. of June.
MDLXXX.

Your worships most bownden Iohn Prampton.

(...) bewail him hereof: in that so little a Herb can offend him, and so
small a fruit or stone may destroy him.

Against al these venomes as well in general as in particular, the Physicians
as well Greekes as Arabiens Latinistes wrote effectual remedies as well general
as particular. Amongst the which they put one in practise, that in times past
was had in great estimation, and taken for a present remedy, for the great
virtues and marvelous effects, which it wrought against all venoms and
accidents thereof, which they called the Bezaar stone. But as time is the
discoverer of all things: so is it the destroyer and consumer of every thing:
for in having been hid so long from us, we knew no more what the Bezaar stone
was, then as if it had never been: and the name thereof was so strange and
unknown unto us, even as the Towns in Scitia. Time it self willing to
restore again unto us this precious stone hidden from us so many years; not
only discovered the same unto us, but jointly therewith hath descried unto us
an herb, which hath the like virtues and effects against all manner of
venom, which herb is called Escuerconera, having been discovered but a few
years past to our exceeding great profit and commodity.

The herb Escuerconera.
And because these two things, to wit, the Bezaar stone, and the Herb
Escuerconera, be so like in operation, and have so many and the self same
virtues against venom, that I determined to write of them both together, and to
show the proper virtues of these two things so excellent in medicine: it is
needful first to know, and therefore treat of the venomes as a beginning of
the work; and to declare what Uenom is, and the cause of such as have taken
Uenom, and then the remedies thereof, and howe they may be preserved from
them: and therefore we will treat first of Uenom, for that it will serve not a
little for the intent of that which we mind to write of the Bezaar stone, and
the Herb Escuerconera.

Uenom is a thing, which being taken at the mouth, or applied outwardly, doth
overcome our bodies, by making them sick, or by corrupting of them, or by
killing them: and this is found in one of these four things; in plants, in
minerals, in beasts, or in mixtures, the which works their effects, either
by manifest quality, or by hidden property, or both. These venoms partly do
kill us; partly we use them for our profit, and bodily health; and partly the
people of ancient tune did use them for a remedy against their great labours.
That which doth offend us as well in general, as in particular, Dioscorides
in his sixth book of his history of Plants doth treat of very exactly,
Dioscorides.
putting in general these remedies, and in particular, that which is
convenient for every one of them: and the same did other Greekes, Latinistes,
and Arabians, which are to be seen, who will more particularly know of them.

These did write of many Medicines, with the which every one may preserve
themselves from poison: for the malice of mankind is very great, and many
have procured for their interest, and revenge, not only with venom to offend
and kill the common sort of people; but also Emperors, Kings, great Princes
and Lords; the which in how much more high estate they are appointed and
placed, so much the more danger they are in.

And many notable men of the old Writers fearing this, did compound many and
diverse Medicines, that by means of them they might not be hurt by venom or
venomous things that might be given them. As for example, the Emperor Marco
Antonio did use such things, The Emperor Marco Antonio.
who fearing to be poisoned, took every morning a little Triacle and
Methridate. Sometimes his confection Methridatica, other times certain Leaves
of Rue, with Nuts and Figs: and so they did use the like medicines because
they (...) and inward and outward burning, that it seems to them they are
fired.

It is also necessary (to know what venom they took) for too see the vomit,
To know what venom it was.
and what they do cast up withal, to judge by the colour what Uenome it was:
and being known by this way, or by Relation, or otherwise being apparent,
it must be remedied by his contrary, for to estinguish and kill the malice
thereof, as all the ancient Physicians have sufficiently written of, as well
in general against all, as in particular against every one of them, for that
every one hath his contrary effects for to remedy the malice thereof.

The tokens that he most evil in them that have taken Uenome, Evil signs.
be often soundinges, and to cast up the white of their eyes, they do wax
very red, and put out their tongue very great, and black, and the pulse fa^,
cold sweet universally throughout all their body, chiefly in the extreme
parts, and in their breasts, and they are desirous to vomit, but cannot, and
they have their understanding troubled: and this is in al kind of venom being
taken, or by bytings of venomous beasts, in so much that they talk idly as
though they had the frenzy which is a mortal sign.

It is needful, for the better knowledge what Uenom it was, To know what
venom (...) was.
that it be seen if there did remain any thing of that which they had eaten
or drunken, and to see what was that which was mingled therewith, judging it by
the colour, the smell and the taste, or giving it to a Dog, a Hen, or a Catt,
and mark howe it works with them: For if any of them wax sad or heavy,
it is a token that there is venom; and if they dye, it is a token that the
venom was strong.

And being known to be venomed the first thing that is to be procured, The
cure.
is, that he which is sick do vomit, which is the thing that doth most
profit, because there should be no time for the venom to enter, by the veins,
and arteires, for to come to the hart, for if it come thither, it is past all
mans help: and therefore it is convenient that this remedy of Uomite be done
with all speed, that it may be expelled, before it pass from the Stomach.
And for to cause Uomite, there must be procured things that in very short
time will provoke it, as to put the fingers in hot water, and the most
common thing is sweet Oil, drinking much quantity thereof in such sort,
that they fill their Bellies therewith, that it may the better be expelled:
the which having received, they shall with their Fingers, or feather provoke
them to vomit, which must be done until that you perceive that all that be
expelled, and cast out, which was eaten or drunken, which did hurt. And if the
Oil be not sufficient too do this; there may be mad^ things for to cause
Uomite, beginning by the most Weak, as the seething of Dill, the Seed of
Radish of Camamell and other like things that do provoke Uomite, adding to
the seet^ing, if it be needful, a Dram of Agarico, the which although it
do provoke vomit strongly, it hath also the Property to break the strength
of the venom. Some for a great secrete do give a Pint of Water of the
Flowers of Orenges warm, which although it doth provoke Uomite, it hath also
a particular virtue too extinguish, and kill the strength of the Uenome, it
must be given hot the quantity of a Pynte. And he^reof it comes that the
Water taken out of the Flowers of Orenges which is a kind of Cydron, hath
great virtue against Uenome, as we have written in a little Book which is
printed with others of mine in Latin, that doth treat of Orenges. It is
very good that with the thing which provokes Uomite, there be mingled
things that have virtue against venom, as Triacle, Methridato, and other like
things, the which hereafter we will treat of.

(...) mu^t be given the remedies, that are too be done for the Cures and
Diseases that the venom is cause of; not forgetting the principal cause which
is to kill and to destroy the malice, that is the cause thereof with the
medicines and Remedies that I will speak of hereafter.

If he that hath taken venom do not perceive nor know what manner of venom
it was that he took, nor the Accidents thereof do show; It is to be thought
that it was of the venomes which do their work of their own property which
is the worst of all kind of venomes: Venom of his o^ne property.
then it is convenient that there be had more care procuring vomit, and that
it be effectually done, as it is aforesaid. And if any be descend in^o the
Guts, let him have a gentle Glister that in all properties hath a known
virtue against venom, which remedies are called Bezaarticas, the which must
be used at all times with his meat, and drink, procuring the inward and
outward comforting of the principal members, and using meates of substance
that may give great strength, taken out by a small press and in any other
sort that is needful, in the which there must be put things that have
v^rtue against all kind of venom, of the which we will tr^ate of hereafter.

And this must be done, not only in them that be venomed with unknown
Uenome which works the malice of it own property, but in such as have
taken known Uenome which works by quality: for that the Uenome is a thing
that doth most of all pull down and weaken nature, making lean very
quickly, and overthrowing the virtue and strength thereof. These medicines
which have this virtue and special property against these venomes, are many:
some be simples and other compounds: and because there are many of the one
and of the other, I will speak of them that are most used, and where is seen
greater experience of the which are compounded. The principal is the triacle
that Andromacho wrote of, the which if it be well made, is the most principal
medicine of as many as ever have been compounded against al kind of venom.
Triacle.
And although it be of a true composition, yet there lacks some medicines
always to do that which is possible; we do see that in this case it doth
marvelous effects, and not only being taken with some water made for the
purpose, but also being put into pricks or bytings of venomous beasts, and
likewise in Apostomes full of poison which are made in the time of the Plague.

The Methridate is of very great effect, in this case, and doth serve
sometimes for triacle. Methridat^ and compouded medicines.
That of Cidrons and Emeralds do make a marvelous work, in al venom. The
earth S^gillata hath a prerogative above them, especially in fevers which have
an evil quality. The triacle Diathesaron, is for the purpose in cold venoms
and in bytinges of venomous beasts, and in especially in the biting of a beast
that is made. And so you have many other compounded medicines that have virtue
and property against venom: but these which I have spoken of, are the most
principal, and found most true by experience.

The simple medicines be many, the most principal is the earth Lemnia so
celebrated of the old wryters, in especially of Galen, who only to see it,
Medicine^-simples. Lemnia.
and to see how the priests did make it, sayl^d to the Land of Lemnos that at
this day is called Estalimene, which is the most principal simple medicine that
the Greekes knew.

The true Diptamo is another which ^roweth in the Island of Creta, which at this
day is called Candia, Diptamo.
whereunto the people of the Isle do run, when they feel themselves (...)
in vain. Likewise it is to be given to them that are bitten w^th venomous
beasts, or pricked of them, because it may extinguish and kill the malice of
the venom: And although that these pouders are of so much virtue as
aforesaid, the Bezaar stone is of greater virtue and excellency, for that in
it alone is found all the virtues and properties that are in all medicines
which we have already spoken of, by his own property hidden and by grace from
heaven infused into it against venomes: which you shall find to be the best
and most present remedy of all others, as we will show in that which
follows.

Of the Bezaar stone.
THis Bezaar stone hath many n^mes: for the Arabiens do cal it Hagar, The names
of the stone.
the Persians Bezaar, the Indians Bezar, the Hebrewes Belzaar, ye Greekes
Alexipharm^cum, the Latinistes Against venom, the Spaniardes the stone against
venom sounding. Conrado Gesnero in his book that he made of beasts, Conra^o.
speaking of the Goat of the mountain, saith that this name Belzaar is an
Hebrew name, for that ( ben) in Hebrewe is as much to say as Lord, and ( za^)
venom, as if ye would say, Lord of the venomes and by good reason it is so
named, seeing that this stone is Lady of the venomes, and doth extinguish and
destroy the as being Lady, and mistress over them. And of this it comes that
al things that are against poison, or venomous things are called Bezaarticas,
for their excellency.

This stone is engendered in the inner part of a beast, that is commonly called
a Goat of the mountain. Where they are engendered.
The ingendering of stones in beasts is a common thing; and also in man
chiefly, there is no part^ in his body, wherein they be not engendered: and
likewise in birds, and fishes, rats of the field.

Plinie in his 28. book the 9. chapter, says that the wild hearts go to
the hollow places where snakes and serpents are; Plinie.
and with their breath do bring them forth and eat them. And this is
gathered hereby, that they do it either to heal them of some disease; or to
wax young again, that they may live many years. The Arabiens do amplify this
cause and say, that the wild hearts by eating of these serpents, come to
engender the Bezaar stone; and they declare it in this manner.

In these East parts are bred certain beasts, which are called hearts,
History.
which for the great heate of the Somm^r go into the ^aues and hollow places,
where the adders and snakes and other vermin being of poison are, which in that
country be many, and very venomous, because the country is so hot; and with
their breath they drive them out, and tread upon them, and kill them, and eat
them; and after they are filled with them, they go as speedily as they can
where water is, and they plundge themselves therein, in such sort that they
leave no part of their bodies out, but their snout, for to fetch their breath:
and this they do, that with the coldness of the water they may delay the great
heate of the venom, which they have eaten: and there they remain without
drinking a drop of water, until they have allayed and cooled, that fervent
heate, wherein they were by feeding upon the venomous vermin. And being in
the water there doth engender in the places w^ere the drops of water comes
forth of their eyes, a stone, which being come forth of the water, falls
from them, and it is gathered up for the use of medicine. This is tha^ in
eff^ct which the Arabiens do write of the manner howe the Bezaar stone is
engendered. I have procured and with great diligence sought to find out by such
as have come fro^ t^e India of Portingal, and such as have past beyond the
China to know the truth of this matter: and it is thus.

In the greatest India, (where Ptolomeo doth write to be found so much goods
and so great riches before the River Ganges in certain mountains which do
ioyn^ with the Country of China, How the Bezaar stone is ^ngendered.
) there do breed certain beasts like to Hearts as well in greatness as in
swiftness, and are very much like unto hearts, saving in some respect they do
participate with goats, as well in their horns which they have like a goat,
being turned backward, as in the making of the body: whereby they give them
the name of goats of the mountain: wherein in my opinion they are deceived,
for they rather ought to be called heart goats, in that they have the parts
and likenesses of both, which is of a heart and of a goat. These heart Goats
in those parts do use themselves like to the hearts, that Plinie speaks of,
in these places as is aforesaid, that go to the dens of wild venomous
beasts, and with their breathing cause them to come forth and eat them: and
afterward do go whereas water is, and do plundge themselves therein, until
they perceive that the fury of the venom which they have eaten be past, and
until then they dare not drink a drop. And being come forth from th^nce,
they go into the fields, and there they eat many healthful herbs, of
great virtue, which are against venom, which they by their natural instinct
do know: that there do arise as well of the venom which they have eat, as of
the herbs which they have fed on, being engendered by means of the natural
heate, and by that virtue which is declared, being infused at the time of the
generation in the inner parts of the bowels, in other parts of their bodies,
certain stones, of the greatest and of the smallest sort, which is a thing of
great admiration, of the greatest virtue that to this day is known against
venom. It is understood of that venom which is so pernicious and ^urtful that
they did eat; of those herbs being so healthful that they fed upon, by a
marvelous work, the Bezaar stone is engendered.

And as they say which come from those parts, and have seen this beast from
whom they take out these stones, The figure of the beast.
he is of the greatness of a heart and well near of this making, he hath
only two broad horns, with the points sharpe, turned and falling much
backward, his hair is thick and gross of a mingled colour, for the most
part, and reddishe, and of other colours: you have many of them in those
mountains. The Indians do hurt them and kill them with weapons and with
snares and gins: and they be so fearce, that sometimes they kill some of
them: they are very swift on foot, and leppe much, they live in hollow places
of the ground, they go in companies, there be males and females, their
voices are roarings: they take out the stones from the inner part of their
bowels, and of other hollow parts of the body, and they use much diligence
in the taking out of them, by reason the Portingales that do trade thither,
give much for these stones, that they do so take out, and they carry them to
the China, to sell; and from thence to Maluco, and from Maluco to Calicut, for
there is the greatest utterance of them, and they do esteem so much of them,
that one is worth there, being fine, fifty crowns, as they are here.

And as I was writing this treatise I went to see a beast, that should seem
to be the same, History.
by reason he hath all those marks which those of that parts have, which I
saw in the house of the Archedeacon of Mebla, being a worthy Gentleman,
which was sent him from very far Countries, by the way of Africa, and is in
this form and fashion: He is a Beast of the greatness of a wild heart, he
hath the same hair, colour, and horne, His figure.
that a heart hath, he hath the face, the head, and the tail like a heart; he
is swift in running, like to a heart, his snout is like to the hearts, and
likewise his countenance, his body is like to a Goat, for he is like to a
great he Goat; and hath two horns turned backward, somewhat falling, with
the points wrested, that he seems to be like a he goat, and all the rest
like to a heart. There is one thing in this beast which is greatly to be
marvelled, for if he fall from a Tower down to the ground, he lyteth upon
his horns, and receives no hurt thereby, but rather doth rebound as a ball
of wind in the air: he eats grass, bread, and all that you give him, he
is of great strength, and is always tied with a Cheyne, because he breketh
and bites asunder the cords. I do look still when he will dye, or that they
will kill him, to see if he have the Bezaar stone.

The form of the stones.
The making and fashion of the stones be of diverse manners for that some be
long as the stones of Dates, others be like to Chestnuttes, others like to
round pellottes, of earth, such as are shot in Crossebowes, others like to the
eggs of Pigeons, I have one like to the kidney of a kidd, there are none that
be sharpe pointed.

And as these stones be diverse in their makings so they do vary in their
colours, His colour.
some have the colour of a dark bay, others be of an ash colour, commonly
they be of a green colour, and with black spots, such spots as the
Cattes of Algallia have, of a sad gray colour, all which are finely compounded
of certain thin skales, or rindes, one upon an other, like to the skales of
on Onion, very artificially set, and those rindes are so excellent and so
glistering, that it seems as though every one of them were burnished by art,
and so taking away that which is uppermost of all, that which remains is much
more glistering, and shining, then that which was taken away: and hereby they
are known to be fine, and true, and only for this I took away from that
which I have, the uttermost shale, that was upon him, and that whic^ remained
was as glistering and more then the ^rst, these shales are greater or smaller
according to the greatness of the stone, it is a light stone and easy to be
scraped or cut, like to Alabaster, because it is soft: if it be long in the
water, it dissolveth. It is light.
It hath no heart nor foundation in the inner part, whereupon he is formed,
but rather is somewhat hollow, and the hollowness is full of powder of the
same substance that the stone is of, which is the best. And this is the best
way to know whether the stone be fine and true when it hath that powder, for
they which are false, have it not, and by these two things they which are
fine and true, may well be known from those which are false and counterfayt.
Which are fine.
In them that are most t^ue be these thin skales and rindes, glistering and
shining one upon another; and the inner part hath that powder which I have
spoken of: and those which are not true have neither the one nor the other. For
I saw one that was broken, to see if it were fine and it had shales, and in
the inner part it had a grain or seed whereby the Indian deceived many.

Guido de Lanazaris, a man naturally borne in this City, Guido de Lanazaris.
which travelled all the round world over, and was in those parts of the
China, said unto me, that there were Indians that counterfeited them with a
composition that they use and know, but the two things which is aforesaid
they could never bring to pass: to wit, the glistering skales, and the
powder, that is in the inner part. And he said to me, In great estimation.
that they were there much more esteemed then amongst us, because they be
healed with them of many diseases.

Andrew Belunensis ^o^h allege of Tipthas Arabien, Andrewe Belunensi^.
in a book that he wrote of stones, and says that the Bezaar stone is a
mineral, and that it is taken out after the same manner as the other particular
stones are, of his min^ries as the Diamonds, Rubies, Es^raldes, and Agatas:
and it seems that Serapio doth so understand it, when he spake of this
stone. He said that the Mineral of this stone is in the land of Syria, and
of the India, and East Countries, in the which they were deceived: for that it
is clearly seen that they are taken out of the said Beasts, which the
Indians do take out with great diligence as we have said: and there is
seen in them the work and manifest effect which we will speak of.

Serapio doth show, that in his time there were likewise of these
counterfeit stones which he says have not the virtue against Uenome as the
true Bezaar hath. Serapio.
Of this stone I find no Greek Author which hath written of it, The old
Writers wrote of this stone.
nor Latinist: only amongst the Arabiens this matter is treated of, and in
some late Writers which we will speak of hereafter, and for this cause only
the Ancient Writers, being Arabiens that wrote of it, and the late Writers
Latinistes and those of our time, amongst the Arabiens, he that did most
largely write of it, was Serapio a learned man, in his medicinal History in
the 306. Chapter where he writes many things of this Bezaar stone worthy
too be known, Serapio of his virtue.
the which of his own authority he shows how great excellency this stone
hath against all kind of Uenome, of what m^nner and quality soever it be, and
against the bytinges of Uenomous beasts, extinguishing and taking away the
ground, and evil quality, that the venomes do infuse into the bodies,
delivering them from death that shall use it. It is given in Powder, and they
say that it doth the same effect by chewing of it, Note.
or holding of it in the Mouth: for after it is taken, it doth provoke sweat
and doth expel the venom, and makes the work sure, saying that being
carried about any person, that it touch the flesh, and bringing it over the
left part, it doth preserve him that shall so carry it about him that no
venom or venomous thing shall offend him: for being applied to the body, it
resists venom that it may not offend him: and them that be infected
therewith it heals. And this it doth not only to them that have taken
venom, but unto such that have had it put into their Syrope, apparel, or
letter, or other part that may offend them. The same Serapio says, that
this Stone doth profit much against bytinges of beasts that are venomous,
and in their Pricks taking the Powder thereof at the mouth, and provoking
sweat, it expels it from the inner parts: it profits much, too cast the
powder of this stone in Pricks, or in wounds made by these venomous beasts,
for it destroys and takes away the malice of the venom, and although that
the soars being so made by these beasts do begin to corrupt, it cures
and heals them, and the powder of this stone being put upon the venomous
beasts doth take away their strength, and if it be put in place where they do
wound any, although they make a sore, yet the malice of the venom doth not take
hold^.

And this is seen by experience in the venomous beasts called Adders and
Snakes, for the powder being put in place where they do byte, all their
venomous strength is taken away and nothing doth remain but the sign
thereof. Three grains of this powder we with some liquor, being cast upon
snakes and adders they dye forthwith. Thus much Serapio says.

Rasis Simia of Gallen a man amongst the Arabiens most learned in the book
which he wrote called Continent, Rasis. Simia of G^len.
says thus: the Bezaar stone is that which seems some what yellow and
soft, without any manner of taste, the which he says that he hath
experimented two times, and hath found in it virtue of great efficacy against
Napelo the strongest of all venomes. He saith also that he hath seen in this
stone the most marvelous effects against all venom that ever he saw in any
Medicine, that was against v^nome either simple or compound, or any
composition made against venom, as Triacles, or other compositions, for that
the Bezaar stone is of more efficacy and virtue then any of them. The same
doth agree with the books he made to the King Almasor, saying, The evil
Uenoms that do offend the heart and work their effect, O how little profit
doth any cure prove in them, if the Bezaar be not taken, for that doth resist
it: and he says, Moreover I my self saw that it did resist the venom called
Napelo which is the Uenome that doth penetrate more then all venoms: thus much
of Rasis.

An other Moore very learned and a great Astronomer that wrote of stones
figured under Signs and Planets and the virtues they have, was called Hamech
Benreripho: he in his book that he wrote of the virtue of Plants and of
stones and of beasts, that serve for the use of Medicine, says the Bezaar
stone is against all venom, and it hath besides this particular property
taken in powder against the bytinges of Scorpions, and being carried about one,
and graven upon, he is safe against all the bytinges of venomous beasts. An
other Moore called Abdala Narache, a learned man in medicine, says, that the
Bezaar stone is against all Uenome, he saw it as a precious thing in the hands
of the King of Cordoua called Miramamolim unto whom was given strong venom:
The king of Cordiua.
and having given unto him the Bez^ar stone, by means whereof he was delivered
wholly of the venom; forthwith the King gave his royal Palace to him that
gave him the stone, which delivered him from this imminent death: and surely it
was a great gift of a king, the chief Palace of Cordoua, at this day day
being a thing so notable and of such great value: and the stone was much
esteemed, for that so great a price was given for it. Auensoar.
Auensoar a Physician of the Moors, but a natural Spaniarde of Penaflore a
place lying between Cordoua and Seuill, gave unto one, who was very much
lamented, by reason he had taken very evil Uenom, of the Bezaar stone the
weight of 3. grains with the water of Goords, for that it was hot venom,
because it did seem to be so. For as soon as he had taken it, there did
appear upon him the Iaundice very yellow, and he was very well delivered and
saved from it.

Aueroiz a Physician and a Philosopher very excellent, being a Spaniarde, and
borne in Cordoua, Aueroi^*
says that the Bezaar stone is in great estimation and very profitable
against all venomous bytinges, and especially against the bitinges of
Scorpions.

Haliabas doth make mention of the Bezaar stone in three places where he
treats of Uenomes, Haliabas.
but he passes it over lightly, only showing that it is soft, and saith that
it must be scoured in water and that the water of it must be given to them that
are poisoned.

Rabbi Moises of Egypt, but borne in Spain, a most cunning Physician, who
followed Gallen in all his works, Rabbi Mo^ses.
in the book he made of venomes in the first thing that he treated of in the
third Chapter speaking of simple Medicines and the use of them which are
convenient for the bytinges of Uenomous beasts, says the simple Medicines
that we have amongst us of most profit and greatest experience which are of
many approved are the seed of the Cidron c. And the other is the Emerald a
marvelous medicine agayn^t all venom c. Gallen made mention of the third
which is the Bezaar stone that is taken out of a beast, the which stone is like
to an akorn, the colour thereof is green and doth engender by little and little
making it self gross: for that they find in it o^e scale upon another, some
do say that they are engendered in the corners of the eyes of certain sheep
that are in the East parts: other do say that they are engendered in the
purse of the gall of the said sheep which (...) poisoned, I caused him to take
thereof diverse Mornings the weight of three grains of the same Bezaar stone
with the water of Oxetongue, and he was therewith very well healed.

Many Physicians of late time and in our days have made mention of this Bezaar
stone and do very much extol the same in their books with great
Prerogatives, Physicians of late time.
against all kind of venom and against many other diseases, which we mind to
treat of, to see what we find written by every one of them. Amongst whom
Andrewe Mathiolus of Siena, a man very well learned, in the Commentaries which
he wrote most learnedly upon Dioscorides in the sixth book, Mathiolus.
declaring the Medicines that are against venom, by special property, doth
write of the Bezaar stone very geeat virtues, and doth approve it to be a
medicine and remedy most principal that at this day is known in the World
against venom, and he doth refer that, as is said, unto the Authors which
we have alleged.

Andrewe de Laguna borne in Segouia, who amongst the learned was named Galen
the Spaniarde for the Commentaries which he made upon the sixth book of
Dioscorides in the Spanish tongue, Andrew de Laguna.
where he treats of venomes, he shows how present a remedy the Bezaar
stone is against all kind of venom and against the bytinges of venomous
beasts, and against pestilent Agewes of evil quality, and also that it is a
great remedy against the falling sickness, that it doth expel the stone
of the Raynes, and being given with Wine, it breaks the stone in the
Bladder. There he notes howe this Stone is engendered in certain Goats of
the Mountains of Persia, and howe the stones that are the best be bright, and
skaley and soft, of the colour of a Fruit of Spain called Beringena, which
is a remedy much commended amongst Princes and great lords for the effects
aforesaid.

Valescus de Taranto, a Physician and borne in Milan, Valescus.
the scholar of Tornamira, in the 7. book of his experiments, praises very
much this Bezaar stone, to be of great force against venom and other diseases
for his effects, and for the great fame that was of his works, in this time
against al venom. Saint Ardonius of Pesauris Physician, in a book which he
made of venomes, exceedingly praises the Bezaar stone prefers it before all
other medicines, as well simples as compounds, which have virtue against venom
or by^inges of venomous beasts: and says, that he saw it and proved it by
great experience.

Amato Lucitano, a learned man of our time, Amato Lucitano.
being now resident in Ragosa, in his commentaries which he wrote upon
Dioscorides in the second book of Ceruigenitale, did treat of this Bezaar
stone very learnedly, as a man of Portingal, who did much inform himself of
those of his nation that came from the East India, and he says that the
Bezaar stone is of the making of an acorn, full of spots, declining to the
colour of a sad blew, compounded with many shales, the which they call Bezaar,
as a present remedy against al manner of venom, and they take them out of
certain beasts which are like to wild hearts, that are in the East India,
and are called goats of the mountains: they are found in their bowels and
inner parts, of the which being give 3. grains with the waters of the flowers
of Orenges, it is the present remedy against all Uenom, killing and
extinguishing, the venomes, and force thereof, it kills the worms give with
water of Verdolagas, where the fever is, and where there is no fever with white
wine: he says that he hath experience, and hath cured therewith the plu^esie
being very sore rooted, it is convenient that it be given to them, that have
taken venom, in vomittes, and it will expel the venom, and being given to them
that have vomited of beasts speaking of the goat, doth much commend this
Bezaar stone to be against al veno. Other authors there be that make mention of
this stone, but they pass it lightly over, only praising it to be good against
venom, in general and in particular, the which at this present I lightly pass
over, for it is sufficiently spoken of by those before rehearsed, whereby it may
have authority with al those that thereof will profit themselves.

That as I have seen by experience.
That which I have seen by experience I will now speak of for the more
confirmation of the said cause, and of the marvelous virtues which it hath,
whereby it may be understood what is written by these authors aforesaid, with
manifest examples. It is about 14. years past that my Lady the Duchess of B^jar
was advertised by the Lord don Iohn Mauriques that in the Court was used for
such as did sound, a stone that was called the Bezaar, for that my Lady the
Duchess had a son very sick of the said disease, well near since the time of
his birth, and she being desirous of his health did procure to know what
remedy might be had, and seeing the ordinary remedies of Physic which they
had ministered unto him being many and diverse by the wisest Physicians of
Spain, and yet not prevailed any thing; and hearing of the great virtue of
this Bezaar stone, they had communication with me thereof: yet was it to me
somewhat strange, for that I had no other knowledge thereof then by books,
and I thought that it had not been in these parts: then I requested that the
stone might be sent for being desirous to ease this Lord, for his virtues
deserved the same, and his great knowledge in al kind of learning, and in al
things that a noble man might have knowledge in, as also to see the stone which
was a thing of me much desired. The stone was sent for to Lishebron by means
of a Genoues, and there was brought two of them very fair wrought in gold,
and each of them as great as a Date stone and somewhat greater, of colour
green and blackishe, like to a Beringena which is a fruit of Spain, and the
stone being brought, not a little to our contentment, every one gave their
judgment, it was agreed yt at such time as he should sownde, it should
presently be given him: and the sownding being come in the evening he toke
forth with the appointed order, which was brought from the court, that he
should take forthwith the weight of three grains of the powder of the stone,
and it should be cast in water of Oxetongue so much as might be sufficient for
him, and so it was done. Opening his mouth he swallowed it down, the which he
did with much difficulty; within the space of half a quarter of an hour,
after he had taken it, he recovered as easily, as though he had not had it.
And seeing the virtue that was in the stone, we did esteem it much, and the
more for that we saw that every time it toke him, he came to himself so
easily, and when he toke not the stone, the sounding did continue long, and he
returned from it with great pains, and in long time it seized not: but when
the stone was given him he came quickly to himself and with great easiness,
as though he had not had any sownding at all. My Lady the Duchess carried the
stone in her purse, and had the quantity that he should take always in a
readiness, because when the sownding came to him, it might be given him with
more speed, because he should not be long in payne: so that from the time
that he received it, his soundings came not to him so continually as they did
before. This being perceived, I said one day to my Lady, that it was the
doctrine of Physicians, that the medicines which do not heal diseases, cannot
preserve that we fall not into them, but that it seemed good to me that we
should give unto him every morning the powder of the Bezaar stone, that with
the continual use thereof, the vapour might be consumed which did rise up to
the brains, so that what seems to be venomous and hurtful, the stone would
extinguish and kill, and would consume the vapour that rises up fro all the
body, and from

A Child did eat a certain venomous thing, whereby he was in danger of
death, and seeing that the common remedies did not profit, I caused to be given
to the child the Bezaar stone, and immediately it was well. And for children
that have worms, it is likewise very good, for that it causes them to be
expelled by dissolution, marvelously taking away the accidents, that are wont
to happen to children. And this it works wheresoever you fear any grief or
venomous humour. In the things that it hath done most good, hath been in the
pestilence, for that there was in Germany a great Plague, and unto all such as
had the Bezaar stone given them, immediately was seen the great effect that it
did in them that toke it. And in an Hospital were four persons infected with
this evil, and it was given to two of them and not to the other, and they
that took it escaped, and the other two dyed. And then it was given to many
that were infected with this evil, and some of them had two sores, and some
had three, and yet they escaped and of this were witnesses many people of
great credit that saw it and other meaner persons, as it is very well known
to all the Court.

For them that are sad and melanch^lie.
This stone doth profit much to them that be sad and melancholic, the Emperor
toke it many times for this effect, and it is taken of many persons that are
melancholic: for it takes it away, and makes him glad and merry that uses it
and to be of a good disposition. Many I have seen that have been much
diseased with faintness, soundinges and melancholy, and taking the weight of
three grains of this stone with the water of Oxtongue they have bin healed
presently. In fevers of an evil quality and most pestilent, it is marvelous
the good work that it doth: for that it takes away the malice thereof,
extinguishing and killing the evil quality of the venom, which is the first
and principal thing that the Physician should do, for if that this be not
taken away first, the cure is in vain. Many do use this stone holding a piece
thereof in their mouth in the suspected time of a Pestilence, and whereas venom
is feared, or any thing that is venomous, and also it doth profit much taking
it in water to them that are sick of pestilent Fevers.

A Gentleman had all his servants sick of Agewes, History.
that are commonly called Modorras, and he put into a pot of water a Bezaar
stone that he had, of the which he caused the sick people to drink, and they
all escaped and were delivered from death. And many people for this cause, have
this stone laid in water continually, that they may drink thereof being
sick, for it profits much to take away the Agewe, and gives strength to the
hart, and not only this stone doth profit in venomous things and venomes,
but in other diseases, as it hath bin proved: being given to them that have the
gidines in the head, it doth much profit, and also against opilations. And it
happened that a Nun that had sowndinges and great opilations, by taking the
Bezaar stone was healed, and likewise of the opilations: and being long time
without her customed terms, they came very well too her and abundantly. This
stone profits much to them that have taken Arsenike or other cursive venom,
for that it doth kill and consume the force of the venom, and takes away the
accidents thereof. Milk hath in this a great prerogative, and doth work
effectually, by taking much quantity, and continually using the same, for
although that it be a marvelous remedy, it must be used in cursive venomes,
for that it makes the venomes to be expelled by vomit, and doth extinguish the
malice. It is the true Antidote against cursive venom, and after the use
thereof, the stone may be given or the powder, or any of the said medicines,
that have virtue against venom. Also this stone doth profit much against
fevers that bring certain red spots in the body like to Flea-bytinges, that
commonly do appear in their shoulders, and in their archter parts of the
body: these do come in sore Agewes, that do expel the humours out of the
body, and so it is convenient that it be so used that it may come out well,
and this must be done by putting bentosit^es, and other like helps, that may
expel the humour, whereby nature is helped, forbidding oyntmentes and other
things that may disturb the coming out of these things. An other thing which
is convenient, is to give to the sick, when these small spots do begin to
appear, those things which do extinguish and kill the venom: of the which
we have treated very largely having respect not to let blood, after that they
have appeared, if it come not of too much replection and fullness of blood.
One thing I have found for these red Spots and for Fevers of much profit
and notable experience in many, which is our Bolearmenike prepared in a dish
of earth with Rose water given in all medicines that are too be taken, and in
the meates that are too be eaten, and surely in it I have found great effect,
chiefly in one year, wherein reigned many Pestilent Agues, called Moder^as,
and many were delivered from them, with the use of it, for that this our
Bolearmenike doth differ little from that of the East parts, and this shall
be where the Bezaar stone is not to be had, for that it doth exceed all as I
saw in a principal Gentleman of this city which had a sore Fever, with
soundinges, Uomites and other Accidents of an Ague upon whom did appear
spots, which before I have spoken of on his shoulders, and in giving him the
Bezaar stone with a little of the U^cornes horne, forthwith the Accidents did
cease and began to be better, for that it did extinguish and kill the force of
the Agewe, which caused all the hurt. And after this sort I could speak of
many here in Spain, that for the space of this fourteen years I have used
it, and many have been delivered therewith from many diseases with the use
thereof, that surely it seems a thing of wonderful effects, that a stone
taken out of the belly of a beast like to a wild Heart or Goat in so little
quantity given, should work so great effects as we have written of. And
for that it is already time to treat of the Herb Escuerconera, because we
have been long and treating of the Bezaar stone, I will speak what is known
of it.

Of the herb Escuerconera.
THe Herb Escuerconera the which we have promised to treat of, is an herb
known, and found within these thirty years. For time hath discovered it too
us as it hath done many other things, as we see which they bring from the
West Indies, and they are so many things, as we see every day, as were never
seen by those that were before us, nor yet by us, as we have written o^ in a
Treatise that we made of these things which do treat of all the things that
they bring from our Indies that doth serve for the use of medicine.

So it is that in the Country of Cataluina in the County of Vrgell in a town
called M^mblan^, Histori^*
was the place where y^ herb Escuerconera was first discovered found out, as al
that country i^ molested toubled of certain venomous beasts which are called
Escuercos, and likewise of many other and although that they are very Uenomous
and full of poison, there are also many in number, as well in the tilled
fields as amongst trees, and grass, and especially in the Corn fields, in
such sort that they are to them in steed of a Plague, and an uncurable
mischief, by reason that the people cannot labour in their Vines, nor reap
their Corn, nor do their business in the fields, by means that they are so
cruelly hurt by them, whose venom and poison is such, that wheresoever they
byte, it swells forthwith, with great pains, and the swelling rises up to
the heart immediately, and if they be not remedied and suckered forthwith,
they die presently: their Triacle and other benefits which they had, did serve
them to little purpose.

How this herb was discovered.
And seeing that in this time this Plague was so without remedy, it fortuned
that they brought to that place from Africa a young man Captive, which did
heal them that were bitten with these so venomous beasts, with giving them to
eat of a root, and the juice of an herb that he knew which did them so
much good, that it healed the bytinges and poison very easily. For the which
there came so many people to the Moore, that they did not only make him free,
but also rich, and the young man in all this time with all the promises and
gifts that they could give and make unto him, would never tell them what
root and herb it was, wherewith he healed so great a Plague.

Two Persons of the Town being very desirous to know the same, by reason it
stood them so much upon too know what Herb it was, went after him and
dogged him so politically, that at length they saw where he gathered the
herb and took out of the ground, the roots thereof. The Moore being gone,
they went too the place where he gathered it, and they found the lack of
the grass that the Moore had gathered, of the which they took out a good
quantity, because there was much there in that place, and they went therewith
too the Town, and so to the house of the Moore, where they found him taking
out the herb of a Bag that he brought it in: and the one herb and the
other being seen, they saw that it was all one: whereby the Moore could not
deny but the thing which had been by himself long time hidden, was now
discovered, and the herb that he had gathered and given, and that which the
other brought were all one. And from that time forward all the people began to
know it, and such as had need of it went to geather it, and used it for the
bytinges of these venomous beasts, as I have said. They call this herb
Escuerconera because it doth heal and remedy the bytinges of this beast, Why
it is called Escuer^onera.
called Estorcu in the Catalan tongue, and the same root is like too the said
beast, and the beast like too the root in figure. This beast or vermin
commonly is a Span and a half long, he is small in the tail, and is
greater and greater towards the head: his head is great and square with a
great mouth, his tongue black and sharpe, his teeth small like to a she
Adder, with the which he doth byte, and with his tongue he doth prick like
to a Scorpion, his colour is full of black spots, with diverse colours he
goes evil fauouredly, and is continually among Plants, and Vines, and bites
other beasts, as he doth men, he goes continually by the ground, and
therefore all men look warily too their feet, where they are. He is a fierce
beast and ugly too behold, and full of mischief, his biting is woorser and
more dangerous than the biting of a she Adder of that Country. Only this
Herb is contrary too him which is called of his name Escuerconera: for if they
cast the juice upon him, it makes him foul, The virtue of the herb.
and if they put it into his mouth and that he swallow it down, he dies. If
any man (...) seed, and the seed being gone, then the Leaves of the Plants
do fall. The Root is like too the root of a Sanahoria fleshie, and weighty,
and leaves with a point, and waxes greater towards the leaves, it hath a
thin rynde joined too the root, and is of a russet colour, somewhat
blackishe, and somewhat sharpe, and being cut or broken, it doth cast from it
a certain clammie waterishnesse, like to milk: it is all white within,
sweet, and fatty, it grows for the most part in hitlie places, where some
moisture is: the complexion thereof is what and moist in the first degree.

The Virtues that it hath be such as we have spoken of, the principal
virtue is against the Escorcu a beast so venomous, and doth so much hurt, that
in this surly it seems to be a thing of great virtue. It is good when the
juice is taken out of the leaves and clarified, and that the root also be
taken, which is a thing of greater virtue.

And it is to be considered that although you take the juice and the root of
this Herb against the Poison that proceeds of this beast which is so
pernicious, it is convenient that great diligence be used, as we have
aforesaid, for the remedy of them that are venomed: whereby it would do
very well that in the mean time that the juice be a providing or the Root of
the said Herb, that four or five fingers breadth above the sore it be
bound fast, that the force of the Uenome do not pass too the rest of the
parts of the body, and this is too be done in the Leg or arm. And if the
biting be in any such place where it cannot be bound, then there must be
laid too it, plasters of dry and strong things that may dissolve the fury
of the venom: and this must be done with speed, before the hurt do enter the
inner parts, for if it once do come to the heart, the cure will go harde:
and this must be universally in al prickinges or bytings of venomous beasts.
And if the wound be small it is needful to open it, with a small cut or some
other way: and if it be new, let the cuttinges be small, and if it be of a
long time, then let the incision be deep, for that with the much blood that
geeth out thereof, there go out a great part of the venom also. And after
the cutting let there be applied such things as may draw out strongly the
venom, still adding thereunto that as shall be needful. Some there be that do
suck out the venom of the pricks or wounds with their mouth, but it is
dangerous to them that so do, for some have dyed thereof: it is better to
r^medie it with ventosities, or to put too it the hinder part of a Cock, or a
Chicken, or a Pigeon being alive, upon the prick, or w^unde, the feathers
being plucked f^om the hind^r part ther^of, and use it so often as shall be
needful, until y^u perceive that they have taken out the venom that is in the
wound, and every one of them must be applied thereto so long time until that
you may perceive that he doth wax faint, or until he be ready to dye.
Also it is a good remedy to put them that be a live opened at the back, and
let th^m be there as long time as they have any heate: and beginning to wax
cold, then take them away put others to, and the venom being taken out by
these means, let there be put upon the wou^d a medicine that hath virtue to
keep the wound open. Some do use in the cuttinges or incisions an actual
thing to burn, called a cauterie, which doth very much good, extinguishing the
venom, and comforting the hurt. The same ^ffect do^th the cawterie potential
in killing the ven^me, but it is not so good as the actual, but thereby it
doth cause that the wound do not close, which is very necessary for the
cure.

The juice of the herb Escuerconera doth profit very much, being put on
venomous ^ytings or prickings, by it self or mingled with other medicines,
that have virtue to take away the strength of the venom, as treacle, methridato
other medicines like to these: and if the Bezaar stone might be had casting the
powder thereof upon the wound, it will work a marvelous effect. While they are
in this case they must be kept with good order, good government, in al things
that are contrary to them, and using euacuations, such as is convenient with
wholesome medicines, and there must be mingled with them medicines that are
against venom, and when time serves use letting of blood, and in the rest, to
go to the cure of the disease, and unto every one of them, as it is convenient
universally, and particularly, having always care to give to them that are
sick, in the morning fasting, the conserua of the root of the Escuerconera,
and his water, or the Bezaar stone, or ye powder as it is said, or Bolearmenike
prepared, he must have care to annoynt the heart with things which are
temperate, that may comfort with pouders and cordial waters, amongst the
which let there be put the herb Escuerconera. And besides the virtues that
the herb Escuerconera hath against the bytinges of these beasts in
particular, and for the remedy of all in universal, it hath also other
particular virtues, the use whereof hath been showed unto us, it is very good
against sowndinges, of the heart, and for them that have the falling sickness,
and for women whose matrix are suffocated or stopped, by taking the conserua
made of the root, and drinking the juice of the herb clarified, or the water
of it distilled. It doth profit much when the soundinges are come, but much
more before they do come: when they feel that they begin to sownde, let them
take the root thereof with the water, and it doth hinder the coming thereof:
and if it do come it is much less, and it doth not work so vehemently as
when it is taken after. Unto them that have the gidinesse in the head it doth
good, and being continually taken, it makes the hart merry: it doth take
away the sadness which is the cause thereof: the juice taken out of the leaves
and clarified, and set in Sun for certain days, taking the clearest
thereof, and put into the eyes doth clarify the sight, and takes away the
dimness thereof, if it be mingled with a little good honey, it is good for them
that fear themselves to be poisoned. The conserua of the root being taken,
and the water in the morning, that day by Gods grace they shall be safe. The
use and experience of this herb hath bin taught without any auctor: for to
this day we know not with what name the authors do term it.

Iohn Odoricus Mechiorius an Almayne Phisitio, doth write in an Epistle to
Andrew Mathiolo, saying that Peter Carniser a Catalan Physician, sent to him
the herb Escuerconera dry, into Germany: this Physician did ask of Mathiolo
what herb it was: Mathiolo did not know what herb it was, neither did any
other, until now that it hath bin spoken or written of. Some that are curious
will say that it is the Codrillia, a spice of Succory which Dioscorides doth
make mention of in the second book in the 122. chapter: although that it hath
some likeness thereof, it differs much in the root: for the Condrillia hath
it very wooddie and unprofitable and very small, and in the flowers: but they
differ not in their virtues, for both of them are good for the bytings of
adders. And whatsoever that our Escuerconera is, we see that his effects are
great, as well against the bytinges of the Escuercos which is so evil a beast
and venomous, as for other diseases which we have spoken of: which seeing that
in so few years there hath been so much thereof discovered, I do trust yt much
more will be hereafter by wise men, that there may be added to this which I have
discovered and written of it.

And seeing that we have treated briefly and the best that we can of these two
medicines so precious, to wit, the Bezaar stone and the herb Escuerconera,
which are two things so precious and of so great effects against venom, now
have we to treat of the last part which we promised to do; ^nd how we ought
to keep and preserve our selves, not to fall into so great a danger, as of
them is declared, for that it is better to keep our selves from danger, the
to fall therein. Herein the ancient wryters have bin very circumspect. Amongst
the rest it hath been an ancient custom in Princes Courts other great
estates, to have their tasters as well of their meat as of their drink for the
eschewing of poison, and so by the means thereof they assure themselves to be
out of peril for that matter, the which surely is allowable and a good custom,
and necessary for the safeguard and health of any Prince or Lord, for if there
be any hurt in the meat or in the drink, it shall light first vppo^ the that
do eat or drink thereof, and not upon the Prince or other high estate, in
whose life and health great matters do depend.

Truth it is that in these days it is done more for a ceremony and estate,
then for health safety of life, this order is used amongst great estates, more
for custom then for any thing else, for this purpose the common people have it
in estimation, so that at this present it is used contrary to that end and
purpose it was meant, for they use now taking of a little bred and bringing it
with the meat and so taste it: that done, they cast it away, and likewise they
drink a drop of wine or water: if it should be used as it ought to be, they
should eat and drink thereof thoroughly, for otherwise the poison, if there be
any, cannot be discerned before it come in to the Princes mouth. Also the lord
ought to command that there be prepared for him diverse meates, for that if he
mislike of one, he may taste of another: for being of diverse sorts he may taste
of each a little, and eating little at once of any that were infected, it
would do less hurt then if he should eat of one dish being infected
filling himself therewithal, for being either of them infected and eating much
thereof, it shall do the more hurt. And note this well, that many times a ma is
not given always to eat of one meat, nor to see it always tasted before he
eat it, and afterward there appears in it notable hurt, therefore it is
good to take your meat with a fork or a spoon, and that they be made as
Ierome Montuo a learned man in Phisike had appointed for king Henry of France,
which was made to know if that he had eat any venom, there must be made a
little fork and a spoon of one mixture of gold and silver, that the old
wryters called Eletrum and it must be 4. parts gold and one of silver, they
must be smooth, clean well burnished, with the fork or holder let him eat
his meat, and with the spoon his broth: for putting them in the meat or in
the broth, if that there be any venom therein, forthwith the gold will have
an evil colour, appearing tawny, blew, or black, and loosing the beauty
that before it had, the which will cause them to look better to the meat, and
this is done for trial thereof, and to make further experience by some beast that
may eat thereof, and so to see the effect thereof, for that is the greatest
experience: the like may be done with the drink to make a cup thereof, or a
broad vessel well burnished. For if the wine or water that is put into it,
have any venom, the vessel will take some colour thereof as aforesaid: and if it
have no poison therein, it will remain in his own colour. And surely it is a
gallant and a delicate secrete, when you begin to eat any manner of meat, the
first morsel that you take let it be well chewed, and mark well if it do byte,
or have any evil taste, or if it burn your mouth, or your tongue, or that your
stomach abhor it, for in perceiving or feeling any thing of these signs,
cast it forth, and wash your mouth with wine or water, and leave that meat,
and fall to other: it would do very well to give it to some beast to see the
effe^t thereof, it is good to have in the house some beast to whom it might
given, for to make experience thereof. And the effect so appearing they have to
judge thereof. And this is to be understood when the venomes come of cursive
things, you shall feel a notable sharpness, and they byte and burn forthwith:
the best is for them that have suspicion, to eat meat that is roasted or sod,
that they eat neither brothes nor pottages, for in them there may be greater
hurt: and if any be made, let them not be made with things of smell, as
Amber, musk, and sweet spices, and let them not have overmuch sharpness, for
in broth or pottage, the poison will sooner lurk then in roasted or sodden, and
use no meates, which have much sweetness, therein all poison will lurk the
more. He that hath any suspicion when he goes to his meat, let him not be
to greedy to eat forthwith very hastily, but let him refrain himself, and
let him eat with leisure, by little and little. The like he must do, in his
drinking, being very thirsty, he feels not what he drinks: and so many
people being very dry, have drunk in lie, lye, and also water of arsenike,
not feeling the same until they have hurt their body, and therefore it is
convenient to drink leisurely by little, and little, tasting his drink as he
drinks: surely if men would be ruled by this order, they should easily find
if there were any evil thing in that they eat, and drink. You have to
consider the colour of your meat, for thereby will somewhat appear. For it
will look otherwise, then it ought to do^; see that your vessels wherein you
eat or drink be clean, new, and glistering: and if your ability be such,
let them be of silver, being clean burnished, for if you have venom in the
drink, it is easily espied, and the silver doth turn black or tawny.

Not many days past a Gentleman of great riches, by drinking in a plain cup
of silver, History.
perceived the cup stained of a sad tawny colour, and did marvel thereat, he
only tasted the wine, and it made his tongue rough, his mouth also: he looked
well on the wine that was put into the cup, it had not that quickness in drinking
that it ought to have had, and he looked on the water, and in the bottom of
the ewre there were many grains of arsenyke, with as yet were not dissolved. I
was called I gathered out of the ewre more then xx. small grains of arsenike.
within certain days after the Gentleman fell sick, whereby I did con^ect^re
that it was not the first time that they pretended to poison him: since that,
he hath bin sick a long time. And thus much I affirm that if the cup had not
bin altered of his colour ^ bin infected, it had not bin perceived. Therefore
it is necessary that the vessels and tinages where wine water are kept, be
stopped, for fear least any venomous thing fall therein, as spyders,
Sallamanquesas and other like venomous be^sts, and therefore it is nought to
drink with vessels or cups that have narrow mouths: for it is best to see
what one drinks in a clear vessel and broad, for it is good for them that
do regard their health. It is good to have a piece of a right Unicorns horne
in a small cheyne of gold, that it may be swilled continually in the water
that shall be drunk. It would do well, for not only it takes away the
suspicion of the venom, but doth put to the drink a marvelous cordial
virtue. Also you must not stand by the fire that is made with venomous wood,
for the smoke doth poison, as if you should take poison, and to set in the
chamber coals when they do begin to kindle, many have dyed therewith: let your
apparel be kept by such as you have trust in, for in them may be put things
that may do notable hurt, and for al that, as is said, it doth much profit to
have trusty servants, and that they be such whom you may trust, and that
they be of a good parentage, and stick not to reward them well. And above al
other let the Physician that hath the charge of your health, be learned and
experimented, discrete and of a good judgement, and that he be rich and of a
good kindred, and being such a one, he will not do any thing that he ought not
to do, seeing that in his hands is the life and health of the Master and
Lord.

FINIS.
THE DIALOGVE OF IRON, WHICH TREATS OF THE greatness thereof, and howe it is
the most excellent metal of all others, and the thing most necessary for the
service of man; and of the great Medicinal virtues which it hath.

An Echo for the Doctor Monardes Physician of Seuill.

In Seuill in the House of Alonso Escriuano.

To the most Excellent Lord, the Duke of Alcala, c. my Lord, the Doctor
Monardes your Physician wishes health, c.
FOrasmuch as the metal called iron, is of so great importance in the world,
and so necessary for the service of man, it moved me to make this Dialogue,
which doth treat of the greatness and marvelous works thereof. Which if
they be well considered* they will bring admiration unto all that shall read
them, by reason it is so nec^ssary for all states, and manners of living. It
hath also great and medi^inall virtues, and likewise with worthiness, and
greatness, it is an Instrument and mean, whereby the most worthy have gotten
great Titles, and fame; as we see many of those which in times past have
attained unto, among whom the Predec^ssors of your excellency with their noble
minds, and strong arms, the S^eare in the fist, and the sword in the hand,
by overcoming battles, by getting towns and places, the name and fame of them
have bin immortal to this day. And for to augment and increase this the more,
and to give to your excellency, and to your chi^d^n and successors, g^eater
glory, you took to wise the excellent Duchess the Lady Iu^na Curtes that at
this day doe^h beautifi^ the whole world, with ^er worthiness, e^timation,
quality, and gr^at^esse, daughter to that valiant and re^owmed Prince, Don
^ernando Curtes, who with his greatn^sse and infinite Labours (...) is a
shorter way, and few people will be there. It seems to me, that the great
hall of the treasury house is s^utt: ^t may be that whiles I go up to see the
sick person, they will open it. Burgus. Your worship may go in Gods name, I
will tarry here for you, and seeing the great hall is not opened, I will sit
down upon the bench, and will see what doth pass until you come.

Doctor. Master Burgus, I pray you pardon me, if I have tarried long: for
the quality of the cause hath caused me to tarry. Burgus. Rather I would
have been glad that you had tarried longer, because I would have seen more.
Doctor. What have you seen whiles I was absent? Burgus. The great hall being
shut, and the pard full of people, and I looking upon them earnestly, it
seems to me that they are people of estimation, but to my judgment full of
cares: for in them I have seen so variable and diverse likenesses of
countenance, that I marvel at it. Some of them talking to them selves: others
being alone with their heads hanging down, and with great imagination: Others
talking by two and two together: Others in clusters treating of the sales of
their merchandise: Mariners and soldiers carrying for their paymentes:
Others carrying away their porcions of silver, which they had taken out,
running with it, as though they had stolen it: Others there were with the
Notaries about their suites: Others in the office of the treasourer amongst
the Registers. There was also a great noise of much people, delivering and
receiving parcels of silver, but they were in a great strife therevppon. The
Judges were in counsel, and many people tarrying for them in such sort, that I
was in great admiration: I being there only to behold, and all the rest to
do their business. And it was to me as one that did behold them without
grief, as a comedye, with many Pageants.

And that which did make me marvel more, was to see that none were merry,
nor content: rather they seemed to have great care and troubles.

Doctor. Master Burgus, I am glad you have seen what doth pass in that
house, with so much attention: for all that which you have seen, that Gold and
silver is cause thereof, which with so great good will you came to see, and
this is it which is the cause of their troubles, and cares, and not only it
brings such as you saw there amazed and astonished, but many others, for they
are at this day the instrument of all these things. Some they put down,
others they raise up, whereby they have rule, and dominion in the world. These
mortal men have put so much felicity in them, that they have and do procure
them, by the loss of their lives, and shedding of their blood, and after they
have them, they conserve them with much labour, and with greater care keep
them, and with much misery they spend them, and with great evil fortune they
lose them. These are they that take away quietness and rest. They take away
sleep, and many pass the day to keep them, and to increase their afflictions
and cares. In the night also they rest with fear, and care: there are in them
so many snares and hazards, as we see every day.

Burgus. For all this I would see the Gold, the silver, and the Emeralds.
Doctor. What? master Burgus, have you never seen Gold, silver, and
Emeralds? Burgus. Yea, I have seen them, but in little quantity. Doctor.
What do you think is there in seeing of little, or much, but to see much
earth, or little earth, and most of all without the profit of man, of as many
as nature hath created? And if you have so great desire to see precious metals:
I will carry you to a place where you shall see one metal much more of price,
of greater estimation, then the gold silver y^ you were so desirous to see,
better, of more profit (...) beginning, and original.

Trimegisto said, that the earth was the mother of the metals, Trimegist.
and the heaven the Father. And Plinie saith these words. Plinie.
The inner part of the earth is a thing most precious, for into it, and
through it do go, and pearce all the influences of heaven, engendering therein
things of great price, as stones and metals: and this is done, as Calcidonio
Platonico doth say, by reason of the great heate that is in the inner part
of it. Calisthenes.
Calcidon^.
Calisthenes understood that the form of metals were all one. Anaxagoras and
Hermes.
Anaxagoras and Hermes said, that the metalls had one form in the inner
part, and an other in the outward part, one secret, and an other manifest,
after the manner as the lead hath within it gold, and the gold lead, and so of
al the rest of the metals. See you my masters howe many and howe variable
opinions there are among wise men.

A common opinion.
There is another opinion, which is that which is common, and which for the most
certain we do follow, which Auicen wrote in his books of Metheurous,
Auicen.
and in the books he made of Alcumisto, which were confirmed by Geber and
Raymond Lullio, and Arnolde de Villa nova, Geber.
and all the rest that have treated of these matters, even unto our time,
Raymond.
do say, that the true matter of all metals is engendered of brimstone, Arnold.
and quicksiluer, the brimstone as the father, and the quicksiluer as the
mother: and the heat of the brimstone, doth incorporate, and congele with the
quicksiluer, in such sort that of these two things are made the metals which
are in the bowels of earth: and of the variation of these two beginninges,
they come to differ the one from the other, and of the pureness of these two
beginnings, some do come to be more excellent then other: and for this the
gold is more profitable more fair then all other metalles, for because it is
formed of his beginning, clean, and pure, which was the cause and original of
his perfection.

And there were Philosophers which said that al metals should have bin gold, if
it had not bin for the imperfection of the sulphur, and the quicksiluer. And al
other metals besides the gold, they call imperfect mineralles, because they
had not their pureness, and concoction, that the gold had, with that
marvelous friendship, which nature gave unto it. And of this it comes,
that the Alcumistes for to make gold, do pretend to make clean and purify
these two beginninges of the which all the metalles are made, and being put
into their perfection the gold is made by of them, which is the metal most
pure and clean, of all other. Thus they d^e work with their distillations
and limbecks: and howe harde it is to do, let them report and speak that have
spent their goods, and also their patrimonies therevppon, and yet in the end
have performed nothing at all.

Such as do write against them, making impossible their works and effects,
do say, that in the bowels of the earth, the metals are not engendered, nor
made of brimstone, and quicksiluer, as they think and hold it for certain,
so they cannot make of them by art, for if it were so, that of brimstone and
quicksiluer they were engendered, there would be some ^ase of them, in the mines
of gold, and silver, and of the other metals: for it is seen that there is no
sign or vain of them in any of those mines, howe deep so ever they be: but
rather they are mines of themselves, as we see, that neither in them are
found metalles, nor in the mines of the metals are found^ sulphur, nor
quickesiluer. And if it were so as they say that the metalles do breed, and
are newly engendered of these two beginnings, it must be of force, that one
metal were already made, and the other should go a making, for that all
could not be made alike: but rather they take out all metalles ready made,
and perfectioned, and in the meltinges (...) the Iron doth fall down into the
lowest part, and so is made a great cake, the which being divided into pieces,
they carry them to the forge, where are certain great hammers or sledges of
Iron which the water drives, and they beat them, and there they are forged,
and do make these planches that you see there leaning. Truth it is, that
there are mines where some Iron is more strong then other some, and likewise
harder and stronger to labour. The Iron of Almayne is softer and gentler to
work: That of Flaunders is harde and nought: Almayne.
and therefore it is that many things are soon broken that are made of it.
Fland^rs.
In Italy you have all sorts, Biskey.
that of Biskey is the best, by reason it is good to work, and it is more
mighty and strong then all other, and for the goodness it hath, it is carried
to all parts.

Doctor. Do they bring Steel from Biskey as they do from Italy? Ortuno. They
do bring a certain kind of Iron so harde and strong, Italie.
that being wrought, it serves for Steel, cheefely with a temperature that is
given to it, that doth make it very strong, although that it be wrought with
great labour. There is great difference between this, and ^he Steel which
they bring from Italy, and cheefely from Milan, for this is very pleasant to
work and soft, and is far better, and the crafts men that do work it,
for this cause are desirous of it, and do use it more then any other. Doctor.
Some will say, that the Steel is a mine a^one of it self distant fro the
I^on. Ortuno. It is not so, fo^ all are mines of Iron, but that some is more
strong then other some, and the stronger and harder it is, for the strength and
ha^dnesse thereof we call it Steel, and there are countries which have no
other Iron but this which is harde and strong, as all the country of
Mondragon, where all the m^nes that are in it, M^n^ago^.
are of this Iron, strong, harde, whereby it is called Steel, all that is
taken out of them, the disposition of the place doth cause it, but that which
they bring from Italy is of another sort. In that country are diverse mines of
iron, some of soft iron easy to work, and other of hard strong iron, not
easy to work. And for to make the steel which they send us, they use it in
this sort: they take of the soft iron, the quantity they seem good, and they
make it in ^ ^aine small thin planches, then they take marble ground small,
and also the rust of the iron ground small, and mingling it al together, they
put it into a furnace to mel^, prepared for this purpose, The mann^ how they
make Steel in Italie.
with much quantity of kindled coal, they cast al together into it, gives it
a strong fire, and after they cast to it some of that hard Iron that is so
hard, that it cannot be wrought, and with a strong fire it is al melt, and
they make it one piece, of the which they make these bars of steel, that
th^y bring to these parts, in so great quantity the which they call st^ele,
by reason it is hard to work, and strong, in Latin it is called Chalibs, by
reason of certain small towns yt were so called, whereas was iron most strong:
harde. The steel serves for many things, because it is of greater might,
Stee^e.
and stronger then the iron, and of more activity, and they make strong
fortify the tools of iron with it, to endure the longer, and may do their
work more quickly, with more strength readiness, for that it is an iron more
pure and clean, and for this cause it is more dry, and white, and better to be
wrought: this is to conclude that which I have understood of the original of
iron, and of steel. D. Master Ortuno, hath said very well, and not in short
speech, but wisely, and discreetly. Reason would that many people should buy of
these 2. metalles. for I have understood that they serve for many things.
Ortuno, they which do buy iron of me, are many; but they which do work it,
are many more, for I do not know any office or science in all this city
whereto iron and steel are not needful, necessary. D. M. B. I would be glad yt
you would tel us in what occupations, principally iron is used spent. Ortuno.
They are so many, that in many days they will not be declared, much less in
the little time that we have here. D. Let us be informed as long as time will
permit. Ortuno. I will speak of some things which I do remember. One of the
things in the which iron is most spent, In what things Iron Steel are spent.
as also a great part of the steel, is in armour, as well defensive, as
offensive, so that there is no (...) at this day in the world where they are
not used, and exercised, and in many Countries they are made. Chiefly there is
spent much iron in making of handgunnes, the use whereof is so much in the
wars, and warlyke exercises, that the people of greatest fame and activity,
are they which shoot in them: as a thing very principal, and most necessary:
but surely it was an invention of the Devil, for to carry many to hell. And
to speak of all kind of weapons which are made of iron and steel, it will
ask a longer time, then we have. The iron doth profit for the tilling of the
earth, and labouring of the fields, and for the benefits of all the works
in the Country, to sow, and do other works, a thing so necessary and
profitable for all people, seeing that the works of the fields doth
sustain all manner of estates, in the world. The iron serves to make
buildings, so many sorts, and diverse, that therewith they build Cities,
Towns, Villages, Forts, Churches, and public places, the which without iron
and steel could not be made, as also in the sciences of any manner of
handycrafts man, in the which there are so many necessary instruments, for to
use, and exercise, that thereby you may see howe necessary the iron and steel
is, seeing that without the they cannot be made, nor any thing can be wrought.
And to express every office, and science by it self, that by means of these
two metalles are made and exercised, it will never be made an end of. One
thing I will speak with truth, that there is nothing in the world, be it by
it self alone or with the help of another thing, that hath not need of iron
and steel.

By means of these two metals, kings princes do get kingdoms, and cities, by
means of them they do make subject their enemies, and do defend their goods
and persons. And as Liuio saith, that with Iron the country is defended, and
not with gold, and with it kings are made strong and mighty, and are esteemed
and had in great reverence. By Iron justice is kept and maintained, and by the
means of it, evil doers are chastened, and the good conserned. This mettle
hath so much authority in the world, that it conserveth peace and quietness
in common wealths, in cities, in fields, and in the deserts, in such sort
that by i^ in all places they have all their assurance, and defence: and so
much may be said of that which it can do, and the great aucthority that it
hath, and the mean that it is for al things, that my tongue is not able to
speak them, nor my memory to express them. One thing I will say, that the
auncie^t Romaines had by it such estimation, that only the noble people only
might wear a ring, the same to be of Iron.

Of two needles which are made of steel I will speak, as of the greatest
things that may be thought: The sowing needle.
the one is the Needle with the which they do sow: howe necessary it is in the
world, in cities, in towns, in common wealths, in particular houses, in the
field, in the Sea, in al places, yea and to any one particular man alone? And
let so many Arts speak thereof, that by means of the Needle are used, and
don, and without it, they should not be used nor don: and being so many, it
will be a thing incomprehensible to speak of them. Let every man consider
thereof, seeing that from the king unto the shepherd, and from the bishop to
the sexton, they cannot pass without the use of it. And if we look what
service it doth to women in their uses and ^xercises, in their sowings and
works wrought upon linen cloth and silk, things so politic, and delicate,
that with the Needle they do work: Imitating also, in things which they work,
like unto the work of nature, making b^asts, birds, plants, leaves, and
flowers, which do seem with the branches, that they give of silk in colours,
as if it were the self same that is growing in the field. I saw the picture
of the kings majesty made with a needle so naturally, as if an excellent
painter had painted it. Of all this the needle is the instrument: a thing so
small that it is hid among the fingers. The Indians were in great admiration
thereof at the beginning, when they were first discovered, when they saw
Spaniards sow with a Needle, for it seemed to them a thing of wonder, and they
gave for a Needle much gold, and they were ask^d wherefore they would have
them, seeing that they were naked: they answered, for the works that the
Spanyardes did with them, they would have them in their power for a thing of
admiration. And with them they took out the thorns that can into their feet,
better then with any other thing.

The other Needle is that which serves for Navigation to sail withal in the
Sea, The needle for navigation.
and is one of the greatest things that hath been discovered in the whole
world, within this little time: and by means thereof, there have been found
new worlds, great kingdoms, and provinces, never seen nor known unto us.
And if the Needle had not been found, they had never bin discovered. When they
wanted it, the navigation was very little, and short: they failed only casting
about by the banks of the Sea coasts: and now by the means of it, they do
ingulfe them selves, and do sail in such sort, that the ship called the
Victory sailed all the round world over, as the Sun goes every day, that
it is said, she sailed at one time twelve thousand leagues. And that which
is more to be marvelled at, that the ship being in a gulffe of 800. or 1000.
leagues, by means of the Needle they came to the port which they pretended to
go unto, without any other knowledge, more the by the means of the Needle, or
as we cal it the compass, the which is of steel: and they do r^bbe over one
part of it with the lode stone, and forthwith by particular virtue which God
hath given unto it by that part which they did rub over with the lode stone,
it looks towards the Pole, which is near to the North, and perpetually it
doth this being in the Sea, or on the land, either by the day, or by the
night, with the Sun or without it, always it looks towards the North.
With the which Needle, and with the card of Navigation, wherein is placed a
distinc^ion for the knowledge of the wyndes, and the description of the ports,
they sail so many milleons of leagues, as at this day we see: and it is done
so easily, that it is very wonderful. Who f^rst found thi^ needle.
The inuetion of this marvelous Needle was found by a Mariner, who was borne
in the city of Melsi^n Italy. Also the Iron Steel do serve to make clocks,
which is a thing of great art, very necessary to live with rule order: for by
them shall be know the works that are to be made, the time that shall be spent
in them, they serve for all states of people, whereby they may live wisely
discr^tely: where is no clock they live like beasts. they are made at t^is day
with so much art curiousness, that they make great admiration, they purify
and make clean these two metals, that they make them as bright as any other:
they gild them, they silver them, there is given to them other coulor^, are
made very fair, as we see that there are made cheynes ^f Steel very delicate
and fine: and there are given to th^m dyu^se s^apes a^d colours, and are more
es^emed then those which are made of Gold or Sil^er. Th^se metals a^e
dis^illed ^y t^ w^e of Alcumiste: and th^re is ma^e of them Quinta ^ss^ncia,
Dis^ed.
as of Gold and Sil^er. ^he Alcumis^es too say, t^at the metal mo^e ap^e f^r
th^ir c^uses and ef^ctes, is the Iron.

The Iron doth suffer a ^ri^uous disease, ^hich do^th consume and make an end
of it, w^ich is call^d rust, That rust come not.
and because it may not come to it, there are many remedies, that the things
which are made of Iron, and of Steel may be continually clean: principally,
that they be put into no moist place, and that they be occupied and used,
gilding them or siluering them: in so doing they be kept clean from the
aforesaid rust, or anointing them with common oil, or with the marrow of a
Dear, or with the fat of birds, or with white lead and vinegar, when they
are taken with the rust, for to take it away, they must be filed of, Remedies
when the rust hath taken it.
and put into vinegar, and after into the fire, for with this it is taken away,
unless when they be so much eaten, that they are not to be remedyed with these
benefits. I do not speak of the finesse and delicateness that there is in
sodering of it, and closing of it together, and of the using of it in the
forge, because I am weary I let it pass, with many other things that I should
say thereof, and do conclude, that these two things, Iron and Steel are the
most necessary things for the service of ma, of as many as are in the world.
Doctor. I am very glad with that which master Ortuno hath spoken: for all is
to confirm the excellencies, greatness which I have understood of these two
mettales, whereby I do take them to be more necessary then the gold and
silver, if we do consider well of it. The gold doth not serve us principally
for any other thing, but for money, which is to buy any thing therewith, and
for the trade of things, the which any other metal might serve, or any other
thing. For in the old time as there was no money, they did barter and change
one thing for another: and by reason in this bartering and changing there could
not be used any equality and justification between parties; the wise and
discreet men of common wealths did agree together to make a thing, which
might serve the lack that might be of the one party to the other, that with
it the things might be made equal, and there might be a justification of both
parts. And for this reason and effect, there was invented and made the first
money, which was neither of gold nor silver, but of iron, and of metal, as we
see in the money of old time. And after that, the Romaynes made it of gold and
silver, for the fayrnesse thereof, but it is sufficient that the first which
was made, was of iron and of metal, seeing that the Indians have it to this
day, of fruits of trees, and especially of the Cacao, which is the fruit of a
tree, like to an Almond, this hath served, and doth serve them for money, to
buy, Money mad^ of fruit of Tree^.
and to sell, and to use all playnesse, in their buzinesse. And in all Ginea
the black people called Negros do use for money, for the same effect,
certain little snails, which they find in the Sea, as also other nations do
use of things like to this. B. I have held my peace, harkening to your
woorshippes, with great attention, and surely you have treated in things of
great importance, and of great learning: and seeing you go treating so
effectually the matter of iron, and so delicately, and with so great learning,
I would that Master Doctor might satisfy us one thing, that I have seen
decided of learned men, upon the complexion of iron: for some do say it is
cold, and upon this I have had so many alterations, that they have amassed me,
and seeing that Master Doctor can certify us concerning this matter, we
shall take great pleasure, if that he will declare it unto us. D. I thought
to have made an end with this saying, and that I had accomplished my promise
with Master Burgus: but now he will drive me to a question, the most harde
and difficult that is in al Physic, and surely it were need of more time,
then that we have to determine it.

B. Your woorship may not escape by that means, for to morrow you may make an
end of that, which you cannot do this day. Ortuno. I shall receive great
pleasure in it, although it be not my profession: for being a thing touching
iron, I shall rejoice therein. D. For to content you, I will (...) own
judgment.

And that we may more apparently see the same, I will speak of such that
hold the one opinion, and also of those that are of the other, That the Iron
is cold.

Galen.


and the parties being heard, we will judge that which shall seem best unto
us. Let us speak first of those that affirm Iron to be cold, and let Galen be
the first, who doth say that all those metals of their nature are dry, and
so they have great virtue, and strength, to dry up, and that that hath most
virtue strength to do this a^ong all of them, is the Iron, as also with this
virtue to dry up: it hath also virtue to make cold. He doth compare it to
the stone, saying that the substance of the stone is constant, and steadfast,
for the cold, and dries that it hath: Even so is the Iron, in such sort that
it hath the nature of the stone, the which is cold and dry. And this which
he says in the nynth of his Methodo, Idem.
he doth confirm in that of the natural faculties. The harde bodies do
show to ha^e more earthly parts, and as the Iron is most harde, it hath more
then all other things, whereby it comes to be cold and dry.

Aueroys.
Aueroyes doth confirm the same in the fifth of his C^liget and says:
things which are made harde of heate, with the dominion of earthly parts ought
to be cold, and dry, Alberto Maegno.
as the Iron is. Alberto Magno in the book of the Metheuros says: the Iron
when it is kindled makes it self very read, for because in his principal
quality it hath earthly parts, the same he doth confirm in the book^ which
he made of metals.

Conciliador in the difference 155. says: in the Iron is not found that
virtue which is expressly active, Conciliador.

Idem.


but in the end it is cold and dry. The same words are said in the
difference 128. Gentill in the same question which he made de Actuatione
medicinarum, says, that the Iron is cold and dry.

Herculano in the chapter de Vomitu confirms the same. Iacobus de partibus
upon the second of the first, Herculano. Iacobus de partibus. Auic^n.
saith that the iron is cold and dry. We do see that the waters which have
quenched hot iron or steel, are cold and dry. Auicen in the second of the
first, says that they do restrain the colour, and take away dries, and the
heat, chiefly in time of very hot weather. And following after this, Menardo
saith, that the water which hath cooled hot steel is cold, Menardo,
seeing that it takes away the dries, and doth mitigate the heate, in time of
hot weather: and the dries being taken away, causes that the putrefaction of
the fevers do cease, and where they are with stools, it makes an excellent
work. Albucasis in the book which he made of cering instruments says,
Albucasis,
that those instruments wherewith the head should be cered, ought to be of
gold, because it is most temperate: that in no manner of wise they be of iron,
because the iron is cold of nature.

Brasauola in his book of the French disease says, that the iron is cold
and dry, Brasauola.
which as he says doth show well in his colour and manner of substance, and
in the darkness and weight it hath, for these things do always appear, and
come into earthly substance, as that which is light in to hot, and aerie
substance, which is known to be cold and dry for his effects, seeing that
it takes away, and doth repress the choleric stools, it withholds the
flux, and hot runnings. That which this doth, always is cold and dry.

Sanauarola puts the degrees of the coldness, which the iron hath, and
says; Sanauarola.
that it is cold in the second degree, and dry in the third. B. Master
Doctor I pray you to pass forward: for unto me, that which is spoken, is
sufficient, for I have no doubt thereof, but that the iron is cold and dry, and
always I have understood it to be so, and now with the confirmation of such
authors, I hold it for more certain and firm. D. Master Burgus hath very
quickly

(...) and determination of this controversy.

A concorde of the di^ference.
We have said with the opinion of Auicen, and the rest of the authors, that al
metals are made of sulphur and quicksiluer, the sulphur as the father, and the
quicksiluer as the mother, the one as the maker, and the other as the matter,
and being so, the matter whereof the iron is made, is of these two things, and
of these two beginninges, of the most hot sulphur, and of the most cold
quicksiluer. The which nature hath placed in the inner parts of the earth, and
made them metals, and where there was these two beginninges, most pure, it was
made gold, and likewise of that which was gross and impure, according to the
degree and quality of every one, there was engendered and made the metal,
conformably to the pureness, or grosnesse that it had: and where these metals
are more impure, more gross, and more dark, the iron did engender. The which
being of beginnings not pure nor clean, but gross and filthy, became to be a
metal, more harde then al other metals, so that by means of it strength,
there might be some who might make it easy and subject to be wrought, as
also it might be a necessary instrument that thereof men might profit
themselves. And whereas the iron is made and engendered of these two
beginnings, which are, sulphur and quicksiluer, the one hot, and the other
cold: so it hath the complexion, and temperature, and doth participate of
both qualities: therefore it is so dry, and for this cause hard and strong. By
means of the sulphur it heats, it consumes, it dries, it opens, it
comfort, it provokes appetite, and makes the marvelous works that we
will speak of hereafter, and al is done by means of the heate which it hath.
And by means of the quicksiluer, being gross and impure, and being formed
with earthly virtue, wherewith it is mingled, it cools, it retains, it
thickeneth, it congeleth, it withdraws, and detayneth any manner of flux, or
runninges by binding, it takes away stools, it cools and tempers the
heate, and it doth many other effects, which are all done by means of the
coldness that it hath, in such sort yt as by the aforesaid is seen, the
effects are contrary which the iron doth: the cause whereof is by reason it is
compounded of things that have contrary qualities, which are rooted in it, and
do work conformably to the subject where they do work. For where it is need
to open, it opens; and where it is need to shut, it shutteth. Truth it is,
that besides these qualities, the iron hath an other most principal, which is,
that it is most dry, more then all other metals, by means whereof it doth
many of these effects and works, which we have spoken of, and also it hath
virtue to heate, to cool, and to dry up. And of this it comes, that some do
say it is hot, because they see that it makes works of heate, and others say
that it is cold, because they see that it doth works to make cold, the
reason whereof is, that it is compounded of two contrary beginninges, the one
hot, and the other cold, and thereby it seems that they may very well defend
themselves, who said that iron is cold, and works cold effects: And
likewise they that said, it was hot, and doth hot effects. Whereby it doth
appear that which the one and the other have spoke and treated thereof, to be
true. B. Master Doctor hath very well ended the controversy, and contrariety
that is in this matter discreetly and wisely, whereby we are satisfied: but
there remains a doubt, if the quicksiluer be cold, as he says that some
do say that it is, and to prove it, they say that it shows by his strength,
colour, and taste, and the effects which it doth, to make cold, seeing that
such as do use of it, it makes impotent, they suffer weakness, and
trembling of sinews, and are utterly void of the use of their members, and
many dye all together of a disease called Apoplexy, and all this doth come of
cold causes. They which say that the quicksiluer is hot, do prove it with his
effects, for anointing the iointes, and other parts, of the body therewith, it
makes great works, and effects of heat, it inflames their mouth, and throat,
their gummes, roof of their mouth, with great heat, and burning: it provokes
sweat most vehement: we see that thereof is made that most strong thing like to
fire, that is called Sublimatum, which is most strong fire, Sublimatum.
and burns wheresoever it be put, and all that it takes, it consumes, and
fiereth. Of it is made that cursive poison, called powder Precipitatos, in such
sort that the cause is doubtful, seeing it hath and doth the works so
contrary to make cold, and to make hot. D. The same doubt we have of it, as of
the iron, and what is that which Master Burgus will now have? B. Now that you
brought us out of the first doubt, we pray you that you will bring us out of
the second. D. It seems unto me that Master Burgus doth take the matter so
earnestly that I must needs do it, because I mean to content him, in al
things, it shall be done very quickly: the evening comes upon us. The
quicksiluer is a metal copounded of diverse parts, the watery parts that it
hath, are mingled with earthy things, which is tha^ that gives it substance
and strength. It hath also mingled with it fulfery parts, which seems to be
very bright: for in chafing the quicksiluer between the hands, there remains
in them the perfect smell of brimstone, so the quicksiluer i^ c^mpounded of
diverse things. The watery earthy parts gives it virtue to make cold: by
means whereof is done the virtue which we have spoken of, and by means of the
sulfure which hath aerie parts, it heats, penetrates, opens and makes
thin, and by them it provokes sweat, it causes to expel by the mouth, and by
stools the humour that doth abound, by hearing and doing other effects of
heate. And therefore it is not to be marvelled that the quicksiluer doth
contrary effects, seeing it hath diverse operations, which is the selfsame that
we have spoken of the iron, and so the doubt remains discovered which was
propouded by M. Burgus. D. I remain sufficiently satisfied of that which is
said, but not so satisfied that there doth not remain for me to ask of M.
Doctor another thing, which is of more weight then all that is said: which is,
to know the virtues that the iron and steel have in the use of medicine: for
their works, and effects, as I have hard it reported, are many.

D. It will be a trouble for me to reckon, and tel of so many ancient authors as
also of late written authors, which do treat of the virtues of iron, and of
the steel, by reason they are many, and do treat of great things. And seeing
that it shall be declared, let us loose no time, whereby we may the rather make an
end. By that which is said, you have understood howe the iron, and steel,
are one kind of metal, saving that the steel is more clean iron, and more
fine, for this cause it is hard and strong. They of old time knew not the
steel, but only treated of the iron, and to it they attributed the medicinal
virtues that we will speak of, and under our talk of iron, we will comprise
the steel, seeing that it differs not from it, in more then in being purer,
cleaner from superfluities: and for this cause the steel doth make cold, and
dries more then the iron. For where it is needful to heate and to open, the
iron hath more force, because it is not clean of the sulpherie parts, for
there is lost much thereof, when the steel is made in the form as it is above
said.

It is needful before we proceed forward, Of the preparation of Iron and
Steel.
whereby we may the better treat of the virtue of iron, that we understand
how it ought to be prepared. For if it be not prepared, neither can it be
administered, nor yet will it work it effe^t^, because ^t is a hard metal and
strong. And seeing that we have M. Burgus here, who in his art is one of the
excellentest men of al Spain, he may declare unto us how it may be used, and
prepared, because we may go forward in this matter. B. I have received great
pleasure with ^h^t as I have heard treated of iron, and of steel, and thought
that we should have made an end, and not treated any longer of them: but
seeing that it seems good to Mai^er Doctor, that I should speak of the
preparing of these met^lles, I will do it, because I would say some thing as
well for my part. But if Master Doctor would take pains, he might speak
thereof, as well as most men that are in the world, seeing he knows it, and
that there is nothing in medicine hidden unto him, but seeing that we have of
him a good Censor, if any thing do lack, he may speak and supply it. The
metalles if they be not corrected and prepared every one, To correct Metalles.
as it is convenient for them, cannot serve in medicine, nor work the effects
and virtues, which they have in them, because they are gross of substance, and
strong. The Alcumistes have known and do know much in correcting and
preparing of them, seeing that we see they use the gold and the silver, in
broths, that they may be dro^ke, and do reduce them into pouders, as also they
do the like with the lead and copper, and of other minerals and me^als, which
they do correct and prepare, for to make them into pouders, that they may
serve in medicine.

They do correct and prepare particularly the iron for this effect, but with
great difference, from all other metalles, as Bulcasis shows very learnedly,
being a Phisiti^n, Bulcasis.
and a Moore, who in particular doth show the manner which ought to be had,
for to prepare the iron, and he says in this manner, the fyling of the iron
which is most pure, must be taken without other mixture, for if it be mingled
with Copper, or Lead, or Glass, and if it be given so mingled to any person
for to drink, it will kill them, you may take the quantity you list, of that
which is fyled, being most pure, and let it be w^shed, and after it is well
washed, let it be put into a clean vessel. And let there be put to it
vinegar, and put it under some thing, so that it be well covered, let it so
remain thirty days, or at the (...) se^en, and after that time take it
forth, and you shall find that which is filed of the coullour of Uerdegrece,
the which must be dry^d: and after it is dry, it must be ground, and being
well ground you may use thereof.

Some there be that do wash it with fresh water, or with vinegar, and do
strain it through a linen cloth, and then put it under a vessel until it
wax rotten, and after they ^ash it, and keep it. That which this Moore doth
say, se^meth to be of Aueroyes, in the fifth of his gathering, Aueroies.
where he sets down the preparation thereof in this form: After the Iron
is ground very small, let it be put many times in to vinegar, or into Gotes
milk, when it is cruddye. This he would should be the preparation. And
Christopher de honestis, Christ^pher de honesti^.
following this in the commentaries which he made upon Mesue says, Let the
fyling of the Steel be put into vinegre many days, for in any other wise the
use of it will not profit, although that some do put it into milk of Gotes,
and some into oil of sweet Almondes, and in this sort they take it. Clemen^
Clementin^.
The same preparation Clement Clementino doth give. It seems a harde thing to
believe, that the Iron or Steel is penetrate, and doth wax soft with any of
these things: only the strong vinegre is that which doth penetrate and soften
it, whereby it may be well ground, for to use of it. And for the more
certeintie I will show howe I do prepare it. The prep^ration.
I do take of Steel the purest and whitest I can get, as also Iron, and do
cause it to be fyled as small as may be, and when it is so fyled I cause it to
be washed in water many times, until the water do come forth clear, and then
I put it into a clean glassed vessel, and do cast to it as much strong white
vinegre as may be sufficient to wet thorough the said fyling, and the v^ssell
being stopped put i^to a close place, I do let it stand xx. days, stirring it
well twice every week, and putting to it some vinegar if it b^e needful: and
after the twenty days, when it is well s^kened, I take it out of that, and
put it into some other brode^ vessel, or upon a table, that it may dry in the
shadow, and after it is dry, I do grynde it in a mortar of metal, sifting
it twice through a thick sieve of silk, and so being made into Powder, I put
it into a fine earthen painted pot, then with a Pestle I beat it small again,
in such sort that being taken between the fingers, it seems not too have
any manner of substance, neither is it felt between the. And if it be not done
in this sort they are never well groun^e, for it is a thing that they take most
care of, so that thereby it may work the effect the better. And being made into
powder in this sort, it ought to be kept in a glassed vessel. Some do wet it
with Gum Dragagaunt and make it in rowles: and it likes me very well,
because they be the better conserved, and the gum Dragagant takes away some
part of their drithe. And seeing that I have made an end of the preparing of
the steel and Iron, that it doth the effect when it is need^ful as though it
were the steel it self, let Master Doctor show unto us the works and
virtues that it doth. D. I do rejoice very much to hear the good order of
the preparation, that Master Burgus hath given and set down to be used with
these metals. And seeing that I am bound to declare the virtues and medicinal
works which they have, I will speak of it the best that I know, as well that
which I have known and read, as that which experience hath taught me, and the
use of so many years, The vertue^ of Iron and Steel.
These two metalles do serve in medicine two manner of ways; the one is, that
of them may be made instruments to work with, in causes of Surgery, without
the which the Surgeons cannot work their works and effects, nor the Barbours
without them cannot do their occupations. To declare what instruments those
are which serve for the one and for the other occupations, it will be to
tedious. The iron and steel do serve in medicine with great effects and
marvelous works, by curing and healing diverse diseases, and so Plinie in his
book of the natural history, treting of this matter of iron, after he wrote
great things of it, as well in that which doth profit in the service of man,
as other curious things, he treats of ^he vert^es and works which it
doth in medicine, showing first the qualities of it, saying: The iron hath
virtue too dry up, too retain, and too hold fast, it is good for such as
do lack their hear, that it may grow, being prepared and mingled with some
liquor prepared and made for the same purpose, it takes away the roughness of
the cheeks, mingled with Vinegar: and being made in an ointment with oil of
of Myrtiles, and wax, it takes away the blisters of all the vodie: the powder
of it mingled with Vinegar, doth heal the disease called Saint Anthonies
fire, as also all manner of skabbes, it heals the little sores between the
nail and the finger, the pouders thereof being applied thereunto with a linen
cloth. It heals also the flux of women of what sort soever it be, being
put thereunto with wool or with ^otton wool, and also if they be applied
thereunto after the mann^r of a Tent in the lower parts, the powder being
mingled with myrrh and put to the sores or wounds new hurt, doth soder them
and heals them: and being mingled with Vinegar and put upon the pil^s, it
dissolveth them. It is a great remedy for such as are gowtie, being applied
with things made for the purpose upon the grief: It sten^heth the blood of
such as are wounded, which is for the most part made of Iron. It is given to be
drunk to such as are diseased of the lungs, for it consumes the disease, and
heals him that is sick, it stays any manner of flux the Piles, doth
remedy the soars of them. It heals sort cheeks, casting the pouders upon
them it is a great remedy worthy of estimation. He that doth cause it to be
made doth put it upon a Plaster called Higre, the which doth profit to take
away and make clean the soars, and to take away the Fistula and too eat away
the Branches and too cause that the sores be filled with flesh: all this is
of Plinie in the Chapter of iron. Galen in the Book of Triacle to Piso, Gale^,
declares much the necessity of iron, for the life of mankind and for the
service of man, and doth account it for a most excellent remedy, for to dry up
the moystures tears of the eyes. In that of continual dissolution, he says,
that pieces of burning Iro cast into milk, by taking away yt waterishnes which
the milk hath, is good for over much stoles, and especially for the bloody
flix. An^ in the tenth of the simple medicines, he commands that milk be
given, where in pieces of Iron have been quenched, and saith that such kind
of milk doth good unto them which have the bloody flix. And in the like case
it is better to use of Iron, then of stones or pebble stones, by reason the
Iron doth leave more drithe in the milk. A^xander Traliano.
Alexander Traliano, adding to this, treatet^ how milk should be used in
stools. He commaudeth to sees milk with a quarter part of water, until the
one half be consumed, and in this sort it may be given to them which have the
ague with stools, and it is better in the place of small pebble stones,
wherewith they do command it to be sodde^, that there be cast into it small
pieces of burning Iron. Paulo.
Paulo, well near says that which Galen hath said, and that the powder of
Iron mingled with vinegre profits m^ch to such as have matter coming forth
of their ears, although that it hath been of a long continuance. And also it
is a great remedy for such as have taken ^enom, that is called Aconito. And
forthwith he treats of the virtues of the water that have cooled hot Iron,
and saith, that it doth good to such as do suffer the payne of the belly, and
such as have any choleric disease, and such as have hot stomachs, and such as
have the stopping of the lunges.

Dioscorides.
Dioscorides in the chapter where he treats of the rust of iron, says,
that the water or the wine, that hath quenched a piece of burning iron, is good
for them that have the flux of the stomach, and the bloody flux, it desolueth
the hardenesse of the lungs, and serves in choleric stools, and in the
looseness of the stomach. Actio.
Accio, treating of certain rowles which are very excellent for the opilations
of the inner parts, says, that it is a most convenient remedy for the
Lunges, and inner parts of the Body, that the water that hath quenched whotte
iron be taken for a long time: but such as have a whotte disease, must use of
the water, and such as are cold if they be weak, of wine that hath quenched
iron. Oribacio says, that the water which hath quenched what stile, is an
excellent remedy for such as are sick of the lunges. Scribonio, Oribacio.
an ancient Physician saith, that the water which hath quenched what steel,
is a great remedy for such as are swollen, Scribonio,
and for such as have sores and griefs of the bladder, chiefly if they use it
continually. Rasis in his Continent treating of iron says, the same as Galen
doth. And Paule adding this, Rasis.
the iron doth take away the flux being overmuch of the menstruous, and
conceiving with child, it heals the little soars that are between the
finger and the nail, it takes away the Pearl in the eye and the hardness of
the eye lid, it heals the piles outwardly, it remedies rotten gummes, it
takes away the Gout from the feet, and from the hands, it makes hear
grow where it lacks, although there have none grown a long time. The water
that hath quenched iron, is good for the flux of the belly, although that it
hath been of a long continuance, and for stools of blood which doth avoid
from the body, and the meat which is eaten and not consumed, and for stools
of blood: it also dissolveth the hardness of the lunges, it remedies the
runninges, and weakness of the stomach. And Macerico an ancient Physician
saith, if the powder of iron be taken with sodden Wine called Cute, it
comfort the weakness of the stomach: he takes for his Author Mes a
Physician. And Rasis concludes the same, saying, I say and certify by great
experience, that the iron, doth profit in the disease of the Piles, and for
the flux of Urine, and for overmuch flux of the menstrues: this says
Rasis.

Scrapio recites all that Rasis saith, word for word: and because I would
not say it twice together, Scrapio.
I let it alone. Auicen follows Rasis in all that he hath said, adding this
tha^ follows to it: Auicen.
The water wherein iron is quenched, makes strong the inner members by his own
property and manifest quality: it comfort the stomach, for the water which
doth quench what iron, strengthens the virtue, and consumes the
superfluities of the stomach, and the superfluous moisture thereof, for those
are the things that take away appetite by the looseness of the mouth of the
stomach, and they are those which extinguish and kill the natural heat: and the
iron by reason of the coldness and drithe, helps the knitting which is made
in the mouth of the stomach, where the appetite is engendered, it comfort the
Liver and the rest of the interior members, it strengthens natural heat,
the sinews and powers of the body, and in such sort it doth give them
strength, and they take such virtue thereby, that they caste from them the
opilations: by reason of which causes the Lunges are consumed. It comfort
the virtue of generation, and this it doth by consuming the moisture which is
that which lets troubles natural heate which is necessary therefore, and
if it be not done by his quality yet it is done by his accidents. Auicen.
All this is spoken by Auicen, in the second of his first, as also he says in
the second Canon where he praises the iron greatly for Ring worms, and for
swellings, and for the Gout, and mingled with Vinegar and put into the ears
that of long time have cast out matter, it heals them, for the sharpnes of
the eye lids, and to take away a web or the whiteness of the eyes: and he
says moreover that the Wine which doth quench ^he Iron doth profit for
the Apostumations in the Lunges, and for the looseness of the stomach, and for
the weakness thereof, it takes away the superfluous Flute of the Mother; it
dries the piles it takes away old stools and the bloody Flixe, it doth
good to such as their fundament comes forth, and to such as their water doth
avoid from them, not feeling it, it takes away the overmuch Flux of the
menstrues of women, and comfort lustiness in man or woman: all this is
taken out of Auicen. Aliabas in the fifth of his Theorica says, Aliabas.
the water that cools the iron, doth detain the belly; it hardens and
comfort the Members, if you bathe your self with it, it doth good too the
Pains and Apostumations of the Lunges. Albucasis says, that the use of iron
prepared, Albucari^.
takes away the naughty colour of the yellow face, that is of the colour of
Saffron, and the use thereof doth make fat, and it should be used as the
sick man doth heal, who being well and whole, doth wax fat.

Well near all that which I have said, Alzananio and Isack, do say: which I
do leave to relate, Alzarania* Isaac^*
because it is showed already. B. Have there been any late writers that have
said any thing touching this matter? I think there be none that considers
howe that the Ancient Writers have written much therevppon. D. Yes, many and
very learned. B. it would do well that you would so much pleasure us, as to
show who they are, and what they say, seeing you have begun, and that they
remain not unknown. D. I will show you, for some of them with care, and
particularly, have written of iron, and the use thereof, and of the great
virtues which it hath, and the like they say of the steel. A Physician which
was a Cardinal called Vitalis de Furno, treating of iron in a particular
Chapter, saith: the filinges of iron have virtue to dry up and to make thin,
What the late Writers say.

Vitalis de Furno.


and therefore it opens and heals opilations of the lungs: it heals the
bloody Flux, and any manner of Flux of the Belly taken in meat or drink.
The Iron that is quenched many times in Wine, is good for the stoppinges of
the Lunges, and Inner parts, and the milk is good wherein the Steel hath
been quenched.

The iron obeys nothing but the Diamont, for it cannot do more then iron:
for it doth consume it altogether. There is no mettle, which doth receive
so much hurt with the rust as the Iron doth, and much more if it be cankered
with the blood of mankind, and also after you have made it clean again if
you anoint it with the marrow of the dear called the hart, or with Oil
olive, or with Vinegar mingled with Alom. This the Cardinal saith.

Montenana in his Counsel a hundredth sixty one doth put for a great secrete
to kill or quench fifty times a piece of steel in strong Vinegar and in that
Vinegar being made what, Monten^na.
to wet a course Linen cloth, and put it upon the lungs and inner parts that
are stopped, many days together, Michael Sauanarola in the book he made of
Bathes, Sa^anarola.
doth say, the iron makes cold and dries up, whereby it is bynding, and
therefore it doth deteyne, and the water that kills or quenches the iron,
hath the said virtues, and all the reft that the iron hath, for the water
receives into it his quatities, and virtues as Galen saith, that the water
receives the qualities virtues of the things that we put into them, Galen.
or sod in them, and they do the same works that the said things
themselves will do; the water which kills or quenches the iron or steel
doth deteyne, it causes that the flux or runninges do cease, ^nd being put
to the ruptures, it doth sodder them together, and shutteth them, it consumes
the old matter of the eyes. The powder made of iron doth loose the swollen
eye lids, it takes away the Rime from the eye, and doth make fast the
gummes that are loss. When there is a tent made and wet in this powder
prepared and put into the mouth of the Mother, it witholdeth any manner of
flux of it: and the loke it doth by putting it into the flux of blo^d: that
comes from the Piles.

This Powder is good against the Uenome called Ac^z^to. The Wine that quenches
iron or the steel, doth profit for the hardness of the lungs, and the weak
stomach and laxative, any manner of flux, chiefly if it be choleric, it doth
profit much. Such as have the dropsy, and the flux of the vryne, and such as
have the menstrues, overmuch, and such as their water goes from them without
perceiving thereof, and such as their fundament goes out: hetherunto
Sauanarola hath said. Nicholas Florentine, praises infinitely steel, Nicolas
Florentine.

Bartholomew an English man.


for opilations of the inner parts of the body, and likewise the water of the
steel. Bartholomew Anglicus, greatly praises the use of iron, of steel, and
says, that they are a more excellent medicine, then gold or silver, for the
service of a man: for that by them these two metalles, that are so greatly
esteemed of all men, are kept in safety, because they do defend and sucker
them from such as continually do persecute them. They defend justice, they
conserve the commonwealthes, by them the evil doers are chastened, and the
good are conserved and defended: in all offices of handycraftes they are
necessary: they labour and work and fields with them, whereby we are
maintained, it hath medicinal virtues more then any other metal, for the filing
which doth proceed of it, hath virtue to dry up, and to make thin. It vndoeth
opilations of the lungs, it takes away any manner of flux of stools, although
they be of blood: and it profits for many other things. Al this the English
learned man saith. William of Saliceto, in the cure of opilations of the
lunges, Saliceto.
doth command to take the powder of steel, for to loose opilations, and he
takes it for a great secrete. Platerio in the chapter of iron says, the iron
and the scales of it, Platerio.
and his rust the steel every one of them hath the like virtue and property,
taking two parts of a dr^m of the fyling of iron prepared, as it is
convenient, with hot wine, it heals the opilations of the liver and the
lungs, although they be very old. Matthew Siluatico saith the same, Matthew
Siluatico
that the rust and the scales of the iron have the same virtue that the steel
hath, either of them (...) were the lade stone it self, and al this it doth
by reason of the great likeness and friendship which it hath with the iron,
together in one with the hidden property which it hath therefore. For this
virtue, that it hath to draw unto it iron, either it is for the likeness it
hath, or for the property, and in this stone ought to be the one and the
other. The diamond is his enemy, insomuch as it is said that in his presence,
Galen.
it draws not the iron unto it. Galen speaks of greater power that the
load stone hath then the iron, seeing that it draws the iron to him, being of
his own kind, and therefore the ancient wryters do give it the same virtue,
that they give to the iron, in curing the opilations of the lungs, and other
inner parts. Galen.
Galen saith, that the use thereof heals the dropsy, and doth evacuate the
gross humours. Serapio says, Serapio.
that being taken with water and honey, it loses the belly, chiefly gross
humours: many do praise it for the dropsy, with water and honey. I understand
that the lo^ stone ought to be prepared in such sort that i^ may bet used, as
we have said of the preparing of the iron. B. Doth your woorship minister any
time the rust of iron prepared'^ for I have prepared it by commandment of a
Physician, The rust of the Iron and his virtues.
being a stranger, and give the powder thereof unto such as had opilations: and
he said to me, that they did better work then the pouders of steel D. We
have spoken of Plateario and of Matthew Siluatico, Plateario.
howe they say that the rust of the iron, Matthew Siluatico.
and the iron it self, and the filing of it, and the steel, have al one manner
of virtue, and therefore the rust of the iron prepared will profit as much for
the said purpose, as the rust doth, and I have understood for to consume and
dry up the moisture of the stomach and the slimy humours thereof, it will make
great effects, for the rust of the iron and of the steel is the most hot
parts, the dryest parts of them. Galen.
And so Galen doth command it to be prepared with vinegar, and that there be
made of it, powder most small, the which dries extreemely, as he says in
the nienth of simples, and in the fifth of his Methodo. Mesue, Mesue.
in that of the ulcers of the ears, he doth put a confection for them
wherein in is contained the preparing of the rust, and before that he puts
the same rust prepared in vinegar, and made in small pouders, he makes of
them a liniment for the ears that are troubled with ulcers. Rasis,
Rasis in the nienth chapter of those things that do comfort the stomach,
after he hath showed of many compound medicines, says, if they do not
profit, let there be given the skales of iron, with wine, and he says the
same in the books of the Deuisions, in the chapter of the diseases of the
moist stomach: he commands to give a composition called Trifera Minor, and
after that, the rust of iron. And in the same chapter before for the weakness
of the stomach, and the debilitation of the natural heate, he commands that
there be given Trifera, and after that the rust of iron: and at the end of the
said chapter, for such as do eat earth, clay, and coals, he commands them
to be purged with Acibar, and after that they eat Trifera made with the rust
of Iron.

B. You have spoken very well, Master Doctor, but I pray you show us how we
should minister the pouders of these things. D. seeing that there with we
shall make an end, I will show it in short time, considering that the time doth
no longer give place.

The cause and original of the disease being known, the sick person ought to
be let blood, and purged, How these pouders are ministered.
if it seem good to the Physician to be so, and if the sick person hath
strength therefore: for there are some so lean, that it is not convenient to
use of any euacuations in them. This being done, they shall take of the pouders
that shall seem most convenient for them, of the three things which are spoken
of the iron, the steel, or the rust of them, the quantity that shall seem good
to the Physician, according to the age virtue, strength. I do give to them of a
mean age a dram, The quantit^
and from thence I rise or fall, as the age and strength or the continuance of
the disease requires, and that it may not be less then two grains of
weight, nor more then a dram half, I give it many kind of ways, either
mingled with suggar of Roses, or with conserua of violettes, or with a syrope
of Coriander, or of the root, or made in pills, with a syrope made for the
purpose, casting them into the mouth, or any manner of these ways, that they
be taken: there must be drunk after them a little sack, that it be not
cold, nor very strong. And if the person that takes it, drink no wine, then
he may drink water sodden with Cinnamon, although the wine be the better, When
they should be taken.
it must be taken, fasting in the morning, and immediately after it be taken,
they must go and exercise their bodies, two hours after, if they have
strength therefore, and if there be not strength to do it, one is sufficient,
or the time yt they may possibly. The going must be in such sort that the
party be not overwearied: and if he be, let him sit down, now and then, and
by reason such as do take them have stoppings or opilations, of any manner of
exercise, although it be little, they are forthwith weary, and all the payne
is for the first days, for afterward they shall go very well, and shall not be
so much wearied.

This exercise is better to be used out of the house, and by the streets, and
in the fields, it doth import very much by the going whereby these pouders
do make their work, That which the going doth import.
and do good, that if they be not well gone with all, they do not the effect
that is desired, and the exercise being made, let him take rest in his house,
or in the place where he comes unto, not vnclothing himself, but even so
apparelled, let him lye down upon his warm bed, and rest himself one hour,
and let him eat four hours at the least, after he hath taken these pouders,
or when he perceives his stomach to be clear, of them, he shall eat of a
Hen, or of another Bird without any sauce, with some dry fruit, or some
conseruas, and not to eat any green thing. The order that he shall have.
Let the drink be according to the disposition that he hath, wine watered, if
it be convenient for him to drink it, or water sodden with Cinamom: let him
refrain to that day from al things that may offend him, let him not drink
between meals, let him make a light supper, with that as may dry up moisture.
I will not counsel that they take these pouders every day, but every third
day, and chiefly these first days, and especially such which are lean and
delicate, for in taking of them every day, they will be much wearied, and one
day that they rest between, they will be restored, and take strength for the
next day. The day that it is not taken, if there do appear any fever, it
would do well that there were taken a good vessel or great cup full of whey,
made of goats milk hot, what with suggar, if it be not to be had, then take a
small table of rosade of a sweet smell: this day their liver shall be anointed
with some ointment made for the purpose, and their lungs with some thing that
may vnstoppe them, and the stomach with some thing that may comfort. This shall
be done in the morning when he is on his bed, and after the oyntmentes are
ended a little time, one hour or two after that they are anointed, receive a
common medicine with things that have virtue to evacuate, and this medicine
shall not lack, every day when the pouders are not taken, for it doth much
import, except: if there be not many stools: in such sort it will be better
that it be a washing medicine. The day which they take not the pouders, they
may eat sod meat with some sauce and green things, and in the one day and
the other drink little.

These pouders are given many or few days according to the necessity of the
party that is sick, The days that they shall take them.
and as it doth him good for to some 15. days are sufficient, and to others
20. and to others 30. some there be which do vomit them up the first two or
three days, and they cast up much choler with them, whereby they are notably
lightened, and doth (...) i^ this sort they give contentmet gladness, I know no
other medicinal benefit it can do to them. There are many Physicians which
do comande to carry to the money house, (which is the house where the money is
made) a pot of water corporal, Note.
and spiritual, and after he hath done this, he doth moderate it in this
manner, saying, But such which have not these eats, and drinks without them
when they are idle, and in pleasure and do not exercise themselves: these
people as they have not heate to constrain them to drink cold, let them not
do it, neither is it convenient for them to drink, it, let them content
themselves with cold water, as nature hath brought it forth, without putting
it too cool in any other thing, seeing that they have not need of that which
is most cold. And forthwith he says: Although they live idly, and do no
exercise, and also without cares if the time were warm, or very what, they may
drink the water cold, I do mean that in Countries where it is not cold,
they may put it too be made cold, so that it be not v^ry cold. The
selfsame is confirmed by Galen himself in his third book of meates and in
the book of the disease of the raynes, where he saith, That the use of cold
water cooled with Snow, unto such as are very what, and such as are fatt^,
and such as do exercise themselves and labour much, that such may drink
very cold, chiefly if they be used thereunto, for such as are accustomed to
drink it* do suffer and carry yt better and more without hurt then such as
do not use it, for such ought to drink it with more respect and
consideration.

And albeit the water hath so great benefit in it, as we have said, for the
conservation of health, it hath greater too heal Fevers and other diseases:
and therevppon Hipocrates and Galen treated very particularly, inespecially
Galen in the nienth of his Method^, doth reprehend there Erasistrat^, Galen.
and such as do follow him, which did forbid the use of cold water, unto
such as were sick of the Fevers. And in his first book of his Methodo, by the
like reason doth reprehend Tesalo. and in the seventh book he doth show
that he himself hath healed many sick persons that had the grief of the
stomach, with most cold water, and also made cold with Snow. And in the eight,
nienth, tenth, and eleventh of the same Methodo, he heals the Fevers and
other diseases with water that is most cold. And it is an excellent remedy
taken with the conditions that is convenient. In the xl. he saith, that the
sharpe Fevers are cured with letting blood and cold water, especially the
Feue^s of blood or that have much mixture thereof. By that which is said, is
seen how convenient it is, that water be made cold with snow, where there is
not to be found any so cold as is convenient for our conservation
contentment, for to heal us of many infirmities. Al the which we have treated
of in brief, whereby it may be a beginning of our pretence that shall follow,
which is to show the manner how to make told with snow, and because that which
shall be made cold is the water, and under is also to be understood the wine,
al the rest that shall be made cold, we will speak of that which shall be
treated, under the water.

The water is cold two manner of ways, Of cold matter.
one naturally as it comes forth of the springes, and this is as cold as it
is convenient, and hath no need to cool it, if it hath as much coldness as
will satisfy our necessity, without having need too se^ke any thing that may
make it colder.

There is an other water which is not so cold as is convenient for us, as well
for our conservation health, as for our satisfaction: and by reason it is not
so cold as it ought to be, it is the cause of the hurts it doth, that before
we have spoken of. Some waters are not so cold as they ought to be by nature,
by reason they are in what countries: Now our intent is to treat of them how
they ought to be made cold, because with their heate they hurt us, and being
made cold as much as need requires, they do satisfy us so that we may
drink them and use them without any hurt that they can do us: so we will show
of al the means that we may have to make cold, which are used at this day in
all the world, and of them we will choose the best, and most sure, setting
down the inconvenience that is in every one.

There are four manner of ways to make cold, which at this day are used in
all the world: Four ways to make cold.
that is to say, with the air, in the well, with salt Peter, and with snow:
every one of these is used at this day.

The first with the air in the cold of the night.
The first is, to make cold with the air, although it be a common thing, and
used in all places, yet it hath been and is most used of the Egyptians, by
reason they have neither wels, nor snow, and that of the salt Peter they never
knew. Galen makes a large relation of the manner howe to make cold with the
air, and saith thus: they of Alexandria and Egypt for to make their water
cold, ^alen.
that they may drink it in time of what whether, do warm it first, or do
sees it, then they put it into earthen vessels, and set it in the cold air,
or dew in the night in windows, or in the gutters of houses, and there they
set it all the night, and before the Sun rises, they take it away, and wash
the said earthen vessels in the outside with cold water, and then they
roll them with the leaves of a Vine tree, and of lattice, and other fresh
herbs and they put them in the ground in the most cold part of the house,
that there the cold may conserve it. This manner of making cold is used at this
day in all the world, although not with so much curiosity, by reason they
sees not the water and they content themselves with putting it in the cold
air, and in the de^we, as commonly it is done.

Likewise they do make cold the water with hanging it in the air, To make
cold with hanging in the air.
having certain skins full of water in the air and moving them
continually: the which is used in all the Country called Estremadura. Others
do make cold by putting the vessels with water in the draw, and before the
Sun come forth, they drappe them in cloth or in skinne^, and this the
Shepherds and other people of the field do.

This manner to make cold with the air hath many inconveniences, The hurt to
to cool in the air.
because the air is a subtle element subject to any manner of alteration and
corruption: and therefore it may be infected with some evil quality, easily:
being infected, it may infect the water that so is made cold, infusing
therinto his malice. The which Auicen shows very well in the second of the
first saying, The air is an evil thing, by reason it is mingled with evil
things, as Uapors, and smells, Auicen.
and evil smokes, chiefly that which is put in between two walls, and
especially that which passes by places where are rotten Plants, and naughty
Trees, and where dead bodies are, for it alters at every one of these
things, and of them receives an evil quality. And for this cause the
ancient Physicians did forbid that in time of the plague the water should not
be put into the air to be made cold, because the corrupt airs should not
infect it. There is likewise an other inconvenience, that you cannot every
night set the water too be made cold in the Air, for some nights and the
most part of them, in the Summer time are so what, that not only the air
doth not make cold, but the water that is set in the air, is whotter then it
was before, and if it be made any whit cold, it dureth no longer then the
Morning, when it is not needful, and likewise in the time between Winter and
Summer, or in the Winter when the air would make cold, then the rain, the
tempests and clouds and other alterations will not suffer the air to do it.
All these things experience doth show at this day.

There is an other manner of way how to make cold with the air, which is the
most wholesome, and more without hurt than any of all the other: wherein there
is no occasion of any evil quality. And there are many people of estimation
which do use this way to make cold that, which they should drink, the which
they put into vessels of earth, or metal, and do always make wind and air
to the vessels with a wet lynnen cloth. And it must be so, that it be in the
air continually without ceasing, as long as you are at meat. And in this
sort it will be made cold to purpose, and the hot air that is joined to the
vessel is taken away, and in place of it comes fresh and cold air, even
as it doth when there is gathered wind to the face, and taking away the hot
air that is joined to it, and with fresh air it makes it cold and
refreshes.

The other way to make cold, is in a well, wherein they do put the vessels
with water or wine, The second manner howe to make cold which is in wels and
the hurt that comes thereof.
and there they remain the most part of the day. This kind of making cold
hath also many inconveniences, as well of the part of the water, wherewith it
is made cold, as of the part of the place where it is put, cheefely in the
wells of the cities and towns, that for the most part are foul and full of
filthiness. The water of these wells is an earthly water, gross and harde,
because it is continually standing in one place, and shut within the bowels of
the earth. And as it is a standing water, it must of force he putrified, for
that the beams of the Sun do not pearce it, nor yet the air doth visit
it, and therefore continually it is full of evil vapours, whereof they do
easily rot, and they are foul waters full of durte and clay, and of other
mischiefs of an evil quality.

And seeing the water or wine is so put a long time into this foul standing
water, what can come of it, but that it participateth of the evil quality
that it hath? And so Galen says, Galen.
that the vessel which must be put into the well, ought to be full: for if it
lack of his fullness, then the water of the well doth penetrate it, or the
vapour of it goes into that which is empty: and therefore it is convenient
that the vessel be filled full, and that it be well stopped, for that which is
said. In the well the vessel ought to be well stopped.
And he says the contrary, when we shall make cold in the air: for then
the vessel shall not be put full, but some part thereof remain empty: for
the cold air in the night season entering into that which is empty, doth
make the water more cold. and in the air vnstopped and not full.

To cool in metal, i^ evil.




Ordinarily they are vessels of Copper, or of the lease of Milan, which are put
in wells for to make cold. The Copper, if it be not well tinned within,
doth suffer too enter into that which is to be made cold an, evil quality:
for with the moisture of the well, there is grown in it immediately, a
certain greenesse that is seen upon it, after it hath stood a few days,
which is a thing very evil and hurtful.

The leaf of Milan is made of Iron, the which with the moisture of the well is
taken forthwith with rust, which is a black thing that is seen upon it after
a few days, which is an evil thing, which doth infuse an evil quality
into that which is drunk. And therefore I am of the opinion that that which
should be made cold in the water of a well, should be in a glassed vessel or
of silver, The best manner how to make cold with the water of a well.
although the best way is to take out water of a well, and put it into a
vessel, in the which should be put that which should be made cold, moving
the water many times: for by taking the water out of the well, it loses much
of his evil vapours, by reason it is visited of the air, which as is said,
doth show the incovenience that there is by making cold in a well.

And besides that, we see that the water hath ever a taste of earth, or of
some evil taste, that is perceived notably, after it is drunk, besides the
evil smell which we see tha^ it takes.

The third manner and fashion to make cold, is with saltpetre, The third way
or manner howe to ^ake cold with saltpetre.
the which is an invention of merchants, and in especially of such as go in
the Galley, by reason that there the air doth not make cold, and especially
in the time of calms, and there is neither wells nor snow. Necessity did
teach the this remedy, although it is not good, for the great inconveniences
which it hath. It doth cool, as some say, the cold running unto the inner
parts of that which it doth make cold, for the excessive heate which the
saltpetre hath, the which is done with the strong force of the saltpetre with
the water, which the saltpetre being entered into the inner parts makes to
be cold, coming from the heate of the saltpetre working upon the strong
force thereof. Other say, that the water doth make it self gross with the
saltpetre, and being made more thick and gross, it hath more cold virtue,
the which being helped with the heate of the saltpetre, the cold makes a
greater pear^ing, through the water, for al things that are cold, the more
thick parts that they have, Galen.
the more they cool. And so Galen saith in the books of the simple medicines,
that nothing ca be very cold, which hath subtle thin parts, by the which howe
more thick the things are the more force they are of. Other there be which say
that the saltpetre hath an actual virtue, very cold, and working with the
water, is made more cold: as is seen by the brine, that after the salt is very
much stirred in the water, it is most cold. The selfsame is seen in the water
of Allom, The hurt it doth.
and of saltpetre. This manner of making cold doth cause many diseases, it doth
heate the liver, it causes continual heate, and a hot burning, it inflames
the lungs, it takes away the lust of meat and other evils, which would be
tedious to treat of.

There are other ways to make cold, which are in rivers, and most cold
fountains, Other ways to make cold.
whereof Galen speaks, of the which it is not needful to treat of, for
whereas are most cold waters, it is not needful to put them to be made cold,
but to use of them as they are.

We have showed howe the water that should be made rain with the coldness
of the middle region of the air, Snow and rain water doth differ in little.
did freeze, and was made snow, and therefore is little difference from the
rain water, and that which comes forth of the snow, for both of them are
engendered of one manner of matter, saving that the water which proceeds of
the snow, is somewhat more gross, for the compultion it hath, of the coldness
of the air, in such sort that it is not so evil, as they say it is. And we see
the Scithians do drink it continually, as Hypocrates saith. We see that of
the snow which doth melt, are made great and mighty rivers, of the which the
people that inhabit near to them, drink continually without doing to them any
manner of hurt, or benumbing of them. And of these are many in Spain, Almanie,
and many more in the west Indies, where most of the rivers are of snow, which
doth melt from the hills and mountains, and al people in general drink of
them, for there is no other water in al the Country.

The Romaynes for delight and curiosity, drank the water that came forth of
the snow, the which they strained through stones to make it more thin.
Atheneo, Atheneo.
doth rehears^ certain verses of Sopita, an ancient Poet, in the which he
saith, that in his time they drank snow, and the water wc came forth of the
snow. Pericrates, Historiographer being a Greek most famous, saith yt in his
time, Pericrates.
they drank snow, not only in the Cities but in the camps. Euticles a man
very learned, Euticles.
in one of his epistels doth reprehend those that were in his time, that they
did not content themselves to drink that which was made cold with snow, but
that they drank the snow it self. Sciates, makes mention of the snow, used
at times convenient, Sciates.
with much care and delight. Xenophon in the things of memory which he wrote,
Xenophon.
makes mention of many people that did not only drink snow, but the water
thereof continually.

The Romanes did use it much, and so Plinie in the 31. book of his history
saith, Plinie.
that Nero was the first that sod w^ters, to cool it in Snow. The which
Galen in the seventh of his Methodo doth recite of him, saying, Nero was the
first that sod the waters, and afterward cooled them with Snow: for the
water being made cold in this sort, receives more quickly the cold, and
more effectually. And it is a water more healthful, for by the seething of it,
is avoided the earthly parts from the water, and it remains more subtle,
and more thin, and so it descends more speedily from the stomach.

Plinie in his natural history, in the nineteenth book, complains of the
care that those of his time had, Plinie.
in keeping the Snow of the Winter, for the hot weather in Summer, saying,
that they did overthrow the mountains by keeping the snow from warm weather,
making it to pervert the order of nature, that in the months which are most
what, in the which there is nothing but heate drithe, that the curiosity of
the people is so much that at that time, there is such abundance of snow, as
in the months in the which there doth naturally fall upon the ground great
quatity thereof. This Plinie says, for in his time and after, it was a common
thing to keep the snow of the winter, for the summer. Heliogabalo Emperor had
made a great cave in a little mountain, Reliogabalo.
from a garden of his own, where he gathered in the winter very great
quantity of snow, bringing it from the mountains that were nearest to Rome,
whereof they used in time of heate, in their bankettes.

Chares Militineus, in the history that he writes of King Alexander says,
Chares Militineus.
that in the City of Petra, a most populous City in Asia, there was,
ordinarily thirty caves, that in the winter time were filled with Snow, for
the what weather, for the service of Alexander, such as were retainers to him.

At this day it is done, not only in Asia, Snow is kept by many people.
but also in many parts of Africa, and in all Europe, chiefly in all the
Countries which are under the dominions of the great Turk, and especially in
Constantinople, where the snow is so much used, that all the year it is sold
in public market, and they use of it al the year. The self same is done at
this day in all the states of Almanie and of Flaunders, Hungary, and Bohemia,
and other places, where they keep the Snow, in houses, and baw^es in the
Winter, for to make their drink cold therewith in the summer.

They carry from Flaunders to Paris, the water that is frozen, which is more
then three score leages distance. Likewise in our country of Castile it is kept
in houses, and they gather it in the winter: and when winter is past, they
conserve it for the whote weather. And there are many Lords and great men,
which have in the mountains particular houses, where they command that it be
put in the winter, for this effect: and many of them do use it, and do make
cold therewith as well in the winter, as in the summer, as there are chiefly
in Castile in the time of winter, waters that are most cold.

They which drink that which is made cold with snow, say that it doth not
offend them, The cold which doth proceed of Snow, doth not offend as
o^her cold doth.
as that which is made cold with the weather, for it is seen that a cup of
cold water being drunk, that comes forth of a well, or of a cold
fountain, hurts such as do drink it, and drinking that which is made cold
with snow, they feel no such hurt.

I do much marvel at one thing, How car^les ^eople are that they have not had
Snow in S^uill*
that this City of Siuill being one of the most famous of the World, wherein
always have lived many great personages of very high estate, and many people
of great estimation as well of the natural people of the Country, as
strangers, that there hath bin none which have brought thither snow in the time
of what weather for to make cold that which they drink, seeing that the heate
of this country from the beginning of Summer, until it be well near towards
Winter, is so great, that it is not to be suffered, and all the waters are most
what, that they cannot scarcely be drunk. And besides that the most part of
the people of this City are people of much business and cares. And seeing
that in a Country so what where business and cares do abound where the
water is what, An exhortation.
and nothing wherewithal to cool it; with just Title it may be admitted and
used that it may be cooled with snow, seeing that the coldness is so sure, as
we have said, and it doth make the benefits which Galen and Auicen have showed
unto us.

Note.
Let every one look upon his disposition that being whole, although he be
not altogether in health, in time of what whether he may drink cold more or
less as it is convenient for him. For the drinking cold doth temper the
Liver, it mitigateth the heate, it gives appetite to meat, it comfort the
stomach, The good that drinking cold doth.
it gives strength too all the four virtues, that may do their works the
better, the meat is eaten with appetite, and with gladness it takes away the
drithe in the day time, it causes that the stone doth not engender in the
raynes, by keeping temperate the heate of them, it takes away lothsomnesse,
and likewise it doth many other good effects, that the use and thereof
experience ode show us.

And because it is the best manner too make cold with Snow as we have said,
Auicen.
let us a^we thereof with grave Authors: and let Auicen be the first, in the
third of the first, where he saith, The water that is made cold with snow,
unto such as are of a temperate complexion, whereas coldenesse hath been made
with Snow, yea although the snow be foul and not clean then it serves to
make cold the water without: and that as is good and clean, is to be put in,
to that which shall be drunk, as Auicen himself shows in the second part of
the first book, the 16. chapter, where he saith, the snow and the frozen
water, when it is clean, and that the Snow hath not fallen upon evil
plants, or that it be not mingled with earth, or other super^u^ties, and the
frost not made of evil infected waters, but that the water which come forth
of the snow, be clear and clean, and the water that comes forth of the
frost, be also good and clean, if any part of the water of the snow or of
the frost be put into the water that must be drunk, or with them the water
be made cold without dout it is good: for the waters which come forth of them,
be not strange from other waters.

This doth Auicen say, giving to understand that these waters which do
proceed of snow and of frost being clean, do not differ from the goodness of
other waters: only the difference is, that the water of the snow and of the
frost are grosser then other waters, by reason that the vapour is congeled in
the middle region of the air, as we have declared. Rasis amongst the
Arabiens the best learned, Ras^*
in the third book of those which he wrote to the King Almasor says thus,
The water of snow cools the Liver that is what, being taken after meat, it
strengthens the stomach, it gives appetite and lust to meat, but that which
is drunk may not be much. And immediately after he saith, the water which hath
not so much coldness, that it gives not contentment to him that drinks it,
fills the belly, takes not away the drithe, it destroys the appetite, it
takes away the lust of the meat, it consumes the body, and concludes, in
saying, that it is not a thing convenient to be drunk.

I do understand it for the preservation of the health of man, of the which
Rasis, Ide^.
treating in that book himself in the 4. of Almasor, speaking of the
preservation from the (...) and there comes to him hurt and poison, which
destroys and corrupts him: believe you me, and suffer not such which are
sick, to spend their money to cast gold in medicines which they take, nor let
them quench gold that is what in wine, nor in water, for of the one and of
the other, there remains no medicinal virtue, that will remedy their evils.
Only the gold being made money, hath great virtues and properties, for that is
it that makes the hart glad, and takes away sadness and melancholy, and
repairs al the virtues and strength of man, it gives strength whereas is
none, it is an universal remedy of al things, unless it be of death: for
against that, nothing can prevail. And seeing that night is come, and time
gives not unto us any longer liberty, and although that it gave us; yet age
doth his office, for I feel my self weary. God be with you Master Ortuno,
and likewyse to you Master Burgus, and I go to take rest.

Written by Doctor Monardes Physician of Seuill. 1574

To the excellent Lord the Earl of Barajas assistent of the city of Seuill c.
the Doctor Monardes your Physician wishes health.
MOst excellent Lord, the fair white snow doth complain unto me, saying:
that she being so ancient, and of so many ages, celebrated of so many Princes,
Kings, wise and valiant m^n, and being had in so great estimation and price,
that with great care they seek after her, with greater care they do conserve
her, for to give health contentment to all persons: yet for all this, many
people with little consideration, not knowing what they say, do persecute her,
putting indecent names to her: and that which doth most grieve her is, that
some Physicians, either for ignorace, or for malice, do speak evil of her, not
perceiving what so many learned me have treated said of the great utility profit
which she doth to many, as experience doth show, all people do understand,
chiefly when they do drink their drink most cold with the benefit which doth
remain to them thereof, they do praise extol her. Moreover she saith, that she
forces no person to use her: but if any will use her, she can give such order
manner to make cold the drink, as is convenient for al persons, giving the
degrees of coldenesse which every one would have, which doth best appertayn to
them, this with all assurance with only leaving or placing the vessel wh^rein
the drink is joined ne'er to her, the which none of the old writers nor of the
late did speak against, or forbid. And especially let this manner of making
cold not be done with stinking water of a well, nor with the most burning
Saltpetre, but with pure water being clean and clear. These coplaintes many
other the fair lilly white Snow hath uttered unto me, in the end she lastly
said to me, that since that I had praised her so much, and taken in hand to
favour h^r, that I should (...) lie the fire hath no mixture of other Elements,
and amongst these Elements the air is very principal, which is divided into
three parts, one is the supreme, and near to the R^gion of the efire, which
is whotte and dry for the fellowship that it hath therewith, taking much of
his quality, which is clear and pure, from whence do not proceed any
wyndes, nor clouds: and this they call the celestial Region and the parts
more lowe which are near too the water and earth be grea^ and troubled full of
Uapours, pierced and visited with the beams of the Sun, whereby it comes
too be whotte and the supreme and middle Region of the air doth come too
be very cold, because it stands in the midst of the two extremities,
being so whotte. And in it, is increased the cold as in the middle part
fleing from the extreme parts of heate, as we have spoken of before. This
middle part hath parts more or less cold, for the part that is joining
near unto us is not so cold, as that which is near to the superior parts of
the fire. And how much more the vapours do rise up on height, the more they do
congele, and hold fast. In the middle region of the air do engender the
clouds, the small raynes, the drops, the frost, the rain, the Snow, the
Hayle, and other impressions as the Thunder, lightnings and sharpe showers, and
comets. The Clouds be the principal matter which do engender the Rain, the
Snow, and the Hayle, and the other impressions which we have spoken of, that
are made of many Uapours which do rise up from the lower parts unto the
middle Region of the air: and so being joined, they make one body, and they
wax thick with the cold of the said place: and for this the cloud is like
to a mother, and is the common matter of all the impressions that are made in
the air. And so it is of the snow as a thing engendered of it, in the middle
Region of the air. And the Snow is no other thing but a Uapour, cold, and
moist, which came into the middle Region of the air, being engendered, in the
body of the Cloud with a mean coldenesse which is not so strong as that
which doth cause the Hayle, nor so soft as that which doth cause the water,
and in the like Uapour before it be made water, it both, congeal and freeze,
and doth fall broken in pieces and are white, because there do rain in them
more cold then in the water.

The which Galen doth show unto us in the book of the Philosophical history
of Anaximenes the Philosopher. Of the congealed air, Galen.
Anaximenes.
he says that the clouds are made; and of the same, being more thick, the
rain is engendered, and the same is congealed and frozen, and by the coldenesse
of the Air it is made Snow: and being more congealed it is made Hayle. And
the same Galen doth say in his book de Vtilitate respirationis, the Clouds
congealed are made Snow: which is the matter that the rain is made of, the
Snow doth fall in the high places, which of their own nature are cold
places, and thereby it is much conserved, and very seldom it falls in the
Ualleyes, and if it do fall there, it is very small, forthwith it dissolveth.
It falls in the Sea but seldom times by reason of the heat which it hath, for
the winds that are continually in it, for heat moisture are cotraries much more
the wind accompanied with the sun. Galen in the nienth of his simples, says,
that there were Philosophers that said the snow had hot parts for being take
in the hand, Galen.
it heats burns like to fire. And so the said Galen in the 4. of the said
Books, says as he went upon snow, his feet did burn: the cause of this is
not that the snow is what, nor that it hath what parts, but with his cold it
doth shut the pores of the hands or feet and causes that the heate which is
in the inner parts have not where to come forth: so being shut in, do cause so
great a kindlying, that seems to burn: the which we see contrary if the
hands do burn be put into what water, as ye pores (...) drinking of the
coldest water they were healed, as Galen saith in the 7. of his Method^, ^alen.
that he saw in one day, ye^ in one hour, with a draught of cold water many
diseases were healed, and some of these were weak of stomach, not only, with
cold water of a fountain, but with water cooled in snow, Cornelio Celso.
and in Ro^e it is used. And so Cornelio Celso in his first book, unto such as
were weak of stomach, commanded them to drink, after they had eaten, the
coldest water they could get, and in choleric stools, should be drunk water,
that was most cold, and in runnings of what humours, it should be used, for to
stay the flux. Auicen in the said chapter saith, Auicen.
that the cold water doth comfort all the ^ertues in his works that is to say
the virtue disgestiue, attractive, retetiue, and expulsiue. And so he goes
declaring every one of them, giving us to understand how much the cold water
doth corroborate and make strong al these virtues, whereby they do their
works the better. Auicen.
And the said Auicen in the second of his first treaty of water, says, the
cold water is the best of all waters, and it is convenient for them which are
whole, for it gives lust to meat, makes the stomach strong. And a little
before he says, that which is not cold doth corrupt digestion, and
causes the meat to swim in the stomach, it takes not away the drithe, it
causes the dropsy, by reason it corrupts the first disgesti^n, consumes
the body with his heate. Auicen himself confirms this in the third of the
first part, Auicen.
saying, the cold water is convenient for them that have a temperate
complexion, for being what, it causes the stomach to be sick. Isaac Aliabas,
Isaak.
and Rasis, say the same, that Auicen saith, the which he did let to write of,
Allabos.
because he would not be long in his sayings. Rasit.
One thing Auicen would have in the third of the first part, Aui^en
that he which should drink very cold, must first make a good foundation,
eating first a good portio of meat, before he drink. Also he saith that the
cold drink may not be drunk much at one draught, but by little and little, by
reason it doth bring two benefits, which is, that there is taken more taste in
that which is dr^nke, Who drink cold, let them dri^ke little and little.
and it do^th not kill the natural heat, as it is seen by the pot that
boils, if you cast into it much water at one time, it doth cease boiling,
but if it be cast by little and little, it cease not his working. And therefore
Auicen himself says, when that you will drink cold, that you drink with a
vessel which hath a straight mouth, that the drink run not in hastily, the
said vessel being a limet, or a yewre, with a point, surely it is a great
benefit, for them which are affectioned to drink with the like ^esselles: if
they ought first to take out the wind or not, I do remit me to the Doctor
Villalabos, who treats largely of this matter.

And by that it is seen howe Auicen would that those which would drink very
cold, You must ^ot dri^ke cold at the beginning of meat.
they should not drink forthwith at the beginning of their meat. For s^me
there be, that as soon as they begin to eat, forthwith they will drink,
that as is very cold, the stomach being empty without meat, which cannot
choose but hurt: and so the hurt which doth come to them by this, they do
attribute it, forthwith to the cold of the drink, and not to their evil
order: the which Auicen saith, speaking of cold water, that to drink it
without order, is the cause of many diseases, if it be drunk in order, as well
in time, as in quantity, it profits as he hath said. Therefore let every one
loke to that which is convenient for him, and let him make experience in
himself, and if that it be convenient for him to drink cold, that he may
bear, it without that it do offend him that do it, for thereof will follow
the benefits which we have spoken of, but if he be sick, and fall into any
disease, whereby he saith, that the drinking of cold drink doth offend
him, in such case let him not use it, for my intent is to sh^w and persuade
them that do drink cold, that if it do them no hurt, nor offend them that
they drink it so, a^d such as do use it of custom and have experience that
it do not offend the, unto such i^ they drink not, that which they drink
cold, the lust of their meat is taken away from the, for they take no taste in
that which they eat, and they eat it with grief, and with an evil will, for
that which they drink doth not satisfy them, the what drink doth fill the
stomach full of windinesse, and cannot make therewith a good digestion.

But what is he that hath a reasonable health, being in the time of great
heate, He doth counsel to drink cold.
or in the what summer, that coming to eat, being weary of exercise, or of
great labour having the tongue dry, the breath short, that doth let to
drink cold, seeing that to do it, there do follow the benefits that I
have said, and doth succour his necessity, and remain content and glad
without having offended his disposition, and health. Unto the which Galen doth
animate and exhort v^, in the book which he made of good and evil meates,
saying. In the time of hot weather, when our bodies are what and sometimes
inflamed, then we must use of things that may refresh us: although that they
be evil meates, as Plummes, Apples, Cherries, Melons, Goords, of other cold
fruits, in these like times. Galen saith, that we may use cold meates, as
the feet of a pig or hog sodden in vinegre, and crudded milk: and the
same meates must be made cold, and likewyse the drink must be made cold, as
the water, and the wine watered with cold water, or made cold in snow, the
one and the other must be made cold in the most cold water of a fountain, and
if it be not to be had, let it be made cold in snow, chiefly the drink.
Galen.
And after that Galen hath made a large digression, as it is convenient so much
in the time of great heate to eat and to drink cold things, he doth
describe who they are that should drink cold, and saith in this sort, those
that should drink cold are such, as have much buzines, and have care of many
things, as those which are governors of cities, and common wealths, and the
ministers which do help them, and do participate of such cares and troubles,
and those that are much exercised in bodily buzines, in especially the
sowldierlyke exercises, or other great exercises, and they which do journey,
and inespecially long iorneyes, giving to understand all corporal exercises.
Here I do see many being sick, and having great occasions of sickness, after
that they drink cold, they are whole: and when they use it not, they become
sick again. And although experience do show it, yet Galen doth teach it
us, in many places, being the Prince of Physic. Galen.
For in the third degree of the substance of meates, he saith, that unto them
which are what of stomach, it is convenient that their drink be made cold
with snow: the same he doth confirm in the book of good and evil meates. And
in the 7. of his Methodo, it hath been seen, as he saith, that diseases have
been healed, Galen.
and the griefs of the stomach with cold water, made cold with snow, and in
the 6. of the Epidimias he doth use much of water, first sodden and after
cooled with snow, Galen.
and in many parts he doth put to cool in snow the medicines, which he
doth use of: and the same do the Arabiens, for that, as it is said, it doth
seem that the snow was had in reverence, by the ancient wryters, and that
they did use of it in the preservation of their health, and in the healing of
their diseases, for that it was the best manner how to nake it cold, more
clean, and more without scruple. For the cold that proceeds of snow, is
healthful without receiving hurt, by that which is cooled with it, nor causes
any alteration because it is a very good congeled water, and doth make cold.

Truth it is, that it is not convenient to use of the said snow continually,
if it be not in time of need, How it ought to be used.
by the way of medicine: for the use of the said snow drunk in water or in
wine, or putting the snow into them, doth engender many kind of diseases,
which if presently they be not felt, they come to be felt in age: Of the which
Galen doth make a large relation, in the book of diseases of the raynes, and
in the book of good and evil meates. And because that Auicen did expound them,
I will show what he writes, in the third part of the first book, in the 8.
chapter: He which doth drink snow, and the water that doth proceed out of the
same snow, if he do use it continually there will follow much hurt thereby:
it doth offend the sinews, and it is nought for the breast, and for the inner
members, and especially for the breathing: and there is none that do use to
drink it, but it will do them hurt, unless he be of a sanguine complexion
which if he do not feel hurt presently, he shall feel it afterward.
Whereby it appears howe evil the use of the said snow is, and the water
which doth come out of it, if it be not by the way of medicine, only so it
may be used to cool therewith, for in such sort it doth not offend, as is
said. For in this neither the ancient wryters did put any doubt of hurt, nor
any scruple, and now we see that it hurts not, but brings health, and
benefit, as we have said.

And as Plinie also saith, of the delight and dayntinesse of the cold, Pl^nie.
without offence of any malice of the Snow. And Martial doth show the same,
Martial.
in the 4. book, where he saith, the snow must not be drunk, but that licor
which is made very cold with it. And this was showed and taught unto us, by
the most ingenious drithe.

And unto such as are very cold, it comes not well to pas, for them to
drink that, which is made cold with snow, or that which is very cold, if he
be not accustomed thereto: for by custom, they may use and drink it without
any offence to them, but it is good that they moderate themselves in drinking
that which is very cold, and that they con^ent themselves that it be made
cold, after a mean sort, although it be with snow. Also it is not
convenient for children, nor boys, that their drink be made cold, with snow,
for the weakness of the sinews, and interior parts, and for the tenderness
of their age, and chiefly they may drink no wine, but water, for that their
age doth not suffer, that they may drink it: and drinking water very cold,
it doth them very much hurt. The wine which is made cold with snow, doth
not offend so much as the water which is made cold: one of the things which
takes away the fury and strength of the Wine, is the making of it cold.

And so there are three things which do abate the fury of the wine, that is,
Three things which aba^e the fury of the wine.
to water it a good time before you drink it. Also to cast a piece of bread
into it, that it may suck the vapours, and subtlety of the wine. The third
is, to put it to cool some reasonable time in water, that is most cold, or in
snow, for the more it is cooled, the more the strength and vapours are
repressed, and so it will less offend the head, and it will less penetrate
the joints, which is seen in the said wine, and being made cold there is
abated much of his strength, in so much that if it be very cold, it seems
as though that it were water. Some people there are which do say and publish
much evil of the cooling with snow, without knowing if it be good or evil:
and as it is a new thing, and especially in this Country, they fear that
there will come hurt to them by the use of it. And I being at the table of a
Lord, there was brought a platter full of Cherries with snow upon them, and
there was a Gentleman that durst not take any one of them, saying that they
would hurt him, History.
because that they were made cold with Snow. And as it was a thing used a
long time, to cast snow upon fruit, Snow vpo^ f^uite.

Galen.


as Galen doth say that it was cast upon the Mulberry, the cause of this is for
lack of the use thereof, by reason it hath not been used nor seen in these
parts, and always they take it for suspicious.

And here are none that do use it, but the noble men, and not al, but such as
have been Courtiers and such as have proved the benefit and commodity that
doth follow of it: for the rest say, that without know they have loved, and
without it, they will pas on their time. And they do not consider that to live
they may pass with Beef, and Garlyke, and Leekes, but these kind of meates
do engender evil humours: for it is one thing to eat the partridge, the veale
at his time, and mutton byrds at another time. And there is differice to eat
the flesh with sauce, the partridge with a Lemon, for the one is to eat
without taste rustically, and the other is to eat as men do, choicely and
delicately. And so it is in the drinking of cold, or what, for of the drink
that is made cold with snow, there follows health, taste contentment: and of
the drink that is what, comes evil diseases, distyl^ing, discontentment.
Let us consider vow the old wryters took great felicity to drink cold, The
old wryters did use much to cool with snow.
and chiefly that which was made cold with snow, and they were people both wise
and discrete, and with much care that preserved their health. For in this and
in their estimations, in their manner of subtle living, they did put their
whole felicity* seeing that they with so much care as we have before declared,
did drink that which they made cold with snow, in countries that was of
lesser heate then this, wherefore should we not enjoy this benefit, and
cont^ntment, seeing that thereof cannot follow unto us, but great benefit of
health, using thereof as I have said?

Note.
Let every one look to that it is conueniet for his health, age, use, and
custom, and let him have respect to that which doth agree with him: for the
use will show him what he shall do, seeing that of the hurt or benefit, he may
soon perceive if it ought to be used, or no, he must be advised that at the
be^inning when he doth use to drink cold, that which is made cold with snow,
the first days he shall feel in the day time drithe, but being past 7. or.8.
days, it is taken away, rather they go between dinner and supper without
drith, without having any need to drink.

They do bring the snow to this country, from the moutains whereas is much snow
6. leagues beyond Granado. The snow hath many things to preserve it, Fro whence
they bring the snow.
because the way is long and it comes by a what country, by reason whereof it
doth much diminish, very little comes hither of that which they take out
there: and therefore it is so dear.

It is a marvelous thing that these mountains of Granado, are always full of
snow, Mountains of Snow.
that in them it is durable and perpetual, and for great heates, and sun,
that shines upon them: yet the snow continues in one state, and we see that
it doth not change. In the moutaines Pirineos, which are filled with snow every
winter, but the sumer being come, al is melted, in such sort that there
remains in them no snow. The kings of Granado, being in all their royal
authority did use in the months of great heat and time of summer, to drink
these waters which they drank made cold with snow, as our history writer
Alonso de Palensio doth refer himself too tha^ ^hich he wrote of the wars
of Granado.

Let the snow be kept in cold and dry places, for the moisture and heate are
his contrary, The conservation of the Snow.
the wind which comes of the si^ne, much more, because it is what moist. They
do tread or press the snow, when they put it in sellers to keep, that it
may the lodger endure melt less. Charles Militineus doth say that the snow must
be kept trod covered with leaves and bows of an Oak, Charles Militineus.
because in this sort it is most conserved. That which is brought to this
city, they bring it in straw, for it doth conserve it more then any other
thing, it doth melt the less: which the glorious S. Augustine doth show us
in the first book of the city of God, where he saith, who gave unto the straw
a cold virtue so strong, Saint Augusti^e.
that it kepeth the snow which is most cold and conserveth it? and who gave it
likewise so what fervent a virtue, that the green fruit not being ripe, as
apples and other like, The properties of straw.
it doth ripe and season them that they may be eaten? in the which it is seen
what diverse virtues the straw hath, seeing that it doe^h contrary effects
which doth conserve the snow, ^ doth make ripe the green fruit, and doth
more then the water, which is made cold in the dew, or in other thing: by
putting any vessel with it amongst straw, it doth conserve his coldenesse
all the day.

There were used two principal ways in these times too make cold with snow:
the one is, to put the bottles or the vessels of that as you will make cold,
buried in the snow, this is done where there is much snow, this doth make very
cold and quickly: the same is likewise done with the water frozen. There is
another way to make cold which is more easy and it is done with little snow,
which is to fill a vessel of that which is to be made cold, and put upon it a
little platter of silu^r or glass, or of ^hin Plate called the leaf of Milan
that it may be made so deep, whereby it may penetrate through that which
shall be made cold, and upon that deep vessel let the snow be put, and from
time to time, the water which doth melt from the snow must be taken away, With
a little platter.
for if it be not taken away, it heats the snow, and it melts the more.
After this sort it doth cool much, and makes it as exceeding cold as you
would drink it: and it is a way that every one may use more or less, as
cold as he will, or as he hath need of it. The selfsame is done with a long
cave made of the leaf of Milan, putting it full of snow, into the thing that
you mind to make cold continuing in it still, and this is to make any thing
cold in an earthen pot or any other great vessel. In a cave.


This manner of way is long or it be cold, and it is needful that it be put
long time before you go too meat, and for all this it will not make it very
cold. Others there be that do put the snow in a little basket, laid upon a
little straw, for this doth conserve the snow much, putting in one goblet
with that as you will drink, leaning harde too the snow: after this sort there
follows much benefit, for it is not needful to go taking away the water
from the snow, by reason that it goes away through the basket. And the other
is, that the snow doth not melt so much, let every man do as he hath the
quantity of Snow to do it withal, and likewise in the cooling of it, more
or less as his necessity and health doth require, and can bear well the use
thereof: of the which we have made a large relation, although that my intent
and purpose was for no more than too defend that the best way too make the
drink cold, and more healthful is to make cold with snow, and as for the
other manner of ways and uses too make cold, they have many inconveniences
which I have spoken of, and only too make cold with Snow, is that which is
convenient, seeing that the snow doth not touche the thing, only the little
platter that is made cold with it, is only that which doth make cold. All
other ways which doth make cold, doth not come near to the cooling with
snow by a great way, for that is most cold which is cooled with it, and all
other ways do seem whotte, being made cold in the dew, in wells, or
with saltpetre, in comparison of that which is made cold with snow. And so it
is a great thing, and too be much esteemed that in the time of what weather,
when we^ are made a burning cole, of the extreme heate of the time, when the
drithe is so great, that it makes us to sound and our bodies are so burning
and sweating, that we have so easy a remedy with a little Snow, we may
drink so cold as is convenient for us, and as cold as we will, with all
assurance of health giving us so much delight and contentment, that there is
no price to be esteemed too it, nor understanding that can expound it, of the
which every one that doth drink cold with snow may be judge of my Apology
when they do make an end to drink by means of the most cold snow.

By that which is said, it is seen what a thing snow is, how the use of it
was esteemed amongst the people of old time for to make cold therewith, as the
best manner of these which are to make cold withal, and more agreeable to our
health and necessity, is that which is done therewith; also as the drinking
cold doth bring so many benefits and commodities, the drinking hot so many
hurts discomodities, seeing that to use it is to make lean, and debilitate the
stomach, it doth make the meat to swim in it, it doth corrupt the digestion,
whereby it doth consume and weaken the body, it engenders winds, it is the
cause that the Liver is debilitated, weakened, it causes continual drithe, it
doth not satisfy our necessity, it gives pain and grief and other hurts,
that he which doth use it, shall quickly feel them in himself. The which is
contrary to them that do drink cold being cold of his own nature, or made
cold with snow, for that it doth comfort the stomach if it be weak,
stregtheneth it doth stay the flixe, runninges of what humours to it, therefore
it takes a way stools and vomits being choleric, it doth comfort all the 4.
virtues, it takes away the driche, it gives lust to eat, it makes the
digestion better, you drink less that with more contentment gladness,
satisfiing us more to a little cold drink, then much which is what. It doth let
the engendering of the stone unto the which are what of coplection, it makes
teperate the heat of the liner, it takes away the kindling of the fire of them
that are too hot, or inflamed of what cause soever it be, it tempers the
excessive heate of the summer, it preserves from the plague in the time of it,
and being taken upon meat it strengthens natural heat, that it may make
better his digestion work, it takes away the sharp pains which comes of
any hot cause, it takes away the trembling of the heart, it makes glad them
that are melancholy, it takes from wine his fury vapours, the fruits put in
snow, cause, that they do not corrupt, he that drinks cold doth enjoy the
daintiness of the cold that it doth make, which is a thing that cannot be
expressed and the understanding of man cannot comprehend it. They which may
liberally drink cold being made cold with snow, are such as be temperate of
coplection full of flesh, those which are of a choleric complexion, hot
inffamed, the which are what of the liver, and of the stomach, they which are
sanguine and do exercise themselves and labour as men of great buzinesse, they
which have many cares, the governors of cities common we^lthes: the ministers
of them, which do participate of the like cares and troubles, they which do
exercise themselves in warlike affairs, and other great business, they which
go much and have laboured much, they which do suffer burning Agues, and evils
of great heate and inflammations, above al, those which are accustomed to drink
it herein, let every man drink cold, or most cold as he hath necessity, and as
it is most convenient for him: to such as it is not convenient to drink cold,
nor most cold, are they that are very old, and such as do live idly,
without exercise, and without care, they which have rawnesse in their stomachs,
they which suffer griefs of cold humours, they which are sick in the breast,
they which have diseases of the sinews, they which cannot taste that they eat
for humours or cold causes, they which do suffer muc^ ventosity, children, and
such as are of young age, and others to whom time and use have showed what is
convenient for them. And thus we en^ our Apology.

Finis.
