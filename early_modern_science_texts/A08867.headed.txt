To the right Honourable Sir William Cecill Knight, principal Secretary to the
Queenes highness, Master of her Majesties Court of Wards and Liuereyes.
THe favourable accepting of my simple travails lately dedicated unto your
honour, hath so much boldened and thorowelye encouraged me, that mawgre the
despite of most reproachful tongs, I have not feared to finish the course of my
long pretended race: with no less profit as I trust, unto a number, than
painful travail unto myself. Wherein if I had known at the first, as much
as since I have perfectly understood, neither had I as then taken upon me so
great an enterprise, nor since so rudely finished, the translation of so
eloquent a Poet. For when I first began to employ some part of my leisure
about it, making dilligente inquiry, I could learn of no man that ever had
attempted to english the same. So that perceiving my labour to be no hindrance
to any other mans praise, and lamenting to see so Christian a writer to lie hyd
and unknown to the ignorant sort, I thought I should not do amiss, if al
that in me lay I bestowed, in the albeit simple and slender, yet faithful and
true translation, of so virtuous a work. But since I have certaynely
understood, that when I first began to fall in hand withal, three books
thereof were both eloquentely and excellently englished, by Master Smith, clark
unto the most honourable of the Queenes Majesties counsel. Whose doings, as in
other matters I have with admiration beheld, so in this I am well assured I
should with an amassed mind have scene: I would that either I had latelier
begone it, or else that he had fallen in hand sooner with it, whereby my gross
homely style might have been no hindrance to the fruits of so pure a pen.
But since it was my fortune, so blindly to venture upon it, I trust my
travail shall never the more be envied. I could not (when I had long debated
ye matter with my self) find out a Poet more meet for the teaching of a
Christian life (an estate in these our days most miserably decayed) than this
no less learned than famous Italio: Marcellus Pallingenius, a man of such
excellent learning and Godly life, that neither ye unquietness of his time
(Italie in those days raging with most cruel bloody wars) no yet the
furious tyranny of the Antichristian Prelate (under whose ambitious and
Tirannicall governance he continually lived) could once amass the Muse, or
hinder the zealous and virtuous spirit of so Christian a Soldier. I have many
times much mused with my self, howe (living in so dangerous a place) he durst
take upon him so boldly to control the corrupt and unchristian lives of the
whole College of contemptuous Cardinals, the ungracious ouerseeings of
bloudthyrsty Bishops, the Panchplying practises of pelting Priors, the
manifold madness of mischievous Monks, with the filthy fraternity of
flattering Friars. Which surely he durst never have done, but only that he was
heartened with a happy and heavenly spirit. Which notable audacity of his was
wonderfully revenged by the malicious hands of such as felt themselves fretted
with his spiritual corsey. For when they had not power to execute their
tyranny upon his innocent body in time of his life, their mischievous malice
was no whit ashamed to consume with fire the blameless bones of so virtuous a
man: yea and that a great while after his death. Besides the reproving of the
lewd lives of the Clergy, he boldly inveighed against the graceless governance
of proud pompous Princes, ye licentious living of the riottous nobility, the
covetous catchings of greedy Lawyers, the ungodly gains of foolish Physicians,
and the corrupted consciences of deceytf^ Artificers: affirming plainly, that
if they did not better beautify their christian names with a more christia
life, of so many thousands as have in vain received that most holy sacrament of
sacred Baptism, there should scarce three aspire unto the enheritaunce of
Heavenly joys. What doth your honour suppose this man would have written? Unto
how great a volume do you think his works would have amouted, if so that GOD
had appointed him to flourish at this preset time in England, whereas pitifully
reigns such mostrous horrible pride, such cankered and spiteful malice, such
false feigned fredships, such lack of love and charity, such professing of God
in words, denying him in works, as doubtless is not to be found among the
faythlesse Turks, miscreant Sarazes, or superstitious Jewes: Better were it in
my fancy not at al to profes his name, tha thus with devilish life to make it
be evil spoken of amongst the heathen. The Prophet Essay. 52.
saith, Vae vobis propter quos nome meum male audit apud gentes. Vae qui
consurgitis c. Essay. 5.
It is not our christendom assuredly that living so unlike Christians shall
bring us to Heaven, as S. Chrisostome in these words doth wytnesse. Sin vero
no tibi quidem ipse luce as, no propriam putredinem foetorem{que} detergas,
quibus te indicijs ego fidelem In Cap. 1. Mat. Ho: 4
potero agnoscere: an quia sacrati aquas fontis ingressus es? at hoc ipsu fit
tibi grauioris viatticu supplicij. I would therefore wish that we should not to
much presume of the security obtained by a Christian name, but that we should
with al our endeavour apply our selves to show such fruits as duty requires
in the followers of Christ. Whereby we should not only prevail against our
enemies, and stop the mouths of our slanderous adversaries, but also enjoy
a blessed and happy tranquillity in this world, and be assured to obtain the
promised pleasures in the world to come. For the teachinge whereof, I know no
man that hath so much travailed and perfectly profyted, as hath this Poet,
which I here present unto your honour, about whom although I have lately ken
some pains, not enjoying all the while so quiet a mind as had been needful
for such a labour, nor having the familiar conference of any studious friends
whereby in some doubts I might better have been resolved. I am well assured I
shall receive for reward, the reprechfull reports of a number of infamous
tongs, as by the publishing of my first attempts I have been sufficiently
taught. What remedy? If this my travail shall find favour at the hands of
your honour and others of perfectness in judgment, I do little esteem the
fond surmisings of the scornful company, nor the rash report of so fond a
fellowship, advising them rather to prove the like labour, than hawetyly to
reprove any well meaning mind. I have longer here continued my Barbarous style
than reason doth allow: wherefore ceasing (for avoiding of tediousness) with
so vnperfecte an end, I most humbly beseechs your honour to take in good
part this so simple and slender a gyfte, which although it hath escaped at
the first impression with a number of faults, I trust hereafter shall
perfectelye be purged. God long preserve your honour in prosperous estate.

Your Honours humble and faithful seruaunt Barnabae Googe.

To the virtuous and frendely Reader.
WHat pleasure and profit the diligent reading of virtuous Poets doth
minister to the Godly and Christian mind, so evidently and plainly hath
always appeared, that I need not to bestow any time about the declaring
hereof. Neither was the statety style of Heroical verse, only had in price and
estimation with the learned Greekes and ^l^quent Romains (with whom Poets were
always esteemed and carefully provided for,) but also it seems there was no
little accoumpte made, of the pleasant agreement of ^u^ly measured words,
among those sacred Prophets that dire^ted the whole course and trade of their
life, to the pray^ng and pleasing of the almighty Lord. For as S. Hierome
testi^eth, the divine and notable Prophecies of Essay, the Lamentation of
Jeremie, the Songs Ballads of Salomen, the Psalter of Dauid, and the book of
Hiob, were written by ye first auctours in perfect and pleasant Hexameter
verses. So that the divine and canonical volumes were garnished and set forth
with the sweet according tunes, heavenly sounds of pleasant metre. Yet will
not the graceless company of our pernicious Hipocrites allow that the Psalmes
of Dauid (a most comfortable book) should be translated into English metre.
And why? Marry (say they) because they were only received to be chauted in the
Church, and not to be song in every Cobblers shop. O monstrous malicious
infidels, do you so much disclose your cankered stomachs towards the divine
Majesty, that you ab horre to hear his glory and praise sounding in ye mouth
of a poor Christian artificer? May none of your sacred secretes pass any
farther than your solemn sinagogs? What say you to Chrisostome who exhorted
his audience in this sort?

Dicat vir aliqua eorum quae nunc hic sunt Homy. 2. in 1. Cap. Gen.
dicta, audiat aunt Mulier, discant Pueri, discant Familiares, fiat{que} Domus
Ecclesia, vt ^ffugetur Diabolus, in fugam vertatur malus ille Daemon inimicus
salutis nostrae.

Let the goodman (saith he) tell to his family some of these matters, whereof
I have here entreated. Let the wife give care, let the children learn, let the
residewe be instructed, and let the house be made a Church, that the Devil may
be put to flight, that the wicked spirit and enemy of our salvation may be
chased away. If you had lived in these days Master Doctor, for your so saying
you should have been counted an Heritike, as a good Scholar alleging of late
days to Sir John lacklattin of the country, the auctority of sain^t Paule:
wilt thou have it (saith the Parson) S. Paule was an Heretike and so art thou.
I assure you yt Devil hath a faith and so have you. To return to thee,
loving and friendly reader: Seeing that with these ancient fathers and holy
Prophets, this kind of writing in verse was so highly esteemed, that the
Godly instructions of the Scripture, and the comfortable prophecies of our
merciful redeemer, were in this sort of writing uttered, yea since there was
such a grace given unto it that the Holy Ghost did therein prophecy of
Christ by the mouths of sinful Pagans, as it appears by the prophecy of
Uirgill.

Vltima Cumaei jam venit carminis aetas
Magnus ab integro seclorum nascitur ordo.
Jam redit Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regnae Eglog. 4.

Jam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.
Since this (I say) appears, be not so straight of judgment as I know a
number to be that can not abide to read anyething written in English verse,
which now is so plenteously enriched with a number of eloquent writers, that
in my fancy it is little inferior to the pleasant verses of the ancient
Romaines. For since the time of our excellent countryman sir Geffray Chaucer
who lives in like estimation with us as did old Ennius with the Latines.
There hath flourished in England so fine and filed phrases, and so good
pleasant Poets as may counter^ayle the doings of Virgill, Ouid, Horace,
Iuuenall, Martial, Lucan, Perseus, Tibullus, Catullus, Seneca, and Propertius.
Amongst whom (as most inferior to them all) I have for thy commodity brought
into English verse this virtuous Poet Palingen^. And though I have not so
eloquently Englished it as a number that may better tha I would have done, as the
worthiness of the autour seems to require, yet have I faithfully truly
translated it: giving in some places verse for verse, word for word: in other
places (where I have not precisely observed so strick^e an order) yet have I no
whit swarued from the perfect mind of the au^oure, to the entente that with
these sundry kinds of translations I might please every head. And if it so
happen to fall out that I satisfy not thine expectation, yet accept good Reader
my good will therein, which only means to please and profit thee. For which
I account my travails recopenced, if so be they shall be thankfully received
of thee. And for the other sort, I say unto them with Martial.

Qui ducis vultus, non legis ista libenter

The first Book of Pallingen, entitled Aries.
MY mind with fury fierce in flamd
of late I know not how,
Doth burn Parnasus hills to see,
adournd with Laurel bow,
The Camps so clear of Castaly,
where Muses sweet do sing:
The town Cyrrha doth me delight,
and trees that ever spring.
What darkness oh shall I now fly?
to me appears plain
The blissful beams of Eous bright,
the day returns again.
O darkness fade thy way from hence,
hyde thou thy self in hell.
The love of Muse and hie Iehoue,
doth both within me dwell.
And virtue doth not labour fear,
the way though hard it be,
O Phebus father Poets help,
disclose the doubts to me,
With Aganippes wholesome fode,
replenish thou my days:
Thy temple eke to come unto,
do thou direct my ways.
Defend me from the common sort,
that seek me to dispraise.
Not worse vnlikde now shall I be,
if that thou will me bless,
That I thy priest unknown and new,
my self to labour dress.
Thou lift men from base estate,
to honours them to call,
Without thy grace, the wit of man,
would perish soon and fall:
His voice and al would ware full horce
nothing would sweetly sound,
All sweet and pleasant melody,
would fall unto the ground.
And if thou wilt me favour now,
I will ascend the Skies,
And there thy hie and Godly works
contemplate with mine eyes.
Oh favour me, thou Phebus hie,
take thou from ground away:
Thy Poet prostrate here on earth,
if that by fates I may.
And you (O Nymphs) of Castaly,
if with unfeigned heart
I have approcht your learned doors,
if riottes fylthy art
Could not wtdraw my youthful years,
from honouring of your name,
No fylthy lust of beastliness
could ever me defame:
Then let my fame go fly abroad,
least that vnworthyly,
I shall be after thought to live,
and so my name shall dye.
For hope of glory and renown,
a man for to obtain,
Hath caused men in vertuousnesse
to take both care and payne.
And thou O famous worthy Prince
that Hercule hast to name,
Among the doughty Italian Dukes,
of most renowned fame.
And of the hie Estensian blood,
the chief illuster flower:
Whom Pallas in Parnafus caves,
hath nourished every hour,
Whom Muses nine with sacred milk
from tender years have fed,
Whereby a fame they hope to have
that never shall be dead:
Of Cyrrha eke the Laurel tree,
shall spring they trust again,
Though Mars doth let in spite of them,
and seeks to retain
Your noble heart into his tents
by al the means he may:
In tents where honour you shall have
that never shall decay,
Whereas your arms as right requires
shall richly decked be
With triumphs due to such a Prince
of lusty Laurel tree.
Draw ne'er and with a joyful face
thy Poet loke upon,
Willing to tread vnproued paths
that have not yet been gone.
And shewe-thy favour to a wight
that now abashed is:
So may Ferrarra see thee long
in perfect joy and blis,
Till after this thy joyful life,
a long and happy time,
Departing from the earth thou shalt
the starry heaven clime.
And if my Fatal years be long,
in time shall come the day,
When as your grace and worthy deeds
I shall at large display,
When Indie aye with Tartesse brinkes
thy name shall cause to sound:
Thy fame shall fly in every place
of Hiperbores ground.
In utter parts of Africa to,
you shall be known by me:
Then I with greater rage of Muse,
encouraged shall be,
And shall declare unto al men,
how that you do embrace
Justice, and eke what Godliness
and faith is in your grace,
What counsel doth in you abound,
what valiant worthy power,
How liberal with gentleness,
you are at every howre:
By me shall also wonder much,
the world in every place,
To see what wit and manners mild,
consists in your grace.
But now the things that I you give,
receive with gentle heart,
And take my present doing here,
a while as in good part.
My mind desires sore to write
of much and diverse things,
And not always to stay at one,
but as the sprite me brings
I go now here, now there I swim
amid the waters deep,
Sometime I toss the boisterous waives
sometime to shore I creep.
And though sometimes by reasons rule
I shall assay to find,
The secret ways by nature hyd,
and bring them unto mind:
Those things yet will I follow most,
whereby a profyt shall
Arise, and add a holy life,
to men that be mortal.
A life alas now banished clean,
if I the truth may say
In this our age, than which a worse
was never seen the day.
Such things I say, that shall expel
the vices of the mind:
A thing that more the Muses fyttes,
than this I can not find.
This makes a man for to be sound,
of wit both prompt and fine,
Although by nature he be dull,
and do no white decline
Ungodly, and neglecting right,
that horedome doth not spare,
Or on whom earthly avarice,
hath caused for to care,
Or he whom envy in his heart,
doth evermore possess,
Unconstant, or a lying man,
or takes in drink excess,
In fine what ever vice he hath,
by this he may forsake,
The hurtful harms of perverse mind,
a Godly life to take.
This worthy men doth cause to be,
and fit for honours hie:
Which to themselves, their house, and realm
can council prudently,
And unto doubtful things they can
bring present remedy.
So much the face of beauty fair,
ought not esteemed to be,
The pleasant eyes with shining locks,
each part of royal blee,
As manners well composed, and
a pure and honest mind,
Where virtue bears so great a stroke
that vice is harde to find.
Doth not the righteous man or he,
that virtues much doth love,
Live al in mirth, and hopes for help
of only God above?
He nothing cares when whispring worde^
be closely spoke in ear,
When judge, or King, doth for him cal
his heart doth nothing fear.
Contrariwise the wicked man,
defamed fears to be,
And when the lightnings thuder rores,
then gilty trembles he.
If men do chance in ears to round,
or whisper when they walk,
Alas then cries he to himself,
of me these men do talk,
What shall I do? the Judge or King
doth cal, and shall I go,
Or rather fly the perils great
of wretched life? now lo,
By fixed law of GOD doth fear
the wicked men torment,
And though sometime the evil man
to mirth doth seem as bent,
As Strongilos amid the seas,
yet doth he boyle within,
Or Etna when his flaming darts,
Pyrackmon doth begin.
But were it better to declare,
with thousand ships assaylde
The cursed chance of Pergamus
that folishly bewaylde
The periurde chance of Sinons deed?
or else Ogiges town,
Which by the cruel chance of war,
was raced clean down?
Or shall I praise, as Poets wont,
some man with forging lies?
And judge a colour fair to be,
contrary to mine eyes?
Or were it better here to fain,
how Dedalus did fly,
The woeful hap of Icarus
that fell out of the Sky?
The bodies oft transformed aye,
of Gods and eke of men:
And so delude the idle ears,
with trifles of my pen?
Or had I better to declare
the wanton toys of youth,
And slander Gods with profane acts
which is a greater ruth?
For what do these our frantic heads
now fear at any hour?
The Gods (we say) with lecherous lust,
both boys and maids deflower.
A whore in heavens hie to be,
a lechoure to they say:
O shame, is this a Godliness,
or right to use such way?
Are these the thanks we owe to God?
be these our odours sweet?
Be these the duties that we owe,
or praises for him meet?
What thing will now the wit of man
forbear to fain or lye:
By means whereof they may obtain
in sin a liberty?
Of writers vain both lewd and ill,
O rude unruly route,
You need to take Elleborus
to pourge your humours out.
To you I speak that others harm
whose tongs do spare no man:
If lightning should you all consume,
what marvel were it than?
Show me the cause both night and day,
why do you take such payne?
Is it but only for your selves?
why then no praise you gain.
For he that only private wealth
regards always still,
And laughs to scorn an others harm
whilst he enjoys his will.
A savage beast by right desert,
deserves called to be:
And not a man for to be named,
for so to write ought we,
That men may get some good thereby,
and not complain to spend:
Their times in trifling tricks toys
that have no certain end.
And first ought to be known that we,
do good in three divide:
In pleasure and utility,
and honesty chief beside.
Some one of these or greater part,
may Poets always use:
So that the bonds of honesty,
to break they shall refuse.
But O what titles and what crown,
did he deserve to have,
Which things not only vain nought
good fruit that never gave,
But wrote such things as might corrupt
the life of any man,
And make him worser ten to one,
than when he first began?
He left behind him monuments,
of wanton wicked ways:
And left such foolish doting things,
to men of latter days.
O Lord how much doth wanton words
to wicked life entice
And with a fervent poison great,
doth draw men unto vice.
From ears a wanton wicked voice,
dare pearce the secrete thought.
And unto mischief move thereby,
the members bent to nought.
A noble man such things delight,
(some man perhaps will say:)
Who in his house a lusty route
doth keep in rich array,
Whom for to fear, excessive goods
compels a man thereto,
With any part of worthy wit
who never had to do.
What then may these be suffered thoe,
or praysd, because they please
The rich, or else the noble men
that always live in ease?
Not so, for what a sort there be
of twolegd Asses clothed
In Gold and Silk, and Purple fair
to al men is not showed.
There be, there be full many now,
whom Pearls have puffed with pride,
And whom the Asians have beset
with Silk on every side,
Whose fingers fair with rings of gold
be dashed and decked about,
With precious stones pearls of price
that India sends out.
Those men a man would almost swear,
that Plato they excel,
Or Socrates who (Phoebus judge)
of wisdom bare the bell.
And yet these Princely painted walls
do nought within contain,
A blather full implete with wind springs
they may be termed plain.
Where Fortune fawns, there pleasure
and pleasure brings folly:
And so the light of reasons rule
is darkened utterly,
Whereby it haps that seldom wise,
these children chance to be.
To suffer payne for virtues sake,
who will, if so be he
Have no reward? reward who seeks,
but he whom need constraynes?
The rich man follows joyful things,
and lives void of pains,
He hates the prycking thorny ways,
the cliffs both sharp and sour,
By which we do assay to clime,
to Lady learnings tower.
I can not stay my self as now,
when anger comes upon,
But needs I must defy both verse,
and Poets al as one,
When boys we see decline to nought,
whom masters do embewe,
With verses filthy to be named,
which most they should eschew.
Their first possessed shame fastness,
to see them clean forsake:
And eke how apt and prone they be
a noughty way to take,
And foster mischief so in youth,
that he may always dwell
In them, whereby they may prepare
in age a way to hell.
But yet it doth me good to see,
how hoping al for praise,
They get themselves immortal shame,
that never more decays.
For who will judge them void of vice,
or that they lived not so,
As they themselves did give precepts
to others for to go?
The talk it self doth well declare,
the nature of the mind,
And every man doth most frequent
things propre to his kind.
Of Oxen, rake, and culter sharpe
the plowmans ^ong doth walk,
Of Sail and Cable, Mast and Ore,
is all the Seamans talk.
Of Horses, harness, Spear Shield,
the Captain still will boste:
So bawdy mates of bawdy things,
their tongs do clatter most.
I warn you sirs above the rest,
of youth that takes the cure,
Whose part it is the tender minds
of boys for to allure,
To bertue and to Godliness,
like wax do them prepare,
Hate you the wicked works of those,
for greater matters care.
Read not such things as are but vain
unworthy to be told:
But teach the worthy histories
of ancient fathers old.
Herein let children nouseled be,
let these be borne away:
Here of may spring a Godly fruit,
direct their life that may.
They show what things we follow should
and what we should reject:
And fables al among the rest
we may not well neglect.
For oftentimes a Comody,
may wholesome doctrine bring:
And monish men by pleasant words,
to leave some noughty thing.
There be I grant some Poets works
not altogether vain,
Which with a pleasant sugared style,
proceed from sobre brain.
These things do help, and void of vic
these works do profit much:
In youth bring up your scholars with
none other food but such.
And when their young and tender age
they once have passed out:
Then may they safely void of harm,
go range the fields about,
And gather flowers where they list,
for danger is away.
But now a while for to discuss,
I think it best assay,
Of which of these is needful most,
or most to be esteemed:
The man that good and honest is,
or he that well is learned.
The good or else the learned man,
of two which is the best:
Learning is hie, becomes the meke,
and doth the proud infest.
It doth refuse the belly gods,
and such as sleep hath trained:
Without long time and labour great,
it will not be obtained.
This City rules and moves Mars,
and this can wars revel:
It shows the earth and goodly stars
and sickness doth expel.
This teaches figures fair to frame,
of sundry sorce and kind:
This teaches us to number well,
and music calls to mind.
This doth ascend the heavens and
bring hidden things to light:
No perfect man without this same,
may called be of right.
Unlike to beasts and like to gods,
this causes us to be:
Sometime and yet of little price,
his virtue lost we see.
As oft as with the dregs of vice,
defylde he doth put on:
Deformed hew amid the durte,
as doth the Jasper stone.
Or as the Sun behind the cloud,
or shadow of the Moon:
No is it only vile in sight,
but hurtful very soon.
For if a wicked man it have,
then may it be compared:
Unto a frentyke fool that hath
a sword without regard.
Whereby he many doth destroy,
and runs more astray:
But he that void of harm and hurt,
to live doth well assay.
Observing well the law of God,
and of the higher power:
And sin doth fly as open throat,
of dragon to devour.
The sheep, the moyle or horses kept,
whose office is to see:
Though he be one, if learning lack,
estemde he ought to be.
Such one I say no man nor God,
can ever well despise:
But he that virtue doth envy,
at least that is not wise.
For who but such will not him love,
and worthily commend:
That fears God and righteousness,
obserueth to his end.
Whom gold can never overcome,
who wills no mans wrong:
Who helps the poores afflicted case,
who flies the naughty throng.
He feeds the humble and the meke
ill tongues he doth reject:
No man to hurt he doth rejoice,
but rather to protect.
And that which is the worthiest praise
at every time he can:
In every thing a modesty,
use, happy is that man.
More happy yet I do him judge,
that doth in both excel:
Who that is good and learned to,
a crown deserves well.
For other men he far exceeds,
as gold doth copper pass:
And as the flaming Piropus,
excelles the duskey glass.
And seldom sin thou shalt discern,
a man of learned fame:
At least not much, unto the rude,
there is no heed of shame.
But headlong rush they into vice,
which they forbidden be:
And holy laws be laughed to scorn,
by foolish fond decree.
Like as the blind cannot beware,
but fall in ditches deep:
As men amid the dark be hurt,
when Proserpine doth sleep.
So mind of man, which is but blind
take learning once away:
In every vice it doth not doubt
to fall and run astray.
Except it be comprest by fear,
of pain that may ensue:
No things but those that pleasant be,
it judges right or true.
Yet many times it may be scene,
that nature doth supply:
The masters room and gives grace,
in youth abundantly.
Whereby that school did never teach,
by grace they may obtain:
What lets such to lead a life,
as virtue teaches plain.
The greater thanks be due to him,
for evermore to give:
Whose book doth show a Methode true
declaring how to live.
O famous Gods of hie rename,
which rule the forked hill:
To whom my years I always gave,
and dedicate them styll.
If that such weighty things a wretch,
may safely you desire:
In this my work I take in hand,
your aide I now require.
Let not dishonour me deface,
nor in his blazing rage:
Let limping Uulcan me destroy,
at any time or age.
And thus an end the ram that kepes
the entrance of our door:
Doth leave his place unto the bull,
that hastes here before.
The book approaching next at hand,
doth will me to have done:
In hast and bids me finish now,
that I of late begone.
The Second book entitled Taurus.
LOng time yt hast thee rested well,
my boat in pleasant bay:
Now time us bids to hoise up sails
and ancour up to way.
The washing winter now is fled,
the hoary snowes be gon:
From down the hills they fast distill,
that once they fell upon.
The earth again doth flourish green,
the trees repair their spring:
With pleasant notes the Nitingale,
begins new to sing.
With flowers fresh their heads be decked
the Fairies dance in field:
And wanton songs in mossye dens,
the Drids and Satires yield.
The wynged Cupide fast doth cast,
his darts of gold yframed:
And lusty youth with pleasant heate,
hath fervently inflamed.
Now may we safely wander out,
amid the waters plain:
The floods be calm ye western wind
is present here again.
O fool why art thou now afraid,
the air is fair and bright:
And Atlas daughters rising up,
persuade thy course of right.
For idleness what kind of praise
can happen unto thee:
To stouthfulnesse no good reward,
may well ascribed be.
Lift up thy heart and courage eke,
be bold and of good chere:
For fortune most doth favour those,
that all things least do fear.
To fearful folks at any time,
she ^umphe hath denaide:
But as I guess the monsters teeth,
doth make thee sore afraid.
Great shame it is that virtue should,
for monsters hyde their face:
Go to therefore leave of thy lets,
and walk the depth apace.
The king and Lord and mighty power,
that rules the world so fast:
Who with a beck the golden stars,
shall govern whilst they last.
Who made the earth inhabited
with beasts of sundry sight:
And diverse fish within the sea,
to draw their vital sprite.
Least destitute of dwellers be,
those elements they should:
And only man among the rest,
discern he reason would.
And unto him he granted speech,
where beasts be dumme of sound:
Declining down their bodies great,
do lycke the massey ground.
With reason he hath under brought,
the strongest beasts of might:
The Lion fierce, the Tiger swift,
alone hath put to flight.
The serpents though their bodies foul
with poison do abound:
Do stand in awe and fear him to,
when that they hear his sound.
The mostruous mole ye thurlpole great,
of mighty form and strength:
In Occean sea doth give him place,
when he doth walk at length.
Take him away what were the earth?
a place with briars grown:
And would bring forth no kind of corn
vntilde or else vnsowne.
He cities built and ordned laws.
whereby they ruled be:
With temples trymmed for their state,
the Gods adorned he.
Full many arts he searched forth,
and instruments he found:
Which like the lightning flash flame,
and like the thunders sound.
Wherein the fire fast inclosde,
enforces all he may:
Out of his mouth to rumble out,
the pellet far away.
Whereby the Towers hye be bett,
and walls of every town:
His strength not able to abide
come topsy turuey down.
And he that hears far away,
the bouncing of these blows:
With dreadful noise ye thuder thumps
as present there he trowes.
Unhappy had you been O Gods,
if in Phlegreus ground:
Whereas with giantes huge you fought
such weapons had been found.
He found out ships whereby a man,
to pass the seas may know:
And wander far whereas he list,
if wind at will do blow.
In places far abroad and nie,
to Tytan in the East:
And where the Sun doth slip sometime
and fall under the west.
And in the North whereas the Bear,
her colour clear doth give:
And in the other part again,
where men there be that live.
Whose feet contrary quite to ours,
do always use to tread:
And like to fall their heals aloft,
do downward hang their head,
And though he do excel in wit,
and vigour of the mind:
So much that well he may be thought
to come of God his kind.
Yet knowethhe not nor seeks to know,
a thing to bad to tell:
How for to live, what ways to fly,
or what to follow well.
O mortal breasts where darkness blind
doth evermore abound:
And eke O minds where foolishness,
may always well be found,
By wicked ways they run astray,
and few alas do know:
Which way their journey well to take
or where in safe to row.
Whereby the chief and happiest life,
in time they may obtain:
The knotty science of tho laws,
will never show it plain.
Nor he that can in medicine skill,
in eloquence or grammar:
But only wisdom must the way
detect, the chief defender.
Of man and ruler of his life,
which if the Lord m^ give:
And if the systers three me let,
until my time to live.
What kind of thing is blessed life,
I will my self entreat:
And how it may be got although,
it be a labour great.
The greatest part of men do think,
felicity to stand:
In purses puffed up with pens,
and so much gold in hand.
To have as in the Lidius streams,
among the sand doth grow:
Or else as much as Tagus up,
continually doth throw.
To have so many acres of
good ground and pastors ^aine:
As he hath hairs unto his head,
of men a bushing train.
Of beasts so huge a drove to have,
as Polyphemus not:
At any time did foster up,
amid the pleasant plot.
Of Sycyly as never had
the shepherd Aristeus:
As never toke away by force,
the man that hight Tyrinthus.
With orchards fair as ever had,
Alcinous the King:
And as the systers fair did hold,
by force of cruel sting.
Of dragon ugly to behold,
for to possess alone:
With houses hye adorned fair,
with crust of Marble stone.
These are the things that every man,
doth now a days desire:
Which nature careful for her son,
doth instantly require.
With earnest prayer to the Gods,
these things who doth possess:
The common sort beleues he lives,
in perfect blessedness.
What Hiders great in flowers lurk,
the blockheads do not know:
No yet how many pricking thorns
among the Roses grow.
For needs he must no remedy,
that riches will obtain:
Both night and day be veered sore,
with cares and cruel pain.
His luck uncertain every hour,
now this, now that he weighs,
No sooner sits he down to meat,
but avarice him frayeth.
No meates almost do please his mouth
he hastes to forsake:
The table yet vnsatisfyde,
for filthy lucre sake.
And little rest the wretched soul,
doth take at any night:
Sometimes on side, sometimes on face,
sometimes he turns upright.
He tosses round about the bed,
like as the weighty stone:
That Sysyphus continually,
doth toss and turn alone.
What he hath done the day before,
he muttereth in his mind:
And what the next day he may do,
he muses for to find.
Behold (saith he) my catraile dyes,
to morrow if I may:
Some fother I shall seek to get,
O cursed wynters day.
How much this cold hath hurt mi beasts
full sore am I deluded:
My bailey and my shepherd eke,
have both me foul misused.
My fold the wolves, O woeful chance,
alas have broken in:
And now my cattle to destroy,
the souldyer doth begin.
He hath destroide my tenements,
by flame consumed quite:
My corn and now my vineyard to,
he scorches down a right.
My detter fled from hence away,
my money with him gone:
No faith there is that fears God,
I think there be not one.
The world is nought but great disceit^
O Lord he was estemde:
An honest faithful man and true
but all is not as it semde.
That rule is not to be obserude:
to trust a man by face:
But wherefore should I now lament,
my ship returns a pace.
And home she brings I leap for joy,
such wares as will away:
Both pepper spice and franckincense,
with sylke and amber aye.
With clothes that Sydon sends for the
and wares of diverse kind:
Which thorough ye waives of surging seas
she brings forth of Inde.
Whom if the great Symplegades,
had chaunste to burst a sunder:
Or Scilla with the Caphare rock,
the seas had sunk her under.
Then should I fill my house alas
with great complaint and cries:
The tears would overflow my breast,
that issued from my eyes.
I will no money lack I trow,
till life begin to start,
Corn bears to lowe a price what then
of oils I make my mart.
I must go delve I must go sow,
and harrow well my corn:
I must go build and see my vines,
well trimmed cut and shorn.
This will I bye this will I sell,
I will receive and paye:
My dettes no otherwise this wretch,
is tossed then ball in play.
The multitude beholding hye,
is used to be cast:
Now here now there among the croude
is driven very fast.
Some one doth strike it with his hades,
some other with his feet:
In joy in grief in fear and hope
so doth he always fleet.
As seas be wont when winds do blow
an Irion is he just:
Who with a cloud as hath been told,
performing filthy lust.
Begat a son of double form
wherefore he then was judged,
Of gods upon a snaky wheel,
for ever to be turned.
For what is riches but a thing,
which aptest we may like:
Unto a cloud which Bore as if
descending hap to strike.
Thou shalt behold whereof it came,
to smoke resolved than:
Of riches monsters he begot,
that have the face of man.
Then outward face of wealthy man:
what thing doth more excel?
But when the course of all his life,
we once have marked well.
We shall behold the hinder parts,
to differ far away:
From those that we did first discern,
whom fortune without stay,
Doth turn about upon her wheel,
the carkes and cares be snakes,
Which always gripe gnaw his hea^
with sorrows that he takes.
The rich man either knows or not,
what goods he doth possess:
If not what help they then thereby
no good no yet distress.
He doth receive but as a man,
that riches is without:
If he do know he either loves,
or loves them not no doubt.
If he them hate, why keeps he them,
what joy takes he thereby:
Such as who drinks the juice of grapes
and wine doth clean defy.
If he them love he them regards,
and seeks to defend:
Them, and to keep the sorrows much,
and labours till his end.
It doth him much unquiet when,
He thinks for to see:
Some harm approaching to his wealth,
and vexed most is he.
When any part thereof by loss
doth escape out of his hand:
As many times for to be fall,
by needful rule doth stand.
When nothing long in state abides,
thou shalt behold and see:
So many harms as ever seen,
in hast at hand to be.
When all is done how much the more
of goods he doth possess:
So much the more of cark and care,
shall ever him oppress.
What shall I here declare or show,
the dangers incident:
That he doth pass by seas and land,
his living to augment.
From thieves by land fro thieves by seas
full oft he flies fast:
And yet for all the wiles he hath,
he taken is at last.
And oft his bowels do become,
a pray unto the wolf:
Or Fishes foul do him devour,
up swallowed in the golfe.
And often he whom worldly wealth,
had moved to be bold:
Is forced under his masters yoke,
his captives neck to hold.
At home at board no yet in bed,
he cannot safely be:
But poison strong they will him give,
whom least mistrusts he.
Or else the wicked hands of some,
unthrifty seruaunt will:
In bed a stepe and snorting fast,
him quickly s^ey and kill.
As fattest beasts in sacrifice,
be soonest ever slain:
And as the worthiest tree is first,
depriued of his grain.
And as the grape is first destroyed,
that sweetest is of wast:
With flies and bees and other worms
that always them do wast.
So he whom nature most hath lent,
is always most entrapped:
And evermore in dangers great,
is readiest to be clapped.
Note well the crafty wit and head,
of Dionise the King:
Behold good man and art thou blessed,
what else thou lackit nothing.
Thou lackst no meat you lackst no drink,
thou lackst no pleasant boys:
Thou lackst no sceptre nor no crown,
thou want no wished boys.
With glistering gold precious stones,
behold thou doest abound:
A sword but lo hangs over thy head,
that will the wretch confound.
With envy riches left be vexed,
all things of good estate:
Doth malice harm and happy things
it evermore doth hate.
So dear (O misers) do you seek,
of gold the wicked mine:
Whereby your harts may always prick
the sisters Pales^ine.
And sooner down descend the pit,
of ghastly Plutoes reign:
Was not the gifts that Bacchus gave,
of gold to Mydas gain.
Of all men laughed to scorn by right,
to whom thou Phebus much,
An angered gave an Asses ^ares,
all things quoth Myde I tutch.
Be gold I wish and by and by,
he asked his fatal end:
For down his greedy g^ping guts,
no meat could then discende.
Such fortune ha^ thou sparing wre^ch
the more thou ha^t of goods:
The more thou lackste as Tantalus,
doth thirst among the ^oudes,
If thou migh^t all things free o^e,
thou would thy self require:
Would thou but take yt should suffyce
excess or else desire.
This one doth hurt the other mean,
all men may soon obtain:
For nature with a little thing,
contented doth remain:
Except that headlong ^aine to vice,
i^ doth repugn again.
The chiefest fruits of seas and wood,
to rich men's boardes be brought:
There lacks no Hare no goat nor Hart
no ^id no Bore nor ought.
Amongst the flock of flittering fowls,
the Throstell fat and round:
The Partridge, Colmouse, nor ye birds,
that bredes in Colchis ground.
With Capons great mighty Doves,
and Turbots in be brought:
The Lopster, Lamprey the Shrimp,
and Mugil fat is caught.
The fish that toke his name of gold,
the chopping Dy^er new:
Which Cizicus doth foster up,
amid his seas so blew.
With many more that seems harde,
in verse for to declare:
And wines yt may with falerne fi^loes,
and N^are sweet compare.
But now I ask and will this wretch,
all this himself devour:
I think not so for if he would,
it seems not in his power.
And if he might his belly sure
would burst a sonder thoe:
And swollen to tomb with roaring route
him following should he go.
For he that doth his stomach charge,
with more than will suffice:
Is hurt and then phisicions help,
with groaning voice he cries.
Then up he throws and all his house,
doth filthy stincke possess:
Whereby him fervent fevers vex,
and humours sharpe oppress.
What sickness great excess doth breed,
no man there is but knows:
What hurts by to much drink let down
within the body grows.
Wherefore he must be modest needs,
of much and little take:
Who that before thapointed time,
sweet life will not forsake:
Nor more than doth yt pore he must,
his hungered body s^ake.
With purple fair and clothe of gold,
the rich man is arrayed:
His gorgeous shirt doth cast a show,
with sylke and ^uerlayde.
About his head he wears aye,
the fleece of S^ithian ^ow:
And Jewels fair about his neck,
of price he wears but now.
Are these of greater force for ^o
expel the bitter cold:
Than if in garments made of wolle,
thy body were infolde.
Or doth the woven web of ^axe,
not so repulse the heate:
When as ye Sun doth feruet flame
amid the Lion great?
Or when the raging dog the fields,
of green doth quite defeat.
As if the fine and tender sylke,
enclosed thee round about:
But thou wilt say he is estemde,
whom gorgeous gear sets out.
Unto him passing by the way,
the people duck and rise:
And only he is counted then,
both noble good and wise.
And worthy worship to receive,
and friendship for to have:
No ^eede at all they take of him,
whose garments be not brave.
The common people laugh to see,
his cote then worn to nought:
Though thou should Tully represent,
whose eloquence was thought.
For to excel all Italye,
or else Demosthenes:
Whose famous voice the Athens men,
did wonder at in plees.
Or if thou had as great a gift,
as Maro had in verse:
Or could the ancient Homers tunes
celestial well rehearse.
For all this same yet should not thou
the price of praise obtain:
But as re^ct of every man,
thou shalt receive disdain.
In vain thou shalt behold the hew,
of Ganymedes face:
In vain and oft thou shalt desire,
thy damsel to embrace:
If that with vile apparel thou
doest run the poor mans race.
I not deny that clothing fair,
esteemed ought to be:
But if the mind doth virtues lack,
with vices eke agree.
Thy beauty all bids then adieu
and glory leaves thee quite:
And every man that knows thee well,
will have thee in dyspite.
They will thee flout behind thy back,
and grievous mocks thee give:
Thy servant to that of thy food,
hath always used to live,
If that he know thee for to be,
a greedy Churl or such:
As cruel is of hauty mind,
or uses wine to much.
Or one that lacks wit he will,
regard thee then but light:
And grudging efte these words will he
unto himself resight.
O such a master fortune false,
why did thou me give?
Me under such a master long,
shall fates enforce to live?
Can other men commend him then,
whose servants so despise:
But if thou valiant be and just,
both sober sad and wise.
If so be that, that learning great,
doth cause thee to excel:
Then to thy worship doth agree,
all kind of garments well.
And no man will thee then despise,
except that he be mad:
And first whatsoever that thou art,
desirous to be had.
In honour to be praised much,
and much to be beloved:
Embracing thou virtue fly thou vice,
and that of right reproved.
May bring the author to a shame,
beware thou not commit:
For oft the common people ^ude,
do use as void of wit.
The noble virtue to despise,
if so be that they see:
With little spot of any vice,
defiled her to be.
But what is he upon the earth,
that lives void of crime:
And from the true and beaten way
departs not sometime?
Or doth not swerve or run astray,
from out the ruled lyne?
But he that least and seldom sins,
him best we may defyne.
But greatest grace hath such a one,
that learnedly and wise:
All things he speaks with order just,
can well himself devise.
To wise and filed speech may be,
great force and strength assynde,
Tt diverse passions doth provoke,
and governs well thy mind.
Much more will this than costly clothe,
set forth thy worthy name:
Use not the love of boys take heed,
such love is sinful shame.
For children have no love no wit,
no reason faith nor trust:
A vengeance light on him I wish,
that joys in such a lu^.
If that the pleasant portraiture
of maids do thee delight:
Go take a wife thou need not lack,
a ^ormouse for the night.
What had thou rather fool to wish,
and hope for things denayed:
When as with easier medicine thou
may have thy grief alayde?
Perchance for this yet riches are,
to be desired plain:
Whereby a man may sooner so,
to virtue hye attain.
If void of money clean thou art,
no man will take the pains:
Thee to enstruct for teachers sure,
require no little gains.
Nor little price will thee suffice,
thy self with books to store:
Whereby thou may apply thy self,
to Lady learnings lore.
Lest poverty with other cares,
doth occupy thy head:
And so from learning draw thy mind,
with other business lead,
O lord howe harde a thing it is,
how few doth God permit:
To fly from base and poor estate,
in honours hye to sit.
How seldom doth the sely soul,
ascend to honours hye:
And more besides what is his life,
to death and eke how ny.
How much to be despised tho,
when pleasure none his mind,
Doth ease, amongst his travails great
when he no joys can find.
When never cares absentes themselves
with griefs when all habounde:
Yet better pass the Stigian lake,
and feed the greedy hound.
And mixed be with shrikyng souls,
then never joy to find:
^n happy things when never mir^he,
shall glad thy wretched mind.
For to this wretch what joy at all,
or pleasure can remain:
That lacks both meat drink full of^,
sometime his bed again.
Sometime he lacks co^ee and cloak,
and oft his to^s be spied:
From out his clouted sh^es to pepe,
where seames sit ga^ing wide.
With pain draws on his drudging life,
much less he able is:
Those things to haunt ye here d^ bring
a mortal man to bliss.
But he that ha^ the golden mines,
in him these things do ^owe:
And every thing he straight obtains,
whereat he bends his howe.
Such rule and swaye hath money now^
such force in every place:
That nothing long she will permit,
for to resist her grace.
From hie she raceth hills down,
and valleys up doth hoise:
If that therefore with swifty course,
of dogs he doth rejoice
To take the Heart the Goat or Wolf
the flighty flying Hares:
If birds to take or fish deceive,
with hooks and nets or snares.
If for to serve in Uenus court,
if meat or drink delight,
If quiet rest, if Lu^e or Harp,
him please or songs to shright:
All these the rich man doth possess,
through mighty monies might.
New hark again what I shall say,
^o this in contrary:
If any man desire ^o learn,
he shall i^ soon come by.
So that his mind ^e constant thoe,
and fears not to tread:
The sharp and crabbed thorny ways,
to virtue that do lead.
If money lack what then perforce,
let household stuff be sold:
With house and all and meadow to,
how may my life then hold?
Then shall I be constraynd to beg,
and walle^ up to take:
Far better wretch it is to beg,
when learning shall thee make.
Like to the heaven saints above,
than if thou should possess:
The Persians herds droves of beasts
with all their welthinesse.
Believe not thou the judgment blind,
of rude and common sort:
No more who can than beasts discern,
the truth or it report.
If thou be wise, mark what I say,
in mind and print it sure:
Excepting vet tu nothing is,
that here may long endure.
For riches fade and form and strength
and honour eke doth fall:
And virtue only doth remain,
in strength and ever shall.
Which never fortune may suppress,
nor age can take away:
I never saw it yet nor thoe,
believe it well I may.
The virtuous man for hunger ^eru^,
or left to beg his bread:
Though fortune sometime doth assay,
him for to ouertread.
Yet veertue hastes fast anon,
and learning doth defend:
His clients nor doth suffer them,
their years in care to spend.
But offers them a board to help,
when sail and ship is lost:
Whereby they may the shore attain,
from waives of Seas ytost.
Who follows virtue may go see,
tharabian deserts fell:
The Ethiops black the rugged getes,
the Indes in health and well.
For only virtue of her force,
will fortune false wythstand:
And oft with her in doubtful match,
doth strive with fighting hand.
For costs thou ought not to spare,
nor doubt the lands to sell:
Whereby thou virtue may obtain,
if fortune be so fell.
That nought to sell at all thou haste,
let goodness then remain:
In thee, If learned thou can not be,
with learned thy self retain.
With ears attetiue mark their words,
sometime and question find:
The rest to God do thou commit,
and with a lowly mind.
Receive thappointed fates from hie,
if joys thou doest frequent:
And hurtful pleasure thee entrap,
and in her gins thee hent.
And covet so thy youthful days,
to pass in pleasant sport:
And therefore doest desire to bear,
a rich and wealthy port.
These things that reason doth thee tell,
peruse thou well in mind:
A greater ill and hurtful more,
than pleasure none can find.
It takes counsel quite from us,
and doth the mind oppress:
Resisting virtues evermore,
increases wickedness.
It is the chiefest nource to vice,
enfebleth aye the strength:
With bitter end and many hurts,
procures man at length.
But playnlier of this same anon,
we will entreat and tell:
The poor man hath his joys also,
if that thou markest well.
Not much perchance inferior to,
for pleasantest be such:
Obtained joys that seldom haps,
and ioyfuller he much.
The pleasure is believe me now,
that long hath been absented:
And more desired so meat is sweet,
to him that is an hungered.
So rest to him that labours sore,
so drink is to the dry:
So flame unto the friesing wight,
so cold when sun is hye.
So long forborne is welcomer,
to Lady Uenus fair:
For contraries by opposites,
their strength do left repair.
The rich man now will suffer nought,
but always doth abound:
With deynties so that lothsomnesse,
in him may left be found.
Sometime he doth desire and much,
on earthy roots to grash:
Sometime on pescods fast he feeds,
sometime on other trash.
And royal fare with deynty dish,
abhorring nought esteems:
Nothing so sweet he then receives,
but better lo it seems.
And likes him not if any time,
it chances to endure:
But changes new doth him delight,
and for to have in ur.
Forbidden things are sweeter much,
such things be nought and ill:
That always are at hand to have,
so not the thing but will.
And judgment of the mind doth cause,
a man to be content:
And worthy is to be imbrasde,
that pleases his intent.
What profits it unto the sick,
to offer deynty meat:
Whose taste away doth quite bereft,
the fervent fevers heate.
Or what avails it unto him,
the pleasant wines to bring:
Who evermore refraining wine,
doth joy in cleared spring?
Some one with Kid some other thoe,
with pork refreshed to be:
Desires more some songs delight,
some other plays to se^.
So love to all men is not like,
some man a boy desires:
And some a maid and some a gill,
and some a wife requires.
The mind and not the thing therefore,
doth cause a quietness:
Whereby the poor no less their joys,
then rich men doth possess.
Excess the rich man doth desire,
few things the poor suffice:
To him doth greater charge of house,
but lesser joys arise.
The shipman or the labouring wight
much pleasure more do take:
With eggs leekes and homely food,
his hungered maw to slake.
Than kings Queenes with deinty dish
of seas and land to dine:
The worthier pleasure then I think,
of right we may define.
That used neither causes harm,
nor honesty resystes:
For best it is to covet least,
and live within the lists.
Of counsel good nor vexed be
with vain and fond desire:
For who the things he cannot have,
doth earnestly require.
With frustrate hope is tormented,
and loses time in vain:
Wherefore desire thou nothing else,
but that thou may obtain.
And rule thy mind with bridlyng bit,
but he that doth habounde:
With riches, always covets more.
then lawful may be found.
With little and content to live,
he knows not yet there fore:
Whom least of all do full suffice,
him happier judge I more.
For lofty lands do cause a man,
for to excel in pride:
Thimmortall gods for to despise,
and men for to deride.
Without all rule, a carpet knight
and virtues mortal foe:
For who doth virtue ought regard,
when riches swells so?
O famous worthy poverty,
O gifts of God vnkende:
Of virtues aye the safe defence,
to shamefastness a friend.
The bridle tried of wantones,
and patron of the life:
Thou only can and well despise,
the shameless fortunde rife.
The raging of the Seas and wyndes,
whilst in thy little boat:
Thou kepest the safe assured foordes,
and rydste by shore a flote.
The lofty hills on hye full oft
the flashing lightnings smite:
And spiring ashes long be bett,
by northern Boreas might.
Low things do lie unknow to harms
the tempests never greues:
The lowly shrouded Junipers,
nor shakes the Mirice leues.
The famous Anaxagoras,
and Democryte the wise:
With many mo whose worthy fame
throughout the world now flies:
Did silver gold and riches eke,
as heads of ill despise.
And why? but yt they thought they were
not virtues good nor true:
Which let the mind with diverse cares,
and headlong down eke threw,
Full many men in diverse vice,
but always mark thou well:
What Fabrice Calo and Curius to,
these holy men thee tell.
Regard not what the common sort,
and foolish route do say:
Therample of the good always,
before thy eyes but lay.
Did not Ouirinus conqueror,
his banners oft display:
Commanded weapons up to take,
and plough a down to lay.
And rest his delving spade a while,
then would the cottage small:
Content the men and deinty fare,
not used then at all.
But Princely meates roufed rooms,
bring forth as now a days:
A weak a fayn^ and tender fruit,
and apt to sport and plays.
O learn you mortal men at length,
put darkness from your mind:
Lift up a loft your dimmye eyes,
where doth will so blind.
You lead? take heed in any wise,
you thither do not go:
By reason like the gods above,
you are created lo.
By reasons are the seas and land,
unto your power subject:
Let errors not therefore as now,
but reason you direct.
The certain end of every thing.
peruse you well always:
And let the meat your selves suffice,
that hunger drives away.
And garments eke your skins to hide
and called for to expel:
Let aye the sleep that doth refresh,
your weary limbs be well.
Of these three things above the rest,
most need we have always:
Since these our bodies are compact,
of vile and brittle clay.
But yet thou oughtst those things to use
as Physic for to heal:
The diverse sickness that to man,
dame nature wontes to deal.
Some one we see in daynty fare,
doth riot most embrace:
Some other in ercesse of clothes,
and some whilst they apace.
From learning fly do vneth know,
nor once this life perceive:
When evermore with sluggish sleep,
their eyes together cleave.
But happy is he that is content,
with little to remain:
Nor puts his trust in things so frail,
that death will him constrain.
To leave behind as none of his,
and weighs well in mind:
How short the space is of our life,
how all things vain we find.
That here on earth created be,
who always one remaynes:
In prosperouse eke and adverse chance,
the judge nor Sttgian pains.
Regards not and nought esteems,
what ever fortune flyng:
Unhappy is he whom will doth lead,
unmindful of the thing
That is to come, but like to beasts,
regards the thing in sight:
Who knows not that by how much,
the mind is more of might.
Than is the corps, so much the more,
in gifts it doth excel:
Riches be not the chiefest goods,
therefore appears well.
For these because for bodies wealth,
they only out be sought:
The manners of the owners eke,
we see they better nought.
Who will account them chiefest goods?
for often times we see:
Such men with riches as abound,
like brutish beasts to be.
As much therefore as will suffice,
thy life no more require:
For in excess do fools rejoice,
in vain thou doest desire.
Thy barnes vnheaped hugye mowes,
of corn when thou as well:
With lesser measure though by much,
thy hunger may expel.
When little cups shall thee suffice,
why doest thou tons desire?
But yet if Putus do thee love,
and plenty on thee flyre.
And eke the will unknown of fases,
hath riches del^e to thee:
What would thou do? that thou had learned
it seems best to me.
Least by possession thou be worfe,
a dolt and counted plain:
And tell me now I thee require,
what wisdom doth remain.
Or counsel else to him in whom,
great riches ever ^owe?
And by what means them for to use,
the fool doth nothing know.
Hereby doth strength and often hurt,
and beauty eke annoy:
By reason like the author oft,
doth eloquence destroy.
And by these means are diverse arts,
full hurtful oft to many:
Let not the snare of avarice,
thee catch but from her fly.
Than this there is no fury fierce,
assuredly more fell:
Begotten once in Acheron,
amid the reign of hell.
She was where flaming fyerbrandes,
she dreadfully doth cast:
A hundred thretning heads she bears
with ugly adders burst.
Her greedy jaws with blood of men,
could never have their fill:
With churlish chaps devouring mea^,
yet food requir the she still.
She spares none nor god his church,
once fears to defile:
This cursed never filled beast,
and wicked monster vile.
Of her come plagues slaugh^ers sharp
with discord and distress:
With treasons brawlings and disceits
and loss of shamefastness.
Contempt of God with perjuries,
and chidings fell with fight:
With many more which in my verse,
I cannot well resyght.
From this therefore ^ye thou thy way
nothing doth more infest:
Nor nothing more than this declares,
a vile unworthy breast.
So women, aged men and boys,
do covet most always:
Because they lack both strength force,
in mind and have no stays.
An other vice contrary now,
to this doth yet remain:
This same from the to banish quite,
thy senses look thou strain.
If thou dost spend without respect,
in vame thou shalt behold:
An hungered left another spit,
with deinties manifold.
When all thy living quite is spent,
by ryote clean destroyed:
Between them both the virtue lies,
the vite therefore avoid.
As reason doth require so give,
and evermore take heed:
Be not to bold to use excess,
within thy tether feed.
This end hath riches we are bound,
all men to profit thoe:
But first our own dame nature sure,
hath us ^reated so.
That not alone to us and ours,
we should commodious be:
But also if that power will serne,
to all of each degree.
What thing more famous is than this,
what more deserves the place:
Of gods above then for to help,
the poores afflicted case?
So shall the people honour us,
so get we fame thereby:
And by such acts to gods full oft,
we see do many fly.
Nothing doth more a man become,
nothing for him more meet:
As saith the old and ancient school,
of Philosophers sweet.
Than man to aide and succour soon,
his fellow fallen to ground:
But now alas O doleful times.
and fashions nothing sound.
All godliness is clean extinct,
to no man geues doubtless:
The wealthy wretch although he hath
wherewith to give excess.
Of no man thoe he p^ie hath,
all hearts do iron seem:
Who gives the beggar now a myte,
their tears they nought esteem.
If ought they give to seoffers now,
or else to rake hell knaves:
They do it deal to Colmon birds,
and eke to bawdy slaves.
No man doth give the learned ought,
the muses be despised:
In every place some one we see,
so much hath exercised.
The dyse and tables till his purse,
at length the gorge doth cast:
So oft an other vies at Cards,
till all his goods be past.
And is not this a greater shame,
thus money for to spend:
Whereby no honour is obtained,
nor thank is got at the end.
O mind forgetting God and eke,
with vices vile defiled:
And is it lawful this to do,
did thou not once a child.
Come naked from thy mothers womb,
and shalt return again:
Resolved unto dirty earth,
from whence thou camste certain?
O fool these goods be none of thine,
but underneath the hand:
Of God above and thou but here,
a stranger in the land.
And bursser for a while of them,
no be the goods at all:
But only now the use of them,
to our subjection thrall.
For when the Gresilde Charon old,
shall be are thee past the lake:
By which the gods above to swear,
do tremble left and quake.
Then here you wretch to other heirs,
the goods thou shalt forsake:
Wherefore we ought to use them well,
while line of life doth last:
In occupying about our selves,
and helping others fast.
Now have I well declared I think,
if riches ought to be:
Accounted for the chiefest goods,
all men may plainly see.
My boat draw back we have assayed,
the seas sufficiently:
Lo causing clouds the southern wind
begins fast to fly.
Upsuckt the floods from out the seas,
the whirl winds up do bear:
Which doth declare a ssorme to come,
not best we tarry here.
Believe me now for sore I fear,
to ships untrusty Orion:
Whilst time we have let us dispatch,
to port and get us gon.
When as the banished clouds above,
shall make the day be fair:
Then Triton shall us call from hye,
and we to seas repair.
The third Book entitled Gemini.
Uprising was the dauning day
and fading stars did shune
The heavens hie of Ti^a thoe
and half to appear begun.
To them that under us do dwell,
and half discernde our eyes:
I meruayld much to see as then,
the sier up to rise.
Amid the floods unquenched thus,
these contraries no doubt:
Each other now do quite destroy,
but is the sun put out.
With floods? it is not fiery then,
or else to touch the brink:
Of Occean sea, the common sort do lye,
thus did I think.
While as by shore I walked alone,
behold there began me meet:
An aged man with staff in hand,
in clothur near and sweet.
His hoary beard with silver hears,
his middle fully rought:
His skin was white and joyful face.
of diverse colours wrought.
A flowery garland gay he ware,
about his seemly hear:
When as we met and made unto,
each other friendly cheer.
Fro whence I came, what place I seek,
my name he doth desire:
I answered him and did the like,
with shame fast voice require.
But after that he had declared,
his proper name certain:
For Epicure this man he height,
I was astonished plain.
Like as the poor and labouring soul,
in delving of the ground:
A hidden chest amid the earth,
by lucky chance hath found.
And thus I said good father old,
such favour may thou find:
Amongst the gods that al things well,
may satisfy thy mind.
Sith wisdom great and wondrous eke,
within thy breast doth dwell:
If falsely men do not affirm,
as left they do. Now tell
Unto me here I thee beseech,
of grace the good precepts:
With witty saws and eke instruce,
my youth if nothing lets,
More wayghty affairs: quod he again
no wayghty affairs me let,
But for that cares and work I shanne
oft times my self to get.
Unto this place I wonted am,
and flowers up to take:
Of diverse hues amid the meads,
head garlands for to make.
Willing therefore with all my heart,
to answer thy request:
I am for old men all to chat,
it doth delight us bess.
But least by some that pass the way,
we here disturbed be:
Let us go hence, and underneath,
the shaded holmey tree:
That by the waters side thou see:
our selves we will repose.
We went and thus with pleasant voice
his mind he began disclose.
Some god young man thee hither now
assuredly hath sent:
Whereby this day thou might perceive,
by wisdom what is meant.
For O the gods in what a mist,
and darkness of the mind:
Is drent as now the whole estate,
of mortal human kind.
Of them that bear the face of men,
two thousand thou may see:
But one that shows himself a man,
is scarcely found to be.
A den of doltes that now the world,
may termed be full well:
And place with errors stuffed therefore
give ear what I thee tell:
If wretched darkness fro thy mind
thou seek to erpell.
And first of all thou ought to know,
the true felicity:
Which wych a reason firm and good,
ought searched forth to be.
Hereof doth wisdom flow with streamee,
hereof she doth appear:
But few there be that can attain,
the truth away to bear.
For riches to be chiefest good,
the greatest sort do say:
An other part doth honour take,
to be the chiefest away.
And diverse men in diverse things,
the chiefest good do find:
But I the price abeue the rest,
to pleasure have assigned.
And this my part I trust I can,
by reason good defend:
It is the mark that all shoot at,
and eke the final end.
To which, the acts and deeds of men,
be altogether bent:
Even as unto thappointed mark,
the shooters shaft is sent.
Who ever would the earth with rakes,
or Seas with Ores have tried?
Or martyall power by force of arms,
who durst have occupied?
In fine, who ever would have sought,
virtue to come unto:
If pleasure then or hope thereof,
did not enforce him so?
For this the chiese beginning is,
the midst and eke the end:
Of labours all, for proof thereof,
thy mind a while attend.
All works if chagent reason have,
unto some end are donne:
The workmas hands it moves thereto,
and first in mind begone.
It is: But last of all the dead,
it self comes forth to light:
The end thereof is good therefore,
the work doth more delight.
The will thereof, with great delight,
the end for to obtain:
Doth force the labour light to be,
the cause is pleasure plain.
For truly nothing else it is,
but pleasure of the mind:
And since by reason harde it is,
to teach the rude and blind.
I will attempt by simlitudes,
the truth for to declare:
Why delues the plowmas clubbishe had,
tears the earth with share?
For all the heate of flaming dog,
his work he doth not space.
Nor hoary winter frost. Why fears,
the shipman not in mind:
The raging rage of surging Seas,
with threarning Rocks so blind?
Despising death at hand in hope,
of mast with sayly pine:
Why doth the Captain to the field,
his manful mind incline?
And uersly doth reioicewhen as
he hears the Trumpets blow:
With hynteng noise of foaming horse,
his heart begynnes to glow.
Why doth it some delight always,
with papers pale to be:
And books of diverse authors made,
with daily pain to see?
Certes for that that after time,
when labours long depart:
So gain or same may give him cause
for to rejoice in heart.
For if so be that fame and gain,
should not the mind ascend:
With joy both virtue arts withal,
would soon be at an end.
For of it self the end is sweet
and for the end is thought:
Both midst former facces so sweet,
it forces also nought.
Of vile or else of honest state,
the dcades do seem to be:
For as the lewd licentious man,
rejoices vice to see.
In virtue likewise evermore,
the good mans Joys do stand:
All things therefore for pleasures sake,
we surely take in hand.
For pleasure men decline fro harms,
for this they gains require:
Things worthy praise or else reproach
through this they do desire.
With only this the Gods above,
contented surely be:
For profit is for them unmeet,
since nought they lack we see.
But thou perchance wilt say the gods,
with honest joys abound:
What then? If with such joyful goods,
in them no joy is found?
As if thou shouldest with glistering gold
and pearls a stock array:
An other thing here add, as oft,
as cause be perfect may.
It needful is the like effect,
from thence should then proceed:
When as therefore that force of ly^e,
is well disposed in deed.
And ch^efest good object to it,
it always doth retain:
That this is happiest happiness,
denies no man plain.
But now from out such fountain, lo,
is pleasure forced to run:
With music so the ears rejoice,
of numbers apt begun.
So is the sight with beauty pleased,
the nose with goodly smell:
This judgment eke I do pronounce,
of other parts as well.
What say thou now to Uenus work,
that creatures all doth make?
And this the pleasauntst pleasure is,
except thou truth forsake.
Moreover yet both payne and grief,
since greatest yls they be:
Contrary eke to pleasure now,
by right we pleasure see.
To be the chiefest good deserves,
of contraries also:
The reason like contrary is,
that sad things to forgo.
By natures force all things do seek,
and pleasures do embrace:
Who may believe that once will us,
deceive that natures grace?
The chiefest good therefore it is,
that creatures all do love:
But what love they, or seek they for,
but pleasant joys to prove?
That we must virtue seek again,
some sort there be that say:
By sweat and cold while here we live,
and pleasure cast away.
And after death they say we shall,
in perfect pleasure live:
Which good to those that do him love,
prepared hath to give.
This voice with reason cannot stand,
but shows it self as vain:
For that the soul doth after live,
when death the corps hath said.
Or that it lurks in loathsome lake,
of Tartares grisly den:
And pays the pains of his deserts,
and takes rewards as then.
Of former facts ought none believe,
except his senses fade:
(...) fools it is your Poets mad,
that have these fables made.
Who ever wonted were to write
such foolish feigned toys:
Whereby they might delight the ears
of fools with frustrate ^yes.
The irksome place they feigned have,
of Stig^an ^iraun^ fell:
Where flames ye ^ouds of Phiegetho
that burns with roaring yell:
Whereas the triple headed dog,
and Tisiphone doth dwell
With adders arinde of pay^ted hew,
and gressly Gyaunts great:
with dreadful darkness doide of light
and fires whose flaming heat.
Consumes no wood, where frieseth cold
without the wynters space:
The boat without the force of oak,
here creketh in this place.
wh^lste her with souls doth ^uerlode
the aged Ferriman:
Here Sisiphus the stone torments,
and Tantale waters wanne.
The s^isty ristye vessels hear,
matemurdring systers bear:
From whence the waters out do gush,
that kept in vain are there.
Much more than I have hear declared
these Poets p^lde have taught,
In hell to be, which are not true,
of children to be thought.
O gods how great a lack of wit,
there is in every place:
How prone the way to trif^es is,
and credit you this case,
O void of wit? which never could,
by reason ought be proved:
Nor by no sense may be desernde,
with fear why are you moved?
Of things so vain, who credits mos^,
is most himself deceived:
These are I say deceitful things,
whereby be priests releaued.
For when that once our vital breath,
is faded clean away:
No more we be than first we were,
before our natall day.
O to much weak to frail and proud,
O nature bold of man:
whereby doest thou persuade thy self
to live for ever than?
Leave of therefore thou lump of clay,
the years of gods to will:
^ll things begone shall have an end,
nothing remains styll.
Both cities great, and mighty men,
and vastye realms withal:
The hautiest hills and greatest floods
doth time at length let fall.
And think thou (O fading dust)
for ever to remain?
Is hope of mind with thee so great?
we travail but in vain.
In trusting dreams for virtues sake,
and feigning fancies strange:
That be but fools that things assured,
for vnassurde will change.
Forsaking thus assertainde here,
with doubtful things to meet:
But yet of old, and ancient fame,
rewards remains sweet.
Of little force this nothing is,
when death hath had his right:
Thou nothing art, for what is fame,
if it do nought delight?
The corps in grave, what doth ye s^one
or stock rejoice in prays?
If here thou hast not them, thou shal^
have never happy days.
Therefore while this our brittle life,
uncertain eke doth last:
The wise man, to his power will joy:
nor strait will down be cast.
As oft as fortune on him frowns,
will seek the pleasant life:
If any thing to him shall hap,
of bitter eygre strife.
Wherefore because I will not now,
thee frustrate here retain:
(O young man) joy while time permits,
and banish doleful pain.
When these his words my berded sire
had moved me to believe:
Good father then (quod I) for these
thy pains I cannot give.
Thee worthy thanks, but whilst I line,
I shall to thee be bound:
Within my heart, and eke I shall,
reserve thy sayings sound.
One doubt within my breast doth yet.
assuredly remain:
For not the deeds we only must,
but learn them to obtain.
Therefore I do require you now,
to teach me here the way:
That will me lead to pleasures place*
whereby it have I may.
The way is short and plain withal,
then grayherde to me tells:
Nor far from hence voluptnousnesse,
that lusty Lady dwells.
Whom if thou doest desire to see,
come after me a pace:
Whereby thou may by me rejoice,
in finding out her grace.
One part of three the starry orbs,
had scarce past over than:
When stackring up himself did raise,
thunweldy aged man.
Who leading forth I followed on,
and hand in hand we went:
By strange unhaunted ways we go,
and space a little spent
Behold appears a sumptuous house,
and straight I ask my guide:
What honour kepes that precious gem
and princely palace wide?
Plutus quod he possesses this,
and eke an armed knight:
The way to keep and men to pass,
forbids by his might.
Except they come him first unto,
and please him with some gift:
But he himself doth hold his hall,
amid you towry clift.
Three daughters eke he only hath,
within his bower to dwell:
Whose names if thou desire to know,
I shall thee briefly tell.
The first of them is filthy excess,
the second puffed pride:
The third is foolish ignorance,
with countnaunce bold beside.
Who then quod I shall lead us now,
unto this famous king?
Three maids he hath quod gresil thoe,
that there to will thee bring.
Chance, fraud and usury, by these,
have all men easy way:
I have no gifts then answered I,
that give these maids I may.
Nor safe it is such girls to trust,
some other way declare:
There is quod he another way,
there is a way to spare.
which if thou say the word we go,
lead me there to quod I:
Together both we went therwyth,
where deep a vale did lie.
with stones the way was all beset,
by which our journey lay:
And so be grown with cra^ed shorns:
that scarce we see the way.
Hereby we found the ragged house,
of seely poverty:
With top vntylde we past it thoe,
and straight a wood we spy.
Behold, then saith my guide to me,
behold you trees so hie:
Which with their tops do seem to touch,
the steamed starry sky.
There dwells ye worthy queen (quod he,)
by whom we shall be blessed:
But first thou must wash hand and face
and get thee neatly dressed.
The Goddess loves no nastinesse,
nor s^ouens can abide:
A river small I then perceiude,
by grauayle ground to glide.
Which with a pleasannt hushing soud,
provoked the joys of bed:
Here washed I fair my face and hands,
and combde my rugged head.
I trimde my clothes in order fine,
and lightness hath expelde:
All grave and earnest things: so that
with mirth my way I held.
No further of than once a man,
a stone may from him sting:
The wood was then whereas we hear
the birds full sweetly sing.
And flowers sweet and fair we smell.
of which inowe there grows:
Such woods tharabian never saw,
though franconcense there flows.
Nor yet the Eastern Indian thoe,
nor Scith the like doth see:
Though round about he is beset,
with bows of laurel tree.
Nor Atlas that the rolling skies,
with shoulders doth ^nstayne:
Though Satires in the place doth dance
whom Fairies love doth payne.
A river mild about it runs,
with comely water clear:
The banks so far asonder stood,
as leaps the chased Dear.
And in the depth a doughty drove,
of scaley beasts they play:
And for a wall it compasde is,
with lofty pines so gay.
With pines that in their crabbed barks
doth Cibels love contain:
And Phebus Cyprus stands them by,
of equal height again.
There lacks no mastes Esculus,
no Mapple, Holme nor Oak:
Nor plaintree, Cork, nor yet the nut
that colour doth provoke.
The Arbute, and the Alder tree,
the Chestnut, and the Ash:
The Filbert, Pechtree and the Palm,
the Byrch with spriggy lash.
The Firretre, and the myrtle eke,
and broad leaude Beechy wood:
When Saturn ruled the golden world,
which was our fathers food.
The Vine, the Fig and Apple eke,
and Lotos Pryaps friend:
The Juey and the Laurel tree,
that Poets heads doth shend.
The Mulberry and the Poplartree,
that Hercule once estemde:
The Peartree, willow, and the Prime,
with Bore that whitley semde.
The Medlar and the Olive tree,
the Elm and Cherrey red:
The Codtree and the Almon eke,
whose flowers first do spread.
What should I here the Cedre tree,
or Hebron call to mind:
Or Cytre fit for Tables fine,
whom gold his place resynde.
Or other more whose names if thou,
dost take in hand to tell:
Thou sooner may in number bring,
the Egiptian lands as well.
Thus in we go whereas the bridge,
doth join the banks in one:
Of ample space and semely sight,
their alleyes long they gone.
With Purple Roles red and white,
and Paunseys painted hew:
White Daffodils and violets sweet,
with flagrant Lillies blew.
Sweet Amaranthe that long doth live,
with leaves of crimson die:
The Clove with Balm and Cassia to,
Mynt Time and Sauerie.
With Saffro Myrhe and Maioram,
the Gardens only gem:
Of savour sweet in I dale woods,
ynow there grows of them.
Both here and there in every place,
sweet savours up they sum:
A thousand kinds of Birds do fill,
the woods with every tune.
With diverse notes the cleared air,
they caused to resound:
There Progne wayles the great vn^rot^
that in her love was found.
And Philomela doth bewail,
her own and Itis case:
In human voice and painful throat,
the ^ara^ pr^tes apase.
Their varying softly notes so fine,
the Goldfi^ch fast doth sing:
And waters flows the flowers upon,
from clear continual spring.
And here and there their courses run
and moystes the hear^es so grene:
No Dragon there nor greedy wolf,
might ever yet be seen.
No Bore, no Bear nor Tiger fierce,
nor Serpent foul there dwells:
To harm with triple hissing tongue,
with poison fierce that swells.
In fine no kind of beast there is,
but such as peace hath ^worne:
The longeard wat, the Hart, the Buck,
the Goat with harmless horne.
The middle heavens then almost,
the flaming Phebus held:
When first we saw the gorgeous place,
whereas this Lady dwelde.
Amid the woods an aumple space,
full of grene herbs we see:
No tree there grew but tables round,
in order placed be.
With de^ties such as Capna did,
the oneyde duke prepare:
Such deinties as they once did eat,
the sacred shields that bare.
The time is come quod Gresill now
let us go drink and fill:
Our bellies: Strength for to repair,
it is the goddess will.
That none shall pass with sober head,
nor yet with hungered maw:
For scotfree here may all men feed,
this is the Ladies law.
When meat doth fail, her maids do fill
the table full again:
A pace we feed and scarce can rise,
so wetes the wine our brain.
With doubtful steps our feet do tread,
with stackryng stumps we go:
More earnestly we then desire,
the Queen to come unto.
Whom in the field we walking find,
with mighty mirthful train:
Young lusty guts with boys maids
and doting age again.
On her right hand a woman goes,
with pleasant shining face:
And in her hand a boy she leads,
from down whose shoulders place.
A dreadful quyuer hanges with shaf^es,
both cruel sharpe and kene:
And in his hands a bow he bare,
and drew the string so ten.
Though blind he was yet straight he threw^
at every man his dart:
And fier^ye to without regard,
he pierced to the heart.
The shaft returns straight again,
when wide the wound is left:
The people all incontinent,
he had of life bereft.
But that a certain woman there,
that pitied much the sore:
Of Godly zeal unto these men,
began help and health restore.
For when the wounded breasts she saw
whereas the dart went in:
Of any man, and blood so warm,
that gushing out did spin.
Then strayte she runs her cure unto,
and healthful drinks him gives:
Whereby though cruel wound remain,
the patient yet he lives.
An other woman yet besides,
in left hand leads the Queen:
Whose chaps do always chaw ye cud,
her golles they gresy been.
With musty dusty loathsome clothes,
whose stink doth all annoy:
And only to she doth delight,
in beastly belly joy.
Great tanckards deep she turns quite
the bottoms vpsey down:
And in her hand a boy she leads,
with drowsy droupyng crown.
And winking eyes, he scarce could wake
nor would his dame permit:
With meat drink thus ouercharg^e
to have a waking fit.
A moyster strange on her he flyngs,
heer^ sounds with wheasing noise:
The boxen shalme, with stroke ye harp.
is forcde to show his voice.
Here Orphens doth bewail his wife.
with tooth of serpent torn:
The dire decrees of darksome den,
and labours past and worn.
And after him both beast and stone,
by musyck sw^e he draws:
To Delphins eke Arion here,
^oth sweetly sing his saws.
With harp the noble Amphion here,
doth Thebes walls renew:
Declaring here his cruel case,
by shipmen eke vnt^ewe.
And after these with fr^skyng l^gges,
comes Dancing all the rest:
Whose eyes a certain dymnes darcke,
had fully then oppressed.
About the heads of every one,
their flies a stinking mist:
And one amongst them all I knew,
that held this writ in fist.
Sa^danapalus here am I,
that ruled with princely power:
T^assyrians Realm lo this have I,
for that I did devour.
O foolish wretches, whylest you live,
let never Joys so go:
For after death alas there are,
no Joys to come unto.
Learn you by me O mortal men,
the trewest way to know:
Now last of all two Monsters came,
amid the vtterst row.
Whereof the one with diverse tongues,
these fellows foul arayde:
The other vexed them sore with pricks,
that grief their Joye alayde.
So much the heavens us do hate,
rejoicing at our ill:
So far the Gods above do seem,
contrary to our will.
And though with these adversities,
we pass our days in payne:
Yet have we not one hour to joy,
in quiet to remain.
If ought we have it is but short,
and joy imperfect framed:
O life that dost of right deserve,
erilement to be named.
Why doth the harms of mortal men,
the Gods above delight:
Why had they rather sad we were,
than live in joyful plight.
Whereof did first spring out to us,
such mortal hatred fell:
Win thou the gods with patient mind,
in bearing evils well.
No space we were of any length,
from this vnrulye game:
When from the right side of the wood,
came forth a comely Dame.
With body fine and virgins face,
and sober semely gate:
Such one as Jove his wife is thought,
amid her great estate.
with hair, and bosom torn, she runs
to us in doleful plight,
And not to be despysde she was
though clothes were base to sight.
And from her ruddy rosye lyppes,
these witty words did spring:
O caytifes whereto pace you thus,
whereto shall frenzy bring.
You now? stay here, set down your fete
and leap nor to the snare:
And hearken to my words a while,
that I shall here declare:
First this (quod she) no goddess is,
nor her no goddess bare.
As you (perchance) beloue she is,
to whom as now you go,
To tents of whom you covet now
to Join your selves unto.
But is a dredefull drery sprite,
deceiving all that lives:
Unwares of her deceitfully,
and gall for honey gives.
Let not the face deceive you now
that seems sayre without:
That glisters aye with shining gold
beset with gems about.
You know not yet how foul she is,
within those garments gay:
A thousand spots within she hath
and castes her men away.
Deceiude with false defrauding toy:
as ^ishe their bane come by:
Whom crafty fysher doth hegyle,
with reed deceitfully.
When from the rocks, into the floods
he casts down his lyne:
With harmful bait the hooke so hyd,
with hasty course they hine.
And snatch with gredye jaws ye bait
and fast they hang thereby:
And following fast the twyrling thread
their dance full dolefully:
The quivering sands of Libiaes land
we need not for to fly:
No fearful Atiphates house,
no Scillaes rock so hye.
Nor dreadefull drenching Charibdis,
nor other monster fell:
So much as ought we pleasure shun
what harms hereby do dwell.
In mortal men? what towns? what realms?
what men of worthy fame
Hath it destroide? I will be short,
and one example name.
Who ever yet Alcides past,
who durst such deeds assay?
That slew two serpets foul sometimes
in cradle as he lay.
He tore the tushes from them both,
and thrust his hands so small:
In midst their throats. He caused hath,
Molorchus beast to fall.
He cut the foul Echydnaes head:
destroyed the dreadful drake:
The fearful bull down he threw,
and swifty Hart did take.
He hath expelde the Stimphalides
by force of valiant bow:
The Thracian tyrants stable eke,
his hand did overthrow.
He turned thy course Achelous,
and brake thy winding creke:
He toke the Apples from the maids,
and spoiled the Spanish freke.
Of huge kine. He did descend
down the pyt of hell:
The dreadful dog from thence he drew,
that fometh poison fell.
The Bore of Erymantus to,
was slain of that same hand:
And Anthenes eke the urength of him,
lift up did understand.
He felt it eke that Oxen stale,
Dan Uulcanes wyly whelp:
And after all the weary sire,
he could old Atlas help.
The stars above and swaying poules,
whose shoulders do sustain:
But O thou hurtful pleasure lo,
deceatful eke and vain.
The Lordly hests of Gigian maid,
with will he did obey:
And he whom dire Megeraes force,
nor fend might once affray.
Nor quivering Lartares frosty cold,
nor flames of Phlegethon:
Nor vggly Charons dreadful loke,
with bristled hairs upon.
Did often fondly fear the threats,
of mild vnmighty maid:
For shield in hand a distaff bears,
for helm with coyfe arayde.
The hand also that once was wont,
unwieldy club to shake:
In maydely guise then tow to spin,
and eke accounts to make.
Of task performed. And unto her
the bondled flax he bears:
whilst clothed in womes wed the stroke,
of mistres whip he fears.
Amphitrions son, what beastly toy,
hath made the thus so blind?
For as that hag dame Circes did,
transform to swinish kind.
Ulisses mates bewrapt their bones,
in stubborn bristles harde:
So doth your Queen (nay rather slave,)
change them that her regard.
For dish in hand to them she geues,
of pleasant poison full:
Of which who drinks is straight transformed
in Lion, Bore or Bull.
Or made a dog or else a wolf,
the common plague to sheep:
And other into diverse shapes,
are thus compelde to creep.
But few of that same sort there be,
this deathly cup that fly:
And you your selves these fearful fates,
shall shortly sure come by.
If thou perchance will after run,
the banners of this whore:
Wherefore be wise and fly the snares,
I warn you sirs before.
Whilst time will serve with brideling bits,
and rule your wilful mind:
And in the privy hidden snares,
let not your eyes be blind.
Least she like as the spider doth,
beguile the siely fly:
whilte as in tender web she lurks,
and in her bower doth lye.
But when that she doth perreyne,
the gyltlesse soul in trapt:
Then out with cruel course she comes,
the corps in cords so clapped.
The dusty twyst with nimble legs, through,
about it fast she winds:
with deadelye styngs she thrusts him
and sucks the blood she finds.
O mad to mad, which when he may,
to gods compared be:
By reason ruled, yet brut^h train,
to haunt delights he.
In using left of lecherous acts,
and pampering Uenus friend:
His greedy paunch and beastliness,
he follows to his end.
These words with patience could not bear.
my lusty gresild gyde:
But mourning this his will so broke,
and angered eke beside.
With mumbling words: I know not what
he turns fro us his face,
And, unto his acquainted mates,
ran three legde sire a pace.
Arete then (for this her name,
she termed her self to be)
Let Gresil fly from hence away,
regard not thou quod she.
The Owl to darkness used, cannot,
the glistering sun abide:
And as the sick whom fever long,
with raging heate hath tried.
Refuses such as may to him,
his health again restore:
Things worse and hurtful to his life,
desiring rather more.
So fools do follow false things most,
and from the truth they fly:
But fly not thou my warning hear,
if elth thou doest set by.
Which that you may more aptly hear,
walk now this way with me:
For with these sights the mind is let,
and ears disturbed ^ee.
Then towards the right hand forth she leads,
and underneath a bay:
That stood thereby, we both sit down,
and thus she began to say.
That workman first that made the skies
the earth and seas also:
As all the spheres he hath compelde,
gaynward the first to go.
So would he that theffectes of mind,
should reason eke gainsay:
Least mind alone within the corps,
with dullness should decay.
For as the Horse by force of spur,
and Ox, with god a right:
Are forcde to go, and by the smart,
receive the greater might.
So sharp with force, theffects the mind
increased by restraint:
The which effects if they were not,
the mind straight ways would faint.
And would no worthy thing perform
like as the ship doth slugge:
Except the winds her sails do puff,
and Ores by force her drug.
Some greatly err therefore that say,
such tumults of the mind:
A wiseman never ought to feel,
like form in marble sinde.
These men do think a man to be:
and doting preach in vain:
For then in vain had nature dealt,
to man such motions plain.
Which is to base for to confess,
we may them therefore use:
Most lawfully if reasons rule,
and art thereto we choose.
These great affections of the mind,
with bridle strong he guides:
And as the horseman rules his horse,
so rules he them besides.
Nor once is over run of them,
he, that deserves to be:
A wise man named, and not in vain,
but few there be we see.
That virtue knows for to obtain,
in measure for to stay:
Some sort therefore this same do love,
some take it clean away.
Both sorts thereby in error halt,
for, only gods alone:
By reason lives, and beasts again,
with only sense do groan.
But man with both is full adorned,
commanded to rejoice:
In both also: in reason most,
this part is worthier choice.
And more celestial eke it is,
and lifts men aloft:
Where lust doth throw me hedlog down
and makes them dote full oft.
Wherefore we ought it least to bay,
although (O nature blind:
Of men) that every man it hants,
and few can reason find.
A sort therefore amid the wood,
saunce number saw we play:
To which even thou with doltish guide,
had held thy foolish way.
But that our voice did thee withdraw,
and did thou nothing fear:
Those mosters two, with stealthy steps
that followed after there?
Know thou their names? the one is grefs
the other slander hight:
I not forbid nor grant such joys,
of sense proceeding right.
But rare I would that they should be,
and eke no virtues foe:
For which it never lawful is,
things honest to let go.
But bridells strong thou need sure,
and closely them to take:
For else they hurt: and joyful things,
will malice not forsake.
Disordring all and loke how much,
a man doth from them fly:
So much the more he doth approach,
the sear of Jove on hye.
And he that hants them most of all,
is worthy least of praise:
Abasing eke himself therwyth,
with beasts he leads his days.
They hurt besides when as they be,
to daily use retained:
And dangers dire be got thereby,
and mind with lets is pained.
Nor can the mind be always yet,
to severe things addict:
For frail it is and joy it must,
when ends the sad afflict.
And down the highest hills descend,
to valleys deep and lowe:
No otherwise than when on earth,
doth Jove his lightning throw.
Hating the crimes that here be done,
the Egle bearing fast:
With bill or feet, the three edged told,
in Cicil fornace cast.
Ascends the tops of heavens hie,
and marvels much to see:
The Princely walls with precious stones
that there adorned be.
Astonished is to see the place,
of glistering gold confect:
That shines with stars she doth behold
with Diamond pillars decked.
The costly roufes she looked upon,
of Indian teeth compact:
She marvels at the ample field,
and light that never lacked.
The great delights that gods are in,
that rong cannot express:
Nor never heart of man could think,
the worthy pleasantness.
She flying fast both here and there,
desires much to play:
By skies so clear and pleasant airs,
begins her wings to spray.
The earth, and quite she doth forget,
her nest is out of mind:
In princely rain of thundering God,
such pleasure doth she find.
But after that by hungers prick,
with fasting strength decays:
And he ate lacks food to work upon,
that now she began to praise.
The heavens hie she doth despise,
and down her self she speeds*
To ground, that late she did contemn,
and there apace she feeds.
Then I which held my peace so long,
(such silence for to break:)
Addressed my self and not afraid,
her tale to stop, began speak.
Because (quod I) the sun as now,
began westward first descend:
And night doth hast his course to use.
before this light do wend.
Away from us and darkness comes,
a few things show to me:
O goddess mild (no matron thou,
but seems a ghost to be.)
What name the woman had, of late,
that I saw yonder stand:
Besides the Queen, what the boys
be, that she led in hand.
Then in this sort she answered me,
doubt not, thou shalt discern:
By me (if time do nothing let)
all that thou seeks to learn.
Unworthy things thou hast not asked,
I will therefore resight:
Her now, that on the left hand goes,
and greedy but she hight.
Her great delight is for to eat,
and night and day to drink:
The greatest sort do worship her,
and for a god her think.
With joyful hearts the flaming wines,
in gilded holes they mash.
And costly cates on bourdened bourdes,
the greedy guts they grash.
The chiefest good they think to be,
this belly god to serve:
But out of doubt I thee assure,
they from the truth do swerve.
For nothing is more vile than this,
nor harms more the state,
Of man: The beasts for only life,
did Jove above create.
But man for life and reason to,
and that he should excel:
And so be like unto the saints,
which in the heavens dwell.
He ordaynde hath to rule the earth,
but they that love the yoke:
Of gredinesse and belly joys,
are dull, and with the smoke.
Of fuming meates their wit is darckt,
(like as the clouds the sun:)
No may they yet the truth discern,
but chiefly when begun.
Hath boiling wines within the breast,
to blind and dull the wit:
And when the paunch is stuffed full,
for books they be unfit.
Whereby it often comes to pass,
their wit but small to be:
The end that nature plaste them for,
they clean for sake we see.
Nor more they know, than doth ye herd
of Sheep or Oxen dull:
Yea less sometime when as with wine
their beastly brains be full.
When as for one, two lights they see,
with board and wall to dance:
O drunkenness, the death of mind,
the brood of all mischance.
What thing dost thou not force ye mind,
of man to take in hand?
What dare not he attempt thorough thee
both strife with brawling, and
Most cruel frayes thou mouest him to,
thou ioyest when blood is shed:
By thee are secretes left reuealde,
with mind and tong made dead.
Both fear and shame fastness also,
full far they fly from thee:
Shun you this plague (O wretches) now
that makes you mad to be.
And even as as mad as once Drestes
was with mothers might:
What filthier thing? what beast more vile
than is the drunken wight?
The meat that he not long before,
hath fast devoured up:
He perbrakes out, he trembles eke,
and stinks of the cup.
Full oft he falls and breaks his brows
his eyes and legs withal:
His stutting words he stamereth out,
no man perceive him shall.
Much things he saith, much he doth,
that when the night is gone:
And sun is present here again,
he sorrows sore upon.
The Mace donian King, the son,
of Phillip grand le Roy:
In drunken mode, at table once,
his friends did all destroy.
But when the cups their fumes had left
and wit returned again:
He found the fault, with tears he mournd,
and wished himself as slain.
Why boast you with your Orgies vain
in woods of Citheron?
Your Thias dance, why brag you now
your foolish drums upon?
No God your Bacchus is Iwis,
that comes of Cadmus line:
Nor Jove him got of Semels womb,
as Poets do define.
But hell hath him engendered, lo
Begera is his dame:
No God he is, but doth despise,
the gods, and hates their name.
For godliness they nought estreme,
that haunt the pots of wine:
Nor well can use the drunken priest,
the Sacraments divine.
What need I here for to resit,
what sickness, and what pains:
Excess of meat and to much drink,
doth breed within the veins?
From hence do flow: even as it were,
from everlasting spring:
The axesse, and the botch, the boil,
with scaule and scurfe itching.
The gout oppressing hands and fete,
with bleared dropping eyes:
With wine the quivering joints they quake.
fro jaws the teeth out flies
With sudden death, stomachs pain,
and fulsome stinking breath:
A greater sorry than sword hath slain,
excess hath done to death.
Besides the goods be straight cosumde,
and down the guts do s^ing:
The field, the house, the household stuff
and every other thing.
And now both poor and base he is,
whose riches late were great:
Eat thou, where by thy life may last,
but live not thou to eat.
I have thee here declared now,
the woman what she hight:
And now the boy with nodding noule,
I will thee here resight.
The boy is hers, and of her borne,
and labour him begat:
His name is sleep, his nurse is leth.
his fode is poppey fat.
He brother germaine is to death,
but not as she doth last:
He doth refresh the wearied limbs,
with daily labour past.
He doth expel the cares of men,
and calls strength again:
Without the aid of him, no man,
his life may well sustain.
Yet hurts he much and doth the mind
in certain wise oppress:
Diseases breeds, and ouls the corps,
oft used with excess.
If food be small, he small will be,
for when the meat is spent:
The corps doth wake or else doth rest,
with little sleep content.
More lightly then his rest he takes,
and better sleeps doth breed:
But unto troubled minds it is,
a comfort great in deed.
And much it is to be desired,
when love the hart doth payne:
When sickness greues or when yt man,
doth heavy chance sustain.
Then is it more to be esteemed:
than gold or precious stone:
As death, so sleep doth make the wretch
and happy man as one.
But he whom nature hath endowed,
with long and happy days:
That doth desire expert to be,
in every kind of ways.
By virtue eke a famous name,
in earth for to obtain:
Must watch: for famous things, by sleep
none are performed plain.
And for to sleep in feathers soft,
renown doth left refuse:
Shun thou this same, with al thy might
thy self to watching use.
For, O what times of quiet length
shall fares permit to thee:
When last of all the night shall come
and day shall banished be.
And breath hath left ye quivering joints
like air that fleting flies:
With long and everlasting sleep,
then shalt thou shut thine eyes.
While as the goddess thus did speak,
descend down from hye:
Thaumantis, lo when sun doth shine
that glisters in the sky.
With diverse hew that shows her face,
amid the misty cloud:
with ruddy rosye purple lips,
thus began she speak aloud.
God speed thee goddess here on earth,
Panomphes gem most dear:
Arete chief of goddesses
(as doth to me appear.)
Come on thy ways for all the gods,
desires now to see.
Leave thou the earth, earthly reigns
where dwellers ill they be.
Here is no place for ghostly men,
all wicked crimes here reign:
Religion none, no faith, nor grace
but virtue in disdain.
Here foolish fondenesse holds ye balle,
imperial Sceptre aye:
Fraud and disceyt all men amongst,
is used here always.
Go to therefore in hast, as now,
break of thy tale begun:
Let lets be losed, with like course,
let us to heaven run.
Arete than, beholding me,
these words began to say:
I cannot now (as fain I would)
all things to thee display.
But when the day again repair,
and night away shall slyde:
To thee, shall I send one, be glad,
to tell thee all beside.
Farewell therefore: with these words
gain ward the skies they spring:
The western wind did them receive
and upward fast them bring:
Like as when wicked Scilla flies,
her father following fast:
Aloft by little up she hies,
and he began after hast.
With greedy mind, through the air
he sores both here and there:
Desiring much to wreke the fault
of cutting of his hair.
She strives her self in clouds to hyde,
and mounts out of sight:
And Nisus thither pierces fast,
that both be out of light.
Down the floods, doth sun descend
and forth the stars they shined:
And I the way that grey berd led,
full sadly then declined:
And home I come, my promised joys
in heavy hope to find.
Cancer the fourth Book.
Sun that with perpetual course
about the world doest fly:
The parent chief of every thing,
and dyamonde of the sky.
The Prince of all the Stars, spring
of everlasting light:
Beholding every thing abroad,
while as with colour bright.
Of crimsyn hew, thou leave aloof
the brinkes of Persean land:
With rising face, and passing forth,
doest hyde thy fyerie brand.
Amid the western fluddes, and last
of all, dost burn the hill:
Of Calpe great, and eke that course,
frequentest always styll.
By thee, do all things plain appear,
whose colour late the night
Bereft, her darkness by no means
abiding ones thy light.
The sight and eye of all the world,
who parts in four the year,
And change times, with the time,
all things engendered hear:
while as by crooked line thou runste
in lively pictured sphere.
O star divine, and of the gods,
o fairest God all hail:
We worship thee, and from the hart,
where never troth doth quail.
Our prayers here we make to thee,
behold us now therefore:
With joyful face, and joyful day,
with joy thy self restore.
Disperse the clouds from hence, and let
the day be bright and clear:
Let seas lay down their roaring looks,
straight, when thou dost appear.
Let shipmen safe frequent their course,
upon the waters plain:
Defend the corn, the trees, and vines
from pouring shores of rain.
And fro the boisterous whirlwind mad,
and stormy stones of hail:
Let pleasant aires on us be blown,
from fiery Pyros vail.
And make all things by thy return,
in quiet rest remain:
O chief defence, and Poets aid,
all hail to thee again.
Thou fillest the minds of Poets all,
with sacred holy sprite:
And mouest the heads of every one,
with sugared verse to write.
By thee they gain the laurel leaf,
and everlasting fame:
Al hayle therefore, and help me now,
my singing verse to frame.
And succour these my first attempts,
direct my course withal:
Till unto long desired port,
my boat, and I may crall.
Thus, whylste at castale sprynges on knees
my humble suit declared:
The muses all about me plaste,
the God my prayers hard.
From towers of Delphos hie he heard,
and straight as semde to me:
The steple be^, and therewythal
a shining light I see.
From out the Chancel came, and eke,
a wondrous voice I hear:
Which with these words, as then me thought,
resounded in mine ear.
O young man void of bliss, and whom,
such destnies dire do payne:
That spendst thy life with bitter years
pull up thy hart again.
For patient payne doth overcome,
and in thafflicted case:
The valiant ought for to despise,
the fawning fortunes face.
For fortune then doth most prevail,
when that she is restraynde:
Doest thou not see, whom fortune oft,
had fully once disdaynde.
The same with changed hand she aids,
and lyfteth up on hye:
Now this, now that: nothing endures,
beneath the heavens sky.
when glouming weather foul is gone,
then pleasant days ensewe:
At length the swelling seas be calm,
that erst the winds so blew.
when winters season sharp departes,
apears the floured spring:
Fix sure thy mind therefore as now,
and faint not in the thing.
That bitter seems: prepare thy self,
for better destinies:
The time shall come (the stars above,
altering their course in skies.)
(If death before, thee not destroy)
when this thy present name:
That now doth lye both drowned hyd,
shall gain immortal fame.
For I my self will present be,
and eke my learned route
The Sisters nine, in every place,
shall stand thee round about.
And take thee from the common sort,
and cause thy name to live:
For evermore. This answer here,
to me did Phebus give
So praying. But scarce can I the Gods
believe such things of me:
Under so crabde aspect of stars,
I know my birth to be.
So sore the heavens do me vex,
but yet from thence I go:
with joyful heart I wander forth,
alone, and always so.
These words in mind I muse,
O Lord that hap might be:
That God or man I might now meet,
as promised late to me.
Arete for to send to teach,
that I the rest might know:
O that from heavens hye she would,
descend the earth below.
And me with pleasant words instruct,
as erst I did her hear:
A valley long there lay between,
two hills that bounded near.
A narrow path there was, that shows
the travailing wight his way:
This path I toke, and straight I saw,
two shepherds there that lay.
In grass full grene against the bank,
who (bags and bottels down:
with crab tree staves where with they walkd)
desirous of renown.
Began to strive who best could sing,
but judge they lacked than:
Whose sentence should the strife appease,
and praise the siner man.
As soon as they me present spied,
they both me called unto:
And wild me for to sit them by,
and judge who best could do.
Then one of them, (when that he had
with oaten music played)
His staring eyes on heaven cast,
and on this sort he said.
O flower fair of Dardany,
of Jove beloved (o child:)
That serve the gods with frothing cup
of pleasant Nectar mild.
Come down from hie now fro ye Skies,
a fairer far than thee:
In earth remayns that unto Jove,
cupbearer now shall be.
Him, Jupiter despising thee,
shall take from hence, and place
Among the stars from envy burst,
(O thou in wretched case.)
Yield up for grief thy woeful goste,
but rather not depart:
Thou shalt with wines the Gods salnte,
and I enjoy my heart.
Philetus dear (without whose sight,
no kind of thing is sweet:
To me,) no not my life to have,
without his presence mete.
As oft as him on horseback swift,
(the Got, or Hart to chase:)
The Fairies spy, with love they burnt
and wysh that lovely face.
With thousand kisses for to mete,
as many gifts withal:
And floured garlands trim him give
contending, best who shall.
And apples fair in baskets bring,
and grapes of pleasannt taste:
O that neglecting to be pleased,
in him were not so placed.
O that this lively Imp would show,
himself always at hand:
To ease the wretched lovers grief,
then hapiest should I stand.
No man in all the world my mate,
but he doth clean despise,
My plaints and faithful lovers suits
and hates my doleful cries:
And as the shaft from bow departes
so from me fast he flies.
But fly not from me thus, nor hate,
me so (Philetus dear:)
I am no cruel Cannibal,
whereby thou shouldest me fear.
But worthy to be loved I am,
perchance if thou me know:
For though upon my body rough,
the hoary hairs they grow.
And though from chin with locks vnkept
my grisly beard doth fall:
I am not yet ill favoured sure,
for beard and bristels all.
Be decent eke and mete they be,
for fighting folks and strong:
Let maydly men have tender skins,
the shepherds all among.
In riches none doth me excel,
of beast I lack no store:
A thousand kine my pasture feeds,
of swine full fyfty score.
Amongst my grove of Oaks they run
my kine with calves do sway,
My lusty gotes with kid they swell:
no want I whigge, nor why:
Fresh cheese, and old enough I have
take what thou likest, away.
All mine is thine and I thine own,
though cruel thou denny:
If thou me loved and would thy self
sometime come sit me by.
I would thee pleasant apples get,
that hangs on branches hie:
with golden sides like yellow wax,
and red, as strawberies die.
I would thy lap with fylberts fill,
and nuts of diverse kind:
How oft, how oft mine arms should I,
about thy middle wind?
Two thousand kisses would I give,
those rosy lips of thine:
Dout not (sweet boy) but walk with me
by cleared spring so fine.
we both will rest, and grateful sleep,
with hausing arms will take:
Alurde with shade of hushing trees,
and noise that rivers make.
while Greshops in the heat do chirp,
alas, and dost thou now
Despise both me and all my gifts,
that here to thee I vow?
Do not my woeful tears thee move,
nor all that I can say?
More fiercer far, than Tiger stout,
(whose whelp is taken away.)
More deaf than pictures made,
of Parus Marble stone:
And harder eke than are again,
the mountains every chone
Of Alps hie, and Diamond strong,
what doth thy beauty good:
If all men so thou dost despise,
with fierce and cruel mood?
And slayest the souls of woeful wights,
whose hearts thine own be tried:
Thus wise her self in flowers fair,
the dreadful Snake doth hide.
And thus with poison honey myxt,
lay down dis^ aside:
A monster vile, and unto God,
is ancient e^y, pride.
Nor be not thou with grace begilde,
or form of fading hew:
For beauty lasts but little time,
like flower fresh and new.
Full fair at first, is gone in time,
while flouring age doth last:
while tender skin in face doth shine,
let not in vain be past
Such happy times, but use the gifts,
now granted unto thee:
While time doth serve, for every thing,
by use commended be.
The time shall come when this thy chin
with bristled beard beset:
Shall vggly seem, and eke thy face,
shall rivaled wrinkles fret.
And when thy golden locks shall turn
to ghastly gresild hears:
To late then shalt thou fodle bewail,
the loss of youthful years.
And oft thy self shalt say, where is
my beauty old now gone?
Where is my colour fresh become,
both red and white in one?
Uayne hope, alas, of this thy face,
then shalt thou sore lament:
Thy changed cheeks, and face so foul
thy self, when represent,
Thou shalt thy glass perceive, but why
thus waste I wind in vain?
What mean I thus in barren soil,
to let my seeds remain?
Unhappy wretch in vain I toil,
my destnies will me so:
O cruel destinies, that now,
so sore against me go.
And chiefly now, when wretched love,
hath appears my woeful hart:
Of greater force is luck in love,
than all the swelling part.
Of riches great, or noble blood,
to destnies virtue ^hrall:
By luck in love the prince despised,
and John obtains the ball.
But though more fiercer thou remainst,
than fearful raging drake:
Or dost my love no more esteem,
than weeds in fenny lake.
Yet thee sweet hart I serve, and thee,
for ever shall I love:
And nothing shall thee from my mind,
(Philetus dear) remove.
This said, he held his peace, and thus,
this other began to say:
Mellina, passing flower of wheat,
and whiter far away.
Than frothing some of raging seas,
or Allablastar stone:
And boiled milk, more red than are,
the Cherries every one.
When ripe they hang, or Mulbry fruit,
while yet no black they wear:
More fair than trees in time of spring,
when branches blossoms bear.
More sweet than are the withered figs
or wines that new be made:
Such lips, such breast, or eyes I think,
dame Uenus never had.
What should I here commend her this,
or places there that lie?
Such parts in practise put, than speak,
with better will would I.
Not only here of mortal men,
her praise Mellina gains:
But Gods her love I saw my self,
a Satire take the pains.
To hunt her once, and when he had,
the game possessed in paws:
Anenst a Cork he taught her tricks,
of wanton lovers laws.
She called and shrikt, and I, as wood,
would straight her aid have borne:
But sore afraid I was to meet,
the shagheard horsons horne.
Nor once I durst my enemy try,
his pactence for to prove:
How oft she beckes and bids me come,
with eyes that rolling move.
And of her self she calls me thus,
and fast begins to twine:
Her arms so white about my neck,
like Juy, or the Vine.
That wonted are their neighbor trees,
with winding course to brace:
And fast the wanton bytes my neck,
and softly on the face
With hand in sport she smites me oft,
and by her troth she swears:
That none on earth but me she loves,
nor none good will she bears.
But yet am I not such a fool,
that I hold this for true:
For women all in lies excel,
and when with fawnings new
The naughty queens begin to fliere,
the more thou ought afraid
To be, these words in song he spake,
and more ve would have said.
But seven wolves by chance therewith,
came creping close the way:
From rocks down amid the trees,
desirous of their pray.
And on the flock they run, now these,
now those they slay and byte:
And mouths in blood they stain, again
the masty cures they fyte.
With barking boughing noise, to beat,
their enemies from the ground:
A noise full great made in the dale,
with roaring cry doth sound.
Then both the shepherds rise in haste,
the wager quite undone:
With sling, and staves of Oak in hand,
together both they run.
And I, behind alone remaynd,
and forth another way:
With doutfull mind and diverse thought
I went, as far as may
The brazen canon cast his stone
at thrice, and there a spring
That spouted up with bubbling sands,
where thick the Plantrees cling
I found, and round about the grass,
full grene, it doth embrace,
With seats of sandy Tophus stone,
I guess it was the place
Where Fairies set in Summers rage,
when Dogdayes heat doth glow:
Not far from hence I saw me thought
a Service tree to grow.
Whose fruit did make ye branches bend,
and thereto fast I went:
(For ripe I them perceaude,) and some,
with hast in hand I hent.
And eat them up, desiring then,
with water for to slake:
My burning thirst, and to the well,
my journey forth I take.
And down I bow my self, and there,
my lips in water fine:
I dipped, and whilst I drink, the stones,
in Crystal waters shine.
Whilst these are done, a young ma down
from heavens to me sent:
That Goddess good, Arete fair,
of me not negligent.
With falling flight he cuts the air,
more swifter much he flies:
Than hawk that strive by force to take
the pray before their eyes.
And straight to me he comes that then,
with weary limbs did rest:
Amid the grass he bids god den,
then up my self I dressed
And worship there to him I make.
He (passing man in fame)
I am did say Aretes son
Timalphes is my name,
My mother hath me hither sent,
that al that doth remain
Behind unfold, I may disclose
to thee in order plain.
Then both together down we sit,
and thus he began to say.
The woman, and her boy, that stood
on left side yonder way,
Thou know, my mother told ye plain:
now rests there for to tell
What hight the woman, and the boy
that on the right hand dwell.
Her Venus men do cal, and say
that of the salt sea sud
She then created was, when that
old Saturne in the flood
Unkind his fathers stones did cast,
so said the Greekish sort:
A people fancies fit to fain
and lies for to report.
Vranius her (of troth) begat
of Lopades by rape.
Vranius sire of every thing,
than whom of larger shape
Was Atlas not, nor yet the fierce
Enceladus so strong,
Nor gorbellied Typheus huge,
nor all the Giants long,
That ever earth did yet bring up.
Nine heads him nature toke,
Whereof the highest is void of eyes,
and Westward styll doth loke.
Gaynward the East the other stand,
above a thousand eyes
The second hath, and on a piece
doth al the rest suffice.
His right hand Northward out he casts
the left to South he sends,
With both his hands ye world he metes,
his feet the flock of fendes
Doth touch, his head the skies doth rech,
a shepherd rich in deed
Above al men, of every flock
through al the earth to feed,
He puts them out, the number would
of them exceed, if not
That monster Pamphagus his son
with greedy ravening throat
Should them devour continually
with Attropos his wife.
This Venus now Vranius got,
and ioynde in wedlock life
To one Pedogenes a God,
and bad they should increase.
This is that Venus, without whom
the use of earth would cease:
And al the world with briars thick
unseemly should be thought.
Her God hath ordeynd, that she might
the loss which nature brought
Full recompense, which God appoints,
that hurtful can not be.
What then of them shall I report
content with chastity
That fair increase do not esteem.
but void of issue die,
And leave no signs of them behind (...)
they sin assuredly.
And if the truth may here be said,
unworthy birth him gives
Nature, of whom not one is borne
unworthy eke he lives
By whom another hath no life.
Yet they whom sickness let.
Or other means do them constrain
no children for to get,
Oppressed with cursed poverty,
do fear that they shall see:
Their children beg, intend saints life
of whom but few there be.
Let them refrain, good leave they have
but many will no wife,
That they may others efte defile,
and lead a lechours life.
And for because that more they might
the common sort beguile,
Under pretence they give them selves
to sacred things a while,
And churches haunt, and priests of God
they counted are to be.
They diverse laws garments strange
do use, and think to see
The heavens hie with scraped crown,
clean things the beasts do fly,
And after things unclean they run,
while as the panche they ply,
And give themselves to drowsy reast,
which both do foster vice.
Stale Virgins are they thought to be
while close they cast the dise,
The dark night al in vice to spend,
their minds they whole apply.
None truly use a Virgins life,
but such as come thereby:
When crooked old vnlusty age,
or sickness lore them fret.
Or restless payne of carking mind:
or gift of God then let.
Al overplus from out the corps
doth nature clean expel.
Hereof it comes that in night dreams
sometimes doth Venus dwell,
In dreams that show the joyful art
and pleasant sporte in deed.
Let them more chaste than Sibels be,
or Nuns of Uestal weed.
Of two which worthier is I ask
esteemed for to be,
The barren bows that frutelesse fade
or else the fertile tree?
The ground that gives good increase,
or sand where nothing grows?
O thoughts of men of none effect,
O fond and foolish vows,
Apply your selves not to despise
the sacred natures hest
Which wold the bred should breed again
which made such joyful rest,
In wedlock bed thee not to fear,
but rather to allure,
Why wilt thou nature thus withstand
no hurt in Venus lure
There is, if her thou lawful use
with mean, and not excess.
But to much used she strength abates,
and drowns the valiantness:
Destroys the wit, and shortneth life.
Now must we here display
dame Venus soon whose force doth cause
both man and God obey.
Who brond withal, and quivered shafts
makes all the world afraid.
To whom (though yet a boy, and blind)
hath every thing obeyed,
That earth, or sea did ever breed,
or heavens hie contain.
O Lord what rage of flames, and fire
in every place to rain
This boy hath caused? what force haste ye
O quivered Cupide now?
No strength thy power may once resist,
thy conquest makes to bow
Both beast and Man, and Gods above,
with darts of thine alone.
(His heart through pearcd) full oft hath made
the thundering God to groan:
And diverse shapes on him to take
his lightning laid a side.
(And region left of starry skies)
on wretched soil to slide
Hath not disdained, sometime the form
of Egle swift to bear,
Sometime, a bull with frowuing face,
sometimes a shepherds cheer
On him to put, sometime to seem
a snake, and now, and than
With flames to come, in Satires shape:
now gold, now like a swan.
Neptunus also once ychanged
to fluddes of Enepey,
While he poor wretch thy dart did feel
with Salmonide he lay.
And oft a Dolphin would he seem,
a Ram, or Horse to be.
With all the seas he could not quench
the flames that burnt by thee,
In breast so blind, and heart of him,
a tale to long it were,
Like acts of all the Gods, to show
to thee in order here.
How Phebus did a hawk become
and eke a Lion kende:
Or call to mind the wood attempts
of raging Tartares fend,
But vain it is so time to spend:
for if I should expound
The Lords, and Ladies euerychone,
whom cruel love did wound,
My tale would run to much at large,
and down (before) would hide
His glistering beams sir Titan bright,
the smoking wheels should slide,
Amid the washing western waives.
But here I think it best
Such things to have, since many men
have plainly them expressed.
And now the truth we will declare,
this boy did never flow
From Bacchus rains, as Greece did fain
no sure: if it were so,
Each man that hates wine, should love
but destny him begot:
Because in every kind of love
this destny knittes the knot.
All morttall things, this destiny rules:
she doth to all bestow
Conditions eke with fortune to,
and end of life doth know.
Of greater force than beauty is
this destiny assured.
Though beauty cause of burning flame
hath lovers linckes procured:
Of greater might than gold it is
though once with gold did bye
Old Saturnes son, inclosde in towers
with Danae fair to lie.
Familiar sight, and licence had
full oft to talk, and live
Together both, when none shall see
which sliding way doth give,
By which to love we in do come,
by which is Venus got.
All this can nothing sure preuaile:
if destnies favour not.
By destny ioinde, by destny broke,
the lovers knot, and ring.
By this the vile deformed slave
sometimes obtains the thing,
Which rich, nor fair can have: by this
the fair and gentle wife
Is of her husband left despised:
and more contents his life
A ragged jade, in house to keep.
By this the wife disdains
Her husband fair, of gentle blood
and greater joy sustaines
A lither lousy lout to have,
or unacquainted wight.
And if so be that love were not
by Gods advisement right
To every man appointed here,
by limits parted just:
No doubt of all might one be loved,
and on them all should lust,
And every man might safe enjoy
the Damsel that he likes,
But as the fisher doth not take
the fishes all in dikes:
Nor foulers all the birds do catch,
nor hunters all do kill,
But every one his chance doth take,
obtains and hath his will,
So, love to every one is dealt
by Gods arbitrament.
So doth the servant base full oft
his Lady well content.
So shall the burst bleared lout,
and crooked father old
A blissful girl to wife obtain.
For as the Merchant bold,
That vnderneth unhappy star
with wares his ship doth freight,
And cuts the fearful fouring seas,
is often spoiled of weight
By lost of ship, or Pirates fierce:
so he that flames with love,
The stars, luck against him both:
doth seek the rocks to move.
An evil name, and cruel wound,
receives he again.
And ef^e his love to get, doth he
the loss of life sustain.
But he, whom destnies favour well,
and fortune smiles upon,
His heart, and joy may soon obtain
with quiet rest anon.
But sure of few this grace is had,
so good are Gods to few:
Except such one as close doth keep
his joys that none them know.
No trust there is at al in man
disceytes are used vile,
Now every man doth practise howe
his fellow to beguile.
If any man unto his friend
his secretes doth disclose.
Then must he stand in fear of him
least he his friendship lose:
Least he in angry mood reveal
that erst in heart he hydes
If free, therefore thou seek to be,
and safe to live besides.
Let no man know thy secrete deeds:
thy friend have always so
While friendship lasts, that thou foresee
he once may be thy foe.
Which thing in proof hath left ben known,
for few such friends we see
That always love: and much herein
ought envy feared to be.
Which ever strives the happy chance
with poison fell to stain.
Take heed therefore of envy sirs,
I warn you lovers plain.
Let no man know thy mind in love,
but hide this love of thine,
(If wit thou hast) and let not thou
thy fire forth to shine.
A monster vile is envy sure,
a plague that rages fell,
A deadly hurt, than which a worse
is hard to find in Hell.
It hunts virtue in every place,
good deeds asunder tears.
Good men she hates, and doth disdain
the haps of others years.
Although no man can well keep close
his own unfeigned love,
If Fates against him let, and nyll
the envious lights above,
Small force in wit of man there is,
where Gods do not agree.
In vain he toils that seeks ought,
when Gods against him be.
Yet ought we not for this to leave
our wills and wits to strain:
For he that hath the race forth run,
and palm cannot obtain,
Is worthy praise: and envy all
upon the Gods he lays:
Who often good men down have put,
and fools exaiting raise.
A happy man is he to whom,
from tower of heavens, grace
Is granted, who God guides himself,
whose birth with lucky face
The happy stars have shined upon,
to him comes joyful love:
And void of woe, long sweetness he
with pleasant life may prove
For love is daynty, sweet, and mild,
if destnye cause not payne:
Whose darts, the man that never felt,
doth senseless styll remain.
What beast might ever yet be found,
that felt not Cupids flame?
All creatures vile, and base we see
have tasted of the same:
God willing so. Wherefore who seeks
this love, a thing divine
He seeks: for if the king, and Lord
of all the world, should not
All things created here retain
in loves assured knot,
The world should straight be at an end,
and the elements decay.
That each man loves he keeps, and it
defends eke always.
But no man seeks the thing to keep
that he sets nothing by.
Wherefore the order of all things
shall last continually.
For, everlasting is the love
of God, that all doth guide.
Though all things made do fall and fade,
the kinds yet never stide.
For those the blessed God doth love,
but not the bodies so.
Whereof the cruel death hath power,
for no man suffers tho
The thing he loves to perish quite,
if he can it defend.
But who denies? God all thing can.
and he can them defend.
But be the bodies doth not love,
wherefore he lets them die:
But not the kinds he so permits
from their estate to (...).
What doth the potter care if this,
or that his pot be burst,
Turning the wheel, and chalk in hand
despises now the first?
A newer sort of them he makes
now over all this same.
The sky, the ground, the seas and air,
and raging fierce flame,
And eke in fine, the world it self
(by loves enduring knot)
So many years doth stand and last,
for if this love were not:
The elaments altogether would
with burst bonds go fight:
Nor down to earth, the Heavens would
show forth their blissful light,
And beams so warm, no seed should grow
and eke the fiery flame
This air his neighbor, would consume,
he would, but out of frame,
His shores on earth yt air put down,
full bare would seem each soil,
The seas should quench the ^er quite,
or rather fire boyle,
And waste away the fyshy seas,
As once, when Phaeton ruled not well
the fyry foaming beasts,
(I dreading sore the monsters hie,)
his own good fathers heastes
Believing not, unhappy wretch
was drowned in his desire.
Then al the world therewith began
to burn with blazing fire.
Till he by force of lightning smytte
came tumbling headlong down,
And in the floods his flames did quench.
Love breeds in every town
Assured peace, peace worthiest is
of al things here we see.
In time of peace do al things grow,
and al things lively be.
Then live men safe, in safety ^ke
the travailing wight he stands,
And takes his journey void of harm
and scapes the robbers hands.
Then buzzing Bees in hives be kept
by good advise and care,
And beasts in pastures fat are fed,
the ground is torn with share,
And yields far increase in time,
then plenty bears the sway:
In bread, and milk and noppy drink,
then every where they play.
The sounding shaume doth the provoke
to dance, the Thiase round:
But idiotes, none do envy peace,
and covet Martial ground.
Such times did flow when Saturn ruled
his Empire here alone:
O worthy age more worth than Gold,
but now O grief to moan.
All things doth discord vile disturb,
with raged motion mad:
And filles and fears every place,
with broiling tumult sad.
Now fierce we forced are to be,
all laws with sword to slake:
The furies al of hell they swarm,
a thousand brondes they shake
A thousand snakes withal, and move
the proud hie minded Kings:
And common people mad to be,
what good to you it brings?
(O wretches mad) your death to haste,
with battes, and bylbowe blade:
To late when as she never comes,
but mischefe this hath made
That plaguy pride and hunger mad,
dominion for to have:
O dust, what makes thee proud to be,
whose stinking guts in grave
The filthy worms anon shall tear,
why seek thou for gold?
Thinkste thou for ever here to live?
O wretch, O wretch, bi hold,
How vain, how short, how fleets soon
dur life before thine eyes?
A grave anon shall close contain,
thy bones, and shall suffic^.
And if so be that love should knit,
the hearts of men in one:
This would not be, for every man,
his friend would tend upon.
And all men for their parts would aid
the friend that they hold dear:
Assuredly, nothing more good,
nor sweater doth appear.
Than truly while we here do live,
of many loved to be:
A safe defence are always friends,
against adversity.
The mind in deubtful things they ease,
and helpers seek to be:
Thy cares and loss they lighten much,
they weep and whale with thee.
But seldom perishes the man,
that thus is rich in friends.
When fortune laughs upon thy luck,
and happy chance thee sends:
With thee thy profyts they embrace,
with thee they joyful be:
With friendship they thy haps increase,
and feast in mirth with thee.
Who list therefore to lead his life,
in safety, and in joy:
Great store of friends for to retain,
let him his care employ.
By many means this thing is got,
which (as I can) I shall
Declare: but now to know,
is needful first of all,
Which love the people call of mind,
a motion for to be:
For well to will it is the same:
that men call love we see.
The mind always it self desires,
the good thing for to prove:
And seeks the evil for to shun,
these (...) alone her move.
These two therefore the causes be,
and loves assured ground:
But good in three divided is,
whereof one part is found
Delighting for to be,
the other honest eke appears:
The third utility.
So likewise, ill in three we part,
first hurtful we esteem:
The second vile deformed is,
the third doth grievous seem.
Who so that loves, refusing these,
or else desiring those:
He loves, love diverse is, like as
the spring from whence it flows.
Not worthy praised like to be,
nor worthy like dispraise:
Nor only differ three foresaid,
in general kind always.
But diverse special kinds himself,
doth each of these contain:
Which kinds when as they diverse be,
make diverse loves again.
What so ever aids, that profit is,
but is not yet as one:
Much goods upon the body wayght,
and much the soul upon.
Strength, beauty, health, activity,
these four the body owes:
These things whatsoever creature gives
from them the profit flows.
Two goods again the soul contains
as manners mild, and Art:
Like as the soul hath virtues two,
the will, to whom the part
Of manners all, belong, and mind,
to whom the truth to know
It proper is, and from the mind,
like diverse goods do flow.
The learnings nine this mind adourn,
which Poets Muses call:
Equivalent to circles nine,
that roll above us all.
The will doth diverse goods possess,
of which these four excel:
Wit, justice eke, and virtue strong,
that conquers troubles fell.
With her that bridles eke our minds,
and modesty doth bring:
From these, as from the fountain first
do al the other spring.
Which whosoever seeks to know,
let him go toss the book:
Of Stagerite, or (if he list)
in Platoes works go loke.
Which two are lights to all the world,
whatsoever then it be:
Such like to us that gives, that term
may profitable we.
As to the body medcine is,
and eke the physic leach:
And to the mind the book likewyse,
is master that doth teach.
But those that profits the soul,
more profitable be:
And better eke because it is,
of greater dignity.
As is the master than the man,
the shipman than the ship:
Than is the cart is he that holds,
the clashing carters whip.
But by delay, or out of hand,
doth profit us each thing:
As to the hungered man the gold,
and he that gold doth bring.
The coke, and eke the fode it self,
the like I do declare
Of pleasing goods in diverse parts,
divided is their share.
Of which the body some do please,
and some the soul delight:
But yet the pleasures of the soul,
he always more of might
And common eke to Gods, and us,
whereas the bodies joy:
As granted unto brutish beasts,
to them a proper roy.
Not lawful unto them it is,
with joys of soul to mell:
Nor have they all the senses five,
and only know they well.
What taste and sense of featling means
they music nought esteem:
No sweet perfumes with princely smell,
to them doth pleasant seem.
Regard they ought the painted lines,
of fine Appelles hand:
Or muse they on the brazen plate,
of comely Corinthes land?
Or wonder they the sight to see,
of shooting Circus game?
If ought they smell, if tune or sight,
them please, it is the same
That ^aste, or feeling makes, as when
the Lion fierce doth spy,
In fields by chance a cow, he leaps,
and lifts his maine on hye.
And twines and twirls his twisting taste
desrous of his pray:
Or when the fomey horse beholds,
the gadding mare astray.
With hauty head upheld he runs,
and here and there he kicks:
And leaps hedge and ditch abroad,
while lusty guts him pricks.
And causes all the skies above,
with hineying noise to shrike:
When meat therefore, and gendring act,
the beasts do chiefest like.
And sith to them it proper is,
it is therefore most vile:
And fit for villains to possess,
fine wit it doth erile.
To often used, it body hurts,
who therefore this obayes:
Is made a fool and for to serve,
is apter eke always.
Than over others for to rule,
but use them moderately:
And if thou minded art to know,
the goods of honesty.
Remember what before I said,
for of the mind they be:
The manners mild, and learning eke,
as I declard to thee.
But give good ear what I shall say,
those goods that do delight
While as they last, do pleasant seem,
and after of no might.
Example for, behold the joys,
of song and Uenus play:
But that that brings the body good,
that profits men do say.
The goods thereof be pleasant eke,
as health obtained doth please:
So profits it again we see,
that heals each disease.
And that that causes goods of mind,
we well may profit name:
But these, as soon as they be got,
then pleasant are the same.
And honest out of hand they be,
for all that virtue brings:
Doth profit much, and dealt her self,
above all other things.
She pleases most, and honest is,
her just reward and hire:
Is honour only due to her,
therefore who doth desire.
Much love, while he here lives to have,
let either him devise:
To please or profyt them he loves,
or else in any wise,
Let him have virtues good in store,
the which the dogged sort
Shall force and eke constrain to give,
a praise and good report.
Whom though they hate yet shall they fear
and first of all he must:
Of those whom he doth seek to please,
mark all the manners just.
For all men's wills do not agree,
nor all their studies one:
Such seeds unlike dame nature sows,
engendering us upon.
The one doth hate that tother loves,
that one doth most dispraise:
The other lifts above the Skies,
whereof appears always,
That each love al things not a like,
nor al men do desire:
One good that profits, like to have,
nor honest like require.
Wherefore we first of all must learn,
what pleases best his brain:
To whom we seek, lest else perchance
we labour all in vain.
In doing things of them unliked,
this is not hard to know:
The talk assuredly declares,
the deeds from them that flow
And hidden heart, al men talk most,
of that they most do love:
And most attentive are thereto,
full many things that prove.
His love at home may left be spied,
the plowman holds at home
The plow, the goad, the yoke, the rake,
the spade to temper loom.
The Knight his fearful armour hath,
that hangs at home full by:
So he whose house with books abounds
a student rightfully,
May deemed be: and this I say
of every other man:
The hand and tong declares the heart,
such things as pleases than.
Who seeks friends let him perform,
for fawning love doth get:
But most men yet do gape for gain,
and all men's hearts are set
On gold, and gifts and many friends,
by gifts obtained be.
But sure such love endures not,
for when that gain doth flee:
Then fails friendship, chiefly then
when hope to have, is gone:
But some there be (though few of them)
that styll remain as one.
And mindful eke of friendship showed,
do never cease to love:
But grant the vnthankfuls frendshyp fail,
it doth not yet behove.
The good and friendly man to leave,
(who may as rare be found:
As Phoenix bird in all the world,
that breeds in Arabs ground)
To profyt many men, and aid,
with all his power the same:
This way to heaven only leads,
by this obtaynd the game
Great Hercules, and many more,
whose worthy fames remain:
As yet with us, whom never age,
can cause to die again.
The gentle and the liberal man,
is like to God above:
Great sorts of men again there be,
delighting things that love.
Whereby such men they most esteem,
that pleasant things do bring:
And chiefly children, youth, and such
as are of great living
Do covet joys, and pleasures seek,
but such love is not true:
For when that pleasure once is gone,
then frendships eke adieu.
Yet sometimes sure it profyts much,
and many get thereby:
Riches, and many favour get,
therefore let him apply
His mind, to please who friendship seeks
(so he go not astray:
From bonds of right and honesty,
but each man profyt may)
And pleasure eke two sundry ways,
by words and dede beside:
But safer eke and easier it is,
such friendship to provide
By words, than deeds, but now tis best
for to declare the way:
By which it may be brought to pass,
which thing perform you may.
If wholesome counsel thou dost give,
and warning hurt declare,
And teach how profyt may be got,
of evil to beware:
In praying Gods to send them health,
and send them well to fare.
In asking grateful things, for them
in whom consists thy care.
If thou desyrest any man,
with words for to delight,
Of him, and eke of all his things,
do praises thou resight.
And if he ever any act
performed worthy prays,
Commend it much, for wisemen now,
and fools at all assays
Would praised be, sometime again,
with sweet, and pleasant stile
Delight that tentiue ears of theirs,
provoking them to smile.
Or telling of some pleasant tale,
though new, or old it be
(If it be worth declaring) tell
some worthy history.
If thou perceives any thing
that doth his mind delight
In any case, dispraise it not,
but say the crow is white.
And if thy conscience be so straight
thou dare not say so much,
Then hold thy tong, say never a word,
for now the time is such,
That wisdom great it is to fain,
(as true the people say)
He cannot live that knows not how
with both his hands so play.
Sometime, believe me, now it hurts
the truth for to defend,
The place, the people, and the time
in mind do thou perpend,
That nought thee hurt. But some there be
that rather love to praise
A man behind his back, and take
the same for better ways.
They do but well such kind of praise
more thank deserves sure:
Unfeigned eke and vnsuspect*
it seems to be more pure.
For some do use to cousin men
when as they present be:
True friends whereby they might be thought*
whom when they absent se
With bifyng words they laugh to scorn,
best is it to reject
Such clawing gestes, it is the use
of Gnatoes fawning sect.
Not few again at least, some one
such merchant shalt thou find:
That all things will abroad declare
that issued from thy mind.
Such praying mates tnow there be
he speaks much good (saith he:)
And doth commend your maystership,
of him dispraysde you be.
In few words now the truth to say,
nothing doth more delight:
All kind of men, than manners good,
and life lead all upright.
Of greater force than riches, this,
or learning eke it seems:
Though evil men be learned, or rich,
yet no man them estemes.
Nothing more odious is, than vice,
but if thou honest be:
And good, al men shall thee embrace,
at least (I think) none thee
Will hate. A sentence old it is,
that manners like in all:
And study like is it (they say)
that love is fed withal.
So merry it is when knaves be met,
so learned with learned remain:
So haunt al kind of beasts their herd,
I speak not this again.
For how can they be joined in love,
whose minds contrary be:
When one thing for to will and hate,
friends use it is we see?
Love lastes not lunge in wicked men,
fools friendship lastes not long.
For private wealth that ill men seek
by right and ^ke by wrong.
And cruel lust to harm and hurt
that ill men all possess:
With pride, and wrath together both
the friends of folyshnesse
Makes fuming humours rage abroad,
and joins them by the ea^es.
That only love endures long,
whose root dame virtue beats,
Which honesty engendered hath,
this only knittes the hearts:
Of godly ^ke and faithful men,
with love that never parts.
And more it is to be estemde,
Than is the love of kind:
By which the father loves the son,
and eke with loving mind.
^he other k^smen do embrace,
for children e^yn hate:
Their parents dear, and fathers e^
have grudgd the childes estate.
The brother hath been scene (er this)
to work the brothers wyl^:
But never true Dresses yet,
did Pylades beguile.
Nor Pylades Dre^ to aid,
did death esteem there while.
But here it comes in question, if
by any means we can:
Procure the love of euerychone,
the good, and evil man.
For lone in many parts disperst^
is weaker every howre:
In few of greater force it is,
in two of greatest power.
Denided thus in many parte^
it vanishes away:
Who byddes secke not to many mates,
do therefore truly say.
For harde it is to line among
so great a company:
With them as it doth friends become,
eke conversant to be.
For fixed faith denies her self,
with many for to dwell:
With few her self the doth content,
wherefore believe thou well.
Thou shalt not many faithful find,
love not in any wise:
The common sort: nor seek their love,
for discord thence doth rise.
And pleasant peace with few remains,
the common press forsake:
Of pressing men with troubles, they
their troublous name do take.
A few, and good choose thou thy self,
with whom to lead thy life:
By many years in safe thou maiste,
and also void of strife.
Like as therefore, thou can not love,
so many fervently:
So, can thou not of such a sort,
be loved faithfully.
For who so loves not for troth,
is worthy of no love:
A civil common love there is,
wherewith it doth behove.
The common sort to love, with which
each good, and evil man:
We ought assuredly to love,
which is performed than.
When as we no mans hurt procure
by words, or else by acts:
When as we lead our life that none
may well control our facts.
When we to all men curteyse be,
and eke with friendly fare:
Do them salute with honours dew,
and praising them ^brace.
But yet, at first it doth ^ehoue
with few to lead thy life:
If thou dost^ seek (...) peace to live,
and (...) from foolish ^:
Them (...) shun whom ^ght thou knows:
it can not be perdye.
That we in thorns, and thistles tread.
and escape (...) thereby:
Nor care thou not a whyt, if that
the wicked love not thee:
Think it enough if he not hate,
no shalt thou hated be.
If thou from them do stand aloof,
such hur^eth not the snake.
But if, sometime it doth thee please.
the company to take.
Of tag, and rag, and neighbor John,
let tongue in silence dwell:
And take good herd what thing you say,
and alwa^es ha^ken well.
And seldom speak, i^ is the sign
of one, whose head is light:
So much to pra^e, be ef^ o^ndes
that so ^oth words resight.
But such as rare, and wisely speak,
des^ue the chiefest praise:
And in the pru^t mouth it is
a goodly gift always.
Speak ill of none behind their ba^ke,
no yet before their face:
Let this the chiefest warning be,
and ^ule of chief^st place.
Nor pr^e not thou to no intent,
nor idle words let ^all:
For then shall each man laugh at thee,
and eke a fool thee call
If thou shalt answer any man,
or if thou question find:
Before thou speak in any case,
record it in thy mind
For when it once is ^edde from thee,
thou can it not retain:
The word that once is flown abroad,
can not come home again
A goodly thing, also it is
in talk to tell sometime:
The pithy sense of aged laws,
and ancient poets ^me*
And now and then examples sound*
in worthy stories old:
Do give the talk a greater grace
if they ^lude, so told.
Always therefore, it needful is
on diverse books to reed:
And, as the Bees now there now here,
on sondry flowers to feed.
Expel thou anger far from thee
away with pride that elf:
Such kind of men cannot be loved,
and always show thy self.
Of gentle mind, and lowly eke,
so shalt thou all men please:
If any man thy hurt procure,
prove thou, him to appease.
Rather with wit, than furious mode,
to wit doth strength give place:
She conqueresse doth all things tame
the Tigers stout in pace.
And Lyons fierce by art are won:
and ships in seas do swim:
And towers strong by art doth bear
the Oliphant on him.
By this the Bull doth bear the yoke
and horse with spouting might:
By this constrained is to bear,
the bridle, and the knight.
Wit all things rules with aide of force,
to threaten much with cracks,
Is cowards guise, women's strength
to men belongs facts.
The wise man doth dissemble hurt,
the valiant prates no white,
But when he sees the time then dare
he do that shall seem fytte.
First take good heed that none you hurt,
and if by injury.
Thou harmed art, when thou see time
revenge it rightfully.
If thou can not let grief a while
within thy heart remain,
Least that by foolish bosting words,
thou may more harm sustain:
It is naughty playing with edged toles
the wise man will refrain:
And spy his time, and eke give place
his foe with words to train.
That pleasant seem, and fawnings eke
till he him bring to snare:
So wins the wild vnrulye colt
the witty horseman ware.
So on the Oxens neck the yokes,
the plowman puts on:
So Lyons fierce the Charret draws
that Cibell syttes upon.
So (tigers wood) you do obey
to Bachus bridell rains.
Great wit it is to conquer thus,
and hide the inward pains.
Till time convenient come, therefore
this must be marked beside.
Whersoeuer thou remain, let not
thy mouth be stretched to wide,
With laughings loud, but when need is
then laugh thou moderately:
It doth declare a simple wit,
to laugh excessively.
And on the other side, it is
not fit for any man:
Always in dumps to be, therefore
fly thou them both, and than.
The middle keep, there virtue sits,
no gester would I thee:
And yet, if that thou can, I would
that pleasant thou should be.
Enough (me thinks) I have now said,
my message here doth end:
For which, to thee, my mother me
from heaven hie did send.
Now time comaundes to leave ye earth,
and skies above to clime:
From whence I wonted am the earth,
to se full many a time.
Musing that it so little seems,
and round as any ball:
Amid the air to see it hang,
having no stay at all.
Sustainde only with his poise.
the sea doth eke appear
About the earth full serpent like
to crangle here and there.
And like a little brooke to run,
here eke I do behold.
The Padus Tanais, Ganges and
that Histre waters cold.
As oft as showers do cause the dikes
with wet to overflow:
And when thy mouths alofe I see
(O Nilus then I trow.)
They be (though great in dede they are)
but seven gutters small.
And hence I view the bloody broils
with shining swords that fall.
And fields be sprent with purple blood,
And foolish kings thereby:
Who (while they covet more to have
and never think to die.)
With dire debate do battles bring
the guiltless souls to kill:
And show the Gods a gazing grief
repugnant to their will.
And there I se their places change
both rivers, springs, and floods
Hills fall to dales, and dales to hills,
and place (where once grew woods)
With coulter ^lde, and whereas plowes
before have run their race,
Their woods to grow, transformed cowns
and al things changing place.
He blessed is that may the like
prospect to this obtain:
Where Asia, and Affricke he may see,
and Europ eke again.
That swells with wealth, wepons eke,
and diverse nations strong:
That there do dwell, who Cancer burns
the Ethiops them among.
Cilicians fierce, and Tartars turks
and men of Scithians ground.
The shoting Parthes, Arabians eke
where franckinsence is found.
The Thracians wild, and Arimaspes
those valiant men in fight:
The french, the Italian, men of Spain
the dreadful English wight.
As many people more beside,
on whom the sun doth shine,
While he above, or under goes,
the horisontall line.
Wouldes thou not hither will to come,
if it might lawful be,
For any mortal man to do:
if body let not thee.
But this can hap to none, but us
whose bodies framed were:
Of finest air, and not of earth,
a while therefore forbear.
Till death thy soul shall lose fro bonds,
and till that time a dew,
I go, this said, and answering I
away from me he flew.
In haste he flies with swifter course
than winds themselves my thought
And spreading wings abroad the skies
with course again he caught.
The fithe Book entitled Leo.
I Seek not here Arabians wealth,
nor stones of value hie:
That red seas breed, no golden sands
in Tagus streams that lie.
Nor people proud to govern here
with sceptred hand and mace:
Such things my luck hath me denied,
nor once I wail the case.
That destiny hath not given me such,
so even the nought as good:
May like obtain to reap the gold
of wealthy riches flood.
Full oft we see rhunworthy heads
of witless people crowned:
Whose bodies eke are trun bedecked
with robes of purple rownde.
Those things I would the Lord of all,
on me would here bestow:
Which neither fools nor wicked men
may ever hap to know.
That makes a perfect man in deed
and ne'er to saints above:
O mighty Jove what is the cause,
or what should thee thus move,
Wisdom to none or few to give?
in every place we see:
Both pleasant, fair, and lusty brutes,
and wealthy men to be.
But vneth may the place be found,
in all the world so wide:
That brings forth such any one
in whom doth wit abide.
Dost thou perchate more worthy think,
a guide of fools to be:
More noble is that power, under
the which more noble be.
For worthier it is assertainly
to rule by force of powers:
Both castles strong, and fortresses
with large and ample towers.
Than Lord of fold and flock to be,
and droves of beasts to guide:
Perhaps thou dost it to that end
our doings to deride.
And make man thy laughing stock,
for nothing else to be:
The life of men on earth doth seem
the staged comedy.
And as the Ape that counter feits,
to us doth laughter move:
So we like wise do cause and move
the saints to laugh above.
As oft as stately steps we tread
with look of proud disdain:
As oft as riches we to much
do crane or honours grain.
As oft as we like Saunder snuff,
our selves do brag and boste.
What less is it, what part is played,
when holding honours most.
With sceptred hand, a crowned owl
an Ass of stature fair:
Of them beholden is to sit
a loft in stately chair.
Despising every other man
though he be like in case:
Desiring yet to hear the sound,
of God preserve your grace.
And to be duckd and knelde unto
and have them kiss his feet.
Nor sees the mad man what he is
how vain and apt to fleet:
Like water bleb and thistle down,
that flies in every place:
I am no such, nor seek I do
to live in such a case.
But you O Gods above that dwell,
and blessed are alone:
That live in everlasting joy,
if case you think upon.
The cries of mortal sinners here
and if you not despise.
The humane prayers that we pour,
and tears of wretched eyes:
I you beseech to grant me here,
a pure and perfet mind,
By which the truth I always may
from falshode aptly find.
And virtue eke from vice discern
least I as void of wit,
Should fly the things yt I should haunt
and follow things unfit.
For if so be it may pertain
to any mortal man:
To line as thus in blessed case,
by this means think I than.
That I may blessed be. But sure
I am therein deceived:
And with me also are all these
that have the same believed.
For no man ever happy was
nor ever yet shall be:
Not though the goods of all the world
in hand possessed he.
Nor though he did in wit excel.
but some perchance will doubt:
Except my leaves by reason strong
do bolt the matter out.
Park thou therefore this present book^
that seek this to know:
According as they best can do
my verses thee shall show.
Your sacred doors (my muses sweet)
set wide and open here:
To me your Prophet and refresh
my mind with waters clear.
Of Parnas hills, which sore I thyrst:
disclose your secrete ways.
Show me the truth, for well you know
what hath been done in days.
Of alder time, and presently,
and what shall eke ensue:
Now first of all I will declare,
with name and not untrue.
Whom we ought happy for to call,
then will I touche the thing:
Whereto the God Appollo hie,
by wisdom shall me bring.
I say therefore that only he
can have the name of blessed
Who hath the chiefest good in hand
now presently possessed.
But all men this not truly know
when each one beff doth deem:
The thing ye most his mind doth please,
the ass doth more esteem.
And mule, the barley grain, than birt
that deinty dish of meat:
Than flesh of fender thrushes sod,
than loins of Hares to eat.
So gold the greedy snudge doth wish,
and always praise for best:
Which honours thinks thambitions man
and milksop, Uenus nest.
Howe few alas the truth may know,
what mist of errors blind:
Our judgements hide, because that few
have now a perfect mind?
Each man doth judge, each man speaks
according to his will:
Of their own selves some things are good
which never can be ill
And never varme, so good there are,
not of themselves that be:
Which sometime help and eke beside,
do sometime harm we see.
These are the bodies outward gifts,
use makes them good or nought:
As if a man his country save,
by strength, this strength is thought
Then good to be, but if he harm,
the guiltless innocent:
And with this strength his country war
then now incontinent,
This strength shall couted be for ill,
like sentence I declare:
Of riches, honours, eke of rule
and all things else that are.
The owner left such goods destroy,
although he use them well:
So hurts the Bees their honey sweet,
so makes the Beaver yell.
His hoystring wax, like rivers stream,
they fade and fleet beside:
And doubtfully in error pass,
and never certain bide.
Not therefore they be chiefest goods,
nor who se doth abound:
With such may counted be to have,
a happy life then found.
But rather if the truth be said,
those goods imperfect be:
which unto us do profyt bring,
and hurt in like degree.
For else might poison good be iudgd,
that sometime health us brings:
And nothing should be counted ill,
among all worldly things.
When as nothing so hurtful is,
but sometime helps again:
But those that of themselves be good,
and always good remain.
Doth make the happy man in dede,
but what these goods now be:
All men knows not, with reason sharp,
therefore them seek must we.
Minerua granting grace, and some,
these things perchance will say:
Is nothing hard to know, sith them,
both chance and corpse denay.
Then must they needs be good of mind
that makes us blessed alone:
This bolt of theirs is well bestowed,
but mark they have touched none.
First must we common things declare,
our purpose show that may:
Like as the torch amid the dark,
doth show the gadlings way.
work, working, or the man that works
in every kind of thing:
The work it self an end we grant,
and him as beginning
That works we take the middle eke
the working for (...) ^ee:
Now which of these more worthy is,
becomes us to see.
Each thing that moves doth far excel,
the moved thing thereby:
This plain apears, the end doth move
the workman certainly.
For what is he takes ought in hand,
but he before perpend:
And in his mind do full conceive,
thereof the final end?
The end therefore more noble is,
that working eke beside:
Is much more base than is the end,
by reason like is tried.
Hereof we must conjecture needs,
the chiefest good to be:
A certain end, but every end,
is not of best degree.
But only that which is the end,
of every other end:
To which the other ends have all
recourse as floods descend.
Together all in roaring seas,
for reason would that so:
Unto the sure and perfect thing,
thunperfect things should go.
And for to come to better state,
because it is more base:
No otherwise could well be kept,
good order in this case.
That thing therefore that is the last,
and end of all the rest:
That needs must be the perfectst good,
the chiefest and the best.
Again of every kind of thing,
contaynde in compass round:
Of all the world some having life,
some void of life be found.
But those that life retain, excel
the bodies life without:
Then whatsoever is chiefest good,
must live ensewes no dout.
Of things that live, some reason want,
and have no speech to use:
The rest have speech and reason both,
and them we best do choose.
The chiefest good therefore hath speech,
and reason perfect tried:
Of those that reason have, great part,
their lives in pleasure slide.
And part again their lives consume,
in labours great and payne:
But of them both their state is best,
that pleasant life retain.
We must needs (Ergo) think the life,
of chiefest good, most sweet:
Of those that live most pleasantly,
some part away do flete
Ju little time, and some again,
remain for longer days:
They that continue longest age,
their state for best we praise.
The longest time therefore doth live,
the chiefest good of all:
Whom thundering Jone great Jehoue
wont mortal men to cal.
He shakes with fearful noise ye flames,
and flashing lightnings fell:
Black storms he sends with thuders roar
he makes the skies to yell.
Unbindes the blasts and sets them forth
that makes the seas to roar:
That drives the foaming floods with force,
unto the rattling shore.
And shakes encldsde in caves the earth,
whereby comes tumbling down:
The buildings byg of every bower,
and strength of every town.
But some perchance do doubt if God,
whom we chief good do call:
An end may be, sith we have told
before that end of all
A framed thing must be, and here,
this end to have we say:
Beginning and a midst thereto,
which all men will denay.
He always was and styll shall live,
no end to him can be:
All things he made, and of no man,
was ever framed he.
Before him nothing could be seen,
nothing can after bide:
This doubt with answer for to loose,
lo thus I do provide.
The workman first and maker hero
of all the world and all
Things in the same contained clear
this same we God do call.
The end of all the world likewyse,
and all thing in the same:
Him God that guides the stars above,
him god we also name.
Yet lawful therefore is it not,
a work to think this same.
For every end is not a work,
his mind that work doth frame.
Seeks not the work alone to make,
but farther doth intend:
As he that frames a chest doth not
his pains and labour spend
The chest alone to make, but for
some other cause it frame,
As something for to keep therein,
or else to sell the same.
More worthy ever is the end
the later it doth fall:
And worser things to better drive,
so God is end of all.
To whom each either thing contends,
for whom the world doth stand:
And all things eke therein that be,
and for himself his hand
Created al, and not for us,
as some sir Johns do say,
That call and bawl in every church,
and lead pore souls astray.
With words they doltes of Dawcockes make
what cause, what wit of ours?
What nobleness, what goodness is
contaynd within our powrs.
For which the world so vast should frame
so great a prince as he:
We all are full of fylthy vice,
and fools we also be.
Scarce one in all the world there is,
whom poison doth not try:
Of greedy scraping avarice,
or fylthy lechery.
Whom swelling pride doth never vex,
whom ire or pleasure blind:
Doth not throw hedlog down, why then
what goodness can we find
In us, or what deserts, that might
so great a workman move:
The skies, the seas, the fruteful earth,
to frame for our behove?
Loves not he gentle vndeserude?
so thou perchance will say:
This is but fond, for who will love,
the unthankful wretch always?
But he that wit doth lack belyde,
whose natures disagree
So much, what means, or how
may love between them be?
For God himself all times surmounts,
in whom no end is spied
Nor never he beginning had,
yet end of all beside.
And first beginning eke he is,
most chief omnipotent,
Above all things, than whom more good
can no mans head invent:
Or yet a Lord of greater power,
or one more excellent
Who hath no need of any thing,
yet all things need his might:
Who each doth behold, and yet
not subject to our sight.
Containing all good things in him,
and void of each ill deed:
We contrary as misers borne,
of vile and fylthy seed,
To wailing woes and doleful tears,
and thousand dangers dire:
Continually with these or those,
diseases set on fire.
But little time remaining here,
and that in grief and payne:
Alas in what an errors mist,
our lives we here do train?
Howe each one weak of mind we be,
with diverse chances dolde:
Lamenting this, and wailing that,
in fraud and vices bold.
Who after that we waded ha^e,
through cares and ^arking thought:
Are here compelled this life to yield,
resolved soon to nought.
The distance us between and God,
this (ergo) doth declare:
More great to be, (...) if we should
the seely flea compare
Unto the mighty Elephant,
what knot of amity:
Can knit these two good geffes in one.
that so unequal be?
Think thou this flea may have ye love,
of this same monster strong:
With like doth love and concord dwell,
and eke th'vnlike among
Always doth hate and discord rain,
small faith at least, with them there is,
Hereby some sort appear,
(whom men profane, our law do judge
and they that cowles do wear
Call heretics) account us mad,
and doltheads us do call:
Because we hope the Skies to see,
and live the Gods withal.
For evermore in happy life,
with diverse other toys:
Which foolish mind and prating tong,
do promise us as joys.
For speech doth make us beasts excel,
where if we lackd the same:
Which God us gives, eke our hands,
by which we all things frame.
No beast more vile than we were then,
no beast in worser case:
For these two above the rest,
gives nature all her grace.
Here of doth all our pride arise,
there of each Art begone,
For voice doth warn the present, what
to do or what to shone.
And letters to the absent speak,
for if a beast might show:
By words the secret motions hid,
in heart that he doth know.
If talk among them might be had,
if that their syngers fine:
were apt to write, no doubt we might
bcholde an Aue sometime
Of greater wit than we: and beasts
of every other kind:
would greater reason have in them
than man in us may find.
And boldly durst themselves prefer,
each other wight before:
And eke the Asso would prove himself,
of estimation more
Than us, the tongue and hand therefore,
not reason causes thus:
Each other kind of beast to be,
a Subject unto us
This they affirm and more beside,
if men be borne they say:
Of parents dumme, whose hands are maund
or cut from them away.
And line in woods not ne'er to towns,
and tongue and hand do fail,
Like other beasts: (I pray thee) what
can human wit preuaile?
what reason shall in them ayeare,
think thou they will not lead:
Their lives as vils as other beasts?
what wisdom may they plead.
More than the reast of brutish sort,
one sprite they al possess
Though it unlike do seem to be,
because they do express.
In body diverse form and have
of great diversity:
Their members all where to is toynde
a diverse faculty.
If diverse Carpenters you bring
like learned in their feat:
If some of them lack instruments,
no doubt the difference great
Must needs amongst them be,
for they can nothing do:
That want each kind of told that doth
belong their work unto.
Nor after him shall Orpheus draw,
the beasts and rocks so hie:
If he should lack his music sweet,
no once would Paris fly
(Being armed well at every point)
unarmed fierce Achill:
With such a sort of reasons vile,
these fools our cares do fill.
But more of them perchance I will,
hereafter bring to light:
When I shall of the soul of man,
some sentences resight.
For there I will it prove divine,
immortal eke to be:
which two of beasts no man will grant,
now where we stayed will we
The chief and perfect good is God,
and who so him possessed:
May called be of every man,
the happiest man and blessed.
But who can him obtain to have,
for ethe thing had as yet:
Is far more vile than he that hath
obtained it to get.
And every kind of thing possesr,
is eke of value less:
Than is the owner of the same,
that then doth it possess.
For even as soon thou may contain,
the Occean sea as wet:
Within the compass of a did,
or of an Oyster shell.
(O candle set before the winds.
O subject dust to grave)
Than Lord of such a mighty power,
by any means to have.
Alone God al things doth possess,
and hath himself alone:
He only hath the happy life,
beside him blessed is none.
A rertayne chiefest good there is,
beside this same foresaid:
Which every creature may obtayns,
yet like to them denayd.
For diverse natures all they have,
some one thing this doth please.
Some other thing doth seem again,
to be the others ease.
Al thing therefore may well obtain,
a certain happiness:
If not so perfectly a God,
himself doth it possess.
But by some means, and for a (...),
while things that doth agree,
With nature best, he can obtain,
no feels adversity.
But (al things past) now time requires,
that we should speak of man:
Who hath the chiefest good in hand,
and counted happy than,
When seeming unto nature good,
he all things doth possess:
And feels in all his life no harm
nor kind of bytternesse.
This may be counted chiefest good,
that all good things contains:
That gives all kind of pleasant things,
that puts away al pains.
For only pseasure doth not make,
nor virtue yet doth give:
The happy life, as some do write,
in ground of Greece that live.
Since many goods of greater worth,
than few, are counted plain:
As is the bushel counted more,
than one pore seely grain.
One good thing gives not happiness,
though it be chief and best:
But one in all that makes the life,
compact in all the rest.
So can not only one that rules,
a town procure to stand:
So can not of a thombe be framed,
a full and perfect hand.
And sith that of two parts we are,
the body and the mind:
Then happiness the happy man,
in both these parts must find.
He must be whole, and sound in Corps,
and of a lusty might,
He must be fair, he must be fresh,
and of a lively spright,
He must be good, wise, learned, discrete,
and gifts of both retain,
Pore life not know, nor hurtful chance,
and if he not remain
In long estate of happy years,
yet blessed can he not be
Though al the same commodities
foresaid to him agree.
For happy life that doth not last
almost is worth nothing,
As well have certain said before,
not one day makes the spring,
No brings it on Swallows swaps.
But at his latest day
With easy death and smallest payne
must he depart away,
And pass with joy the Stygian lakes
resoulde from mortal days,
Nor in his life time glory wants
nor at his death his praise.
But may there any one be found
with us that mortal are,
Which hath al these things in his time?
I think him very rare,
To whom nothing disyrde is lacked,
nor doleful chance doth light,
In al his time and years, who lives
and dyes in happy plight,
This is the very Phaenix bird
whom dust the Grecian fain,
The Grecian of a foolish head,
and of a frantic brain:
Who thought of one might issue come,
and bones consumed that be
To ashes cold, a bird to breed
which never men could see.
But so that she may wonders sing
this nation not esteames
The truth to say, a nation whole
addict to toys and dreams.
At whose example Latines dote,
the happy man therefore
Is rare as Phaenix bird. But we
are al both less and more
In wretched case, although yet some
than some more misers be,
Because that like estate to al
is not, nor like degree.
He that therefore doth most good things
and evil least sustain,
May counted be a happy man:
but he whom cares do payne,
And few good things at al possess,
may called be full well
A wretched man, sith none therefore
is happy, we must tel
How least unhappy we may be
and how in better case
Our lives to lead in greater joy,
and with more pleasant grace.
And to begin I not believe
it true that al men prase
How Bishops great and mighty Kings
do live in best estate.
For as in every other thing
extremity is thought
But il to be, the mean as good,
so here excess is nought
In riches, for to much of each
doth hurt, who hath therefore
Most riches, hath no better life,
than he that most is pore.
With evils like they veered be.
^o he that is to fat,
And hath his pauch with guts bombast
not lighter is for that,
Nor sooner moves than doth the wretch
whose skin doth leanness fret:
The one doth feblenesse forbid
the other fatness let.
And as the Seas with greater floods,
and foaming force doth yell,
And casts himself in mountains hie
while he discovers Hell,
Amid the depth the tempest roars
and yet doth least appear.
Is moved most with raging winds,
but now the shore full ne'er
The shallow Seas with louder noise
doth bounce upon the sand:
So Kings that have the power
and rule of realms in hand,
With greater cares tormented are,
and greater griefs of mind,
Although the common people yet,
these wouds do never find.
For secretly within their hearts
their torments they do hide,
Add this thereto, they always have
a mischeus mate beside
That vexes them, and fear it is
suspecting every twig,
Here of sometime do treasons breed
sometime a Spanish fig.
They dare not walk alone, nor eat
except it tasted be.
More dear than any kind of price
O worthy liberty,
The chiefest Gem, and Jewel fair
which taken once away,
Be sweet, and pleasant unto men,
nothing invented may:
And death it is alive to be.
The pore and seely soul,
Where as he list both night and day
in safety may go proule,
Either within the Cities wall,
their places fair to see,
And plays behold, or view the signs
of old antiquity,
Or if his pleasure rather be
without the wall to walk,
In Orchards fair, and gardens gay,
amid the flowers to stalk,
Or if desire of country sight
remain within his hart,
Nothing him lets but may alone
when he sees time depart.
He needs no shuffling sort of men,
nor croude of clients thick.
As oft beside as he doth thirst
or hunger doth him prick
Apace he falls there to, nor fear
of poison doth him let.
For baser food the birds abroad
in woods had rather get:
And greater pleasure far they take
in pecking seeds with payne,
Than if a cage of pearl and gold
their bodies should contain:
And there be fed with daynty meates.
Full oft a king therefore
May live in wretched case no doubt,
nor makes him happy more
(Believe me now) his regal crown.
But on the outward show
The fools do case, and what within
remaynes they little know.
For I him count in best estate
whom Fortune gives a mean
Whose living doth not much exceed
nor substance is to lean,
Who hath himself a pretty house
to which doth ground belong
That gives his master malt and wheat
and other grain among
O what a great and goodly gain
the ground well tillde doth breed
The husbandman that labours well
of few things stands in need.
For either trees of diverse kinds
a long in order set,
With little cost on them bestowed
do greatest profyt get,
Or sundry sorts of fruteful grain
and Corn in furrows cast
With great increase comes up again,
Or if to labour fast
It pleases him in Orchards fair,
of whose increase doth spring
Such pleasant fruit that may compare
with dish of any king:
Except one list rather exceed
than reasonably to live.
The mean estate therefore is best
which either chance doth give,
Or dead men's will, or dowry of wife,
or travail of the hand,
Or cast of mind by merchandise
to fetch from land to land,
In breding heastes, with cattels heird,
thy stables full to drtue,
In keeping doves on houses hie,
or homed Bees in hive.
Or winter milles black oils to grind,
or milles that meal do make,
With these and diverse other means
sufficient gain to take
Doth wisdom teach such as give not
their minds to slouthfulnesse,
Nor suffer ill and poison sweet
of drowsy laziness.
But chiefly yet this is the gift
of lady Fortunes grace,
She sets whom she will aloft
in rich and wealthy case.
She lady is of every thing
and riches all doth give.
It is not to be sought beside
in service for to live,
For nothing more an honest man
becommes than liberty
But he of nature is a slave
and of no dignity,
Unhappy rather, and a wretch,
who can the yoke sustain
Of masters hestes, and them obey
for hope of foolish gain.
The meadows fat, nor all the Gold
nor price of Indian sands,
Is so much worth that thou shuldst have
thy meat in others hands,
And rest at others will, and when
thy master bids thee go,
Then like a ball from him thou must
be tossed to and fro:
And serve a man perhaps more worse
than thou thy self sometime,
An Ass, vnlearnde, a surfetter
that vows his years to wine.
A fond and filthy thing it is,
when thou may lead thy life
With little living safe and free
and void of al such strife
To bear the yoke of bondage vile
for hope of greater gain
And freedom sell, the chief of all
and stately check sustain.
O minds of men degenerate
why seek ye great men's halls
To be an honour unto them
and make your selves as thralls?
Wo worth you all that shepherds need
like beasts of brutish sort,
That of your selves not able be
to keep an honest port.
For who so serves by any means
can no ways happy be,
It is an Asses part to bear
the saddle still we see.
Therefore who comes of parents free,
or of a noble kind,
And doth possess as much as may
suffice himself to find
He nedelesse then his chance be wayles
But some perchance will doubt
The married or the single life
which best of them, for stout
And proud the wives are often seen,
and oft to chide and brawl,
And catch their husbands by the pates,
and often nought withal:
^esides the cares of children vex
whom grieves the sickness rage
Or else untimely death doth take,
the daughter come to age
With monied bags a mate requires,
or else Dame Lais school
Doth practise there, and stayns ye house,
the son proves oft a fool
L^mfingred oft, and harlots kepes,
a brawling merchant stout,
A swearing Gose, a Rusfian wild,
a vile unshamefast lout.
He seems not to be free beside
who so ever hath a wife,
Must alter needs conditions al,
and leave his youthful life,
Forsaking frayes must bide at home,
not ride from town to town,
Nor in the night time walk the streets
in beating doors down,
And keeping Jone. Its needful then
to live advisedly,
And see thy goods they not decrease
but may augmented be,
Least in thy age the wallet come.
Although these things be so,
Yet think I sure with marted bed
and nature for to go
More better far, as she to us
of birds and beasts vntame
Example shows, how both the kinds
themselves together frame,
And join in one of duty must,
and always so remain
Increase to get and nourish up
their young with equal payne.
Whereby the kind may styll endure
and never more decay,
For we as every kind of beast
are moved to Venus play
By natures will, a worser thing
shall hap to thee be sure
If thou thy self wilt never seek
this thing for to procure.
And void of issue shalt thou dye
and yield thy corps again,
A stranger then shall have thy goods
for which thou took payne.
And when that aged hairs shall hap
and sickness shall thee hent,
Who shall thy wearied age relieve?
who shall thy hurts lament?
Thy brother or thy kinsman ne'er,
or will do this thy friend?
No sure, for to be heir to thee
they rather wish thine end.
On thee alive they wait and fawn
thy goods at grave to take,
And each man loves and fears thy good
of thee no force they make.
O mischief great, O beastliness,
and vile desire to get,
O piteous plague each where dispersed
on profit all be set
The virtue left. Who seeks now
the righteous thing to use?
What man is he that will not now
al goodness clean refuse
If any hope of gain he have?
Gold guydes the laws we see,
And might of Gold than strength of blud
of greater force to be.
For Gold both shame fastness and faith
are set abroad to sell,
For Gold the Gods above be scrude
and we set free from Hell.
But now the wife her father leaves
and mother dear beside,
With al her house and household friends,
with thee alone to bide
For evermore both night and day,
and of thy seed she bears
A sweet and goodly golpowlde Boy
of small and tender years:
And kindred now to thee she brings
and doth thy house enlarge
And helps thee eke in every thing
and takes with the thy charge.
Between you al things common are
both good and evil things,
Whatsoever harms one hurts both.
and that which profit brings
Unto the one, that profits both.
If sycknesse make thee weak
Or greater age, then doth she straight
exhort thee well and speak.
She comforts thee, she helps thee then,
she never leaves thee there,
She watches thee and watching serves.
Likewyse thy children dere
With al the means they can they keep
for both your bloods are one,
And Image like: And when the day
wherein thou must be gone
Is come, thou art not clean extince
but shalt alive remain
In them who then shall represent
their fathers face again.
But some there be that rather had
in common harlots bed
Uncertayne children get, therefore
they list not wives to wed.
Such kind of men I can not praise
nor wise I have them thought,
For wife with dowry helps thee well
where harlots bring thee nought.
A wife doth bring thee store of friends,
where harlots bring thee foes,
A wife thou shalt in safety have.
a whore with grief and woes.
The one will trusty styll remain.
the other false always,
And fearing to be cast at large
she steals al she may.
And for her self she heaps up all
her state for to repair
When thou hast plucked her belles away
and cast her up to air.
More, if thou kepest a whore, thy goods
are but in queasy case,
Of wives are children lawful got,
of harlots bastards base.
To wed therefore it needful is
but fittest first to see
The maids estate, the parents ^ke
their manners what they be.
For oftentimes the children do
their parents after take,
For trees according as they are
like fruit are wont to make.
Ask counsel of her neighbours, close
(so that she faithful be)
And if thou hau a woman send
her whole estate to see:
If she be fair, if she be foul,
if she be sore to know
If she lack wit, if she can spin,
if she can knit or sow.
These are the works for them to use
and virtuous women's deeds,
For to eschew all idleness,
which chiefly vices breeds.
For idleness the mind corrupts
and leads it unto evil,
To wanton lust and filthy vice,
and fancies of the Devil.
This idleness doth overthrow
and Cities down doth pull.
For if that Lucresse had not given
her self to works of wul,
And if the chaste Penelopey
which webs had never wrought,
But both amid their halles had sit
with idle wanton thought:
This might have pleased perchace among
a thousand wooers one,
And of the others Virgin death
should never fame have gone:
But best it is for thee to view
these things thy self alone.
For other men among (for troth)
firm faith remains none.
For al men now will fain and lye,
and truth is quite exiled:
Few faithful shalt thou find, but if
thou wilt not be beguiled.
If thou would al things better prove,
then make thy self a spy:
And seek al things thou go about,
to see with present eye.
Wherefore I warn thee earnestly,
take heed that thou her see:
(If that thou can) what one she is,
to whom thou think to be
In marriage ioynde, least afterward,
in vain thou dost lament:
And least it do when time is past,
thee of thy dede repent.
But if perchance (as left it haps)
thou lives in wretched case:
With wicked wife deceyude by fate,
and frowning Junoes grace.
First mildly do such one exhort,
sweet words with her frequent:
And give her gifts, and all that may,
her wayward mind content:
With sweet deceyts her overcome,
now fast thy arms embrace
About her neck, and though she shun,
cast kisses on her face.
With all sweet means apease her ire*
if this do not prevail,
Use bitter words, be angry then
and chide her fast, and rail,
Put on thy brazen face, and fume
and fear her then with threttes.
If this do nought procure, and by
thy words she nothing sets,
Try thou the matter then with stripes
and softly on the back
With bouncing blows bebast her well
that all her bones may crack.
If thou suspect thy wife of play,
then keep no lusty men,
Nor fellows fair, with whom she may
be prating now and then.
Thou art deceived, if thou dost think
that any kind of man
Will faithful be, in Uenus case
no men are faithful than.
For the rejoices to beguile.
by fraud is love possessed
And unto Uenus always fraud
a thing is counted best.
But as a chiefest thing take heed
there entre not thy door
No fryer fat, no lusty Monk,
nor priest of any lore.
Eschew the knaves, a greater plague
than these can none express,
These are the dregs of every sort
and springes of folishenesse,
The common synke of mischiefs all,
and Wolves in felles of sheep,
For pence and no devotion sure
to God these wretches creep.
And with a colour false of truth
they simple souls be guile.
And underneath religious cloak
a thousand mischiefs vile.
A thousand heinous deeds they do
deflouring maid and wife,
Whore hunters vile, and Sodomites
the servant all their life.
Of beastliness, and belly joy,
the things divine they sell,
What wonders great invent they not?
what dreams do they not tell?
The common people to deceive
and to procure again.
Hereof doth superstition rise
and thousand fansyes vain^
Which if the gods be wise they scorn,
and do refuse to view:
The Godly man doth worship God,
with earnest love and true.
And not for gold, away with gain,
thou shalt see them deny:
All sacred service here on earth,
and God himself on hie.
Themselves therefore this flock doth serve,
and not the saints above:
And profit causes Gods to be,
which if thou once remove,
Both temples and their alt are stones,
shall flat lie on the ground:
Nor any more amongst them al,
shall any God be found.
These juggling mates and foxes false,
expel from thee therefore:
And take good heed that none of them,
do enter at thy door.
Least thou do cry the Cuckees note,
through feigned virtue such:
Nor if thou any gossips hast,
believe them not to much.
For under colour of this name,
the Knaves do many play:
Take heed beside that from thy house,
she often do not stray.
Nor let her haunt thy neyghbors house,
it hath been scene full oft:
That whoremasters have hid the selves,
amid thy neighbours loft.
Appoint her mates for company,
of chaste and honest fame:
Let mother Be, be put from thence,
and every bawdy dame.
And seek thou not with other whores,
thy self for to relieve:
Nothing doth cause her more to frown
nor nothing more her grieve.
For nothing more revengement seeks,
than when she is begilde:
And sees that with vnstedfast love,
her bed is thus defiled.
Then all with ire she flames and hates,
then doth she eke begin:
To work her husband like despite,
then choler boils within.
Then rages she like Bacchus priest,
whom to much wine doth prick:
Believe me well she is but rare,
that doth not use the trick,
That harlots use, when that she is,
deceyude of lawful part:
At least if she can not in dede,
yet sins she in her heart.
For will with vice provoked thus
in vice will farther slide.
But if thou takst her with the deed
let laws on her be tried.
Be not ashamed but let the laws
be reuerencde of thee,
For they are as a certain rule
by which we guided be.
Least thou should give a greater pain
amid thy raging ire
(Offending God, in felowing men)
than doth the fault require.
For common people never use
the rule of reason sage,
But are seducde with furies fell
like beasts of brainles rage.
No hast thou lost thy liberty
by marrying of a wife
Because thou may not walk ye streets
and lead a ruffians life.
This can be called no liberty
but rather licence nought
Who so is free doth seem to serve
such is not to be sought.
It brings the owner to much harm,
and not to can do ill,
Is better sarre than have such vice
adherent to thy will.
How many men have been destroide
by to much liberty?
How many men in safety live
with bridles dost thou se?
And if thy children sickness vex
why should thou weep or wail
Go seek in hast to make them whole
if that will not preuaile
And if that death will have them needs
then use a patient mind
Thou art not in this case alone
but fellows shalt thou find.
The grief that we with many bear
we better may sustain.
We all are borne to this intent
to render life again.
For of our first beginning doth
the fatal end depend
And certain is the time decreed
for all away to wend.
And either soon or latter doth
each man his grave descend
To death which is of evils alt
the last and final end.
Not of the valiant to be feared.
what doth it ought avail:
The deaths of them with tears, yt here
have lost their life to whale.
Is it a thing so wretched here,
to leave this foolish life:
To rid thereby our mortal corps
from all unquiet strife.
And for the hurly burly here,
eternal life to win:
Perpetual reast by death we gain,
or eke the coming in.
To life again, but weep thy fill,
in time thy tears shall staye:
And all thy cares and grief beside,
from thee shall time convey.
But if thou wanton children keep,
or of a greater shame:
O father fond deserving stripes,
then thou art most to blame.
And causer chief of all their hurt,
who taughtst not them to know:
Both manners good and vertuousnese^,
while tender years did grow.
Not yet with vices foul defaced,
neglecting thou the mind:
Diost only bring their bodies up,
like beasts of brutish kind.
Hereof so many foolish geese,
and noughty men remain:
With whom each city pestered is,
for all in age retain.
The manners that they did receive
when younger years were rife:
And each man as he lived in youth,
so leads he his life.
The tender twig at first may bow
according to thy mind:
But when the bows get elder strength
no more thou shalt them wind.
Nor from the place that young it held,
thou shalt it cause to fly:
So doth a child in tender years,
each way himself apply.
But when that elder age is come,
look which way first he went:
That kepes he still, and will not change
his first conceiude intent.
Of custom long is nature bred
and yields her force always:
To use that long time hath been kept.
yet ought we for to pray.
To God, within the mothers womb
that he may give good seed:
For so we show our selves in life,
as we therein do breed
Whosoever doth come nought fro thence
will seldom virtuous prove
Though manners good, the school him teach
and thousand masters move.
Well may thou nature rule sometime,
but never her expel
For she is still of greater force
thau all thy guiding well.
Yet something will she altered be
with use and daily toil:
So with continual husbanding
doth bear the barren soil.
So Lions fierce of mighty force
obey to man as king.
So by continual exercise
each Art in time doth spring.
Wherefore instruct thy children well
while tender years do grow
And teach them honest ways to walk
and virtuous life to know.
Permit them not to ramp abroad
according to their will,
Than liberty no kind of thing
for children is more ill.
If thou be wise hold fast thy raynes
and warily well them guide
For mortal things by naturra force
are moude in vice to slide.
And willingly thereto they run
if help no labour bring
For without Art is nature won
to give no perfect thing.
For God himself will not permit
that we with slouthfulnesse
Should heavy ware, but stirs us up
with cares and busynesse:
And as with spurs the slothful pricks
a pleasant place there lies
That rises up with craggey rock
amid the steamy skies,
Full of delight than which more bleft
a place can not be found
To whom the sweet Elysius fields
and Temp, of Thessale ground
Doth place resign, here nigh the pole
and night the stars that shine,
Dame virtue dwells, and there enjoys
a thousand pleasures fine.
But vengeance crabbed is the paths
^oth narrow and vnplaine
And so be grown with thickes of thorne
that never can attain,
The vile and slothful mind to pass
of earthly cares possessed:
And few pure mind a loft doth bring
whom God hath chose as blessed.
Above to dwell amid the skies,
full crabbed is the way:
To virtue sure, but plain to vice,
by which we soon do stray.
To which we all run easily,
who therefore doth intende:
To trade a child in vertuousnesse,
must labour him to mend,
For without labour nothing good,
can well performed be:
The force of daily labour doth,
all things dispatch we see.
First ought you fathers to take heed,
above all other things:
Your children haunt no ill resort,
for custom always brings.
Each kind of manners unto men,
yea though they saints should be:
Ill company will them corrupt,
but chiefly let them fly.
From haunt of lusty youthful brutes,
for youth is always bent:
Lo vices all, and filthy be,
all filthy talk innent.
For wholly is this age advicse,
to naughty riots deed:
That they use not the haunt therefore,
of young men take good heed.
Thou that intend for to keep.
a child in vertuousnesse:
Now use to chide, and now the rod,
and plain the way express.
By which they may their feet direct,
in no wise favour show:
And ever angry, let them not,
the love of Fathers know.
For nothing can more hurtful be,
than speak them fair unto:
Then greater heart in vice they take
then all things dare they do.
When thou for truth shalt take their words
and makst of them to much:
Bewitched sore with doting love,
to children favour such
Is hurtful sure, for fear alone,
doth make them vice to fly:
Not reason then, and soon they sin,
if they be not put by.
With brydels harde, and as they do
full oft in vices fall:
Done causing them, so seldom they
return if none do call.
According as they bring them up
so all men children have.
Beside all this we must invent
our bodies health to save.
For health is far more worth than gold
the healthy delving lout
In better state accounted is
than crazed king no dout
First ought the cause be know whereof
such sickness vile are sown,
In corps of men, tormenting them
for once the causes known.
More easily may thou shun theffects
and causes pulled away,
The effects of them that did ensue
incontinent decay.
The causer first of each disease
is chiefest nature sure,
As oft as under naughty stars
the birth she doth procure:
While as the child doth inward take
the motions of the say
Or else begot of naughty seed.
the cause doth eften lye.
Amid the parents of the child,
when they perfour me the act
Disposed ill, with naughty blood,
or sore diseases racte
More causes are there yet beside
as labour toil and rest,
Both cold, heat, with sleep, and meat,
and joys of Uenus nest.
Each one of these, doth strength abate
and hurt the lively sprite,
As oft as we use them to much
or use them else to light.
Excess of both doth sickness bring
of measure health proceeds
The perturbations of the mind
diseases often breeds.
And to much sadness, fear and grief
and to much myr^h as well
Doth kill if we will credit such
as histories do tell.
The air doth hurt, the water harms
when they be both infected.
Hereof doth come the plaguy sore
whereby the guts are veered.
The common rot doth many kill,
and diverse sickness sore
Doth brawling, fight, and fawle procure
with thousand perryls more.
These springs grouds of mischiefs all
(if thou thy health set by:)
By all the means thou can invent.
seek thou from them to fly.
If thou be sick as needs thou must
sometime, what wilt thou do?
Desire not then the medcine long,
but loke thou soon thereto.
While as thy sore is yet but grene,
nor yet thy mortal fo:
Possessed hath his fired place,
amid thy corps to go.
A little water doth suffice,
to quench the breeding fire:
But when that it is fully grown,
and flames begin to spyre.
With vaunting course again ye stars
scarce river, spring, or lake
Will then suffice to quench it out,
shift therefore timely make.
To know the cause of thy disease,
and soon to put them out
Use contraries, contrary things,
each one expel no doubt.
If cold have thus procured thy harm,
use things to heate again:
If travail, toil, or meat thee hurt,
from them likewyse refrain.
If need require then seek the aide
of some Physicians hand:
Or Surgians help in Surgians Art,
more knowledge sure doth stand.
For plain and sure appears the work,
that in his hand he takes:
But Leach, whom we Physician name
while he the water shakes.
Whereby he doth his judgment give,
and feels the beating vain:
And rakes the dung, he is deceaude,
and doth deceive again.
But with unlike estate of harm,
the simple soul doth die:
And gives the bald religious men,
a cause to sing and cry.
The other having gotten gold,
accuses God on hie:
And saith that be was only cause,
whereby the man did die.
And fast with silver stuffs his purse,
with sweet reioicing hart:
All men (alas) are healed now,
by chance and not by Art.
For he that any Art knows well,
in practising of it:
But seldom he doth chance to er^e,
or doth offend no white.
But these among whereof we talk,
amongst a hundred ill:
There scarce is one whom they can save
or whom they do not kill.
How chances this? But for because,
that few of them doth know:
What thing they do, what Physic is,
but while they seek to flow.
With witty words, and Logiks Art,
the vulearned sort to bind:
Of Phisiks cure the principles,
they scarcely seek to find.
Instructed thus with nedelesse Arts,
themselves they home wards hie:
And fast with Ergo there they prate,
and big they look thereby.
Hereby they stipends do require,
and think enough the same:
(Nor are they here deceyude) for this,
that with an honest name
They may be murderers of men,
O laws of wretched kind:
That can permit such mischtefs great,
O Kings and rulers b^inde.
That spy not this deformed thing,
O you that guide and rain:
Permit not such a wickedness,
chase hence this plague again.
And succour bring to mortal kind,
by these same murdering knaves:
How many men both night and day,
have found their fatal graves?
Let them have perfectly their Art,
or let them not profess:
For other arts if they do err,
the harm of them is less.
But this except it perfect be,
is full of perils great:
And privily doth rage as doth
at home the plaguy heate.
It is not good therefore to trust,
such men, whose learning stands:
In precious habit to be seen,
and to adourne their hands
With rings and hoops, and precious stones,
but this that I shall tell:
Whereby thou may thy self retain,
in mind reserve thou well.
See that thy diet wholesome be,
and eat not thou to much:
For mischief great hath come to men,
by over feeding such.
Here of do most diseases breed,
beware especially:
As of a poison strong that doth,
enforce the corps to dye.
That thou no meat again do take.
till that received last:
Be well consumed and perfectly,
his full digestion past.
And every day use exercise,
by pace or other feat:
Whereby thy joints thus moved may,
procure a warming heate.
For moving is the cause of warmth,
and aids the stomach well:
Increases strength, humours nought,
from out the flesh expel.
Break not beside thy quiet rest,
for sleep the body feeds:
And helps the mind where harm to both,
excessive watching breeds.
Expel thou sorrow far from thee,
and heaviness exile:
For it dries up the sinews all,
and makes the body vile.
And grested hairs untimely plants,
the joyful heart again:
Doth make thy limbs mebers strong,
and youthful years retain.
The other things behold thy self,
that erst I told to thee:
A thing more precious far there is,
by which we happy be.
And like to Gods, and heavens haunt,
in earth remaining here:
Although his grace to few is given,
few worthy do appear.
Such honour hie for to possess,
and if to know the same:
Thy mind desires, I will thee tell,
dame wisdom is her name.
This is the greatest good of all.
than this of greater grace:
The Gods can give nothing to man,
to this resigneth place
All that that breeds in red sea sands,
or all the golden goods:
That Lagus keeps, that Hermus hath
or in Pactolus floods.
Whatsoever grows if truth be said,
to her no Princely raygne:
May be compared, she is the Mother
of all Godly train,
And greatest virtue is. O blesf,
yea blessed, and blessed again,
As much as mortal man can be,
is he that doth obtain
Of God, this goodly gift to get,
but some perchance will seek:
What wisdom is to know, and sure
the troth hereof to speak.
Nought else but knowledge chief she is
by which the pured mind:
Whom neither mortal weight doth pres
nor earthly thought can blind.
Doth scale and clime the skies above,
and there in airy place:
With God doth dwell, despising here,
all things in mortal case
As vain, ascending always up,
much like the flames of fire:
Regarding light these earthly things
doth things above desire.
And doth discern the good from ill,
and truth from falsehode nought:
And things of blind and mortal men,
that chiefest here are thought.
As pleasures, realms, and riches great
with hie triumphing gear:
For which both night and day they toil
esteming not a hear.
Bewayls the vayn and fading thoughts
declaring here the way:
Of living well in order just,
and eke the dying day.
The rest among the wiseman shines,
as doth the sun full bright:
Amid the stars, and doth despise,
the force of fortunes might.
And underneath his fete doth tread,
each harm with constant mind:
Nor moved is beside with fear,
or dread of death unkind.
Nor fears once the pains of Hell,
but takes with mirth his grave:
And laughs to scorn the fancies fond,
that common people have.
Not douting here this life to leave,
replete with wretchedness:
And full of toils hereby to get,
eternal quietness.
In fine he equal is to Jove,
to him adherent be
Four things: For well he counsel gives,
and clearly judges he.
All error quite from him remoude,
he guides also right:
Both human things and eke divine,
are subject to his sight.
This last that I have here rehearst,
is chiefest of all the rest:
Than which there is no greater thing,
that here may be pass.
But no man can this wisdom have,
till clean he purged be:
From every heinous vice and crime,
and all iniquity.
For wisdom doth deny to dwell,
amid the sinful hart:
And hates eke the minds impure,
since she is purest part.
And no man can this wisdom have,
except he be discreate:
And learned be in many Arts,
know these to be the feat,
With which is wisdom free obtaynd,
whereof I would say more:
But time commands me here to shut,
and end this book before.
My Lions tale hath long enough,
continued here her stile:
Wherefore my muse now hold thy peace,
and rest thy self a while.
Virgo the sixth Book.
SOme I believe of cankered mind,
and of malicious face:
Who think they only know the troth
and only have the grace
Al doubtful things with judgement right,
and knowledge full to try:
Will say I never tasted yet,
the blessed springs that lie
In Aone fields, nor sacred floods,
that Phocidos doth frame:
Nor that the Laurel leaf I do
deserve, nor Poets name.
Because I write not fancies fond,
and monsters marvelous:
And feigning not deceive the ears,
of such as credit us.
For they suppose the Poets part,
is only lies to tell:
As if it were a thing to vile,
for them with troth to mell
And lawful not. their judgements I,
account both nought and vain:
And sweeter seems far to me,
the truth for to retain.
To aged wives and witless boys,
such trifles I be take:
Some bark abroad the battles big,
that Giant great did make.
With Gorgons grun, and Harpies vile,
and mighty Ciclops wild:
And shipmen sore enflamde with song,
of pleasant mermaids mild.
with Circes old that monstrous hag,
and beasts that three heads wears:
Chymera vile, and Atlas strong,
whose mighty shoulders bears.
The starry skies, ichangd to rock,
that clouds hath forrowed left:
with Persea hie, and Tantalus,
Promotheus wretched theft.
And Titius stout, and Belides,
and what so ever more:
The doting greece hath Latins taught,
in long time here cofore.
I wish not I, so much to drink,
of Aganippes streams:
Nor seek I so the Laurel leaf,
of glistering Phebus beams.
with Juey leaves the hears to deck,
whereby I so might fain:
A poet thus to be I blush,
and am ashamed plam.
If needs we must such trifles wright,
and use such pleasant lies
Troth thus despisoe: of many tongue
is had, but few are wise.
Believe me well: and many wright,
with hauty verses hie:
And many have the Grecians tongue,
and latin perfectly.
And while so many things they know
their wisdom is but thin:
With regal words their stile is dekt,
but small effect within.
The outward Image only shows,
and picture light we spy:
But what good thing remains therein?
what fruit is had thereby?
What learns he that reads them?
what knowledge hath he got?
But dreams and foolish fancies fond,
that lise here profit not.
which for to know, and not to know,
is all of one effect:
Though they me Poet call or not.
I will not yet neglect.
The troth to say, and lies to shun,
truth makes the perfect mind:
which who so ever most doth know,
approaches niste the kind
Of saints above, and happiest is,
although the folishnesse:
Of people rude him not commend,
nor praise his worthiness.
Nor favour him as he deserves,
nor titles of him tel:
Wherefore my muses now approach,
and Sycophants farewell.
Behold, I enter now the way,
which with a loathsome shade:
The Cyprus and the Yeutree hides,
with leaves that never fade.
The doleful fields and darksome reign
of Proserpu^e I see:
Wherein the Letheus river runs,
with streams that darkened be.
Amid the poison fields abroad,
doth slepy Popey spring:
On silent shores, Calliopey
where dost thou me bring?
What monsters for to se dost thou,
command? what noise to hark?
With doleful noise of irksome Owls,
sounds al the wodes so dark.
The Howlats cry with woeful tunes
and loud lamenting noise,
O muse, where dost thou me bring:
behold, with wailing voice.
The hills and valleis all do roar,
and ^ccho back doth beat:
The mourning times, an answer gives,
what grief is this so great?
What is the cause of mischief such,
what kind of people those:
That all be clad in mourning blacks
and wailing vesture goes?
What men are they that thus in black,
with weeping fill the skies?
Alas, what sight of bodies slain,
lie here before mine cies?
What hath here caused this bloody broil
who made this slaughter fell?
How many kings and bishops bones
lye here? I know them well.
Is yen same death aloof that comes
with bloody sith in hand?
With dredful face, and ghaslley look
before whose face doth stand.
A thousand heaps of sicknesses,
a thousand dangers cake:
O armed with to fierce a guard,
my thinckes I hear him speak.
With clamoure great as he doth come,
to him I will give ear:
And what I hard with all my hart,
I will declare them hear.
That death I am that with my since,
right down do cut like hay:
All things that live upon the earth,
the rule and eke the sway.
Of all the world, hath I ove me dealt,
and bids me none to spare:
But hie and low, to slay and kill,
them down with equal share.
Whereby may none escape my hands,
not one can fly from me:
The hauty heads of mighty kings,
by me suppressed be.
The pride and pomp of prelates flour,
I cause a down to fall:
No kind of creature here doth live,
but unto us is thrall.
Although he (flying) pearse the parts,
of northern Boreas ground:
And pass the ragged ^iphean rocks,
yet shall mine ire be found.
And he my power and stroke shall feel,
or though he do descend:
The southern parts, where shines bright
the stars to us vnkend.
Yet there he shall me surely find,
and finding me shall die:
^y sith, both East, and west doth kill,
I set not riches by.
How many men hath this my hand,
down cast from state on hie:
And headlong shoved with mortal might,
in darksome grave to lie?
I well remember Priam once,
when stain at altar stone:
He sacrificed was to me,
the guide of Macedone.
The proud, with fighting hand that put,
so many realms to flight:
To whom no like could then be found,
by force and deadly might.
Of this my dart, in Babilon,
sore wounded down did fall:
What should I here the Latin Lords,
and Mars his neuewe^ call
To mind, the Lords of all the earth,
whose valiant virtue plain:
Did join their rule to Ocean seas,
and fame with stars to rain?
Could I not when me list all these,
^slaine to hell throw down?
Depriude their hands of scep^ors ^ou^
their heads of regal crown.
Of words their mouths, of sight their eyes,
of moving members all:
And eke their bodies thus destroyed,
in filthy grave let fall.
Me fears the Ind, the Arabian,
the more, the Scithian fell:
All they whom Asy and Europe kepes,
in Affricke all that dwell.
Both kind and place are one to me,
nor times observe I than,
Nor manners way, nor years esteame,
the good and evil man.
The wise the foolish dolt shall die,
the little sucking Will:
The young and old, the fair and foul,
with reason like I kill.
And he that yonder I do se,
approaching to my land:
When as his destinies permit,
shall feale my deadly hand
These fearful words with hellish mouth,
this churlish thief out brayed:
Wherewith my senses all did fail,
and I remained afraid.
My blood therewith forsook the veins,
and left the outward part:
And shrouded close within my breast
to succour there my heart:
But chiefly when this fearful fiende
had sent the plagues of Hell
To them that ranged on the earth
amid the croude to dwell,
Which knew not of that mischief great,
then forth abroad they fly
And here and there they catch and take
each one they can come by.
Then bodies sick on ground are laid
and deep for pain they groan,
And many there with Since in hand
doth death dispatch alone:
And passing forth she did reserve
till slaughter next begun,
The lives of all whom Lachesis
not yet had fully spun.
Thus trembling all my joints therewith
and all amassed then
My self unto began say these words:
O cares, O vows of men
O labours vain, deceiving hope,
O seeting joys of mind,
O time that evermore dost change,
O fading human kind,
How vain and how uncertain is
this transitory life?
How subject unto every harm
of thousand evils rife?
Which outward shows a pleasant face
both sweet and framed well,
But inward, O what gall, what grief,
what poison there doth dwell?
What are we wretches here but dust,
with wind and rain vpcast?
And like the brittle breaking glass
and shadows fading fast?
Much like to Roses that do show
a gorgeous gaudy face
When funne doth rise, when the night
apears do lose their grace.
To day with mirth alive, and foot
to worms within a while,
This day in fair and lusty plight,
and straight a Carrian vile.
Alas what doth it us avail
to hourd up heaps of Gold
And plate to have, and clothing rich
and Gems of price to hold,
Great realms cities strong to guide,
in houses fair to lye
Aloft to loke, and think himself
full like to Gods on hye?
If death do al things take from hence
if we like smoke or dust
As wretches fade, if that so soon
our pride, our pomp and lust
Do pass, and end for evermore?
as I these words had said
With whispring voice my self unto
beholding al afraid
With quaking pace this Ghastly fiend:
sir Orpheus mother dear,
Why art thou thus she saith aseard?
be bold and of good cheer,
For fear is sign of beastly mind,
vnfyt for men is such,
What is the cause that should thee move
to fear this death so much?
Then answered I: Good Lady mine
nature doth force me so,
What living beast her not abhors
and seeks from her to go?
She takes from us both life and goods
delights and al at ones
The corps to nought resolves, for what
remains but dust and bones,
Which bones in time return to dust?
in fine all goodly things
She here from us doth take away
and chiefest mischief brings.
Whom would not therefore such a beast
and vgley Monster fear
Except his heart were made of steel?
Then Jove his daughter dear
With smiling lips began to say
thou runst beyond the white,
And art deceiude with form of truth
and shadow of that light.
It is not easy for each one
the truth it self to know,
This is the self same bow that doth
amid the great wood grow
With trees of order thick embracde,
that misty errors hide,
Nor ever might this golden twig
of many men be spied,
But only unto them to whom
the milk white Doves it show,
But I of seed celestial borne
the truth do fully know:
And can it well to thee declare
if thou to here require.
I aunswerde then: Good lady sure
I nothing more desire:
We must depart from hence quoth she
come after me a while.
And forth she leads, not far from thence
where Phebus hye did smile,
With beating beams upon the hill,
whose pleasant shining light
Did put the misty clouds abroad
and darkness all to flight.
Beside a spring we both sate down
and under Laurel shade
Begins my guide with pleasant voice,
and thus her words she made:
An Ape (quoth she) and jesting stock
is man to God in sky,
As oft as he doth trust his wit
to much, presuming hie,
Dare search the things of nature hid
his secretes for to speak,
when as in very deed his mind
is dull and all to weak.
If he be ignorant of things
that lye before his feet
How think thou those things shall he se
which God and nature sweet
Within their bosoms close have hyd?
yet al at fingers ends
This hasty blind unhappy fool
persuade himself he kendes,
So much himself he bears in hand
of al your folishnesse
The spring and chief this selfeloue is,
A darkness great that causes you,
to know the truth the less.
Away with this, and better things
thine eyes shall quickly spy,
And those that erst for good ye thoughtst
thou shalt for good deny,
And those that evil now thou think
thou wilt not evil trow,
This darkness from thy mind expelled.
I will therefore thou know,
That mortal state is nothing else
but blathers full of wind,
which here and there on rolling bal
enforces fortune blind,
To whom if any wit they had
should death more welcome be
Than life, sith living here all men
with harms oppressed be:
And few good things they here do use
not full of bytternesse
which true I think thou wilt believe
when I shall here express
The goods and ylles of mortal life
as briefly as I may.
These two conferd the human life
we plainly shall display.
What thing it is, and whither death
ought so much feared to be.
But first of riches will we speak
which every land we see
Doth praise, doth seek, doth wonder at
and covet instantly:
I will endeavour them to blase.
Good Lady then quoth I
If it you please, this labour spare
for once and long ago
This lesson learned I perfectly,
Minerua taught me thoe,
Now forward show some other case,
not things fore known retel.
The whole estate of pleasure to
Arete told me well,
So did her son Timalphes eke
let this thoe passed be
Therefore, and then declare at large
what else it pleases thee.
Then answered she, of nobleness
I something here will say,
For that is one of chiefest goods,
and at this present day
Al men do seek this same to have
and think they it obtain
Although as far from it they be
as is the Spaniard plain
Removed from the man of Inde.
But what is nobleness?
Of value what? the truth I do
intend for to express.
But what avails it as now
the truth of ought to say
Sith no man will it now believe
sith al men it denay?
Some kind of beasts do fly and hate
continually the light,
And roving styll amid the dark
do wander eke by night.
So, many neither can, nor love
the light of truth to find.
For God with nature so deuides
the state of mortal kind,
That unto him that sees aright,
the state of man alone
Doth seem to blase the nature full
of other beasts each one.
So diverse are the thoughts of man,
and so unlike they be,
For many still pursue the dark
and truth can never see,
And on the Sun do always loke
with waterish winking eyes,
A few with open sight it view
whose mind is of the Skies.
Nobillity therefore as doth
the common people say,
In heaps of riches doth consist.
or in the Golden sway,
Or else in blood, as oft as he
bred up of gentle like,
Of Belsiers, and of Grandfathers
can brag and arms define,
And can his valiant parents praise:
this judgment I refuse,
For styll the common people lye
as they were wont to use.
A like opinion many have,
but few have reason plain.
If he should be a Gentleman
that riches doth obtain,
Why then good Gentlemen may be
the Dowrers and their fears,
The Butchar, Barber, Fishmongers,
and he that horses reares,
The shepherd, and Jack Baker, and
the Tanner with his hide,
The Baud, the Chief, the Graftex
and other all beside
Of fylthy sort, for them among
full many riches have
And many may, for fortane oft
extolles the wretched slave,
And often she doth throw a down
with her unequal hand
Such as of late she did permit
aloft on whele to stand.
At that time only Marius was
therefore, in noble state
When as a victorer he came
within the Romaines gate
(The Counsel and the Commons al
rejoicing much thereat,)
With crown of Baize, horses white
ydrawne on Chariot sat,
But after that from thence expelde,
by wicked Syllaes might,
A banished man to Minturne fled
lay hid, and wanted light
In dung on vile, or when he was
constraynd to beg his bread
In Africa land, (O laws of Gods
O powers to little dread,)
And bread most apt for ditchers tough:
was not this noble man
A wretch as now? from him aloof
fled nobleness as than
And strayghtwayes she did eke return
when Marius came again
By lot of changed star to Rome:
their sentence sure is vain,
If noble state consist in gold,
of earth doth Gold proceed
Of fraud, of stealth, of Usery,
we ergo then do speed
Of nobleness by fraud and stealth,
and eke by Usery,
O judgment blind of common sort
of reason clean without,
No Gold can make your noble men
no riches thus can clout,
For worthier is nobillity
than any precious good,
With gold it is not bought nor sold.
But some now brag of blood,
And praises of their kindred prate
while they most wicked be,
And of their parents acts they tell
and old antiquity,
Of Grandsirs deeds, and bloody spoil
of Uncles winning ground,
And though ye slothful beasts themselves
with thousand crimes abound,
And virtue lack, yet are they thought
good Gentlemen to be,
Because they come of ancient blood,
and noble ancestry.
Why bragst thou thus with others acts
and talk thy Parents praise,
When as thou art a shame to them
that lived in alder days?
The Crow a Swan would seem to be
and eke the prating Rooke,
With Pecockes feathers false ystolne
would like a Peacock loke,
But nature doth forbid, which is
the spring of nobleness.
Hereeof comes beastly minds minds
addict to Godliness,
Of her proceeds every kind.
The body causes not
Thee for to be a Gentleman
but mind procures that.
For many Clowns have bodies big
of fair and lusty state,
An ornament is nobleness
to mind appropriate,
And certain force of nature bred
which mighty things and hie,
Desires still, and things of base
estate sets nothing by,
By which the mind doth strive aloft
like fiery flame to rise,
And like the Herne, to pearce the clouds
and baser things despise
whosoever can this strength obtain
by gift and force divine
He shall be good and pain full eke,
of power in counsel fine,
And royle sustain something to do
that shall seem worthy praise,
That he himself may praise deserve
^n long and after days.
But not to al doth nature give
a thing of value such,
Yea unto few she doth it deal,
whose worthy fame so much
For ever lives in peoples mouths
long after deaths distress.
But O conditions ill to ^el,
O wondrous fransinesse:
Who would not now be called thought
a Gentleman by name:
O Knavish sort, O creatures vile
beyond all kind of shame:
Triumphing names do thee delight,
and fame abroad to yel,
Thee glory likes, then why not payne,
and vertuousnesse as well,
Contents thy mind that worthily
thou may be named than
A Gentleman, likes it thee more
a wise and sobre man,
Deserving not, than of desert
accounted for to be?
Why is not chalk for cheese as well
delighting unto thee
As lying name of Nobleness?
O vile disguised spright,
O Monkey, learn to bridle will,
to guide thy mind aright,
Reason to use, to fly the things
that shameful are and vain,
Haunt righteousie know thy self,
and labour hard sustain.
Fly flouthfulnesse, whereby thou may
attain to virtue hie
Then may thou well a Gentleman
be called, and worthy lie,
This, this, is true Nobillity,
these gifts the Gods bestowne,
And these rewards to men, unto
the unlearned sort unknown.
This way the ancient Romaines went,
by this their Empire flew
Above the Stars, and when it ceaste
then bad their state adieu.
For when as their unthrifty seed
(their Empire thus encreast)
Did spring amid more prosprous years,
they following inward preast
Great riot, plays, and wantonness
did clean for sake the state
Their fathers held before, whereby
did nobleness them hate:
And went again the Heavens to
till riot foreward wrought
And vice, whereby was Rome at length
clean sacked, and spoiled to nought.
It is not kindred thoe nor blood
nor spechelesse Imagrie,
Nor heaps of Gold that can thee make
a Gentleman to be.
Virtue, virtue, by her was made
both Hector and Alcide
Of noble state, by this again
right Gentleman was tried
That wight to whom the Iliades got
an everlasting name.
With diverse other worthy states
of still abiding fame.
Why bragst thou that thou dost descend
of noble stock and blood?
Great spres thee got, what then, if thou
thy self be nothing good?
If thou a villain do defile
and stain thy family
Then is thy blood no honour sure
but mere reproach to thee.
Thou art a Monster, shame to them
from whom thy blood doth pass
As when the stately Lion stout
begettes a sely Ass
Or Ape of Eliphant is borne:
for nobleness not so
Is left you here by Testament
nor virtue given so,
As house and land and household stuff.
this nature clear hath dealt
Unto thine Ancestors before,
which yet they all not felt.
For if thou shalt the lyne well search
from whence thou first were twinned,
Thou shalt perchace of thine own blood
full many a cobbler find,
And many a Carter clean, and one
of them thou shalt well see
was first that caused in time thy stock
such Gentlemen to be.
which as it did in time increase
so time shall it decay
For time doth here bring every thing
and time takes all away.
Amongst us all what man to come
of Pompeis blood is found?
Of Cesars line, or of that man
to whom did Affricke ground
A surname give by virtue great?
what man would once have thought
That such a stately stock as these
should ever come to nought?
The highest houses often fall
and come to mere decay:
Oft comes the little house aloft,
of man the srate always
Can not endure. The skies above
do alter mortal things.
But thou wile say, what kind of seed
is sown, such fruit it brings,
If I of noble stock do come
then shall I noble be.
Not so, for oft a squall is borne
of goodly men we see
And fair and eke welfauourde men
ill fauourde knaves have got,
Of witty men have Asses come.
The mind engenders not
As doth the corps of fathers seed,
nor in the fathers sure
It lies, to give the children mind.
This, nature doth procure.
What fruit can noble seed up bring
if skies do not agree?
Most true it is that people say
the year, not husbandry
Doth give the corn a good increase,
if see de amid the ground
Though best be cast, and thereto stars
agreing not be found,
There of will either Darnel spring
or lost it else will be,
Thus noble children for to get
the father not (we see,)
Sufficient is except the grace
of Heavens him permit.
That many base, prove noble men
of this here chances it:
Who by their virtue and deserts
obtaining fame thereby
Did after noble make themselves.
What was the Vergill hie?
What was the famous Cicere
what Cato wise, divine?
Or what else was Horatius?
all borne of franklynes lyne.
Of whom did learned Homer come
whose sire nor country we
As yet do know? Demosthenes
his father tell thou me,
And mother of Euripides?
declare the worthy line
Of Socrates, of him I say,
from whom the saws divine
Did Plato learn, who counted was
as then Apollo thought
The wisest man, him Mason got
that in the Marble wrought,
And eke a Midwyfe was his dame.
We also well do know
That many have been crowned Kings
whose parents were but lowe.
Not seldom Emperors have come
from base and small estate
To honours hye, what say thou then
sith all degenerate,
Both horse dogs and other beasts
from their long wonted kind?
For nothing can long time endure
but all things worse we find
In time to be by natures rule
and law that still endures
Of destinies, till that again
an other birth procures
Restored state, this altering
the worlds chief grace I take
This is the htest workmans praise
of little things to make
Great matters, and the ample things
reduce to small estate,
To change the face of every thing
and still to renouate
Most prudently al things in time.
I do not here deny
But that it is a goodly thing
to come of parents hye,
And to be borne of ancient blood:
for it is worthy sure.
With aid and good examples eke
such fathers do procure
Their children like themselves to be
if Fates do not say nay,
Or nature strong of force to much:
which who so seeks to stay,
As well may clime with heaped hylis
in heavens hie to dwell
Depriving Jove of regal seat
as fame to us doth tel
When Phlegurs fields the tumult felt
of ghastly Giants stout,
How then the great Enceladus,
by force did bring about
The great and huge Olimpus hill
with Ossa for to lie
While Ossa then was over pressde
with mighty Pelion hie.
But yet we count not this enough
though all therefore thee call
A Gentleman, and thou art fair
and framed well withal
Of pleasant face, and fare well
and go in proud array,
And thereby she west thy noble stock,
for this no man can say
Thou art a Gentleman, but that
dame Fortunes grace is thine,
And thou full like a golden puff
and like a marble sign.
But who regards, for now enough
it is, to have the name
Of virtuous, and of gentlemen,
each man to seem the same
Desires more than it to be.
O Gods, above that guide,
Now names of great magnificence
and titles hie beside
All men desire and arrogate,
they hunt and it possess,
The Ass a Libarde calls himself
the Ant a Lioness.
Who will not gentle, just, and wise,
well learned and honest now
Be counttd here? contented well
with bark alone of bow
And outward shadows of the thing
that under such a cloak
His wicked manners he may hide.
Now name bears all the stroke
And not the thing: well take therefore
this noble name to thee
As Pasquill is at Rome and as
both Thecues and Harlots be,
Be noble thou like marble sign.
I put the case a Gentleman
by name and eke in deed
Thou art, what good shall it thee do,
hereof what shall proceed?
Thou answer wilt, I shall have praise
and honours shall obtain.
Are these rewards not to be sought?
or seem they to be vain.
Of nobleness doth virtue breed,
of virtue praise doth spring
And honour eke. I will not (for
it seems no lawful thing)
With virtue find a fault: but if
with clear and perfect eye
Thou shalt behold the truth in deed,
then shalt thou plain espy
What grefe pains this virtue brings
and bytcer life doth make,
Though they that are of Stoik sect
this for to grant forsake.
And first we will the mortal part
behold so difficil
That who so seeks it for to keep
must needs employ his will
Great cares and labours for to take,
with nature wars proclaim,
And fight he must: for nature so
doth mind of man constrain
Both weak and prone in vice to be
and virtues enemy.
O God, full soon in vice each one
doth fall full readily,
What is the cause that nature is
of man so nought and vile?
Was this thy fault Promotheus?
or doth the fiende beguile,
And plant such ills in mortal breast
as fame doth plainly tell,
And causes love of wickedness?
The way that leads to well
Full hard and sharp and painful is.
who can we good now find?
Of his own self not one, who not
of ill and wicked mind?
Such one as fear of King or laws
prohibits to offend,
Or such as cannot well perform
the crime he doth entend.
It is not easy sure to win
and nature put to flight,
Nor for to stay the furies fell
within the heart that fight,
Wherefore it needful is to strive
from years of youthful train,
With daily flight and labours great,
the vices to restrain.
For custom wonted is to break
the force of nature sure
If that by many years it hath
been used to endure.
Man life a warrefare (ergo) is
each field the enemy
Possesses full, al full of thieves,
such gynnes who then can fly?
So many nets who can escape?
for when that fortune smyles
Then creeps in fond lasciviousness,
and stings with thousand wiles,
Fast by encampeth swelling pride
with sloth and gluttony,
And foolish boldness straight doth rise
with grief and fear thereby,
And ^ayson fell of envy and ire
doth then possess his mind.
When as he lives in great unhap
then seeks he for to find
Al means he can away to drive
his wretched poverty,
Then false he plays, he robs steals,
his lack for to supply.
Oh Lord thus wise are mortal men
between the cruel rocks
Of Charibdis and Scilla tossed,
of both receive they knocks.
And while they seek these yls to shun
to other straight they fall.
If valiant they do seek to be
then dangers dire they shall
And irksome labours also feel
if virtue they do heed
That guides the acts of mortal men,
then them commands need
Al joys away to drive and put,
and eke with saged saw
A life unpleasant for to lead.
If just and righteous law
Seek any man for to observe,
then profyt must away
This justice is of many praysde
and few retain it aye.
If prudence any man do please
he must in any case
Beware he put his trust in none,
for now in every place
Are great deceits, and perils rise,
and with simplicity
In fine who that is good receaues
most often harm we see,
He least in safety lives and feels
more hurt than al the rest
For this same world a storehouse is
where mischiefs al be pressed,
All goodness here exiled is
the simple Hares thereby
The fearful Hart, the harmless gotes
their bane come soonest by,
But rare the hunter hunts the Bear,
amid the woods so hie
The Lion reasts, go now thy ways,
and lead thou simply
A gentle life with innocents,
that sooner so thou may
Unto the greedy gaping wolves
become a grateful pray.
The world (alas) doth now abound
with tyrants over al,
The strong tread under foot the weak,
the mighty hurt the small.
The Egles chase the fearful Swans,
the Hawk do Throstles kill,
And sary simple seely doves
destroys with crooked byl.
The speckled Serpent kylls the Frogs
and Lizartes up doth eat
And in the woods the greatest beasts
of lesser make their meat.
Thou monsters also doest possess
O seas of mighty power
That with a gaping greedy throat
the little fysh devour.
Not sea, not earth, not air is safe,
the enmy every where
Is now at hand, it profits small
to live vnhurtful here.
Behold how good is virtues part
that goodness here doth train,
For when ye have it gotten once
with labour and great payne
Amid your enmies al she doth
you thus unarmed send.
But thou wilt say, such vertuousnesse
do laws and Kings defend.
O would to God that this were so,
but now in every place
With money laws corrupted ar^
and eke the Princes grace
Is pleased with precious gifts and suit,
the laws set them on rack
That either have no pens to pay
or friendship else do lack.
The other escape as innocents
howsoever judgment try:
Like as the fly that smallest is
in weaved Cobweb hye
That Spider makes remains wrapped
where if a greater stray
She breaks the nets, flies abroad
The laws (as well doth say
That Barbarous sage of Scythia)
the seely soul doth tie
Where as the rich and mighty men
burst through full easily.
The other part of virtue, that
doth search with studious payne
And for to know the causes hyd
of nature, doth obtain,
And froth to learn, that scarce you can
at any time come by:
How hard and full of payne it is
they know that it do try.
First under masters rule with strypes
they are constrained to live,
And there account of lessons hard
with fear and tears to give:
Shut up as it in prison were
whereby they may not go
Abroad, without the tyrants leave
although them forces thoe
The office of the Campo Club,
restraint of Blathers might,
Though hunger prick, and lust to play
wherein they most delight.
But when the years of youthful state
approaching present stand,
Then need requires more diligence
some one then seeks the land
Wherein Anthenor last arrived
with raging floods to strive
Of Venice gul^e, to Naples else
through Tuscan seas doth drive:
An other fast to Perouse sails
or gayneward Rome do f^eete,
There from his country far exiled
with many woes to meet,
With lack of meat and quiet sleeps
and want of Venus play.
On books with study for to loke,
applying day by day.
For otherwise can none be learned
except with untrue fame,
For few are learned now in deed
but many are in name.
Joys hurt them much pleasures ^ke
that seek for to attain
To top of learnings palace hie:
for this beats back again
Their minds from treading crabbed paths
by which the journey bends
To fair Mineruaes holy house.
For he that thus intends
A name throughout the world to get,
must suffer daily payne.
Great griefs hereby some men with ill
digestion left sustain,
Of many whilst to much they read
both sight and eyes decay,
By study great their stomach raw
their colour falls away.
Then leanness comes with wayward age
nor marvel is it thoe,
Since for to know the truth doth styll
beyond man nature go,
And proper is to God alone.
Like as the Owl of night
Can not behold the shining Sun,
with clear and perfect sight:
So fares the mind of man as oft
as it intends to fly
Aloft, to search the secret things
falls headlong straight from hye.
Now mortal men dare reach at things
to Gods appropriate,
And foolisher they prove themselves
the more they seek the state
Of things whereof the knowledge doth
pertain to them no whit?
Except that God grant them from hye
both reason grace and wit.
But happy are the Angels all
for they the world do know
What thing it is, how much, how great
whereof it first did grow,
The Lord and maker of the same,
all things that may be thought,
The Causes hid, the privy strengthes
whereby all things are wrought.
This is the life that they do lead
and this their pleasure all:
On meat or sleep they never think
to griefs they are not thrall,
No hope of gain, no fear of loss
doth cause them for to fret,
But always are of perfect power
this knowledge true to get.
Sapience to Angels doth belong
and Gods above you see
Where only prudence doth pertain
to men that mortal be
Whereby they may take good advise
from harms and hurts to fly
And gather things that may give aid
and live here quietly.
What thing to do and what to leave
to man doth prudence show
Therefore who wishes well to live
and eke where thorns do grow
With feet vnpricked for to go,
let him seek her to know.
Who will not him account a fool
that things of greatest gain
Forsaking quite, doth seek to get
things strange and also vain,
Who seeks above his reach to rove
and while he climes to hie
Comes tumbling down like Icarui
in waters deep to lye?
The Tod that late did seek to match
the Ox in drinking vain
His panche asunder burst thoe
doth never drink again:
while as sir Phaeton sought to rule
the bridled jade on hye
with earthly hand, was he not forcde
in Padus streams to lye
His life and chariot both resygnde
with this unhappy fall?
The prudent man contains himself
within dame natures wall
Nor more he dare than him becomes
except that God him moves:
Let mortal men such things regard
as mortal men behooves.
Let them not search beyond their power
least if they climb to hye
They headlong fall and prove themselves
a laughing stock thereby.
As if an Ox would upward clime
abroad his flight to take,
Or if an Ass a Lute would sound
melodious noise to make.
But let it be that one obtain
all arts in memory,
By which he many books can make,
what good gettes he thereby?
what just reward shall conteruaile
the pains that he endures?
Fame, praise, and glory, thou wilt say
reward to him procures,
His name thereby shall ever live,
and always eke remain.
But (...) would have the well perpende
(...) (...) view more plain
What praise, what fame, and glory is.
For many things we see,
In other shapes than in their own
transformed for to be
Which with a cloak and shadowing mist
deceive the mind and eyes.
Hereof good things are counted nought
and evil good likewise:
All foolishness hereof doth spring.
Full oft is Copper tried
In Silver round enclosed to lye,
oft Gold doth Iron hyde,
And purest shells within contain
the nuts that rotten be,
In skins of sheep full oft to lurk
the wily Wolf you see.
Do not the gorgeous hangings hyde
the dusty mouldred wall,
Where gaping riftes unseemly sit
and worms consuming crall?
There is a sharper sight that sees
what hyd in secrete lies,
Who uses this shall judge aright
and wonders see with eyes.
I here demand what fame doth help,
what praise? or what renown?
To them that sleep? or unto them
whom death hath stricken down?
No more for troth than doth the harp,
the deaf vnhearing wight,
No more tha gorgeous plays doth please
the man that lacks his sight.
Thou answerst here, that they that live
and they that here awake
Rejoice therein, and for the same
no perils they forsake,
But breath and blood do both resign
this thing for to obtain.
Ambition many doth enforce
and drive to glories gain
Much like a spur, and many brings
to tops of virtue hye
With pricks, provoking sluggish folk
by force of sword to try
Some worthy thing, and if they nil^
by force perform the same,
That then by wit they take in hand
some thing of worthy fame.
Yet is ambition sure a vice
and no man will we see
Be called so, and they that are
ambitious, counted be
Both vain and proud of naughty mind
as once the Romains war,
Requested of the common sort
(rejecting shame afar)
As oft as they their voices sought
with humble suit did pray
Good will of Rascals for to get
that they might bear the sway
In common wealth, their own things left
whereby they might go ^et
Amid the streets with train of men
and stately countenance set.
For her own self is virtue sought,
and not for honours sake,
Though she of right deserves sure
chief honours for to take.
No virtue moves the common sort
they rather her despise
Wherefore must Fortune favour needs
and riches eke suffice.
Then praise renown and worthiness
will also present be.
In every place if living lack
doth virtue beg we see.
But yet it forces not if that
the donghill cock do guess
A precious stone as nothing worth,
this makes not it the less
Of value: so the virtuous man
content with each degre
Despising praise of common sort
regards not vanity.
The face that well preporcioned is
requires no painted hew,
And of it self may bare be shewde
the gold that tried is true.
But he that virtue is without
doth counterfeit the same
And vnderneth disguised cloak
procures a virtuous name.
wherefore if thou dost well discern
thou shalt behold and see
This mortal life that here you lead
a Pageant for to be.
The diverse parts therein declared
the changing world doth show
The maskers are each one of them
with lively breath that blow.
For almost every man now is
desguised from his kind
And vnderneth a false pretence
they sely souls do blind.
So move they Gods above to laugh
with toys and trifles vain,
Which here in Pageats fond they pass
while they do life retain.
Fame, glory, praise, and eke renown
are dreams and profitlesse
Because with chance they are obtaynd
and not by vertuousnesse.
But let it be they granted are
to such as worthy be
Tel me do they the body good?
no whit I promise thee.
Help they the mind? as much for truth,
they blow them up before
Depriving them of sobrenesse
they make them careful more.
For he that after honour seeks
must cap and crouch full low
With bribing gifts beseeching men
his simple state to know.
This is therefore a wretched life
and full of business,
With envy oft it compassde is
and oft in great distress.
But he that virtue true can get
he lives most quietly
And happy enough, let him commit
the rest to Gods on hye.
Sufficient honour unto man
is to deserve the same,
For to the unworthy honour dealt
you can not honour name,
To such it is a burden great
and more a scornful thing
As when upon the stage a fool
comes dressde up like a King.
Now will I here declare and tel
of man the mischiefs al
As soon as he from mothers womb
with blood embrued doth cral,
He strayghtway cries, and weeping luck
him brings to wretched life,
For seeing well by nature shewde
the cares and bitter strife
Wherewith this mortal life abounds.
So deep with groaning wind
The merchant sighs, and fears as oft
as he doth cal to mind
The perils great that ships are in,
the force of Pirats hand,
The boisterous winds, raging Seas,
with rocks and drenching sand.
Then by and by but scarce yet borne
him binding bonds do hold,
And straight his tender joints and limbs
the swaddling clothes do fold:
As tokens ill of bondage great
that he in time must wear,
For who is free? laws, kings crimes
have al thing subject here,
And each man serves for hope of gain
or else with force constraynd.
Al beasts as soon as they are bred
with lymmes are straight sustaynd.
And walk abroad immediately,
where man is nothing so,
But long his mouth and mind he lacks
and strength of limbs to go.
Much like a sounding picture made
with crying never styll
Disturbing al men night and day
with voice and wailings shrill.
And when on limbs he stiffer stands,
and words can well pronounce
Then bound he is, and suffers threats,
then masters on him bounce,
With lashing strypes, and oft his sire,
oft mother on him lays,
Sometime his brothers buffets fly,
sometime his stepdames frayes,
with blows not few that stepsyre gives
and when this age is past
Then lusty youth approaching comes,
and strength increases fair.
Now from his mouth he shakes the bit,
now council none he hears,
He rages now with furious mode,
and burns in youthful years,
With rage and riot runs he mad,
and rash without advise,
No counsel will he take therein,
but witty saws despise.
No dangers now he doth esteem
so he the thing obtain
Whereto lascivious lust him moves
and force of wilful brain.
Neglecting laws he brawls fyghtes
and braynsicke runs astray,
The greatest part of youth are now
with surfeits led away.
A few whom fear, or shamefastness
or wisdom doth restrain,
Their youthful days uprightly lead
and void of vicious stain.
Now graver age and wiser comes,
and cares with her she brings,
And labours hard, then toils the man
about a hundred things,
And al the means he can he seeks
his living to provide,
At home he never idle stands,
but here or there must ride,
In town, or else at field he works
with labour great and payne,
His wife, his children and his men
whereby he may sustain.
Alone for al he cares then,
he tastes no daynty meat,
Nor queer sleeps, but forward nows
him drives ambition great
And gives him rule in common wealth,
where while for honours hie
The fool doth gape, he malice doth
and mischienes great come by.
Then wrinkled age with hoary hairs
encrocheth in apace
The body fades, the strength abates,
the beauty of his face
And colour goes, his senses fail,
his ears and eyes decay,
His taste is gone, some sickness sore
frequents him always,
Scarce chawes his meat his tothlesse chaps
scarce walks with staff in hand
His crooked old unwieldy limbs,
whereon he scarce may stand.
The mind like wise doth ^eele decay,
now dotes he like a child,
And through his weak and aged years
is wisdom quite exiled.
Each age therefore his mischief hath,
but mischiefs more there be,
That doth belong to every age
to al of each degree.
Sometime doth cold to much them vex
and Snowes that flakey fly,
And Northern Boreas wind so brym
when Ise doth hang full hie
On house, and when the waters deep
congealed styll do stay
Now raging heate of Summer burns
while Sun doth keep his way
Through blazing breath of Lion fierce,
the fields depriude of green,
The ground by drythe doth gape for rain
and moisture none is seen,
The herbs grass their lines resign,
the Pooles and Fens be dry
Now hunger pricks, now thirst doth grieve
and dearth doth make the cry:
Who can in verse declare to men
the sicknesses that raynes
In mortal life? the Agues hot,
the grief and raging pains
That over al the body runs?
each member poison feels,
The hand, the side, the sight, is vex
and al from head to heals
Doth grief and sickness sore sustain,
Why do I them resight?
Why seek I here the Cranes to tell
in Strimon floods that light?
Or number great of Swans that swim
in streams of Trojan land?
Oft times the mind doth lose his state
by herbs or Witches hand:
Or when at sacred Ceres feast
some fiende in breast doth lye,
Or when possessed with Bacchus force
abroad with rage they fiye,
Though grief with ire and covetousness
ambition and delight
As much the senses do confound
as doth of wine the might
Procuring darkness to the mind.
If truth we therefore say,
Al drunk with beastly affects of mind
are most men at this day,
But few (alas) there can be found
that reel not here and there,
That can discern what they should do
with beams of eyesight clear:
And guide them selves by reasons rule.
Here of advisedly
One said the number endless was
of fools abroad that fly.
For who needs not Helleborus
that gives the purging stools?
But seven wise the Greeks could find,
among ten thousand fools.
The nurse and dam of mortal kind
dame Folly sure is thought
Without whose grace all thing would fade
and men wold here do nought,
She Captain chief are wars begun
and al that thereto long.
As armour bright, and Targets fair
with Ancents eke among,
Where colours fair abroad do blase
with sundry sort of beasts,
Of her comes plays and dances fine
and drunken Bacchus feasts,
All nice delights and wanton gestes
with suits of fond array
From her doth come, with heaps of books
compiled day by day.
The floods of trifles fond do flow
by her, and every thing
Most part at least that man here doth,
proceed from such a spring.
But now the woeful hurts and harms
and doleful destiny
That man sustaines, can none declare
though eloquent he be,
Now drowned in fluds here sinks thereon
and unto fyshes great
The simple wretch of soul depriude
becomes a dainty meat.
An other down from house doth fall
and shows a tumbling point,
And through his hast receives a clap
that cracks his chiefest joint:
Or batters sore his tender limbs
and some the lightnings smite
Or tempest kills, on some again
the falling house doth light,
And doth vnlode him of his brains,
some fire fries to death,
With hurtful herbs or Mushroms vile
some yield their vital breath.
And some when as to fast he eats,
while greedy guts do gripe,
Doth overcharge his piece with lumps
that stops his drinking pipe.
How many tears the raging beast
with teeth something to keen,
With Iron shoes of Horses flame
how many hath been seen
And many goarde with wild Bulls horne
that roaring mad doth bring?
What should I show the dangers great
that man to man doth bring?
No beast he needs more to fear
than fellows of his own:
So many knaves and thieves hereby
and persons vile are known,
So many witness false that bear,
so many vicious slaves,
So many living on the spoil,
and cut throat swearing knaves,
Disturbing reast of mortal men
and in none other plight,
Than doth the merry beasts disturb
the Lioness in sight.
He with his tongue procures harm,
he with his sword doth fray,
The greatest sort with craft doth hurt,
one robs in open way,
An other filcheth privily:
some sort there also be,
That under cloak of friendship strong
or of Hypocrisye,
Such men deceive as they do know
to be of credit light.
All men almost (O wicked kind)
in others harm delight,
The brother scarce may brother trust,
each man his friend must fear
The father of his son in doubt
doth live, sure Hell is here,
The furies and the stinking floods
that lye in Lumbo lake
The gaping grenning Helhound wood
and all that Hell doth take.
Sleep only peace to man doth bring
amid his fleering life,
Nothing than this (if dreams fray not)
more sweet or void of strife:
For cares and labour it extles,
and with his pleasant wings,
The wretched body resting brodes,
and sweere estate him brings.
Yet nature seems this rest to hate
and ordainde hath hereby
The stinging Gnat and biting Flea,
to vex continually
With twinging prick this pleasant joy,
whereby both night and day
Might mischiefs ever present be.
More better far away
Therefore is death, than picture his,
For who so once the seas of life
in joyful boat hath past,
And in the quiet haven fair
his Anchor safe hath cast,
With merry heart doth laugh to scorn
the blasts of raging wyndes
With tempests black, and Leucoths head
which floury Garlands byndes,
Doth honour much, and Melic^rt
with gifts he doth salute,
And safe amid the shore he joys
with plays of sundry suit.
Death ends al pain, al bonds doth lose,
death causes fear to fly,
And dangers all by death are forede
to rest eternally.
And as no grief nor pain thee vexed
before thy Sire thee got,
So shalt thou feel no grief nor pain
when death her dart hath shot.
Who can conceive the times as ill
he felt his birth before?
Or judge of days he never saw
or shall see never more?
Or who will once dispraise the night
as wretched, nought or ill
Wherein possessed of deadly sleep
he senseless lay full still?
For what is death continual sleep.
what sleep? for small time death.
But many think souls never die
but after loss of breath
The dead they say do live again,
and flesh forsaking quite
As cockels from the shell outdrawne
to Pluto take their flight:
And downward headlong fast they run
in kingdom black to sail.
There fain they woods of Mirtel trees
where woeful lovers whale.
There rivers run with flaming floods
and dreadful Monsters be
That poyso some, with gaping throats,
their places may you see
Of diverse form, where Infants cry,
and where the gilty Ghosts
The furies fierce of Hell do burn,
and whip fast lynckd to posts,
And where the pleasant fields do lye
with goodly green arrayed,
As due to blessed men that here
their pagents well have played.
But other now say otherwise
and souls they grant remain
But those that well in earth have lived
with stars above shall rain,
And they again that like to beasts
have serude licentious mind,
And God neglect, in form of beasts
to live are all assinde:
In brutish shape to wander long
by judgment just are made,
Till time that purged front their crime
they come to highest grade.
Which things in deed if they were true
death fearful might be thought,
Or at the least a better life
and void of sin be sought:
For to the just hereby is got
the joys and pleasures true,
Whereas the wicked shall receive
their pains and merits due.
But whether that the dead do live
or that they nothing be
And soul with body hath his end,
pertains not to me.
For I me thinks have said enough:
enquire of Sister mine,
Whom Grecians, wisdom ever call,
these thoughts she doth defyne,
And always searches secrete things
and verity doth show,
Her teaching, well thou may attain
the state of souls to know.
Except it serve to tell thee that
death is not to be dred,
At least unto the just that here
a righteous life have led:
For either quiet rest they have
in sleep that still doth last,
Or happy else they shall receive
rewards for virtue past.
wherefore go to live Godly now,
put vice from mind away,
So death shall seem but light to thee
and grave thee not shall fray.
But now in mind these words revolve
both speak and think this thing:
What hurt shall death to me procure
what loss shall grave me bring?
No whit for troth. what will it have?
of riches me deprive.
But riches then I shall not need,
for nothing then I strive.
But richest then I may be called,
for welthyest is the wight
Not that doth most possess, but he
that lacks least in sight.
Gold, silver, precious stones, and lands,
with sumptuous fine array
With other like, I will despise,
as things that I not way:
Nor pleasure past shall grieve me then
no more than grieves beasts
Sweet pleasant sparkling wines to lack
or Custards fine in feasts
The things that no man doth desire
what if they not be had?
But friends children sweet to leave
will make (thou say) men sad.
why should this thing me grieve so much,
were it not hurtful more
If in my life my friends should dye
and I lament therefore
Continually? as some do write
how for Antilochus
Sir Nestor wept, as for his son
(whom slew the King Turnus
While he the Troians armies helped)
Euandre lived in woe.
I go before, and what for this
they all shall after go,
When God appointed hath their time,
and me again shall see:
If souls be ought as we believe,
as Christ declares they be.
Well whatsoever that it is
death ill I may not call
Because it riches takes away
and pleasant joys withal.
For unto us these are but lent,
the use doth nature give,
And not the thing it self she deals
to mortal men that live.
Since nothing then to me belongs
to death I will resign
Al other things that here I have
as nothing sure of mine.
What if I others goods do leave?
wherefore should I lament
If nature now do ask again
the things that she me lent?
I naked came into this world
and naked will I out.
For this world is an Inn where hostess
of men a wondrous roure:
Who for a time do use the food
that lays before their face,
Their host and therewithal doth say,
sirs take and eat apace,
Not for deserts of you we give
these things, but of good will
These pleasant dishes here we set
therewith your selves to fill
Until such time as I think good
to bid you hence depart
And say from up my table rise,
now ease with joyful heart,
But when the hour last shall come
wherein I bid you go,
With willing mind obey me then,
and place resign you thoe
To other gests that here shall sit,
let them rejoice a while
with dishes these: who will repine
(except he be to vile,
Lack wit, or else vnthanckfull be)
hearing these words to go
From others doors, or else will sit
while he commands so?
But he shall cry come forth you Knave
and thrust him out by the ears
And ill apayd he forwards goes,
with woeful weeping tears.
Wherefore should I if he do call
that all things here doth guide
^epine to go from hence, or seek
in wretched life to bide
As many do? nor fit it is,
nay willing hence I go
And leave this fylthy world I will,
where thousand mischiefs flow,
Where faith is none, where godliness,
where justice none doth dwell,
Where peace and quietness is fled,
where vices bear the bell,
Where brother seeks the brothers blud,
where son the father hates,
Where discord evermore doth reign,
and guile in married mates.
No man there is, at least but rare,
who (if he can) not steals,
Who robs not, who doth not fain,
and who not falsiy deals.
That well this world may now be called
of thieves a gaping den.
Lo, Kings and Bishops proud beside,
by name of Godly men
The commons poor do powle and pyl,
and Citizens do shere
And simple innocents destroy.
what should I reckon here
The horedomes great committed now?
all flows with vice we see,
The naughty act do young men use,
and close misused be,
Who plants not horns in neighbours heads?
the bald religious fry
Who should be chaste, abroad with hores
or close with boys do lye:
To widows grave or tender maids,
the holy priests do crepe.
And some within their kinsfolks bed
have great delight to sleep.
Some slaves with bests themselves defile:
the fields and grove of tree
And every town is now a stews.
And harms that instant be
And dangers great that haps to men,
and labours great and sore,
And al the superstitious sort
of false religious lore.
What need we subjects now to be?
sith (O the shameful state)
Unwytty and grosseheaded fools
and they that learning hate
(To whom the dice, and Dogs to keep
with birds of ravening kind
And horses ride, with other toys
is all their chiledish mind)
Do Scepters hold, and peoples guide,
and govern Cities strong?
Here of such errors up do spring
with folishnesse among,
Hereof so many vices breed
if this thou call to mind
Thou shalt not fear this foolish world
and nought, to leave behind:
Yea thou wilt count it well that once
Calanus and his fears
Did bring to pass, who slew themselves
to escape these wretched years
And staying death with hand did haste,
nor longer would preserve
The dying Corps, nor wretched flesh
with labour long to serve.
And if religion said not nay
and laws of Plato hie
And GOD himself, I would persuade
thee forthwith for to die,
And wicked chance and wretched earth
to leave as vain and nought,
Not wine as wine desired is
but wine and good is sought.
So life as life is nothing worth
if goodness lack we see,
If it be nought, as wine corrupt
let it despised be.
For life it self we need not wysh,
nor fled it ought to be.
The worm, the fly, and every stone
and bark of every tree,
And every vile and little thing
doth life in it possess,
No kind of thing desired is
where wants pleasantness.
If it be not both life and good
I see no cause whereby,
It should be wished or may be loved.
Therefore who fears to dye
Is but a fool since he desires
such hurt and harm to bide
Both of the body and the mind
with labours long beside
Before he would al kind of grieves
with flesh from him expel,
And ever in tranquillity
and perfect rest to dwell,
Or leaving members here behind
to live for evermore,
Where he shall want no kind of thing
nor sorrow feel nor sore,
And with the saints together there
about the world to fly,
More swift than al the winds that be
beholding things on hye.
Except the dregs of vice him stay
and force him styll to dwell
Beneath in Corners deep of earth
amid the raygne of Hell.
When thus this Lady fair had said
she rose and stood by me
And on my head (refusing I)
she put the Laurel tree,
And thence departing forth she flew
where shining stars we see.
Explicit media Pars.
Libra, The seventh Book.
MY muse a lof^, raise up thy self
and use a better flite:
Mout up a hie, think it scorn
of base affairs to write.
More great renoune, and glory more,
in hautye matters lies.
Uiew thou ye Gods, and take thy course
thorowout the starry Skies.
Where spring time lastes for evermore,
where peace doth never quail,
Where Sun doth shine continually,
where Light doth never fail.
Cloud causer Southwinde none there is
nor boisterous Boreas blows,
But mylder breaths ye Western winds
where sweet Ambrozia grows.
Take thou this way, and yet sometimes
down falling fast from hye,
Now up, now down, with sundry sort
of Gates aloft go fly.
And as some hawty place he seeks
that covets far to see,
(...) The cause is first before the effect
the workman work above.
The perfect thing, because it doth
each part in it contain,
And nothing lacks, is stronger far
of greater force again.
Therefore it makes, comaunds, moves,
and so by challenge due
The cause and Auctor eke of all
it may be termed true.
But otherwise thunperfect thing
that maymde can not consist,
Is overcome, and move it must
even as the perfyte list.
It doth obey and not command,
and therefore must be named
The effect, and eke the framed work,
and not the thing that framed.
So far behind it ever ought
the perfect thing to go.
For if vnperfite were the spring
from whence all thing do ^oe,
It were but vile and nothing wrought
thereof should perfect be,
As always of thunperfect Art
imperfect work we se.
Wherefore beginnings more than one
no reason forth can find,
Because there is not to be known
but one of perfect kind.
From which, the never failing course
and order of all things
Doth come, as from the Union first
each other number springs.
Besides it pure and single is,
that mixtures all hath made:
For nothing can compounded be
but symples first is had.
For first it needful is alone
the symples to be tried,
And then in mixture all in one
compounded to abide.
Therefore no principal there is
but one, as I have taught:
Which simple in degree we judge,
and purest must be thought.
Whom if we think not for to live,
in ^rror great we fall:
If he live not, how lives the reas^,
since by him live we all?
Doubtless he li^es, and wisdom hath,
or else in order dew,
How could he frame such goodly sights
except he all things knew?
Nor doubt we must, but needs confess;
with mouth and eke with heart,
Him to be good: Can he be ill
of whom each good is part?
Can bitter ^reames at any time
from sweetest fountain run?
Or can the rivers pleasant be
of bitter spring begun?
For either nothing must be good,
or good must he be thought,
That is the spring of all the rest,
by whom the world was wrought.
Him men do call by diverse names,
but we that Latin wright
Do call him God, and more we say
that Jupiter he hight.
Who, fynce he is the first that was,
and maker of each one,
Lives of himself both good and wise,
receiving state of none.
But all by him their states enjoy,
who may lose that they have,
Whenever he list for to restrain
the thing that first he gave.
As Kyuers must leave of their course
when springs their stremes deny,
And yet it follows not therefore
the spring it self be dry:
(For of it self it yields the stream
and hanges at no mans tail:)
So God doth of himself consyst,
and therefore cannot fail.
If altogether perish should,
yet fails not he therefore,
For what consists of it self
must last for evermore.
When only of himself he s^ayes,
and needs no helper by,
When as by force he cannot quail
and will not willingly.
He is all and whole, the rest but part,
yet in no such degree,
That of those parts he purest should
himself compounded be.
But by his virtue he is all,
because he first did frame
The world so wide, and all things else
contained in the same.
All things that live and void of life,
all things that do appear,
And hidden syghts he only made,
and doth preserve them here.
In this wise therefore is he all
as seed is all the tree,
Whereof springs up the mighty boole
whose branches shadowers be.
Some doubt if God a body have,
and thus do they believe,
That nothing void of body is
that sense cannot perceue.
And therefore now we will attempt
the troth thereof to see,
Of quantity and quality
all bodies needs must be.
For by these two state sensible
the body doth receive:
Take these away what doth remain
that senses may perceive?
All quantities and qualities
compounded ever be,
And God of nature single is
as late I told to thee.
Add more to this that bodies all
of form and matter be.
Nor God can be of such a power
as bounds may comprehends,
When he abides for evermore,
least so the world should end.
Nor body none is void of bounds,
but all are measurable.
The compassed form hath his precinets,
whose fashion is most laudable.
So hath the Square and Triangle,
and all the shapes that be.
This reason proves no body is
but it may measurde be.
And thus I prove, this body here
in equal parts divide
Whereof the half let A possess
and B the other side.
I here demand if A as much as B
can do? or if these twain
Be infinite? so one shall serve,
and tother shall be vain.
If both have power determinate
the whole must have the same.
But who so seeks the unbounded thing
of bounded parts to frame,
Shall prove vnwyse and thus ensewes
the maker chief of all
No body hath. But some there be
perchance that answer shall
God is a body infinite.
hut this do I deny:
For so should he each place fill up,
and leave none void: whereby
The rest should never be contained.
so world there should be none,
Nor we remain, nor any thing
save he himself alone.
Besides, since body here in life
is of more noble state
Than sensses Corse, we must not doubt
but life of higher rate,
Than Careasse is. But here I ask
if life a substance be?
If not, then substance were more vile
and of more base degree,
Than that which substance is without.
and if you bring in this,
In suffering such absurdity
the scholemen all will hiss.
But if that life a substance be,
then body is but vain,
Since of it self is can consyst
and severed (...) remain.
And why should ^od a ^ody take
since he at liberty
Doth best enjoy his state and hath
no such necessity?
It is a thing super fluous eke,
by which the life enclosed
As prisoners like is bard the place
where it is best disposed.
Therefore that chief Almighty Prince
eternal good and wise
No body hath. Now will I show
why many do despise
This reason, and do think it vain.
the cause hereof doth spring,
That drounde in bodies gross, blinded sense,
they know no other thing
But bodies here. as through a glass
with any colour stained
Whosoever looks, each thing shall judge
of colour that is fained.
Yet must we know, and doutlesse think,
that diverse things there be,
That either void of bodies live,
or of such pure degre
Their bodies are, that neither eyes
of ours can them behold,
Nor sense discern, and so more worth
than ours a thousand fold.
Which thus perchance may proved be.
all gross and wayghty things,
How much the more of earthly drofse
annexde to them forth brings,
So much more base and viler be
than that which seems to flow
Of fine and purer matter wrought,
all metals this doth show.
For look when as by fervent heate
of Fury flames they fry,
They straightwaies melt, basest parts
wherein most earth doth lye,
As nothing worth, falls out to dross.
the purest and most fine,
With better sound and better shape
before the eye doth shine.
So Bread is best of purest meal
whereof the Masters eat,
Of grosser is the servants food,
the worst is Mastyues meat.
So Water, Wine, and Oil with like
the worthiest of them be,
Such as most clear and subtle seem
and lyghtest in degree.
So meat the baser and grosest part
by syege away doth fade
The finest part remains, whereof
Flesh, Blood, and strength is made.
What is the cause that common stones
so rude and rusty lye?
Where marble, the precious gems
do glitter in the eye.
Nought else, but that in one of them
less dross of earth is found,
In tother, gross and heavy mold
hath sight and value drounde.
Therefore more foul, and baser far
such things are indgde to be,
Wherein most earth remains, whereby
they are called of less degree.
As dross we take less gold to be,
or gold of baser mine
We can not call so justly Gold
as that already fine.
For of all Elaments the earth
the vilest hath been thought.
And as the rubbish of the re^e,
cast by, when they were wrought
Therefore the wisest workman first
did cause it lowe to lye,
That distant far it should remain
removed from the sky.
And thick in ball he cast it round,
more less and small to be,
That saints might have more plain prospect
that list the world to see.
For when God had dect the world
with Stars in trym array,
What dross remaynde he bade ye winds
to cleanse and swepe away.
Then in with hasty course they rush
their Lords award to do,
The Northwinde blows ye Southwind huffes,
the West, and East set to.
With striving blasts they swepe ye fields
and round in heap they cast
Whatsoever they find, constraining it:
the earth is framed and left.
Which, banished from the heavens hye,
straight down to center fell,
No place more far nor base appears
where nygher she might dwell.
Beside, of weaker force it is,
and eke of smaller power,
Than all the reast of Elaments are,
and feblest of the four.
For if by fervent heate of Sun
it be constrained to gape,
Or pierced with Plow, it cannot join,
nor take his former shape.
The waters if they parted be
do straight return in one,
And void of all diuisyon seems
as if there had been none.
So doth the air, and fire eke,
if these divided be,
At first they join again, so that
no sign of hurt you se.
And why? because they are more pure,
and perfect in degree,
And of their proper force alone
they always moved be.
But now the earth unwieldy thing
of nature ever stays,
And more, is cause that sundry things
can move no kind of ways.
For where most earth habounds, most weight
is found, such things apere
Less apt to move, the light more quick,
and unto life more ne'er.
For life in every thing is cause
whereby they move alone.
It needs no proof the senseless Corse
doth stir as doth a stone
Since things in life have chief estate
(for life excells all)
Doubtless the light and moving things
the chiefest we may call.
They err therefore, that do believe
no other things to be.
But such as senses gross perceive,
and eyes apparent see.
For what more subtyle is than air,
what less is felt or seen?
By which have many thought it void
as no thing to have been.
It is but s^ight: what tho? yet hath
it here a substance sure
And body is, of four chief, one,
than earth or stream more pure,
And therefore placed in hyer seat.
for things approaching ne'er
To skies, and blessed stars above,
of chiefest state appear.
Besides, are not the wyndes so pure
that no man can them see?
Yet nothwithstanding none there is
but knows that winds there be.
Which when they have a sunder burst
the bars of Eolus strong,
The monstrous Hills by force do shake,
down torn the trees along
Do lye, the Seas from channel deep
are tossed above the shores,
The clouds are caused, the lightninge flash,
the dreadful thunder reares.
Since thus their force doth rage think thou
that substance they do lack?
Because thou can not them behold,
or in thy hands them take.
To judge as senses lead is fond:
for oftentimes the eyes
In taking one thing for an other*
this error plainly tries.
As if into the clerest spring
a staff most straight be thrust,
The eye shall judge it to be Crooked
though it be never so just.
As if a boat row ne'er the shore
the shore shall seem to fly
And styll the boateis thought to stay,
the senses therefore lye:
Which many times deceived be,
and changed sundry ways
By age sometime or sycknesse* great
the force of them decays:
Nor every man hath them alike,
some thinks it fair and meet,
The thing another saith is foul,
and some do count it sweet,
That others judge of bitter taste:
the air is cold saith he,
Another saith the whether is hot,
thus senses diverse be
In diverse bodies, diverse seems,
deceived sometime by chance,
As when the drunckardsees two lights
for one, and stools to dance,
The wine in troubling of his eyes
doth much disease his sight,
The air besides deludes the sense,
sometimes it seems bright,
Now dark, now thick, now moist, now dry,
whereby we often guess
The Sun as, red as blood to be,
the Mo^e now big, now less.
Hereos doth also come to pass
when one aloud doth cry
Deceiving foolish cares a doyce
doth seem to answer ny.
By this and other means they err,
but reason is more sure.
Who finds amongst a thousand toys,
the certain truth and pure.
This reason is most dear to him
that wisdom doth retain,
Whose mind is of a lively force,
and sprite of heavenly vain.
The blunt and doltish common sort,
with blind and bleared eyes,
Doth not her see, hereof doth fault,
vain hope, and fancy rise.
This reason guides the wisest men,
Opinion leads the lowte,
Let us the steppes of reason ^read,
and ioyle her ways about,
This reason may be called the Sun
that moves in order just,
By which alone from brutsh kind
of beasts we differ must.
The dark and dim uncertain Moon,
Opinion may be named,
But what doth reason bid me write*
that many creatures framed,
Alive there are that we can not
by senses understand:
For if that God should not have made,
wych hye and glorious hand,
More noble creatures than the state
of fading mortal kind
He had not then deserved such praise
as is to him assinde,
Unperfect eke had been his rain
for vnderneth the kind
Of man the wild and salvage beasts
consyst of brutish mind,
To sleep and feed, addicted all:
and if he had not framed
No better things than here we see
the world might well be named
A fold of filthy feeding flocks
with thorns and donge set out
What should we then this God account
a mighty herdsman stout
But he created man besides:
now sure a goodly thing:
Was this his best? is this the power
of that Almighty king?
But let us try if this be true
if we may credit give:
It is not good nor reason will
that we shall this believe.
For what is man? a foolish beast
a creature full of spite
And wretched far above the reast
if we shall judge upright.
Who is not of his nature nought?
the way to vice is wide,
Wherein the feet of mortal men
continually doth siyde:
No warning, law, no payne, nor fear
can cause them for to staye.
Again the path of virtue is
a straight and painful way,
Wherein but few do use to walk
and them you must constrain.
Who is wise? the woman? or the child?
or all the Cobblers train?
The most (alas) are foolish doltes
in darkness blind we tread,
And fond affection bears the sway
by which we all are lead.
For none at all or few there be
(whom he that guides the sky
Hath chosen to himself alone)
this reason ruled by.
For who can now behold or how
may leisure we obtain,
Whereby we might search out ye troth
that secrete doth remain?
Cares pulls us back: the greatest part
of life in sleep doth wast.
The rest doth payne or sycknesse let,
or poverty doth taste,
And stouthfulnesse sometime doth hurt
and pleasure oft annoy,
Hereof springs fools wisdom eke
by this we not enjoy
For she with great continual toil
and study long is got,
And doth require a quiet mind
that troubles hinder not
The troubles of the state of man
(if I remember well)
Among my books the syrt I think
before doth plainly tell:
Of mischief, grief, and foolishenesse
alas this is the place,
And darksome den of Hell wherein
all live in wretched case
But yet the gross and common sort
do never way this thing,
But in the midst of all their toil
the foolish knaves do sing
And gaping laffe do not perceive
their own calamity,
But are when pain doth plague them sore
as ioconde as a Pie,
And suddenly doth all forget
so that some sweetness fall
Hereby doth come forgetfulness
that ryds them clean from all.
For nature wise and provident
our state did well fore see
In giving us so slender wy^
for our commodity.
For if that wisdom were in us
what man could bear the strife,
The cares, and tedious troubling to^es
of this our wretched life.
For sadness joined with cark car^
this wisdom in doth bring,
And nature seems to Foster man
with hope of hopeless thing:
Without the which each man himself
would covet to destroy.
So hope and folly medicines be
that nature doth employ
For our behove by sage advise,
least we by chance should faint,
When many mischiefs swarming thick
our witless sense doth taint.
And if no creature else excel
this man in hye degre,
The chief Creator of the world
what shall we think to be?
Of Misers, Fools, and eke of them
by whom doth mischief spring:
He shall be called a Lord, a Prince
a Father, guide, and King.
O noble power, O princely reign,
companions fine and brave,
What wants there now O God to thee?
what seek thou more to have?
Alone thou dost not now remain,
it well became thy Grace
To frame so fair a world as this
to make such creatures place.
Let Heaven serve their only use,
the Stars, the Moon, the Sun,
The Air, the Earth, the surging Seas
what else? it shall be done.
But straight they shall consumed be,
and vanish clean away:
As Snow doth fade in summers heate,
or flower in frosty day.
What state have they that do consyst
of body weak and frail:
What state baue they that in the space
of so small time do fail?
May we believe the seas and earth
alone replenished be
Which are compared to the skies
as nothing in degree,
And if the mighty compassed spear
in mind thou well dost way
thou shalt perceive the smallest Star
more great as wysemen say
Shall then so small and vile a place
so many fish contain
Such store of men, of beasts and fowls
and tother void remain?
Shall skies and air their dwellers lack?
he dotes that think th so
And seems to have a slender wit
for there are thousands mo.
That better state and better life enjoy
and far more blessed be.
Moreover if we will confess
the unfeigned verity,
This earth is place for man and beast:
beyond the clouds, the air,
And sacred sky, where peace doth rain
and day is always fair.
The Angels have their dwellings there
whom though we cannot see
(For pure and fine their substance is)
yet numberless they be.
As thick as are the sands in place
where waters ebb and flow,
As thick as stand the flowers and gras^
that in the meadows grow.
For who so thinks the Heavens hye
of dwellers void to be,
And may upon this earth so vile
so many creatures se:
He dotes deceived by ignorance,
and foolishness of mind,
And seems all drounde in earthly dross,
as beasts of basest kind.
Nor wonder I at this a whit
that happy Ilandes found
In Occean seas they say there be
where all things good abound,
Whereas no grief the life doth vex,
where no misfortunes raygne.
The shyes perchance th^ Occean sea
to name doth here retain,
Because in colour like it seems
and eke in moving round,
Each Star an Land shall be thought
why not? have we not found
That diverse houses are so called
because that far away
They severed from their fellows ^y^
who otherwise doth say
He saith not true, for if there were
such Ilandes in our seas
The Princes would not suffer them make
to pass their life in ease:
But weapon straight should conquest
to enlarge their kingdoms hye
If any passage were to them
themselves therein to lye.
What doubts Greece to fain or lye
the mother old of toys?
For doubtless Heaven, Stars, ayr^
inhabitants enjoys.
Who this denies doth malice much
the blessed saints on hye,
And eke the eternal state of God
do blaspheme foolishly
Is it not wicked blasphemy
presumpteously to say?
That Heaven lacks inhabitants
and God doth bear no sway,
But here with us and savage beasts
so fond so full of shame,
Nay certainly God could and would
more noble creatures frame,
That lead their life in better place
whereby his praise esteemed
Should be the more and larger power
and world more perfect deemde.
For making sundry sorts nobler things
the beauty more doth shine
Of this same world and more appears
his Majesty divine.
But if these shapes be pure and void
of body coms the dout,
Or whether they consist of parts
as we do round about.
Yes truly reason doth declare
all creatures that do dwell
In fire, and air, they bodies have.
if they had not, as well
The air and fire should desert be,
and places void should grow
For none but bodies place possess
as wise men's words do shows.
But wither shall these bodies dye?
we must confess it so
A long and joyful life they lead
at length with death they go,
For if that air and fire in time
corruption shall deface,
Why should not all such creatures dye
as live in such a place?
For placed things do follow still
the places nature plain.
But some perchance desires to know
what fashion they retain,
We may be sure their beauty is such
that they do far excel
All creatures fleeting in the seas
or all on earth that dwell:
Which neither God permittes nor we
could view with carnal eye,
But they that pass their life in stars,
and in the purest sky,
Doeneuer dye for age nor years
cannot the strength abate,
Of those so gorgeous glistering stars
or harm the heavens state.
And eke we must believe that those
which live in skies so bright
Their bodies are more fair, more fine,
of greater force, and might,
Then all the reast that live between
the earth, and Stars above:
Or in the elements dwell where time
and age can them remove:
But what do they? they do rejoice
with sense and reason right,
Now using one, and now the other
and live in such delight,
As wit of man cannot devise,
nor mortal tongue can tell.
True world, and true est ate is there,
true joys, and treasures dwell:
We only have the shadows here
and counter faytes retain,
Which lasting but a little space
like wax do melt again.
Our world is but a figure plain
of those so princely powers,
And as our world the painted Map,
so it surmounts ou^es.
Above these Heavens that we name
and creatures all beyond,
A better world vncorporate
that senses doth transcende
And with the mind alone is seen
there are that think to be,
And with thassured troth it seems
not much to disagre.
If mind excells far the sense
why should the sense behold
A world alone with perfect things
and creatures many fold.
And mind without his proper world
a Cyphar should remain
And none but dreams and fansyes fine
with shapes and shadows vain.
Thus either nothing is the mind,
or else hath nature wrought
A world agreing to the same
wherein contained are thought
Unfeigned, chief; and purest things
which better far away
May of themselves consyst tha things
that senses compass may.
This same first framed world doth pass
the world that senses see.
As much as mind excels the sense
in perfecter degree:
In which the chiefest light is God
where saints as Stars appear,
And therefore more stranger things are there
then are perceived here,
Sith it is perfecter by much
for nothing there doth dye,
No time, nor motion, there hath rule
all fixed continually,
As void of place and safe from harm
they all do seem to be,
There are the causes of each thing,
and springes of all we see.
The world that senses may perceive
from this same world doth spring,
And seems here a figure sure,
and shadow of that thing:
All things more perfect there
and all things whole appear,
We have but portions of the same
which are increased here
By natures fault and great deffect.
so hearts a number be,
For virtue one above creates
the hearts that here we see
By her the subtle Fox is framed
by her the Lyons live,
And so of all the other beasts,
that this our world doth give,
Which seem in number diverse sorts
but all are one in kind
That from these powers at first to come
are every one assinde.
None otherwise than Carpenters
in Cities great of name,
Each one applying well his work
do diverse matters frame.
Wherefore this world doth stad of parts
the other doth consyst
Of al, and living by themselves
of distance as they list
But some have thought yt every Star
a world we well may cal,
The earth they count a darkened star
whereas the least of all
The God doth rain that underneath
the clouds hath placed his chair
That fosters all the creatures here
in seas, in earth and air
A Lord of shadows and the guide
of shapes that lively be
To whom is dealt the charge of things
and rule of all to see.
Which for because they do not last
but pass with time away
Do scarce deserve the name of ought
but shadows that decay.
The same is Pluto as I judge,
of whom the Poets old,
Do often sing, and say that he,
the King dome black doth hold.
For underneath the clouds is night,
above are al things clear,
Where light doth last for evermore,
and brightness styll appear.
To him as to the worst of all,
thalmighty Lord did give
The vtleft reign, the rest more good,
in better stars to live.
But yet is no man sure of this,
for who doth know so well,
Gods mysteries? who hath been there,
and turned again to tell.
No state of man is such, our mind
doth faint in things so hie:
The Owl cannot behold the Sun,
with pure and perfect eye.
Each one presuming of his wit,
inuenteth matters new,
But Poets specially, to whom
most confidence is dew:
For they may by autority
of any matters write:
With Bacchus rage they moved be,
and with Apolloes sprite.
Though nothing is that doth forbid
the mad man truth to say,
Sibylla used to tell the troth,
in madness as she lay.
Let this suffice (my promise kept)
to prove that numbers be
Of creatures far excelling us,
which no mans eyes can see:
Yet do they live and reason use,
and as some wise men say,
Such are our souls departed once,
that never shall decay.
So Plato, so Pythagoras,
and so Plotinus thought,
And so have many Poets erst,
in pleasant verses wrought.
Therefore it seems labour worth
(a thing most mete to tel)
Of this for to entreat at large,
for what doth more excel?
Than thoroughly man to know himself:
for children understand
Where of the Body doth consyst,
even earth, of flyme, and sand.
But harde it is so plain to know
the nature of the mind,
Wherefore presuming on my Muse
with all the force I find
Bestowing all my wits thereon
I will attempt to know
The perfect nature of the same,
and plain in verses show.
That done forsaking Libra soon
Scorpius, thy crooked sign
I entre will, and destiny
thy fatal force define
If destiny do not deprive
our Port of his will.
And for because in doubtful things
to bring the greater styll
The methode and the order best
is plainly to begin,
With such as are assured most
so will I do herein,
For if the first beginnings here
shall seem obscure in sight,
The sequel shall uncertain seem
and in the worser plight
If slender the foundation be
in small time and space,
We shall behold the buildings fail
that we thereon do place.
The effects more plain and manifest
than causes seem to be
At them therefore we will begin
and all things open see.
With moving now (for every thing
that life remains in
Doth move alone, first sign of life)
therefore we will begin.
For of it self the bodies rests
and members rots away
The cause (perhaps) that moves is heate
or blood that bears the sway.
But things alive are often styll
when as they list to rest
Though heate blood in them abound,
therefore appears best
That will is cause of moving here
yet sometimes they desire
To move and cannot stir therefore
doth moving both require
The one commands, the other works,
for will can nothing do
If power do lack. But how comes it
that men move to and fro?
Because (mind teaching) will sees good
and moving straight doth turn
To that it sees, as Fyrre is drawn
by that which makes it burn.
Like as the iron from his place
the Lodestone upward draws,
And as the Aumber lyfteth up
the little slender straws:
The world in such a wondrous sort
the Almighty Lord did frame,
That many things do well agree
as joined in the same,
And many things do disagree
and keep continual fight,
Whereby some men have surely thought
that strife, and frendeship might
Be justly called beginnings chief,
by which are all things wrought,
Thus good first moved by which ye mind
to motion quickly brought,
Doth move the parts pricks forth
the body here and there:
But yet ws think suffices not
one good to all things here
Nor one desire to all alike:
so this some that estemes
And every one retains his joy
as best to nature seems.
The Child we see desires the things
that aged men forsake,
For as the bodies seem to be
so mind and will do take:
Wherefore we sometime covet this,
and sometime long for that,
And that which late we did esteem
we now do seem to hate.
Because our changing body is
disposed diuerslye,
And draws the nature of the mind
the way that it doth wry.
Hereof comes thyrst, and hunger sharp,
and lust to Ladies laps.
The body many things do change
as age, or time, or haps,
As also meat, and drink, sometimes
and air doth change it quite,
And Stars doth alteration make
as learned men do write.
Wherefore nothing in sight alone
but state of body here
Doth cause us diverse things to will
and moves, it doth appear.
But some by reason rather led,
do walk as she doth show,
And only are by virtue drawn:
but such are very few.
For fleshly fond affections here
the mind do over run,
None otherwise than mists do dark
the clear and shining Sun.
Lo this the cause why body moves.
the moving force of mind,
Whom moved will doth still command
obayes as is assinde.
And in the parts that quiet are
if nothing them do let
Is poured out and causes them
now here now there to jet.
But why should labour weary them
whereof should this arise?
As fainting feet in travail, and
the akyng arm oft tries.
The cause hereof, is blood resolved
by force of fervent heate,
(For to much moving it inflames)
decays in fuming sweat.
None otherwise than Fevers fierce
the creature pale consumes.
When blood or other humour hot
thorowout all the members fumes
Doth life support and body feeds,
which whylest it quickening makes,
The moving force possessing all
the body quivering shakes
The heate and heated blood beside
doth breed a lively spright:
As waters warmde with beams of Sun
do yield a vapour light.
This spirit enclosed within the bowels
Thorough all the veins doth run,
And ne'er to her doth serve the life
in what she will have donne.
But those in heavy sleeps that lye
how should they moving make?
As some do in their steepes arise
and weapon up do take,
Some in the stable takes his horse,
some wrytes as many say,
And some hath erst been seen a sle^pe
upon the Lute to play.
It must be known that of the thing
the Image doth remain
In us, of all that we do see,
or senses can retain.
This makes us think we see the face
that late we gazed on,
And that we seem to hear the words
were vtred long agone.
These forms within the secrete celles
enclosed in the brain,
A vapour moves, which to ascend
the stomach doth constrain
And mind deluded so doth move,
the body styres thereby,
If the resemblance be of force
that in the head doth lye.
But tail of L ysart, or of Snake
that cut in two doth sprawl,
Doth will it move? Or force of mind?
that Greekes do fansye call,
As they whom rage of madness moves,
or to much drink arayes,
Or dreadful dreams do cause to shake:
or happens other ways.
Perchance amongst the knotty parts
of this divided tail,
The lively spirit enclosed doth search
all means for to prevail,
In breaking out and wynding parts
doth wry as best it may,
And striving long through passage small
doth get at length away.
Or that same part of mind that feels
divided doth remain
In tail cut of, and causes it
to turn and turn again.
Yet I suppose that every thing
wherein no judgment lies
Can feel no grief, nor nothing else
that we can here devise.
For chiefest force by which we feel
from knowledge ever flows.
who knows judges most feels most
and most rejoicing knows.
But fools and doltes care less for all,
less harmed, less fearing styll,
They feel not cold, nor heate so much
scarce know they good from ill.
Not for because it smartes, therefore
the tail divided shakes,
For nought it feels, because the strength
from which it knowledge takes
Is not in it, but in the head
in better place did lye.
Wherefore the former cause I judge
the troth to go more ny.
Lo, thus therefore is moving made
by which all creatures go.
Yet in the reasons past before
we put this one thing to,
That sundry times the present good
when it might be achieved
Doth nothing move, nor is desired
because tis not perceived
Thus knowledge seems of moving cause
or chiefest as we see:
For who desires, or seeks the thing
he knows not what to ber?
For will h^r self of proper force,
is altogether blind,
And cannot any thing desire
without the light of mind:
By whom if she be not enformde
she takes she untoward way,
And with the she we of good beguiled
her virtue doth decay.
Of moving this shall here suffice,
now let us seek to know
How living things do wax so great,
what causes them to grow,
And why at certain time they cease.
a fiery spirit doth rain
Thou gives life to every thing,
that carcass doth contain.
This heate doth lively moisture feed,
as flame of Candle bright
(When soon withdraw himself fro us)
the Oil preserves in light.
This in the stomach boils the meat
whereof the finest spread
Abroad, the synowes, bones, and flesh,
with pyth, and blood are bread.
And all the body doth increase
as plants with showers of rain,
And warmth of Sun them comforting
doth rise and spring amain.
If that this fire be much of force
and moisture equal here
As much as heate shall seem to need
the increase shall great appear.
At length it makes an end and stays
when spent is all the heate.
Which fading body fades, as shows
in them whose years are great,
For wasted they like pined Ehostes
their aged lymmes do crook
And stouping low with hollowed eye
upon the earth do look.
For fire is gone, and lively heate,
and moisture doth decay,
Without the which no life remains:
as Lamps no longer may
Give out their light than oil doth serve
but leaves, and darkness brings.
Then let us now the moving show
of mind and whence it springs,
A thing both dark, and harde to find,
but yet we will assay
With all our force to touch the troth
as ne'er as well we may.
And first of rage, that boldneth men,
and dangers doth despise,
Increases strength and gives force,
as much as shall suffice,
Which moving all as desperate
upon our foes we fly,
And bloody battle to begin
with sword in hast we hye.
The cause thereof is blood enflamde,
and heart that sends out fire,
And bitter gall abroad dispersed
for Gall is house to ire,
And choler matter ministers
to rage and fury blind,
Hence comes that creatures lacking gal
are not of wrathful mind,
Embracing peace, refuse to fight,
but they whose blood doth burn,
And greater rage of heate retain,
to anger soonest turn.
So youth, and so such drunken mates
whose heads hath brink diseased,
Upon a smallest cause do snuff,
the mind therefore displeased
Doth blood and choler myngle straight
then hand for weapon calls,
And skirmish comes, thus cuts are carved,
and wound wide open falls.
For first the mind offended is,
and vexed by miury,
Which troubled, moves ye body straight
by these it seems they lye
That say the mind can never styre,
for if it never move,
The body styll to stand and staye
it always doth behove:
For diverse mouings do declare
a diverse mover plain
The Sun doth oft change in course
and shadows change again.
What is the cause that Organs give
now one now other voice?
But hand yt, shyftes from diverse kayes
doth cause a diverse noise.
The mind affection inward first
doth take and close concele,
And makes some part or other serve
when she will it reucle:
Disclosing straight to it whatsoever
within in secrete lies,
To the end that plame it may appear
and open to the eyes.
None otherwise than when the king
unto his faithful friend
Declares the secretes of his mind
and after doth it send
To be proclaimed in every place
that it may plain appear.
Hence springs love for when the mind
doth fansye pleasant ger.
She makes the heart a minister
and so doth love declare,
In heart, love, wrath, fear, lust, hope,
with joy, and also care
As in a tower with mind do dwell
and these as there begone
By means of other parts through al
the body forth do run.
But of this same in other place,
more plainly shall we write,
If God therein do favour us,
and Muses grant us sprite.
Suffi^eth now affections first
of al things else to be
Within the mind, the causes sprung,
of things without we see,
And after they by member, blood,
or other humours might,
Are spread abroad in every part,
and so thrust out to light.
For seeing mind and body are ioynde,
the moving needs must be
Common to both, the harms al one,
and change in like degree:
Whatsoever thing the one perceyues,
the other feels it,
They both in nature do agree,
so strongly are they knit.
But now because we seem to touch,
the typ of Scorpions toe,
Let us, my Muse, of senses speak,
here briefly as we go:
Five senses nature gave to suc^
as perfect creatures be,
But unto some he dealt not all,
which may be worthily
Unperfect named, as Moles, worms
and Scallops of the bay,
And Wilks, Irchin ek^ whom pricks
encompassed round array.
Aniong these senses al, the sight
is thought the best to be,
Because it is the chiefest means
wherewith the mind doth see,
Declaring plain the wondrous works beasts,
that nature here doth frame
such flowers, such fruits, such her us, such
such plants, such stones of name,
Such sundry sorts of mettalles fair,
and showing also plain,
What Fyshes Proteus feeds in seas,
what Monsters there remain,
And more than this the stately rooms
wherein the Gods do lye
The glistering globes of stars above
and Phoebus shining hye:
Besides the things that men do hear
that tongue can not display,
This sense therefore doth all excel
and fairest far away:
In which the seat and chiefest place
wherein the mind doth dwell
Is thought to be, for when we meet^
or talk in presence tell,
Upon the others eyes we case
as man, and mind, and all
Did there consyst, who so the eyes
the glass of mind doth call
Shall say the truth, for pleasant love
in them doth first give light:
There hate and ^iercenesse doth appear
with mild and gentle sprite:
There sadness, joy and mischief shows
with zeal and wisdom great,
And folly, pride, and fear and rage,
with fault and wrathful heat.
But whereof doth the sight proceed?
the minds let other see
Of learned men, I briefly show
as I think best to be.
One life there must be known to be
of substance eke so fine,
As sight can never comprehend
of force and power d^uine.
Which nature deals God doth give:
this feeds and makes to grow,
Doth breed, doth move, doth hear, taste
doth smell, see, feel, and know:
Which is the chief and greatest power
most ne'er to saints on hye.
These powers she through ye body spreds
in certain parts to lye,
And by the eyes doth light let in,
and sundry colours see,
And judges plain of every shape,
and all things else that be:
Receaueth also by the nose
the smells of sundry sort,
And by the ears doth understand
sound noise and great report.
By tongue descernes each kind of taste,
by feeling knowledge brings
Of hot from cold, of harde from soft,
of rough from smothest things.
Companions five these are to life,
and faithful servants sure,
That shows her all, without the which
she nothing could procure.
The eyes therefore as glassye made
and as the Crystal cl^re,
Like as a glass receive the shapes
that we do look on here,
By power whereof are things desernde
if that the eye be sound.
These sorts of things unto the mind
(for as in highest ground
Her stately seat in head the holds)
the eye doth plainly show,
Whose image truly shadowed there
she wise doth straight ways know,
So wondrously she doth perceive
a sundry sort of sounds,
When in the helthy vnharmed ears
the air thereof reboundes.
For air of slendrest substance is
and moves by and by,
Which beaten with the noise doth shune
and from the stroke doth fly,
And pearcyng breaks into the ears,
though close be kept the glass,
And close the door, so fine it is
that inward it will pass.
For even the fyshe when fy^hers harde
with poales the floods ^e plashe,
For fear of noise fly fast from thence
and thick in nets do mash.
For air to depth of seas doth pearce
up mounts the waives thereby,
And tempests roars with dreadful noise,
the shipman out doth cry,
And vows to offer sacred gifts:
As oft therefore as we
Do find two things together knockte,
as oft as air we see
Moved vehemently, but chiefly then,
when through these hollowed things
By narrow straightes it passes out,
thence diverse voices springs:
As diverse are the sorts of them,
as place doth fashion take:
In which the air doth sundry sounds
and sundry voices make.
So sounds the Trumpet otherwise
by far than shalme doth blow,
And well we may the Tymbrels tune
from sound of sawtrey know.
For as by stroke of stone in stream
do many cyrcles rise
So moved, the air, with whirling wheel
doth spread in largest guise.
And therefore into many ears
one voice doth easily pass
As where a number be, one sight
is seen in every glaue.
But how the nose receives smell
let us say something here.
A slender fume from every thing
arisyng doth appear,
Which broad in air doth spread it self
as Frankconcense we see,
Or Myrrh, if that upon the coals
the powder poured be.
By means of tongue is taste perceiude
and roufe of mouth beside,
For by these twain the taste smatche,
of every thing is tried,
Which piercing straight doth touch the sense
thereof is taste begone.
But feeling, blood and sprite procures
which through the body run.
This sense do creatures all possess
and taste they all receive:
But man doth better them enjoy
and them more right perceive.
Hereof to man more wisdom doth
than to the rest arise:
Some this deny and say the things
foresaid are otherwise,
Alowing not that forms received
in eyes, cause sight to be,
Or that the air we need, as mean
to hear, or for to see.
For the almighty King doth give
so many powers to mind
As in the world he framed things,
that vary in their kind.
That she might al things comprehend,
she knows well what to be,
Her proper kind, and more perceyues.
Mind al things plain doth see,
And al things ponders prudently
that senses to her brings,
And with celestial trial ways
the true and virtuous things.
To Life therefore is mind the Sun,
the senses Stars do seem:
So some affirm, but we make haste
and leave these things to deem,
To other men, for ny we come
to end of Libra here,
Because the feet of Scorpion sign
do plainly now appear.
My sayings yet do plainly teach,
the soul Celestial
To be, which void of body lives,
and gives life to all,
Discerning also every thing
as far as God gives leave,
For al things here, of him their force
determinde do receive.
To him eternal power belongs,
al things doth he create,
And makes al things that here are made
through his almighty state.
For if the soul perceaues and knows,
and understands al,
We may not think it substance such,
as we may body cal,
Sych bodies move, not earth nor air,
not flood nor fyry flame,
Nor any thing that these have made,
hath power as hath this same.
we need not doubt but soul proceeds,
and doth from Jove descend,
And never dyes whom he permits,
the world to comprehend.
What if so be the Ato^yes
that sundry wise men fain,
The soul is rather thought to be,
than body to maintain,
Al Bodies be of quantity,
and may divided be,
But soul is vndiuidable
and of no gross degree,
And as a Center doth she seem,
where many lines do mete,
Which senses do convey to her,
as floods to seas do flete.
Wherefore I marvel much at such,
as think a like decay,
And judge the soul no more to be
when body fades away.
For if so be it might be proved,
yet should it not be said,
Nor published to the common sort,
nor every where displayed.
For many wicked men and ill
there are, which if they thought
Their souls as nothing shall remain,
when corse to grave is brought,
Nor that it feels, or suffers ought,
when it goes hence away,
And that no punishment remaynes
for pranks that here they play,
A thousand mischiefs would they do,
take fear from them among,
And fall to every villainy
confounding right with wrong.
Besides a number now that think
in blessed state to be,
When death hath them destroyed, hope
the face of God to see,
And evermore with him to joy,
and therefore virtuously
Do seek to pass their present life,
wych Godly modesty:
If they shall see that after death,
do no rewards remain,
Amassed al, their virtuous works,
shall cease and perish plain.
So many stately temples trimmed,
so many altares hie,
With gold and marble garnished
and decked sumptuously,
Beside Religion, Godly zeal,
honour, and worshipping
Of God, shall come to nought, if after
death remain nothing
That men hope for, if that the soul
as wind doth pass away.
Of wild, and frantic common sort
Religion must be stay,
And fear of smart. For mischievous,
and full of fraud their brain
Is always seen, nor of themselves
they well do mean or plain.
The common people virtue loath,
and ever more do hate.
Religion is the comeliness,
and glory of our state,
Which makes the Gods to favour us,
which we win Heaven by.
No wise nor good man therefore dare
attempt here openly,
To teach yt soul shall come to nought,
and so corrupt the minds
Of rude unskilful common sort,
that waver like the wyndes.
Now must we prove by reason good
that soul doth never dye,
And free from sting or dart of death
doth live eternally:
As he that preaches Christ declares,
and Greshop eater Jewe,
That for sins utterly despised:
which God that all things knew
Would not have made if he had thought
it had been nedelesse here:
And nations all with one consent
account it to be clear.
And first the thing resembling most
the mightiest Lord of al,
Of longer lasting time we grant
and perfecter must call.
For that which doth not long endure
but shortly doth decay,
That it should be vnperfecter
who is that will say nay?
And therefore do celes^iall things
a greater while endure,
Because they are more perfecter,
and more divine and pure:
But things that nearer are to earth
and farthest of from skies,
Unperfect since they are, do fade
and soonest ever dyes:
Shall then our soul since it in life
and knowledge doth appear,
Most like unto the state divine,
be closed and shut up here
With body for to end? nor shall
it here have longer place
Than fading flesh? or shall it live
more great nor larger space?
Besides the soul can not decay,
this reason wytnesse shall,
Because it is of single state,
and void of matter al.
Add this, that when the body fades,
the force of mind doth grow,
As weak and aged fathers old,
do more of council kn^w
Than youthful bloods of younger years,
and often lacks he wit
That doth excel in strength and force:
For rare doth God permit
To any one both strength and wit.
Wherefore if force brought low,
By space, and course of many years,
the mind doth stronger grow,
Of Body doth it not depend,
but of it self consist
Another thing, and after grave
doth live and death resist.
Doth not beside when foot doth ache
the mind judge thereof plain?
It is no doubt. But how can grief
to tower of mind a^ayne,
Doth it ascend from lowest parts
as smoke doth upward fly?
No: for many parts not foot alone,
(if so) should ache thereby,
Nor of the foot, but of the part
that nearest is to mind
The ache should grieve: this shows that soul
is not of bodies kind:
And so is free from death since it
in distance needs no mean.
Add this when we would cal to mind
the thing forgotten clean,
Or else devise some worthy fetch,
from mind, the senses al
It then behooves to gather up,
whereby doth often fall
That many better for to muse,
do shut and close their eyes,
Or else forsaking company,
some secret place devise.
Or when the night with darksome cloud
the earth doth overspread,
And creatures all with heavy sleeps,
do take their rest in bed,
They styll do watch, and silent al,
upon their beds do rest,
And light put out, in darkness w^et
their mind with body oppres^.
For senses do the mind disturb,
affections it destroys,
Amazing it with dullness great,
and blindness it anoyes:
None otherwise than clouds do hyde
the Sun that clearly shynes.
If therefore, when it doth remain
within his own confines,
And flying far from senses al,
and cares that body brings,
It wiser be, then shall it know
and understand al things
In better sort, when it is free,
and from the flesh doth fly,
More perfect of it self it is,
and lives continually.
Beside when man as mean consystes,
the Saints and beasts betwixt,
Some part with each he common holds
with beasts his body mixed,
And with the saints his mind agrees:
one of these parts doth dye,
Of the other Death can have no power,
but lives continually.
Death therefore takes not al away,
for why? his deadly darts,
Doth never harm the soul a wh^
when it from body parts.
And more than this I have to say,
if nothing do remain
Of us, when carcass lies in tomb,
God shall be called plain
Uniust, and one that favour shows
to such as naughtly live:
For such for term of all their life,
no sorrows them do grieve,
No riches lack nor pleasures great,
but happily rejoice,
Exalted with promotions hye,
and with the Commons voice.
On the other side the virtuous men
a thousand griefs molest,
Now sore diseased, now plagued wc need
in fine always oppres^.
Therefore the soul lives after grave,
and feels deserved pains,
And if it have done justly here
a Crown of glory gains.
By these and many other ways
I could declare no doubt,
That soul of man doth never dye,
and body lives without.
But this enough: time bids me end
nor ignorant am I,
That soul of many (although unapt)
is termed a melody.
And as of sundry voices moved
an harmony proceeds,
Of sundry compounds medeyne made
which force of healing brcedes:
So of the joined elaments
by certain mean and way
Created, of the heavens eke
the soul to be some say:
A part whereof in body dwells
and part abroad doth lye:
As sight doth spring of outward light
and virtue of the eye.
For Heaven is the chiefest cause
from which all things do spring,
without whose aid ye earth could not,
nor seas breed any thing.
But this opinion is not true,
for if it should be so,
The soul with flesh should never strive,
nor once against it go,
But evermore in one agree.
As every power doth show,
That wonted are of my^ed things
by sprite divine to grow.
As in the kind of herbs apperes,
and in the precious stone.
Some think the soul doth not remain
when flesh is from it gone,
Because that heavy, sluggish sleep
the nearest thing that may
Resemble death, doth seem to take
both sense and mind away:
Or for because they see the mind
with sycknesse diversely
So vexed, and harmed, that it can not
the place it hath supply,
And with the body to increase
with which it eke decays.
As well apperes in children young
and men of elder days:
Fond is the child, the man discrete.
the old man dotes styll
For weak unwieldy withered age
doth mind and body spyll.
And more say they if that the soul
of substance be divine,
And seured from these fleshly lyms
may lead a life more fine,
Then why should it in wretched flesh
so seek it self to place?
By whose defect so many yls
and mischief it deface.
But fond she is therefore if that
she do this willingly,
And if perforce she be compelde
in carcass caued to lye
who doth costraine? Doth God himself?
then her he nought esteems:
Nay which in prison vile he puts
to hate he rather seems.
More of it self (except it learn,)
since it doth nothing know,
And oftentimes forgetfulness
the mind doth overthrow.
Therefore they judge it nothing is
when body here doth dye,
For learn it cannot, senses dead,
which it knows all things by.
Some other say that soul there is
in all the world but one,
Which gives life to every thing,
as Sun but one alone
There is, that makes all eyes to see
eternal, think they this
Though bodies dye as eyes put out
the Sun eternal is.
These trifles fond it is not harde
with reason to disprove:
But here I longer am I fear
than it doth me behove.
There shall not want that such demand
shall answer once at full,
And all the doubts therein assoyle
and knots asunder pull.
O man of sharpe and pregnant wit,
thy praise shall live with mine,
Our labours (doubt not) shall comende
the men of later time:
They famous work attempt, seeds
of Heaven on earth go sow.
This one thing will I more put to,
that every man may know
The soul immortal for to be,
and sprung of heavenly grace,
If senses and affections all
he will restrain a space.
If that dispisyng worldly joys,
and earthly thoughts resynde
with daily labour he attempt
to God to lift his mind:
Then perfect wisdom shall he have,
and things to come foretell
Awake, or else in heavy sleeps
perceive the same as well.
In this sort did the Prophets old
the things to come declare.
The sober mind therefore doth come
more ne'er to heavenly fare,
The farther from the flesh it flies,
and from the earthly care.
But like to beasts the greatest sort
do live as sense doth will,
And think none other good to be
but flesh to have his fill.
Hereof (...) comes that many think
the soul with body dyes,
Because they see not things divine
with weak and fleshly eyes.
But of the soul this shall suffice:
let us return again
To him that made the world, whom we
conclude for to remain
Of body void: and thousands more
that body line without,
As thick as in the woods the leaves
do cluster trees about:
And if they bodies have at all
so purely are they find,
That sense of ours cannot perceive
but only seen of mind.
But thou my Muse be silent here,
and when his will shall be
And pleasure eke, who moves my lips,
then shalt thou search with me
The cause of things, that vnderueath
the circle of the Moon
We see to pass, if they by chance,
or fatal force be done.
And whilst while as the Sun ye back
of Lyon flaming fryes,
And doubling oft her creaking voice
the Greshop chirping cries,
Encompast with the shadowing grass
let us find out in shade
Of Laurel, or sweet Myrtle tree,
where hushing noise is made
Of streams, that flows from Parnas springs
a quiet resting place,
For rest doth well refresh the mind,
and calls again the grace.
And straight when as with quietness
our strength is come again,
I will (if thou wilt favour me
and me with grace maintain)
Attempt to touch the stately tunes:
and if the almighty King
with countenance sweet do grant me aid,
my labour long pitying,
And poverty drive far from me,
and bitter cares expel:
Al wholly will I live with thee,
and always with thee dwell.
This only shall be my delight,
my self then shall I fill
With pleasant Aganippaes streams,
and sing on Cirph^s hill.
Scorpius, the eight Book.
THe cause why mortal state doth pas
such crooked contrary ways,
Some sort in honour, happily
do spend their joyful days:
And other some in misery,
oppressed continually,
With daily moyling vexed sore,
in fame obscure do lye.
Fair Muse declare: for unto thee
it lawful is to know,
The councels of the Gods above,
and secrets for to show.
Some men by blind disordered chance.
think all things done to be,
Nor world by reason to be ruled,
because they most things see
With undeserved goods adorned,
and most things plagued again
Unjustly vexed with noisome ils,
and difference none to rain:
The just and virtuous men oppressed,
and Rake hells hiely placed,
And vice than virtue more esteemed,
and Churches al defaced,
With fyry flame of thunder cracks,
and most men for to gain,
By sinful usage of themselves,
and craft of subtyle brain:
Such when they see to come to pass,
the greatest part surmyse,
Either no Gods at al to be,
or else that they despise,
The base affairs of mortal men,
And only heavens mind: therefore
they rash and blindly say,
Uncertayne chance in every thing
doth bear the chiefest sway.
But Fortune some to thee do give
the governance over al,
And thee Lady chief of every
thing on earth do cal,
And that thou holdst the scepters here
with brows that sourly frown,
And with thy false unstable wheel
turnst al things vpsyde down:
To thee the old deceived age
did build their altares hye,
And often times before thy face,
their sacrifice did lye.
Some are besides that do impute
each thing to destiny,
And judge that force of fatal laws,
the world is ordered by,
And that with one continual course
(as pageants shows to mind)
Al things do move, and every man
hath here his part assinde,
That he must play, till al be done:
a question to be sought
Right profitable fair and hard,
not to be left untaught.
Now first therefore let us declare,
that nothing here can be
Without a cause, and that the cause
must of necessity,
Much differ from the effect, since that
nothing it self doth breed,
No thing can of it self be cause,
nor of it self proceed.
Then infinite shall causes grow?
not so: but yet there ought
Some first to be, from which the rest
of causes must be brought,
Which from the hiest must descend,
unto the basest state.
This order then of causes we
cal Destiny or Fate:
Which God as once predestining
that all things should be so,
Determinde hath by his decree
for evermore to go.
But as each cause doth nearest come
unto the causer first,
So all the rest it doth excel,
and moves, and rules the worst.
The first beginning is a cause
and no effect the same,
The lowest state is but effect,
no cause we can it name:
The means that are between these two
may names of both retain.
For if of causes were no knot,
nor order styll to rain,
If the one of tother should not hang,
(as if from heavens hye
A Chain to deepest part of Hell
should hang and linked lye:
Which is to vile to be rehearsed)
beginnings more than one
Shall seem to be: and causes first
must many spring thereon.
Then shall they strive amongst themselves
and often fiercely fight,
So many heads, for one alone
doth rule require of right:
So neither world should here be one,
nor beautiful should seem:
For ordre is the beauty chief,
that we in things esteem.
But some perchance will say from one
beginning first of all,
Together many causes seue*
red downward often fall.
As sundry sort of glistering beams
the Sun doth from him send,
With certain difference severed,
of which doth not depend
The one of the others force, but each
from self same head do fall:
So needs no strife, nor let, because
one way they walk not all.
This order is not very ill,
nor much mislyketh me,
This sentence may be fortune true:
but let us thoroughly see,
All blindenesse from our mind expelde,
for mind of man cannot
Attain to light of troth so soon,
nor in such easy sort,
But oftentimes doth use to err,
and hereof doth arise
Such sectes, such contrary saws,
he proves, and he denies:
As reason proper is to Gods,
opinion is to us,
No certainty hath mortal man
the troth for to discuss.
Therefore if many causes be
that from the first do flow:
If each of them in perfectness
be like, I seek to know:
No order there shall then appear,
for where no chief doth guide
No difference, nor diversity seen,
no order can be spied.
In every thing thou may perceive
a first, a midst, and last,
No kind of thing is here that is
without an order cast.
But if they al do not alike
this perfectness avow,
God hath some thing imperfect made:
this can not I allow.
Wherefore one perfect good effect
allow the causer first,
The rest have more vnperfecter,
as they themselves are worst.
For commonly most store of fruit,
the naughtiest tree doth bring
But worst, as ill than good, and sour
than sweet doth ryfer spring.
For as each cause is more of power
and of estate more hye,
So more of life and reason hath
this purest substance ny.
The cause again of weaker force,
and of a baser kind,
Less life, and reason doth possess,
and substance less doth find.
As well upon the earth appears,
where al things do endure
But little space, where reason is scarce,
where no estate is pure:
But all of many things consists,
al things on earth that been,
Compounded are, and myxt, so that
no substance can be scene:
Nor here she is esteemed a whit,
the honour doth remain,
To such as her do here enjoy,
and such as her retain.
In dark some caves she hidden lies,
and hereby do we find,
That fortunes goods are more estemde
than virtues of the mind.
For substance virtue may be called,
but in this world exiled
This substance lives, her country fair
her seat and mansion mild,
The heavens are, where as she hath
her faithful friends of trust,
Goodness, truth. By this means tho
the world is framed just,
Of causes as before is said
preieruing every thing
with during bond, this chain (but God)
may none in pieces bring,
Nor force, nor space of time it break.
Of causes such is sponne,
What is to come, what present is,
and what hath erst been donne,
To al the which their force, and strength,
thalmighty king above
with certain bounds, time appoints
by certain means to move.
And needful is it to be known
how, many causes run
To gather oft when any thing
by force of them is donne.
Nor rashly is this meeting made,
and causes mixed so,
But by appointed destinies,
all things do pass, and go
Thalmighty work man of the world
hath all things vndercast
Assured laws, and measure dealt
to all the things he past.
Therefore it is not true that some
affirm, and dare defend,
That nothing certain can be found,
that chance doth all things send:
And God regards not mortal state.
But they themselves deceive,
And are beguiled much, to whom
this sentence here doth cleave.
For truly chance is nothing else
but vain opinion blind,
Not differing much fro shapes, syghtes
that in our sleeps we find.
Whatsoever Aristotel saith,
or any of them all,
I pass not for, since from the truth
they many times do fall.
Oft prudent, grave, and famous men,
in errors chance to slyde,
And many wits with them deceive
when they themselves go wide:
Examples only serve, so much
must errors followed be.
Let no man judge me arrogant,
for reason rules me,
She faithful guide of wysemen is:
let him that seeks to find
The troth, love her, and follow her
with all his might, and mind.
And that there is no chance at all
this reason strong and stayde,
Makes me believe: for if that all
(as erst before is said)
By causes fixed in certain guise,
and certain time do move
As God commands, for perfectness,
and for the worlds behove,
Least hurtful error should destroy
so fair a work as it,
what kind of place shall chance possess,
or seat find out to sit?
In doubtfulness, and altering state
surmounting far away
Both Protheus, and Vertumnus to,
in changing their array,
As void, so nature chance denies.
Uncertain nought doth lye
Within this world, but certain all:
as nature, God, and sky,
And elaments, and what of them
so ever framed we see,
Or hath in time before been wrought,
or evermore shall be.
But if that ought uncertain were,
then should the mind divine,
Not all things here know certainly,
but from the troth decline?
Which were to great absurdity,
for he doth all things spy
That each thing makes, nor ought from him
can hyd in secret lye.
Though some do say that if so be
that heavenly mind should know
The base estate of mortal kind,
it should less worthy grow.
But they are much deceived, for none
is ill because that he
Doth ill things know, nor vile yt knows
the things that vilest be.
Nor any man is changed white
that white can well define,
Nor worser is the Sun as oft
as it on knaves doth shine,
Nor if with beams it hap to blase
in place be durtyed much
It foul doth seem, nor light defylde
that filthy things doth touche.
So if the mind perceive the thing
that vilest may be thought,
It is not worse, to know ill, than good,
but ill to do is nought.
Thus God of nothing ignorant,
all things that are doth know,
What hath been done in alder times,
and what shall after grow.
Which if they be not surely ^ixt
confess we must them needs
Not to be known, for knowledge styll
of things assured proceeds.
The Prophets also when they speak
of things that happen shall,
The certain days do plainly appoint,
and proper names of all:
Which would not be, but that al things
are fixed certain so
That are to come, or present be,
or passed long ago.
Yet many things do seem by chance
amongst us for to light:
As when a tyle by tempest torn
from house a man doth smite:
Or when a man in delving deep
doth store of treasure find:
Such things by chance to hap, doth synk
in common peoples mind.
But this my mind doth not allow:
for though unlooked for
Such things do hap, shall we therein
admit a chance therefore?
Our knowledge, nor our ignorance,
to alter things hath might:
For fire hath not his flaming heate,
nor Snow therefore is white,
Nor Sun doth yield his glistering beams
because we know the thing:
For of the matters that consyst
our knowledge here doth spring.
Therefore we know it thus to be
because the thing is so,
And mind may often seem to err
the thing can not so do.
Now of the thing I speak and ask
if chance therein do lye,
For whether we do know thereof
or no, regard not I.
The chance therefore in us doth lye,
not in the things that be,
Such things we think to fall by chauc^
whereof no cause we see,
As known alone unto the Gods:
all things are certain tho.
For with one sort of moving round
the heavens always go,
Like seed, like fruit, and elaments
in ancient order rain,
And keep their kind, wonted course
the year doth styll retain.
For after spring, the somer hot
himself hath strayghtwayes placed,
And after him with Apples thyck
and Grapes doth harvest hast,
Next after that his nipping frosres
the winter brings in,
And with his Isye northern blasts
all things to droop begin.
No herb doth ever change his force,
all creatures do retain
Their old accustomed shape, and in
their wonted guise remain.
No must we think that monsters here
of chance or errors grow,
When cause of them assertaynde is
ill tidings to foreshowe:
And thereof first did take their name
wherefore their wonders hight,
Which nature willingly doth make,
who often doth delight
To breed some ^ond ylfauo^red things.
As painter oft doth joy
(Though he have cunning great beside)
to paint some testing toy:
As pycture crooked, or saddelbackd,
with nose of largest syse,
And blabber lypt, a worthy sight
and fit for clownishe eyes.
Since all things thus in order good,
and measure like do fall,
Unstable chance within the world
shall bear no swing at all:
whom chiefest providence of God,
and wisdom great doth draw,
That he may easily understand
with what a wondrous law
The world with everlasting course
is framed here and graced:
How every creature hath his lymmes,
and members aptly placed,
well serving to their uses all
agreing fair the same,
How God or nature never thing
in vain did make or frame.
who ponders this shall think not chance,
but reason bears the sway,
And al things done as God commauds,
will deem, and plainly say.
But whether fortune guides all
as many do persuade,
A thing both meet, and worthy is
in knowledge to be had.
Let us bend all our wyts to this,
but first we must well know
What kind of thing this fortune is,
and whence her grace doth grow.
In ancient time they worshipped her,
and Goddess her did call,
And thought she bare no little sway
in Heaven and earth, and all:
And alters unto her they built,
and offred sacrifyce:
But I think her not God to be,
nor any saint in skies,
Is either male, or female sure,
in kind they not delight,
No birth they have, nor dying day
as some of old do write,
Who think the Gods like us to be.
O fond, and foolish minds,
O heads for to be healed with juice
of greatest purging kinds.
Judge you the Gods, of our estate,
that with their Ladies fair
Embracing many times they lye,
their kind for to repair?
Let rather us therefore account
a certain God to be,
Whose nature differs far from Gods
a Ghost of lowe degre,
And therefore guides the kingdoms vile
of earth and waters round,
Whereas so many heinous facts,
such griefs and plagues are found,
Where as no kind of thing is safe,
where no estate is free,
where crafts and wiles do swarm so thick,
where such deceiuings be.
The Prince of all the world, this God
is named of Christ, and Paule:
Whom Pluto, and sir Dites black,
the Poets use to call:
who favours fools, and wicked men,
and virtuous men molest.
This house, this seat, this court doth seem,
for such a tyrant best,
whom commonly we fortune call:
for each ill thing doth rain
Beneath the Moan: as darksome night
and storms, and tempest mayne,
With cold and heate, and teasty age,
dame need of beggars hall,
And labour, grief, and wretchedness,
and death that ends all.
Above the Moan continual light,
with peace and joy remain,
No time, nor error, death nor age,
nor any thing is vain.
O blessed, and double blessed again,
that in so pleasant place,
So fair, so beautiful, to live
of God obtayneth grace.
Some think the world to be fulfylde
with other Gods beside,
Whereof the most do lead their life
in airy places wide,
whom Greekes cal sprytes, more to the
the chiefest rule they give
Of creatures al, that on the earth,
or on the sea do live.
Affirming that both good and evil
as most their minds doth please
They send, as honours, joys, wealth,
and contraries to these.
wherefore it very needful is
to please them often times,
which may be done by serving them,
by charms, or by divines
As many think, and like wise say
that they will straight appear
To us, (if they be ryghtly called)
and help us praying here:
And that no better thing can be
here in this life to man,
Than for to have their company,
and see them now and than:
which I believe but few obtain
but just men that despise
The fond and fading wanton joys,
and food of fleshly eyes:
That quietly do live, and cares
do banish far away,
And heavenly things alone do mind,
and never seek to stray
From that, which right and virtuous is.
Although that some do say,
Ill sprites amongst these good there be,
constrained to obey
To naughty men, by Conjuring,
whereby much ill is done:
I can not stay, nor now is place.
the sign where as the sun
Doth yield his yearly compassed course,
where scaled brethren shine
Shall tell the rest, where as I will
the state of Gods define,
If God himself do me permit
who doth my verses gene.
Let us therefore pass over this.
I scarcely can believe,
That any God can evil be.
Wisdom bids never sin:
But contrary, by folly doth
fault, stray, and crime come in.
No man is evil willingly
as far as I beleaue:
For every will doth covet good,
if judgment not deceive.
But Devil wisdom hath, (if that
this name to him agree.)
But whether Fortune govern al,
or howsoever it be,
Or Devils guide the state of men:
but yet without destiny
Doth nothing pass, But al things ruled
by mind of God on hie,
Without whose power nothing is done:
but of this saying here
A doubt doth rise, and knot so hard
and sure doth eke appear,
Such one as Hercules, or else
the Macedonian King
Would scarce undo, which douht stay
to many minds doth bring.
If destiny commands al,
if al things so must move,
Not will to us remains free,
nor to the Gods above,
Free will is taken clean away,
and virtue no reward,
Nor vice doth punishment deserne,
which is not to be heard.
No place is now of Gods to speak,
but of such things as be
In our estate, is subject here,
which eyes of men may see.
I say therefore that in the things
that under fortune be,
No kind of thing can here be found,
exempt from destiny:
As riches, pleasures, joyful mind,
with rule and honours hy^,
Come from above: not will of ours
is that we get them by.
For who would (...) such things enjoy?
but will avails not thoe,
It rather hurts if destinies
against a man do go.
How many strive to rise aloft
against their destiny,
But faster more and more they fall
and down they deeper lye.
On tother side they unto whom
the stars more gracious be,
Unlooked for do often live
in chief prosperity:
Whose nets while they themselves do sleep,
Rhamnusia full doth fill,
With fish, and brings unto them
al things that they can will.
Lo, some of great and noble house,
we see to come to light,
And to (...) from childehode first
all things with joyful spright,
And to attain to honour hye,
though they unworthy be,
And bli^ded oft their eyes to rule
that scarcely well can see,
And live in al licenciousnesse.
And some of kindred base
For to be borne, with grief and tears
themselves for to deface,
with labour long and vain, to toil,
and yet cannot expel
The prick of hunger that they feel
but still in beggrye dwell.
who will deny these ylies to come,
through cruel destnies might?
A number fair and active are
and of courageous sprite:
And many foul, and syckly still,
of courage faint we see:
whereof comes this? of our deserts?
or our infirmity?
Or shall we say, our will doth al?
By Fates assuredly
Each thing doth chance to mortal men
the rule hath Desrenie:
Of our affairs and our estate,
the hour and kind of death
It only guides: a halter him,
him sword deprives of breath,
He drowned in floods he kilde with cold
him strangles fyry smoke,
Some other hunger doth destroy,
and some doth surfeits choke,
By grief or sycknesse many dye,
some, chance away doth send,
And many age bereues of life:
a certain day of end,
To al men is, and every age,
nor longer can we go
Than thread of life permits, that runes
the spiteful spyndle fro.
So kylde a rysh the prayser of
A chilles lusty lore:
So Aeschilus, while as he walkde
abroad on Sicill shore,
With mighty fall of house deceased:
Anacreon so did kill
A reasons seed. Alas what ways,
what means hath death to spyl?
When fardest of thou think him,
then nearest stands he:
Nothing than death more certain can
nor more uncertain be.
Yet some that know the force of starr^s,
and secrets of the sky,
Soothsaying Po^ts that can tel,
how things to come do lye:
I know not with what sprite inspired,
are often wont to tell,
The kind, and day, of death to come:
for of the things as well
To come is nature sure, as of
the present things and past,
Sure in the first and second cause
that from the first to the last
With largest lynke extended are.
But goods or ills of mind,
Do they proceed from destiny
or from the fatal kind?
Learning and wit seem thence to flow,
may any learning get
Except he wisdom do obtain
and nature force permit
If fortune let or sycknesse staye?
An Dratour some one,
An other a Philosopher,
some always look upon
The sacred secretes of the Gods,
and secke the starry sky,
And some there are yt drink the streams
in wretched poverty
That from Castalian well do flow,
whom pleases pleasant fame
As nearest kin to hunger sharpe
from whence comes all these same?
From destiny the chief of all,
each Art from hence doth flow,
Thence offices derived all
that mortal men do know.
In sundry servants nature joys,
that diverse things thence may
Proceed, to deck the world, and letts
not all to pass one way,
But them commaudeth several course
and several pains to take,
With sundry sort of works the world
more beautiful to make.
But whether our conditions here
are dealt by destiny,
Or whether of our will they spring
it seems good to try:
Nor labour small it doth appear
the troth herem to find.
Of our free will what portion doth
remain within our mind?
In wretched case we live if us
byreft is liberty,
If that the chief and greatest force
of fatal destiny,
Constrain us ill to be, and that
by force we in be brought
To wickedness, and if to strive
therewith avails nought.
Wherefore it seems labour worth
our wits to this to bend,
And for to syft the troth as much
as God shall knowledge send.
First it behooves us to tell
what this free will should be,
An ample power received of God,
and largest liberty
Delivered man, that as he list,
the right, or ways unjust
He follow should: not (virtue left)
that thereby sin he must:
But contrary the vices thunde
to apply the virtuous ways:
For evil deeds do harm the soul
and good deserves praise.
Besides it further must be sought
if this free will doth rain
In all a like or if it doth
in every time remain?
No sure it seems not to be
in Children, nor in such
As vehement anguish of the mind
or body grieves much,
Or they whose eyes the heavy sleeps
have shut and closed sure:
For sleep is counted plain of death,
the lively portraiture.
Wherefore if thou shalt search the truth
with well advised mind,
Thou shalt a smallest sort among
so many thousand find,
That with free will do guide themselves
and liberty do use.
The fault of age I overpass,
and childrens years excuse,
And unto those that sleeping lye
I licence also give,
Or them whom fevers rage doth roast
or sycknesse sharpe doth grieve.
Of which a number great there be,
but greater far away,
And worser eke, whose fylthy mind
doth vices foul array,
And fond affections makes to faint,
withdrawing it with strife
From reason far, and from the path
of right, and virtuous life.
May these be counted for to have
free will and liberty?
A doubtful thing it surely is,
and many it deny.
Wherefore thou well must understand
that he alone is free
Whom reason rules, that with payne
will never conquered be,
Nor when the stormy tempests rage
to rocks is ever thrall,
But stoutly sticking to the sterne
doth with the haven fall.
So truly erst have certain said
but wisemen none we find,
Whom reason ruling can correct
the affections of the mind.
The other sort can not do so:
why? hath not God them dealt
Free will? which ever may be found
where reason may be felt,
For these are always coupled styll.
So beasts of nature wild
Sith reason they are thought to lack
are judged from will exylde.
But all men reason do receive,
and therefore have free will:
For reason is the guide of mind
that chooses good from ill,
Descerning eke the naughty facts,
from such as honest be,
And called is the sight, and eye,
wherewith the mind doth se.
Such eye perhaps as Poliphaem
the Poets gave to thee,
Wherwyth the lymmes of thy beloved
in seas thou oft did see,
But nought (alas) and all to nought
(who, such, to shun hath might)
Vlisses with a fiery post
hath it bereft of sight,
And face, the face that first was fair,
of beauty spoiled quite:
Or such an eye as Lynceus had,
that saw in darkest night.
This eye therefore to every man
Prometheus wisdom dealt,
But few it use, a very few
that grace of love have felt.
Hereof the spring of errors doth,
and wickedness arise.
For if the steps of reason, all
should tread in nearest wise,
Then peace on earth should always (dwell,
and Mars his bloody hand
Such slaughters nor such cries should cause,
towns walls should stand,
And weapons framed first in hell
by fiendyshe furies wrought,
Should tille ye field, with good exchange
to share and cultre brought.
Then Bees, and Cattle swarming thick
and riches of the field,
Unto the happy husbandman
a great increase should yield.
The golden world should then return,
and eke one place contain
Both man, God, who would vouchsafe
before our eyes to rain.
The cause why few do reason use,
and ways forbydden know,
And void of freewill live like beasts
I will assay to show.
A certain part divine, in us
that mind and reason hight,
There is, which nature in the head
hath placed a loft in sight,
And servants unto it appoints
the senses, that there be,
By means whereof the Skies Earth
and al things it may see.
An other fading force there is
within the breast enclosed,
By means whereof we move, and grow
with help of heate disposed:
(Thus hath it pleased God) this straynes
molests and grieves the mind,
And to this part a number great
of servant, is assinde,
As fond delight. wrath, grief, and fear,
with great desire to gain,
Ambition hauty harmfull thing,
with fumes that vex the brain.
With these his lusty soldiers he
gives battle to the mind.
These mates attempted Jove to vex
of fiercest giants kind,
As Giges strong, Iapetus, and
Tiphoeus monstrous sprite
Enceladus ill worker, and
Briareus dredful wight.
With worldly thoughts hie heaped they vex,
the part divine above,
Except that grace from heaven hye
like lightning them remove:
As when the raynes are once let lose,
the Chariot headlong dryues,
And swiftly runs, to stay the course
in vain the Carter stryues.
The first beginnings must be stopped,
while spark but kindling lies,
When fire hath rought the lofty parts
and flames approach the skies,
Especially when Boreas blasts
from Northern Pole doth fall,
And rages fierce, in vain alas
for water then they call.
As when from top of hawty rock,
some wayghty stone down trowles,
What force can it of course restrain?
al things with it, it rowles,
Asunder cracks the mighty trees
that on the mountain springs
Which at the first might well be stayed
with force of smallest things.
Even so the affections of the mind
if that with all their sway
The mind oppressed they do invade,
them scarce, can reason stay,
And helm and al forsaken quite,
with stream dame Reason drives,
In raging winds, and yields to foe
a captive kept in gyves.
Therefore while vices yet be young,
let them oppressed be,
And void the cause ere they wax strong
then mind and will is free:
Then conqueror thou shalt be crowned
with Palm of Idumay.
But if the assault be now begone,
and siege the foe doth lay,
And shakes with battrey great ye walls
except (believe me well,)
Some God with better grace defend,
Reason doth bid farewell,
And cannot bide so sore a brunt.
May we not plainly see
What harms the mind doth there sustain
where Bacchus blessings be,
What madness oft doth spring when wine
to much in stomach raynes?
Tell where freewyl kepes residence
when drink doth vex the brains?
The sober and the fasting man
of freewil is possessed,
And doth what so ever Reason bids:
Again the drunken gest,
The thing that he no would, no knows
he always doth the same,
Which deeds he sobre doth repent,
and sorrows eke with shame.
So with affections mind is drunk,
and in none otherwise,
Than wine that topsey turns the brayn
when it doth upward rise
It troubled is and darkd in mists.
Thus he (and none besides)
Hath freedom, and his mind at will,
whom reason only guides:
Who all affections ouercommes,
and wholly doth restrain,
He that from youth doth virtue use,
may well to this attain:
Such force hath use, nothing more strong.
The other sort are wayde
In manner like to brutish beasts,
as true the Poet said,
Each man his own delight doth draw,
Freewyll in many oppressed
And hindered is, wherefore who list
Freewyl for to possess,
Let him resist while young they be,
thaffections of the mind,
And them to reason subject make,
and brydie use in kind:
For flesh against the sprite rebels,
and with continual wars,
Doth it molest: The soul most pure,
doth covet styll thestarres:
But lumpish flesh doth shun the skies,
and earthly things desires,
For earth it only is, and into
earth at length expyres.
Thus two so far contrary things
hath God compact in one.
Admit thou art wise, and only ruled
by reasons force alone,
And freewyll perfectly enioyest,
shall destnie then bear sway?
Yea more to Fates thou subject art,
and more shalt it obey,
For destny is the will of God
where with the prudent wight
Agrees, and doth as it commands.
The fond and naughty sprite
On the other part abhors his laws,
and shuns the Lords decrees.
But thou will say: then is he free,
not ruled by destinies.
No: but two worser lords he serves,
and such as vilest be,
As wickedness, and folishnesse
his sister in degree.
Though this the will of God doth cause
but that which doth permit,
And not the will that doth command,
for of two sorts is it.
whereby appears that al things are
subject to destiny,
whether they be of good estate,
or of a vile degree:
For mischief destiny permits
and good by force doth send,
And God him self comauds, fro whom,
doth destiny descend.
with reasous like persuaded some
to this effect do say:
O mortal men live joyfully
while that you have a day,
And doleful cares from heart expel,
no trouble once your thought
with things that present here you see,
or after shall be wrought:
By fixed law shall all things fall,
and pass by order sure,
Wherefore should grief or foolish fear
to sadness you procure?
Each man hath here his lot assinde
which written secretly,
Within his breast he always bears,
yet nothing knows thereby,
But proof thereof doth come to light
upon the fatal day:
When as experience doth reveal
that erst in secret lay.
what needs sobs or wailing tears?
for back can never run
Celestial saws, nor nothing change
that God hath wrought or done.
For order best, and perfect course:
if it should altered be
It should be worse (which may not chase)
or better in degree.
But nothing of more perfect state
than perfect can be found.
A doubt both great and marvelous
doth spring upon this ground,
For if al things (as late I said)
are under Destiny,
Why frowns God on some, and looks
on others graciously?
why is not fortune like to al?
why sees some happier days
Than other do? and nature why
seems she to some always
A stepdame sharpe, and unto some
again a mother dere?
This knot it seems good that we
should break asunder here.
By fault and by desert of us,
a number think that this
Doth chance, and by decree of God
such as have done amysse
For to be plagued, and virtuous men
good Fortune to receue.
But this by no means can be true,
nor I do it belene,
For what have brutish beasts deserved,
what fault in trees can be?
Yet fortune unto every beast
doth show diversity:
The thief doth some convey, some dye
upon the Butchars knife,
Some wolves, or sycknesse, frost or flood,
some age deprives of life,
Some lead their life more pleasantly,
and some with greater payne.
And unto every kind of tree
his fortune doth remain,
The east wind cracks a sonder this
and roots doth upward turn,
Some sort are cut for diverse things,
and some in fierce burn,
And lightning spoils an other sort.
To every fish, and beast,
A certain fortune is assynde
by destinies beheast:
Yet neither tree, nor beast can sin.
And oftentimes beside
Misfortunes great the good man, doth
and virtuous man abide:
On the other part to naughty men
doth fortune favour show,
And grants them eke in worldly wealth
and honours hye to flow.
Thus destnye looks not on deserts:
therefore some other way,
Or cause, we must attempt to find.
Perhaps some man will say
The will of God is cause of all
and seeks none other where:
This doth not yet suffice, we must
go syft the truth more ne'er:
For God since he is wise, and best,
will not the thing permit
That reason lacks, but chiefest things
commands as seems most fit.
Wherefore we must say otherwise:
each cause of causes all
As from the first it farther is,
so more unlike doth fall.
Sith God therefore is always pure,
and ever one shall be,
The last of causes that from him
is farthest in degre
Shall double be, and diverse seem,
and work shall always frame
In sundry sorts, and altering state
and this is even the same
That rules the earth, and every thing
that earth doth here contain
Therefore nothing on earth is seen
that certain is or plain.
Sith fortune her vnsted fast wheel
doth turn in sundry sort:
And mortal men with diverse chance
to guide hath chiefest sport.
But yet why smyles she so on some,
and frowns on other sort?
Why gives she some a life with cares,
and some a princely port?
The cause of this is harde to know
as if we should require,
To know the cause of raging heate
we feel in flaming fire:
Or wherefore worwood bitter is,
why snow doth show so white,
wherefore some herbs have force to hurt,
and others healing might,
And why some trees bear sundry branch
why in such shape they grow,
Or why some beasts have subtle sense,
and some are dull and slow,
Wherefore ye straws doth Amber draw,
why Loadstone lyfteth hye
The iron piece, why it can not
do so the Diamond ny.
Such things hath God in secrete shut,
and unto mortal brain.
Appointed bounds, the which to pass
mans wit doth strive in vain.
As if the potter do divide
in sundry parts his clay,
And it departed thus abroad,
to sundry purpose lay,
Why rather he of this than that
a pot or dish doth bake:
Or basin broad? Of this a Crock,
of that a pytcher make?
Doth reason move hint thus to do?
or reason none at all
But only will? as he thinks best
so frames he great and small.
Tys harde to know ye workmans mind:
Even so, who seeks to know
Why fortune some exalts hye,
and brings others lowe:
A thing to hye he reaches at,
for God hath given power
Of earth to her, and of the world
hath made her governor,
That what she list she may perform
the force of destiny
Excepted still, for every thing
is governed thereby.
why should not she do what she list?
what law should her restrain?
Ought servants laws for to appoint
their Lords for to constrain?
we all her servants truly are
while we enjoy this light,
And must in every thing obey
the pleasure of the spright,
Yet of our souls she hath no power
whose root in heaven stands,
This only God exempted hath
from out this tyrants hands.
All other things in earth or seas,
as she shall best devise
God suffers frely to be done,
both good and ill likewyse.
But some will say: God then is cause
of every evil act,
And so unjust may well be called,
for he that doth the fact,
And he that suffers it to pass,
do both one fault commit,
And both like punnishement to have
the law adiudgeth fit.
Wherefore if God such ills on earth
doth suffer for to rain,
And when he well may them forbydde,
yet doth not them restrain:
He shall be thought the cause of ill,
and mischief to embrace:
This part I also answer shall
if God do grant me grace.
First therefore with attentive mind
it must be noted well,
That causes some be base, and small,
and some again excel
In worthiness before the rest:
as in a battle mayne
Lieuetenants are, and Captains stout,
the rest of common train.
These causes chief above the rest
in wondrous sort assigns
Thalmighty Lord, that guides above
the Stars, the starry signs,
Who lives in everlasting light
above the Heavens hye,
That at his beck doth cause to turn
the motions of the sky:
To every cause assigning force,
and whereto they shall tend,
With certain bounds encloses them
the which may none transcende.
And since he wisely all things made,
of force it follow must,
That every thing continually
keep course and order just.
For things that once are rightly framed
and fault do none receive,
Ought not in tract of any times
their wonted course to leave.
The order thus of every thing
can never altered be,
Because thalmighty Lord hath made
all things in just degre.
If then the sprite that guides the earth
be nought, or work amiss,
It is because the basest cause
and farthest of is this
From causer first, and light removed
a large and ample space,
And therefore unto darkness blind,
the nearer hath his place,
And only shadow shows of truth:
which God doth so permit
Because the state of all the world
and order asks it.
For as the day determinde is
by darkness of the night,
And things contrary ended are
by force of others might:
So sort and course of causes good
as reason doth require
In vile and wicked cause must end
and fynally expyre:
which wicked kingdoms govern shall,
and mischiefs vile shall guide,
Hence discord evermore proceeds
with brawls, and mind to chide,
Strong battles, frayes, false diseyt
with fires, and slaughters great,
Theftes, wiles, with need robberies,
and plagues, with raging heate,
Great earthquakes, storms, tempests great,
of sycknesses such store,
So great a sort of perils vile,
and dangers evermore,
And finally what harms to hap
in any place we know
From this so wretched cause Prince
of all the earth doth flow.
Full truly erst (alas) did say
the famous Hermes wise
This world a heap of harms doth seem
where every mischief lies.
Because the devil that on earth
the chiefest stroke doth smite
Is mischievous, and evermore
in cruelty doth delight.
For as the first of causes is
the spring of all good things,
So is the last the fountain chief
from whence all mischief springs.
Wherefore if lecherours on earth
bear al the rule and sway,
If Asses sxt in seat as Kings,
in pomp of proud array,
If charge of sheep committed is
to wolves of ravening kind,
If Har^ots in the Churches dwell
and men of monstrous mind,
If that the holy rytes of Christ
the hands impure doth fyle,
If Heaven and purging place Sir John
doth sell with greedy guile,
More, if vnpunnished such crimes
are styll before our eyes,
The fault not in thalmighty Lord
but in this Devil lies:
Whom fortune commonly we name,
and Pluto oft we call,
But unto him an apter name
Sarcotheus fit doth fall:
For unto him the power of flesh
and guiding is assinde,
Him serves all such as love them selves,
^o much with fleshly mind:
Of him the bodies are, therefore
in sin they always drive,
And to the souls as enemies
contrary still do strive.
For of the heavens comes the soul,
and from the starry Skies,
But earthly are the bodies here
and heavens do despise.
This same Sarcotheus thoe that guydes
the lowest parts of all,
Such holy men as do despise
the ^oyes ^errestr^all,
To virtue bent, and Godly life,
he hates and still pursues:
And vexes, grieves, them molests:
as commonly doth use
The naughty Prince, and cruel King,
always for to oppress
The wisest men, and such as do
ercell in vertuousnesse.
For virtue of the wicked men
is evermore envied.
Al things their enemies hate and fear
and shun from them aside.
Therefore the Devil many harms
prou^deth for the meek,
And them whose minds do mout aloft,
and hearts do heaven seek.
No would he have his malice seen,
for if he should be known,
Al men would him detest, as head
from whom al ylles have flown,
And bloody butcher of our kind,
him al should justly hate,
And cursing cal him cruel beast
deceyuer of our state.
Therefore he craftily lies hid,
and from the wise man flies,
Least he be known, no fears he Moles
but leaps from Linceus eyes.
So thieves do use, and wicked men
always the light to fly,
And in the darkest time rejoice
that none their mischief spy.
Hereof it comes as often as
men feel adversity,
Al ignorant with blindness, and
of mind oppressed be,
(For ignorance is causer chief
of errors al that fall)
Thinking with anger and complaint,
the guide of goodness al
Doth vex the, so they straightway curse
his h^e and holy name.
The wicked Devil dances then,
and grinneth at the same,
And joys to see himself unknown,
and mischief close to lye,
And that he thus hath power to hurt
and no man could it spy.
A foe unto ^halmighty God
he is, and ennimy,
By whom from heaven tumbled down
in chains he here doth lye,
Enclosed between the earth and Moan
and there he holds his rain.
Wherefore O wretched mortal men
at length apply your brain,
To know the cause of al your griefs,
from whence such ylles do flow,
And heavy harmful things do hay,
your butcher learn to know:
For this Sarcotheus this is he
that plagues you in such sort,
That of your harms grievous grefes
doth make his chiefest sport:
None otherwise than Mars his child
(great realms in thraldom brought)
With death of wret^hed men or beasts
a plea^ant pastime sought.
The Noble men the Gentlemen,
the commons all sit styll,
In diverse rooms assigned them,
as Otha^s laws doth will:
Then enters in before them all
the cutters for to fight,
Or else some other yields his lymmes
to beasts thereon to byte:
The Lion, or the Tiger stout,
or else some fier^r kind,
Should at this play present himself
to please the peoples mind:
With death mangled much with wound
from whence the blood doth flow,
Oft unto some of others smart
a great delight doth grow.
Wherefore they do most wickedly,
that railing thus do brawl,
And dare blaspheme thalmighty Lord,
the cause of goodness all:
From whom as from himself, no ill
can any time proceed,
Except contingently as Sun
doth darcknesse ever breed
As oft as under earth it slydes,
and absent fire we see
Increases cold: yet cloud in Sun,
nor cold in Fire can be.
Wherefore I marvel much that some
whose Learning is not small,
Do say that he offended is,
or wrathful him do cal,
And that he plagueth us as oft
as we do him offend,
That mild, and Lord of mercies is,
that goodness al doth send:
And that from him doth wars begin,
with plague and famine sore.
If that our deeds could him offend.
what thing unhappier more
Than he, in al the world were found*
for every day and hour
We crimes commit, and blasphemies
out of our mouths we pour:
Then surely should he never joy,
nor rest in quietness,
Nor God should happy be, if that
as oft as we tra^gresse
He should be wroth* moved with deeds
of such as synfu^be.
But God can not be vex or harmd
if we the truth will se:
For of such might and perfectness,
of God the nature is,
And distant even so far is it
from our iniquities,
That we from him do differ more
and farther are by much,
Than is from us the Ass, the Fly,
the Flea, or worse than such.
How then can we such wretches vile
offend a Lord so great?
Or by what means may we him harm
and force him thus so freat?
Is not this God of passions void,
and free from grief or payne:
And thereby lives in blessed state
and always doth remain?
Doth it become a Prince to fume
when foals do fondly prate:
Or rather them for to contemn,
seems it a giants state,
With little children for to fight?
since he knows al things well
And doth the things to come foresee,
I thee beseech to tel,
Ought he such things for to create,
as should his pleasure spot,
Whereby he should be after grieved?
or rather ought he not
That helps the world, to help himself?
or tel if thus diseased
He wills it so, if he will so
he is no whit displeased,
But rather joys. If he would not
why doth he it permit?
Or is he not omnipotent?
he is, we al grant it.
Then ought he not to suffer it
but yet he doth we see,
Whereby no kind of grief he feels,
as reason teaches me:
But leads his life in quietness.
Here thou perchance will say
If that our sins him not displease,
with al the force we may
Let us run headlong into vice
and never sin forbear,
Not so: but to these words of mine
give thou attentive ear,
And unto thee of truth strayghtwayes
the gates I shall disclose.
When any man doth sin, then forth
away he stinging goes
From this same spring of good, leaves
both right, and light, and peace:
Whereby the synner evermore
his harms doth still increase.
Such is the state of contraries
that how much thou doest fly,
From one, unto the other straight
thou doest approach more ny.
So he that synning flies from God,
runs to Sarcotheus next:
Whose yoke when he hath once put on
with griefs he sore is vexed:
And as the tyrant doth command
is plagued in sundry wise.
Thus no man sins but punishment
for him prepared lies,
Yet God is never cause of ill
as I have said before
As of himself and properly:
But he that sins therefore,
doth with his own consent,
Unto the hangman give himself:
to have his punishment
But hereof springs two crabbed doubts,
for if that sin be cause
Of al our mischief and our ylles,
and our unhappy saws,
Why often doth the wicked man
his life in pleasure train
And dies well, the virtuous man
doth many griefs sustain,
And ends at length in misery?
Besides before is taught,
That by no fault nor our deserts,
things good do chance, or nought:
But rather seems it from the power
of certain sprite to flow,
Who guides the Seas, and al the earth,
and air possesses lowe.
How speak I thus in contraries?
my words do disagree,
But (reader) well thou shalt discern
the troth and verity,
And darkness from thy mind thou shalt
behold far of to fly:
If these my words thou wilt vouchsafe
to hear attentively.
Know therefore double good to be,
one as the Commons will,
The other as the wisemen judge.
So of two sorts is ill,
The opinion of the common sort
is worser evermore:
For gross, and do^she is their brain
of judgment lacking store:
wherefore the goods of body here
and such as fortune gave
These only they do wonder at
and these they seek to have:
But now the goods that in the mind
are found for to remain
They either know not what they mean
or else they count them vain.
The wise man on the other side
the only goods of mind
Doth seek to have, and doth despise
the rest and other kind.
Thus followed we before the mind
of rude and common men,
And as such people use to speak
so was my talk as then.
But from the rude and common sort,
my mind doth differ now:
As wise men judge of good and ill
at this tune I allow.
And in such sort I say no good
unto the wicked man
May chance, and to the virtuous sort
no evil happen can:
Which plainly will I now declare
and clearly shall appear.
First this it needful is to know,
what vice or crime is here,
Is of the mind a sickness sore:
nor men are only sick
In body here, but mind aye feels
her wound and grievous prick
No less in force, than body doth.
Thus every evil wight
Is sick, because his will is sick,
and judgment is not right.
Whereby the wretch ye harmeful things
more worth than good esteems,
And sweter aye the filthyest facts
to him than honest seems,
Which if his mind will were sound
could never wicked be:
But just and virtuous should be found:
in this they disagree.
And as the body all is ill
when any of these twain
Diseased is with malady,
the heart, or else the brain:
So, so, alas the whole estate
of soul is ever ill,
When as these two with vice are harmed
the mind and eke the will.
As pleasant meat to stomach sick
doth seem unpleasant aye
And protytes nothing unto him
that sycknesse doth assay:
So (sick the soul) no good thing can
the wicked man come by,
Nor nothing profytes him at all,
which true I thus will try.
Some men in laws expert we see,
but full of subtlety,
And covetous, unjust, and one
that ways not honesty
What profits him his learning here,
what good gains he therefore?
Alas he wretches doth beguile,
and spoils his Clients poor
And many other doth he hurt.
Learning unto the nought
Is like a sword unto the man
that mad hath it up caught.
For all things doth the wicked man
abuse, and make impure,
To others harm, shame to himself,
and hatred doth procure,
And in his feet the thorns he set
with anguish often goes
Or else he fears them, with hurt
whom he hath made his foes.
Shall then his learning good be called
which doth so many blame,
And hurt like stinging snake, no spares
the owner of the same?
And so of other faculties
that ill men occupy.
Esteemed them to be as good
like reason doth dent.
But now the wicked man is rich
with Gold and Jewels store,
Are not these riches good? not so,
tell me the cause wherefore.
Lo here I tell, because he doth
abuse them filthily,
He kepeth hores, and surfetteth,
and bawds therewith doth by,
With money greedy boys corrupts,
and with great gifts assays
The chastity of maidens poor
that happen in his ways,
And so that he may bring to pass
what lust doth him persuade
Regards no whit what laws of men
or Gods precepts do trade:
Who if he once be covetous
what crime dare he not do?
This wolf wc bloody mouth doth rag^
each fold to come unto,
And runs headlong into vice
his misch efe to contrive,
And every where he follows harde
as vile desire doth drive.
Nothing may worse be suffered
than fools in wealthy state,
Than rich men to be covetous
than ill men fortunate.
Thus ryther like to beasts he doth
with fleshely pleasures go,
Unto himself an enemy
and to his purse a foe:
Or else an other Tantalus
his goods to much doth spare,
And heaps up all, no knows for whom
these heaps he doth prepare.
And as the swine to his own bs^,
himself he doth not feed
But many mo, who fruits of toil
do snatch away with speed.
Whereby appears no goods to be
the riches of the i'll,
But if he stout and sturdy be
and stomach have at will
What doth he the? he stratght will brawl,
and with his mighty your
Now one, now others shall he harm,
and mischief every howre:
Most commonly a wartare goes,
or else becomes a chief,
That Tygarlyke by others blood
he may receive relief:
Both wars weapons fierce he loves
for mischief not for praise,
whereby he to his country gettes
both loss and shame always.
Stout personage void of virtuous mind
puts many men to pain,
Lastes little time, and seldom doth
to aged years attain.
But what needs many words herei^
sith these exampies may
Suffice the troth thereof to show,
and clearly to display.
Now meet it is with good advise
to search if ought can be
That harms the just and holy men,
as many judge we se:
Sure harde it is, yet boldly will
I thereto trudge apace
Presuming of Apolloes help,
and of my Muses grace.
First every good man needs must be
of soul and mind both sound,
Though sycknesse in his body rage
or ache in limbs be found:
Least will, and judgment tyght in him
do lack or not agree,
For void of judgment, right, will,
no virtuous man may be:
These two are the foundations
whereon doth virtue sit.
Such men whatsoever they possess
do justly order it:
And therefore is their learning good,
their substance and their strength,
And finally whatsoever they
possess, and have at length.
For in the greacest sort of things
the use of them we se
Is it that chi^fly causes them
both good, and ill to be.
And if so be thimmortall Gods
of men have any care,
They chiefly ought such to defend
as sust and virtuous are:
Which if they should not do they semde
all void of reason clear,
Unworthy cke of odour sweet,
of Church or service here.
Wherefore I do not se what thing
can harm the virtuous man,
No yet what ill in body, or
in mind, he suffer can:
Sith God him kepes and nourishes,
and with his mighty arm
Doth for him fight, and sets him safe
from every kind of harm.
For who helps not, or who doth not
defend his friend at need,
whenever he can, if that he do
bear him good will in deed?
But yet sometimes the good man seems
to live in misery,
To suffer need, and sicknesses,
and great adversity:
When as in deed he is not good,
but plays the Hipocrite:
Whereof a number shalt thou find
that under simple plight,
Do secret hide their poisoned hearts
and wolfish natures plain,
And foolish men do oft beguile,
while they do virtue fain:
And therefore god who knows ye hearts
and secrets of the mind,
Preserves him not, nor loves him.
But we with judgment blind,
And doltish head, deceived with sign
and shadow of the right,
Think then the just man suffers hurt,
and lives in woeful plight.
Alas how often false and fond,
are found the judgements blind
Of men, and eke how ignorant
of truth is mortal mind:
Al please themselves, and every man
in his conceit seems wise:
By this we cause the Gods to laugh,
hence errors most do rise.
But here admit the just man feels
both grief and sicknesses,
And leads his life in poverty,
and aye in great distress,
Exiled from his country far,
or pent in prison vile,
Or vexed with other casualties,
doth he take harm this while?
No: for in suffering of such things
more clearly shine he shall:
Al to the best to Godly men
as God commands doth fall.
And as Physicians use to give
the byttrest medcines oft
Unto the sick to bring them health,
and raise them up aloft:
So oftentimes God tries the just,
to stir them up thereby,
That so he may them more compel
their virtue to apply.
As pleasure makes men foals, nought
so payne doth cal to mind,
And chase vice, a bit to sin,
a spur to vertnes kind.
See thou not gold in fyry flame
more precious to be made?
And ground more ferule for to be
by edge of churlish spade?
And standing waters to corrupt?
On iron cast thine eye
Is fairer made by occupyings,
and rusts if it do lye.
Thus diverse things there are that vexed,
receive a clearer state,
As chiefly virtue, that when as
her blackest mischiefs mate
Appears most bright, as in the dark
the fire more fairer shows.
wherefore no kind of grief at al,
the good man ever knows:
Or if he suffers ought his pa*
cience gets him greater gain,
And medcine though it bitter be,
doth cause relcase of payne:
And least some man should think that I
do tryfies fain in mind:
The thing that wholesome others feel
is poison to some kind.
So unto some wines hurtful are,
and flesh a harmfull meat,
So wormwood unto many health
doth give, and pleasure great.
So heate doth Snow, and wax, and Ise
consume and melt away:
which heat doth harder make again
the earth or potters clay.
So many such in sundry states,
do work in diverse kind.
How left the same words some delight
that vex another mind?
Al things to al sorts are not like:
the wines that best we deem,
If they in musty calke be kept
both tart and nought do seem.
Unto the sound are al things sound,
but such as sycknesse have,
Them wholesome meates do sometime harm,
and almost bring to grave.
So (to my matter to return)
the ylles of body than,
Or stings of fortune hurtful be
unto the evil man:
But good and also necessary
for such as virtuous be,
By which although they hurtful seem,
they gain more hye degree.
These words for this time shall suffice,
for now this book to end
My Muse commands, Chiron doth
upon my Pen attend,
Who covets of state of man
to write, and fashtons rife,
And open to disclose abroad
the vestry here of life.
Now therefore needful is for me
my Muses tunes to cease,
And silent in the sacred woods
to rest my self in peace,
And on the roof of learnings lodge
on hye to hang my harp:
Till that these times be overpassed
and doubtful seasons sharpe,
Times much to be bewaylde: wherein
the discord that doth broil
Among the states, all Italy
with wars doth seek to spoil,
Whereby doth Rome lament her cafe,
her households laid on ground,
Ticinum, Narnia, Melphis eke
this fall have felt and found.
And Naples that with Mermaids tomb
so famous lately joyed
Beholding now her orchards fair
with French men's hands destroyed.
Alas doth heavy morn by streams,
of Sebethes so clear.
What should I tel the wodrous flames
that in the skies appear,
More bright than days locusts grim,
like clouds the Sun to hide,
And tender corue with greedy jaws,
to spoil on every side?
How many cities woeful plague,
and piteous famine sore,
Hath quite depriued of Citizens?
how many places more,
With floods are almost perished?
Alas now instly now doth God
plague us in sundry case?
What mischief do we not commit,
what justice is in place,
What love or service here of God?
Religion now is made
An occupation for the purse,
a Merchandise and trade.
The sacred rytes are aye defiled,
with hands of bandy mates.
Yet loke thereon and let it pass,
the Kings and Princely states,
And honour due to Christ above
they not esteem nor way.
Thus over us pore misers here,
such blocks do bear the sway,
Therefore I will go hence a while,
and in Parnasus hill
Until my Muse doth cal me forth,
lye close and secrete styll.
Sagittarius, the ninth Book.
IT waxes light now Muse enough
within Castalian lake,
We rested have, the wrest therefore
and Harp in hand go take:
Set strings in tune, and with thy grace
accustomed to thy kind,
Sing Goddess ancient melody:
good verses fill thy mind
That erst Apollo wonted was
in Bay tree woods to tel:
While he by river stood that runs
from out Permessus Well.
Us calls behold another ioyle
wherein some praise ooth lye,
Let us from hautye place and top,
of Parnas hills so bye
Behold the sundry minds of men,
and eke their living mark.
Now past the midst of surging seas
had run my sailing bark,
And now the tops of lofty trees
with frosty ryndes were white:
When as a certain God unknown
by me stood up in sight,
And shining with his beams divine
expellde the blackishe night.
A certain rock I then beheld
whose top did reach so hye,
That passing clouds above it might
discover plain the sky:
Harde seemed it first to enter up,
for ragged stones there was
Placed round about, which made ye way
both straight, and ill to pass,
The bottom all beset with briars:
the midst more mild again,
And nearer as it comes to skies
the path appears more plain,
And easier to be travailed,
Theorea eke it hight
Hereto me straightwayes did conduct
my Ghost and guiding spright.
To top whereof when as we came
I might behold and see,
Each place with wodrous syghts fulfild
and furnished to be,
Which if my tong would here declare
the Sun should sooner slyde
To lowest parts, and night the earth
with misty cloak should hyde.
While as I stay, and case upon
the large and joyful syghtes:
Lo falling from the skies aloft
a voice these words recytes:
Stellatus bow thy knees, and here
thy humble prayers make
Unto the Almighty king, without
whose grace thou can not take
The pleasant pleasures of this meunt.
Therefore in humble wise
Kneel thou to God, for favour all
doth fall to earth from skies:
For nothing is whereof to man
can greater profit flow,
Than heavenly help with holy prayers
to get, and God to know.
When this I heard, upon the earth
my face, and hand upright,
I bowed my knees, and poured out
these words in hearty plight.
O Father great of saints, chief power
that in the world may be,
Than whom may never thing be found,
nor thought of more degree,
Removed far from body here,
yet framing fashyons all,
Both such as never fade, and such
as times at length lets fall:
The first, and of beginning void,
the fountain whence doth spring
All kind of good, of nature eke
the auctor* guide, and king:
That all things here dost comprehend,
comprended thou of none,
The hye Almighty Majesty,
and chiefest good alone,
Life, wisdom, order, praise, and end,
mind, truth, way, light, and grace,
No where thy self inhabiting,
and dwelling in each place,
Unmoueable, and moving gives
to all and every thing,
From whom, in whom, eke by whom
all kind of things do spring:
In one estate remaining styll,
and changing in no time,
The chiefest cause that rolling aye
the Globe where stars do shine,
Doest guide by fixed law thappointed
force of destiny:
Of Lords the greatest Lord of all,
and King of Kings most hye,
Before whose face a thousand beasts
of Angels glistering bright,
Do minister with joyful hymns,
in presence of thy sight,
Amidst the ample fields of light
above the world so hye
Where aptest place and seat there is
for things of certaintye.
I worship thee, I honour thee,
and prostrate here on face
I lift mine eyes desiring thee
with mild and cherefull grace,
Upon me sinful man to look,
and hear my earnest cry,
Pour down into my earthly breast
thy beams of light from hye,
Drive darkness fro my mind oppressed
alas in doleful wise,
While in consuming carcass here
and fading flesh it lies.
Grant me the perfect path to find
least harmful errors sting
with fancy fond, and judgment blind,
in sin me headlong fling.
For without thee, the wit of man,
and force of mortal kind,
while it intends to mount a loft
receives a greater fall:
As Icarus whose wings him faylde
when he flew highest of all.
Grant therefore O most mighty king
to me thy creature lowe,
Thy will to learn, and thee to please,
and then that I may know
Mine own estate, from whence I came,
and where I was made,
And whether I at length shall pass
when that from hence I fade:
what here in life I should perform,
and what I should not do:
That when dame Lachesis my thread
of life hath snapped in two,
And that the farthest day is come
that long with privy stelth
Procured my grave death bring my rest
and part of saving health.
These words thus said, an other voice
again did pearce my ears,
Thalmighty Lord thou pleased hast
thy prayer full well he hears:
Pluck up Stellatus now thy heart
to thee for to remain
Here on this mount it granted is
and sacred fruits to gain.
This said forthwith the voice did cease,
nor word it uttered more:
Then in my mind a greater force
I felt, than erst before,
And sharper sight: then looked I forth
all things descerning well
And for my eyes, they might presume
old Linceus to excel.
With that I felt a subtle wind
to lift me up on hye,
which softly caused me to ascend
to top of starry sky:
Much like the bird that bears ye darts
that ^ulcans forge did frame,
That when we sin, ye thunder thomps
do fling and flash oft ^ame.
And now approcht I ne'er the Moon
whose ga^es I had in iyght,
Whereof, part glistred all with gold,
and part with silver white.
I entre in beholding al,
when straight with me doth meet
Timalphes young, of virtues great,
and eke of favour sweet:
(Whom of Arete Jove bega^
in ancient times of old.)
He knew me straight, for oft he had
his mothers hestes me told,
And when each other greeted was
he much things asked of me:
And after brought me to a town
of hugest quantity,
The lofty walls of Diamond strong
were raised hye and framed,
The bulwarks built of Carbuncle,
that all as fiery flamde.
O Lord what gorgeous houses there,
and goodly syghtes I saw,
As Temples fair, and Theaters,
and streets, and seares of law:
Al framed of silver, gold and stone,
and more of goodly kind
I there beheld, but cannot now
bear al away in mind:
And though I could remember al
yet God doth not allow,
That common peoples heads should know
the state of all, and how.
I wondered at the number great
that through the city so
Al clad in white by thousands thick
amid the streets to go,
Their heads beset with garlands fair
in hand the Lillies white,
They joyful bear Menarchus guide
of Cynthyus kingdom bright:
Remembering oft with Himnes they sing,
and sweet agreing lays,
Menarchus name they oft rehearse,
Menarch with Psalme they praise:
Menarchus name did Echo load
resounding oft send out,
He vanquished in happy field
the Arcadian giants stout:
As then Timalphes told to me
with words that were not vain.
Once was (quoth he) Arcadia void
of hills, and al lay plain,
There dreadful giants kingdom held,
as Maenalos the hye,
And Pholoe, and Lyceus great
that joyed in woods to lye:
And Erymanth whose shoulders bare
the backs of savage swine,
Cyllenes eke that boylde with spyte,
against the powers divine:
Who first before the rest presuming
al of force and might,
Durst give ill language to the Moon
with words of canckred spite,
That they before her long were borne,
and of more noble race,
And so that they deserve the names
of Gods, and higher place.
Besides in rage a tower they built
amid the skies to look:
O Nemroth larger far than thine,
and with an iron hooke,
Attempted thrice from place to pluck
this Goddess where she stands,
Blood red for fear to see her self
so ne'er to wretches hands:
Menarchus gave them thrice repulse
with valiant force and might,
And thrice the juice out pressed from gras
of old Saturnus spright:
Among them ^ast the poison runs
straight ways through al their bones
With chy^ling cold, consumed with pain
they leave their lives at once:
And vggly souls they clean forsake,
which hell below receaues,
Where as with pains they plagued are
that never after leaves.
But now their bodies quite destroyed
by force of venom late,
Their carcass turned to lofty hills
kepes name with changed state.
Whereby this deed and triumph great
in mind the Moon men hear,
And celebrate with solemn pomp
this feast from year to year,
And to their king they worship make
with great and joyful cheer.
Thus passing forth, we found a tower
that all of Gold did shine,
Al wrought, set with precious stones
of sundry colours fine:
Here quoth my guide, no mortal man
may ever set his feet:
We stayde therefore, and by the space
of large and ample street,
On every side we might behold
approaching souls at hand,
And there before the seat and place
of judgment for to stand:
Which placed was against the tower,
and wrought right cunningly,
Three sons of Jove and faith begot
sit there in sea^es full hye,
To judge the souls, regarding well
of al their sins the store,
And virtuous deeds that every man
hath done in earth before.
Telescopus and Dorophon
Philorthus friend always
To justice, these, deserts and faults
in perfect balance way:
And by their judgements very few
to heaven did ascend:
But thousands of the same again
to earth did down descend,
And many also in the Moon
they did command to stay.
Astonished long with gasyng sight
at length I began to say:
Declare to me good guide quoth I,
if Hell beneath doth lye
In deepest dungeon of the earth,
and to the Center ny,
And souls thereto conveyed they say
the corse clapped under hearce,
Old Aeacus and Minos there
and Radamanthus fearce
Do ever judge, and give rewards
or else deserved payne,
How chances it I here behold
the like thing done again?
Man mind (quoth he) in prison dark
of carcass shut doth lye:
And forced by fault and ignorance,
is led by ways awry.
By this is man to dreams and toys
of nature prone and bent,
And from the truth he wanders far,
if grace do not prevent.
No marvel thoe, if many things
your Poets false have song:
Because to tread the steppes of truth
lies not in every tong.
But thou, have always well in mind
these mysteries I tell:
All things are good and never fade
above the Moon that dwell,
Nor grief can vex those sacred states:
But all that nature framed beneath
the Moon, is nought, and ill,
And law severe of death doth feel,
and force of time to spyll.
These places doth the middle sphere
of Moon in twain divide,
Placed equally betwixt the world
doth bounds to heaven bide.
Thus when that life is fled, all souls
are brought unto this place,
And here plead gilty or vngilty
before the judges face:
By whose award, to certain rooms,
according to their deeds
They straight are sent, receiving there
for their deserts their meedes.
And every one the henyer they
with heaps of vice are made,
The deeper they descend the pyt
of dark infernal shade.
Again the better that they be
and farther of from crime,
So much they higher mounting up,
more ny the heavens clime.
But they whose ylles do counterpease
the virtues of their mind,
For to remain about the Moon^,
are many years assinde:
Till either falling fresh to vice,
when many years are spent,
They turn to earth, or purged well,
are into heaven sent.
Lo thus he said. But then again
what is the cause quoth I,
That souls so few the stars approach
and gain the heavens hie?
Why run they headlong so to vice,
and (Misers) virtue fly,
Why more esteem they dark than light
and rather sin to apply
Than virtue pure? where of to them
doth so great madness rise?
What will so fond doth them beguile,
what fancy bleares their eyes?
Then answered thus Aretes son:
both I do it desire,
And mete it is, that I disclose
the things thou dost require,
And many other things beside,
which thou thy self shalt say,
Are worthy to be learned here
and to be borne away,
Since here without the power of God
I know thou can not come,
Who list such things to thee to show:
before the gates of whom
No man alive may once approach,
except by him assinde,
Then now give ear, and what I say,
bear well away in mind.
But needful first it is for us
a little hence to walk.
We went, and in a lofty tower
we both sit down to talk,
From whence both seas land full plain
we might behold and see.
Then thus from sacred breast, this voice
he uttered out to me:
As of them selves the souls can not
be ill, nor bent to sin,
Since yt their kind doth come fro skies
and spring from God begin:
Nor of their own and proper will,
their natures can be nought,
Since God them made who never thing
of evil state hath wrought.
But many other causes be
that into dungeon vile
Of hell do downwards thrust these souls
and them with vice defile.
And chief of them the body is,
wherein the soul lies bound
As in a prison strong, whose bonds
doth judgment quite confound:
No otherwise than fire is hid
within an earthen pot,
And misty clouds do dark the sight
of flaming Phebus hot.
Then all things doth the soul forget,
And Lethes streams doth taste,
And like apperes to papers blankt,
wherein no word is placed.
Thus captive closed in fading flesh,
a thousand mischiefs ill,
A thousand Monsters her assault,
and always seek to spill,
Like as the Goldefinch while in cage,
her doleful destiny
with sundry fortes of pleasant tune
doth seek to pacify:
To whom all close and covertly
the crafty Cat comes near,
And drives molesting sore the wretch
on every side to fear.
The Cat a bane to simple birds,
of Mice the finder out,
She fearing sore the spoilers paw,
doth slutter round about
The Cage, and saves her self by flight:
when present doth appear
An other foe with fury like
the selly wretch to fear,
Who thrusting in her Tallons sharpe,
doth take her clean away,
And feeds thereon with wonted noise
as on accustomed pray.
So (...)* and there with diverse foes
th'vnhappy soul is tossed,
And flying far the gins of some
is in the others lost:
White inclo^de in carcass here it li^
It knows not what to do,
(...) danger here for to beware,
or what to cleave unto.
And with the show of good deceived,
much like the drunken wight
It stackring stands. Whereby, if that
by some that teach aright,
Or by their aid that warning give,
it be not led or brought
From darkness blind unto the light,
it runs styll to nought,
And better things doth aye refuse.
of soul the chiefest staye:
Contagion first, and chiefest ill,
that through the flesh doth rain,
Is ignorance of truth and good,
from whence out springs than,
False judgment as the greatest plague
that happens unto man.
Whereof two monsters are begot,
folly, and wickedness,
From these two every (...) proceeds
that man can here express.
For all men sin, either because
the goods here counterfeat
^hey most esteem as folly leads,
or else that mischief great
^oth prick them forth to wicked de^.
Wherefore, we justly may
Count him a fool, or wicked man,
that doth from reason stray.
But in that part of soul that lusts,
there syttes dame follies grace,
And there she pytched hath her tents,
and chose her dwelling place:
In the other part all bent to wrath,
there mischief hath his hold,
With force, and Craft, poison strong
most dreadful to be told.
These two (for truth) are mighty kings,
and armies great behind
They lead, and both destroy
the state of mortal kind.
They both are ygnorant of truth,
and framed false judgment by,
(As erst was told) the souls that in
the careasse buried lye
Unmindful of their own estate,
and void of light withal,
Into three lakes of Hell, and death,
they lead, and down let fall.
Of which the first Limosum hight,
therein doth pleasure rain,
Spinosum is the other called,
where vile desire to gain,
And covetousness, doth rule: the third
Fulmosum hath to name,
Where pride bears sway, yt thristeth still
for honours hye and fame.
In these three lakes the greatest part
do perish every day:
Of all the souls within the world
this is the chief decay.
For such as slyde into these pooles.
them evermore destroys
The lust of flesh, and greedy mind,
of fond and fading joys.
No of themselves they knowledge have
nor of the heavens bright,
Nor other life they think to be
than this in present sight.
O fylthy, fond, and doltishe minds
from heaven turned quite,
Not minding hye or worthy things
but still in brutish plite,
Respecting only here the earth.
Besides are causes mo,
whereby the souls infected are,
and often plaged so.
For where the clouds are thronged thick
and showers of rain proceed,
And winds with dreadful meeting sound
do flash of lightnings breed,
There is the place of ugly sprites,
by whom do plagues arise,
With battles fierce raging storms,
through seas, and land that flies.
By craft and by the tempting force
of them, and their deceit,
The simple sort of men do fall
to every mischief great:
Hereby both right and honesty,
they quite cast from their mind.
But now, because these temptours here,
and fiends of devilish kind,
Few can obtain with eyes to se,
therefore but few believe
That any such things do remain,
nor credit will they gene:
Nay rather many do account
it but an idle fame,
And as at dreams of folks diseased,
so laugh they at the same.
But thou drive from thy mind away
this foolish heresy,
And give good credit to my words
of greatest certainty.
And for because thou shalt perceive
I teach not trifles vain,
I will procure that thou shalt see
all things before thee plain.
But first it needful is with prayers
Dame Rainbow for to try,
Who wonted was to bear the hestes
of Iuno through the sky:
That she with wind disperse ye clouds,
and make the skies look fair,
Least that thy sight be hindered,
by dymnesse of the air.
Then humbly in this wise I praide:
O thou Thaumatis hye,
Of sundry colour to behold
a beauty to the sky,
That stretchest forth in misty clouds,
thy great and mighty bow,
And Phebus shining bright his beams
in thee doest bear and show,
And floods up sucked unto the clouds
dost bring and carry far,
O Rainbow wondrous sight to men
and Iunoes Messanger:
And truly got of Thaumas old,
the daughter passing fair,
Grant I thee pray all darkness fled
a clear and Crystal air.
Shut up in caves of Eolus,
the south winds cause of rain,
And send abroad the northern blasts,
to make fair days again.
Immediately upon these words,
from out the northern side
Did Boreas blow, and with his blast
cleared all both round and wide,
Then sprinkling in mine eyes a juice,
my guide, behold quoth he,
Now shall the secrets of the world,
reveled be to thee.
Now open wide your springs, plain
your caves abroad display,
You Systers of Parnasus hill,
beset about with bay,
And unto me (for need it is)
a hundred tongues in verse
Send out, that I these airy kings
and people may rehearse,
Deceivers great of men and guides
of vice, which all that live
Do styll molest: and by their craft
mans soul to hell do give.
Here first whereas in chariot red
Aurora fair doth rise,
And bright from out the Occean seas,
appears to mortal eyes,
And chase hence the Hellish night,
with blushing beauty fair,
A mighty King I might discern,
placed hie in lofty chair,
His hair with fyry garland dockt,
puffed up in fiendish wise,
With brows full broad, threatening loke,
and fyry flaming eyes.
Two monstrous horns large he had,
and nostrils wide in sight,
Al black himself, for bodies black
to every evil spright
And vggly shape, hath nature dealt,
yet white his teeth did show,
And white his grenning tusks stood,
large wings on him did grow,
Framed like the wings of Flindermics
his feet of largest sis,
In fashion as the wild Duck bears,
or Goose that creaking cries:
His tail such one as Lions have
Al naked sate he there
But bodies covered round about
with loathsome shagged hair,
A number great about him stood,
a wondrous forte of men,
A greater company I think
than Xerxes trained, when
By force of arms (unhappy man)
the Greckes he did invade:
And scarce in safety could return
with al the flight they made,
Each one of them in hand a hooke
did hold, and Belbowes bear,
With bellows for to fill their heads,
with wind, whom Fortune here,
Had either lent great store of gold:
or whom they saw full well,
In learning, beauty, state or strength,
their fellows to excel.
With hooke such as with wanto wind
were puffed sufficiently,
Amid the smoky lakes to cast,
with Snakes and Toads to lye.
And other monsters there that dwelt.
This lusty foresaid King,
Tiphurgus had to name: as said
my guide that told each thing.
Then where the Sun doth downward fall,
amid the western streams:
From whence among the Spaniards,
he throws his latest beams,
I cast mine eyes, and like the first low
another King in sight
I had, that sate in seat aloft,
his name Aplesto hight:
A number great of sprites he ruled,
such as amid the west
Are bred, and such as in those parts
do dwell and have their rest.
Each one of them a Serpent holds,
a flesh hooke also hath.
Then spake Timalphes in this sort:
see thou quoth he, to wrath
How every man their Serpents move?
and pinching oft do touch,
That sharper may they set their teeth,
and poison more by much
Destil in hearts of earthly men,
for they on whom doth hit,
The force of those such poisoned teeth,
do forth with lose their wit,
And he auenly things do clean despise:
and with such thirst they broil,
That licoure none can them suffice
with drink in vain they toil.
And while thus evermore in vain
they drink and styll are dry,
Unmindful of their death, their lot,
themselves, and heavens hye:
Then straight at had these devils come
with hooks as here you see,
And catches them, strykes the throats
that yet full thirsty be
To fling in floods of thorney lake:
where as with wondrous pains
They punished are with Monsters vile
that secret there remaynes:
Blond specially with bloudsuckers
that thick about them lies:
And hyting styll, both day and night,
them plages in piteous wise.
At length they yield again the blood,
that whilst they here did live
They sucked from men, nor ease of smart
no space of years can give.
This King both makes and plages such men
as covetous he made.
This said, I turned my eyes to stars
that glide in coldest glade,
Whereas our Pole doth plain behold,
and view the double bear,
And where Boots drives his wane,
in ever rolling sphere.
And there an other king I see,
and thousand spirits ill
That dwell about those northern parts
whose hands great hooks do fill.
Then said my guide: this king yt raigns
in parts of Boreas cold
Of Lechery, and Gloconye,
doth Crown and Sceptre hold.
Philocreus eke to name he hath,
in fraud full like the rest:
O Lord with how great harms doth he
poor mortal men molest?
For on these hooks that here thou see
the baits that taste full well,
He tyeth fast where poison lurks
of filthy floods of hell.
And with these baits he doth comaude
the doltishe fools to take,
And caught in puddles to be cast
of muddy miery lake.
Who straight transformed into shape
of vgglye beasts, appears
Both Swine and Asses, Bulls Fox,
and wolves, and loathsome Bears:
And others Monsters void of mind.
Nor this doth yet suffyse,
with Harnets, wasps, Betels blind
that round about there flies,
Continually they vexed are.
Lo thus Philocreus men are plagued
in piteous painful wise,
That covet only carnal joys,
and virtue here despise.
Thus saith my guide, but I my eyes
about the southern pole
Do cast, fro whence ye clouds are caused
in every place to roll.
with steadfast sight I note, what sort
of sprites I there can see,
And flocks of fendes with wings full black
that swiftly flying be.
Amongst them all a mighty king
there stood with Crown of pride
with lowering brows, and dogged loo^
and in his mouth full wide
A monstrous tongue he hissyng shock,
and like the loathsome Snake
He castes abroad from out his throat
a fylthy poison black,
Such as the adder (while he burns
with love of Lamprey long,
Much fearing for to harm his joy
with deadly venom strong)
Casts up among the ragged rocks,
and hydes it secretly,
And springing straight with lusty leap
into the seas doth fly,
And calling oft with hissing sound
doth seek his lovers dear,
Who runs to meet her mate in hast,
whose voice she weldoth hear,
And both with much embracing join.
But when their pleasant play
Is fully past, and finished,
the Snake with joy away
Doth swim to land, and on the rock
whereas his poison lay,
He searches for his own defence.
which if he find away,
Or spylt, or trodden under foot,
such grief he then sustaynes,
That mourning, weary of his life
he dashes oft his brains,
Against the sharp and ragged stones
till that his breath at last
With al his wretched pains grief,
by death be overpassed.
Such was this King, and such did seem
his subjects for to be:
Oft times the Prince a pattern is
unto the commontie.
with Fawchon great in right hand held
each one of them he goes,
Al black, both face, and teeth, and lips
al full of fylthy froth.
This King was Lord of envy great
Timalphes cold me there,
And that Miastor was his name,
by whose award seucre,
His servants fill the hearts of men
with froth of canckred spyte.
Then runs the plague through every vein,
and every where doth light,
But most of al doth vex the eyes,
that they (...) suffer may
To see their fellows live in wealth,
but thereat pine away.
At last they thrust the through with darts
and souls full sick expel,
Whereon with triple throat doth chaw
the fiendish hound of Hell:
And chawed, to poiso strong doth turn,
and of their bodies spring
Fowl Scorpions, which although they fawn
with tail do deadly sting.
But now behold the middle parts,
that in the air doth lye,
And there Sarcotheus see, above
the rest a King most hie.
And of them al most mischievous.
The other Kings that be,
Do fear and also worship him,
the power and rule hath he
Of al the devils in the world
from whom the mischiefs al
Do flow as from a point: and as
the beams from Phoebus fall.
I then beheld this vggly fiend,
placed under cloth of state,
That in his hand the sceptre held,
of mischief pride and ha^e.
From him doth spring f^l bloody cobs*
and seven horns in bight,
The number like of lofty towers
in show resembling right.
His ears his nostrilles and his eyes
all fyerie filthy glow,
And from his dampishe throat he doth
the smoky flames out throw,
Alas, how far the number great
of his companions spread,
What armies armed all with darts
and gunnes, this fiende doth lead:
As if he would the heavens burst,
and saints from thence expel.
Then quoth my guide: this devil once
in beauty did excel,
And most with God in favour stood:
but mind disposed ill,
And pride to prosprous state allied,
this Miser quite did spyll.
For like to God he needs would be,
and honours equal have,
And thus from thence was banished
the proud presumptuous slave.
Whom Michaell as he was assynde,
in grisley cloud hath tide,
And there appointed him his place
where he should styll abide.
But often, of his old estate,
and joys of passed ^yme
Remembering well, in vain he strives
and thinks the skies to clime.
Hereof doth come the thunder cracks,
and fearful flames of light,
And ghastly syghtes of fire do flash,
from clouds as dark as night:
The beasts for fear amassed stand,
and hearts of men do quake.
But vexed in vain, and to no end
his travails doth he take,
Nor nearer can he come to skies.
And he that guide of light
was once, and called Lucifer,
loves now to walk by night,
And darkness best of all estemes,
and leads with him his sprightes,
And bugs, and goblins grimm or hell
and such deformed syghtes:
Sometimes by day when as he joined
a troupe of armed knaves,
And straws with bloody Corses ye fields,
or drowns ships in wanes,
Or when such mischief great he works:
Then comes he forth by light
But close, and sends abroad his men
in secret privy plight,
Which moves the hearts of wicked m^
and them with fury ^illes,
And secretly with sylent voice
persuades their mind yo ylles.
But then quoth I: I thee beseech my guide
let us now leave
These monstrous Devils to behold,
and state of man perceive:
For from this mount we easily may
both land and seas discrye,
Nor profit small I thee assure
in this prospect doth lye.
Then gazed we both upon the earth:
and first I wondered most,
To see such diverse colours strange
in men of sundry cost.
For those that nearest lead their life
unto the middle lyne,
Are black, with blaberlips, and hair
both curlde and crisped fine,
And naked clean, or couerde else
with skin of Kids full ill.
But such as dwell about the North,
where Gold is quaking styll,
In whytenesse seem to pass the snow,
and scarce they can expel
With garments long many clothes
the clode that there doth dwell.
Between these people all that be,
with black and white are died,
But more and less as far and ne'er
they from the Sun abide.
While thus I fondly wondered at
the things that there I see,
Why doest ye (quoth my guide) regard
the things that vaynest be?
why view thou thus the colours vain
in flesh of mortal man:
Far better shall it be for thee
their manners well to scan,
And diverse fashyons of their minds,
and works of them to see,
whereby thou shalt behold the life
of man, I showing thee,
And what confusion is therein.
First, fain thou here a hand,
whose thombe directly upward rise
and fingers open stand:
And on the thombe place thou the men
of best disposed mind,
That worldly things do here despise,
and things of heavenly hind
Do only seek, and most esteem
dame wysedomes sacred grace,
Delighting nature to behold,
and hye Celestial place,
Unharmefull, gentle, loving best
the virtuous things and right,
Whom neither riches can corrupt,
nor fleshely fond delight,
Nor glass of pompous state allure:
men of a heavenly kind,
And Gods incarnate here on earth,
but rare and scant to find.
For all such things that perfect are
are scarce and selde to see,
O that the mighty Lord would cause
thee such a one to be.
Next stands to this the forefinger,
whereto thou shalt assyne
Discretest men, the second sort,
and good we them defyne,
Yet lean they some thing to the world,
as fit to bear the sway
In cities and in common wealths,
and banners to display,
And faith and justice eke they love,
and virtuous seek to be:
Yet from the pleasures of the world
they are not fully free.
To whom if God at any time
the rule and empire give,
Then comes the golden times again,
and virtue here to live,
And justice to the earth returns,
and peace doth bear the sway,
And vice with punnishement severe
is forced for to stay.
The middle finger follows then,
of estimation small,
Whereon thou must apoint a place
unto those Minions all,
Whose minds are ready to conceive,
and wits for to invent,
Whose tongs do flow with eloquece,
to utter their intent:
But wicked, and unjust they are
and full of vyllanyes,
And bending always to the earth
do not behold the skies,
A subtle sort, that foxes hearts
within their guilfull breast,
Do always bear, and simple souls
with fraud do styll molest.
And when as most they virtue hate,
yet list they for to seem,
Both good, and Godly men, and such,
as virtue most esteem,
And other wise than they do mean
their tong doth talk always:
And all they do is done for gain,
or else for hope of praise,
Nor life but this they none esteem
nor look for to enjoy.
And these are they that evermore
do wise men most annoy,
And armed with fraud, on favour staide
(which either they obtain,
With slavish service done to them,
or else with gifts do gain)
The Godly purposes they let,
and truth with craft they hyde:
And if their cunning there do fail
then force in time is tried,
Then use they swords, or flames of fire,
or strength of poison try:
And if they cannot closely hurt
then work they openly.
With these such iolye servitors
in every time, and place,
The Dieul doth his Kingdom keep,
and eke his own good grace.
This staff he chiefly leans on,
with this great help and stay,
He conquest makes upon the earth,
and brings them to obey.
More crafty Knaves than wiseme live,
and stronger aye they be,
That wyn the Palm, and triumph still,
with spoil of honesty.
Which when they sceptre hold in hand,
or rule in cities bear,
Then comes the iron world again,
and Mars approaches near,
Then fury conquers laws and right,
then lawful is it found
For vice to live vnpunnished,
then virtue lies a ground.
No men more mischievous than these
among the mortal state
Do live, nor none there are that more
the Gods above do hate.
Now next in place the Fools do sit,
who presently must stand
Upon the finger fourth in place,
of this thy feigned hand.
Of Fools the greatest number is:
who doth not plainly know?
Dame nature joys in making Fools,
as she doth oft to sow
Both Nettles, Docks, filthy Weeds
dull wit, and doltysh brain
These Idiotes have, they seek not for
the joys of soul to gain:
And only of their life, and paunch,
like beasts their God they make.
These doltysh Fools by thousand wiles
the crafty sort do take,
And many false and wicked things
to do, they them persuade,
And with their language as they list
do train them to their trade.
For Fools do quickly credit give,
as children also will,
But soonest to vice: opinions worst
in them appears styll,
To whom is also worser mind:
here of it doth arise
That Foals believe these crafty Knaves
before the Godly wise:
For council nought these Foxes give,
and teach from truth to slyde,
And underneath a painted cote,
the fylthy vice they hyde.
But though by many means they do*
these foresaid doltes beguile,
Of superstition yet there is
a plain and easy while,
Well known to al the worlds of old:
the which this subtle kind
Doth chiefly use, for to the church
of God themselves they bind,
And holy rytes they minister.
Then cause they sore to fear
The blockish hearts of Idiotes,
and them they threaten there,
Except with gifts they please ye saints
except they do appease
With Gold the wrath of God for syn,
and purchase their release,
Which straight these Prelats chaste receive,
wherewith they fat and feed
The Harlots and their Courtesans,
and Mules to serve at need.
For who doth not the life of Priests
both note and well behold?
And how they do poor Fools deceive?
yet escape they uncontrolled:
Such is the suffrance now of Kings,
that only do apply
Their minds to pastime, belly cheer,
and filthy lechery.
These things the Gods do aye permit
that little seem to wey
What hands do deal their sacraments
what hearts do them obey,
What honours here on earth they have
or else what blasphemy.
But now to Fools I come again,
whom when in seat on hie
Hath Fortune placed for her delight,
O Lord what number great
Of Follies shalt thou then behold?
to long it were to treat.
Then virtue made a jesting stock,
and placed aloft is vice,
Then dances fond, and bankettings,
and plays are had in price:
Then flock of Parasites and whores,
in every place are seen:
Then filthy fond delight alone
doth guide the soil as Queen.
For as the Prince is commonly
so do the subjects live,
And to the like behaviours aye
themselves they always give.
Not only pleasure unto Fools
of kindred we do find,
But anger oftentimes doth match
her self with Foolish mind:
For Fools are easily moved to wrath,
and desprate enterprise,
As oft as fury slames within
and choler up doth rise:
Then wicked love of weapon springs,
and bloody broils thereby,
That many corses give to death
full cold in grave to lye:
A naughty kind of men are these
and much to be avoided.
The last the little finger is
wherwyth the ears are scratched,
And therefore called the earefynger
where mad men placed sit,
That lack the use of reason right,
and that have lost their wit:
Whose fury if it never cease,
more fit for them to dye
It were, and from so great disease
by means of death to fly.
Of good men thus two only kinds
there are, and never more:
The rest are always nought and ill,
avoid them well therefore,
Or if thou can not them avoid,
beware yet at the least
Thou mouest them not, ye common sort,
a fierce and cruel beast
Do always rage, and hurtful be.
When thus Timalph had taught,
May not (quoth I) these Foals wolves
to good estate be brought?
May vice by no means be expelled?
or if there be a way
Disclose to me. Then on this sort
Timalphes began to say:
As nature in man body doth
diseases diverse breed,
So many Sicknesses to the mind
from her do like proceed:
And travail like to both hath dealt.
Lo, how she man doth love:
Yet many succours hath she set
for mortal man behove,
Which if she had not done, to sore
and cruel had she been.
Therefore ye same that helped hath har^,
and as to harm she is seen,
So had she skill to heal again:
that justly you may doubt
A natural Mother her to cal,
or else a stepdame stout.
But now let us the bodies griefs,
and medcins for the same
Pass over quite, in many books
declared of ancient fame:
And of the mind as much as need
shall presently require,
Let us here speak to teach more plain
the thing thou did desire.
And first, as nature so disposing it
the rude and country field,
^le Nettels, weeds brembels sharp
continually doth yield,
Except it oftentimes be tilde,
and eke with labour sore,
The hurtful wedes with plough rakes
be caused to grow no more,
Nor this enough, it needful is
good seeds therein to cast,
And daily for to husband it
till danger all be past.
Even so the mind whilst it is bound
within the body here,
Is ouergrowen with Briars sharp,
and wild it doth appear:
Except it aided be with help
of one that tills well,
And aptly virtues therein plants,
and vices doth expel.
But what is husbandry of mind
perhaps thou seek to know:
Its wisdom, wisdom that I mean,
that manners good doth show,
That makes men virtuous for to be,
and plain doth teach the way
To mortal men, of living right,
and leaving for to stray,
Persuading them to lead their lives
in perfect Godly state,
And right ousnesse to exercise,
and sins to shun and hate.
This only is the wisdom true,
and not that other kind,
Where Physicians and vain clerks
do still apply their mind:
Attempting causes hid of things
to bring abroad to light,
And for to search the secrete celles
of nature, day and night:
Materiam primam, and Vacuum,
and thousand monsters more
with blustering countnace belching out,
that they might seem therefore
Well learned, and stuffed full
their purse with coin may strain.
O goodly wisedoe, whose learned youth
do either gape for gain,
Or swell with vain ambition:
but none amongst them thoe
Doth vertuouser, from thence
or better manerde go,
No teacher of the mind is this,
nor wisdom her we call:
But rather knowledge hath to name,
if that she do not fall,
From doubtful paths of men deceiude.
who this hath learned than
No wit but knowledge gains by it,
and of a cunning man
Perchance he bears the name, but not
of wyss and prudent wight.
These two do differ far in state,
and works in diverse plight,
From wisdom springes ye fruit of life,
from knowledge the flower doth rise,
The one doth profit, aid, and help,
the other beautifies:
The one respects the inward things,
the other outward shine,
The one makes virtuous men, good,
the other learned, and fine.
Thus wisdom only decks the mind
which manners God doth show
As I have said, destroys vice,
and virtue there doth sow,
And waters it with heavenly showers.
O light of mankind here,
O per^ite way of saving health,
defence, and comfort clear,
Both entry door, and guide of life
O peace, and salve of mind,
O blessed worthy san^tuary,
O wisdom sweetest kind,
That Nectar doest excel in taste,
to whom art thou now dere?
who follows thee? what place hast thou
on earth, what honours there?
In Temples wast thou wont to rain,
in schools, and proches lowe,
In Councelles, and in courts of kings,
now no man doth thee know:
But Poets dreams and tryfles fond
for thee in place do rain.
what ^earnes (...) scholar now in schools,
what knowledge doth he gain?
But ^ansyes vain, or bawdy tales:
be hold in seat full hye
The Master sy^tes, which book before
that open wide doth lye,
And spitting oft he well doth view
his great assembled crowd,
And when he sees them bent to hear,
with lofty voice and load,
He then expoundes some dreadful ghost
of doleful tragedy.
Or else some harlots tricks declares
in wanton Comedy,
Or doting lones of ancient time,
or else to light doth bring
Some monstrous, or some cruel fact,
or lamentable thing.
O brain deserving to be p^rged,
doest thou these ways instruct?
The tender minds and ignorant
bring up with such a frui^t?
Is this the salt where of the age
so young is made to say?
Is it not shame with ^ryfles such
to pass the time away?
By this so many naughty knaves,
and villains do appear:
By this the grove of vices thick
up springs every where:
When as no virtuous bringing up
of Children can be found.
O you that youth do not correct,
but rather them confound,
Learn first your selves to live upright,
and then to others show
A virtuous trade, least like to beasts
you live, and nothing know.
But thou Stellatus harken well,
to thee I will express
which way thou shalt apply thy mind
to perfect vertuousnesse.
First, oft in mind remember well
one God alone to be,
E^ernall best, omnipotent,
and of most hye degre,
Who heaven, and the golden Stars
that shine throughout al the sky,
The rest of things that may be seen,
or not be seen with eye,
Of nothing, with his beck alone
before all times hath made,
And framed the kepes, governs here
with everlasting trade.
Him worship, honour, fear and praise,
and often to him pray,
Both nights, days, when Sun doth rise
and Sun doth fall away,
And when from both in equal space
his Globe doth distant glow:
For virtue chief and wisdom chief,
it is, the king to know.
Of saints above, and father of men
to love with heart entire
To praise him always and to dread,
and humbly him desire.
Without this same all virtues else,
think nothing worth to be,
For almost this, and nothing else
sufficient is for thee.
Therefore have always God in heart,
and often in thy mind
And call to him, nothing than this
more vertnous can thou find:
This is to all the virtues else
the open door, and plain,
For without grace, and aid of God,
no man can them obtain,
Nor able be to fly from vice.
Besides the sayn^ts above that dwell,
and hostess of messengers,
And servants of the chiefest Lord,
and holy Ministers,
Fulfilling the commandment of
his Majesty divine,
That always stand before his face
in skies full clear that shine:
With holy mind remember oft
in humble sort to pray,
That they may help thee in thy need,
and dangers drive away,
And thee unto the Lord commend:
for truly Angels can,
And often use to profit much
the earnest praying man.
Nor, be not thou (beware thereof)
amongst such sort a mate,
That think that nature never made
a thing of higher state
Than man: mad men, yt when they see
so plain before their eye,
Both seas and land of Creatures full,
do think that in the sky,
And in the Stars no dwellers be,
and indge the ample space
Of blessed heaven for to be
a void, and desert place.
O crabde, and crookde untoward souls,
O minds in darkness drounde.
Mans sense can not all things perceive,
for many things are found
That often times deceive the eyes,
which yet the mind doth see:
Therefore what reason moves in mind
must rather followed be:
Which teaches that there is a God,
and dwellers in the sky:
Wherefore ye Stars are either Gods,
Or Temples where they lye.
These ground works laid, with all thy heart,
embrace thou righteousness,
And let no injury of thine
be any mans distress,
By words or deeds no man can hurt,
nor deal thou so with men
As thou would not be dealt withal,
but always do to them
As thou would they should do to thee:
thus nature doth decree.
Which if thou straightly dost not keeps
give credit unto me:
Thou never can be favoured of
that majesty divine,
Nor after death unhappy man
thou shalt the heavens clime.
An others honour, fame, or state,
harm not in any case,
When vile desire doth move, or wrath
or envy comes in place:
But rather help such as thou know
to be of virtuous mind,
With all thy force, and pleasure do
to men of wicked kind
Sometimes, that so they hurt thee not,
or seldomer thee harm:
And let not bribes, nor love, nor hate,
thy mind from justice charm,
For these are three especial things
that dasell sore the sight
Of mind, and drive men ever more
from doing well and right:
But styll have God in memory,
and death to come in mind,
Then f^ye the enticements of the flesh
and byts of sharpest kind
On pleasure put: For nothing doth
to man more mischief bring
Than ill delight, to virtue sure
a most contrary thing:
For virtue labours evermore
the heavens hye to climb,
But pleasure ennimy to the skies
doth downward styll decline,
And groueling gaseth on the earth,
as beasts do commonly,
Destroying strength of body here
and force of mind: whereby
It breeds a dull and slothful sense,
and sharp dyseases makes.
This is that Circes, that Siren
and hooke of Stygian lakes,
With this same snare a number great
of souls, the Devil takes,
And suffers not them after death
their country Skies to see,
But wyly wraps them in mists
of Hell his mates to be.
These baits therefore, this poison sweet
of fylthy fiendish foe,
With al thy might avoid them well,
and warily from them go:
Lest that when greater years do come,
in vain thou dost repent
Thy self, thy substance, fame, and wit,
so lost and fondly spent.
Then shalt thou say as many do,
O goodly times in mind,
How vilely have I you abused?
where now should I you find?
Unhappy man: If God would grant
again my former time,
And once again the Samian branch
I might assay to climb,
Thereto I would where as the earth
his horne forth doth stretch,
Though that the way be strayt, steep
the top there of to retch.
No kind of thing doth virtue pass,
which always doth remain,
Which honour gives, and hie estate,
and glory great doth gain,
Preserves the life, and doth augment
the goods that here you have,
And doth remain, when death hath cast
the fading corse in grave.
But me unhappy wretch alas
did pleasure sweet de^eaue,
And fled away doth me in briars
and many mischienes leave:
For whilst that I in youthful years
the ^ewes do oft frequent,
And while to feeding, sleep, and play,
my dol^sh mind was bent,
Nought would I learn, hating books,
did study much despise,
And learning scorn, but now alas
I see before my eyes,
My self vnlearnde, of ill report,
in beggarly array,
My strength decayde, my mind appald,
my senses worn away:
Al this time have I lived as he
that lies a sleep in dreams,
Doth think him self awake to be
deceived by such means.
Like words to these doth utter of^
the s^outhfull s^uggish man,
When age the neighbor next to death,
doth count to late as than
His life led ill in youthful years.
The greatest sort do shut the door
when Steed is stolen away:
And wise they are when as to late
their wits they do assay,
And for Physicians fa^ they seek,
when hope of health is gone.
O wretches whilst you here have time,
look well this time upon:
For fast away the hour ^yes,
and fled can not re^ou^ne,
No tears can help the corse in grave,
nor sobs for him to morn:
That medcine only is of force
which is in time applied,
Therefore must virtue be embracde,
when youth is first in pride:
And then it needful is to to tread
the perfect path of life,
And virtuous works to take in hand,
then reason must be rife,
And mind with council must be ruled
while yet but young it is:
Least that with fond delight deceyude,
it he adlong run amysse.
Who so is wise let him in time
with wisdom well provide,
For after wits are evermore
to folly next allied:
And out of time it brings grief
be wailing al in vain,
A hurt or loss that never can
be brought or got again.
Beside, the wicked thirst of wealth,
and vile desire of gold
Must thou eschew, for where a place
this covetousness doth hold
There rain almost each other vice:
as shameful perjuries,
Ungoolinesse, theft, and disceyt,
with open robberies,
Guyles, treasons, and conspyracies,
with frayes and murders vile,
What needs it for to show them all?
nothing beside more vile,
Nor worse than is the covetous man,
that drowned in earth below,
Doth like the Mole no kind of thing
desire, love, or know
Save only riches of the earth
for which he doth not fear
Each ill to work, nor other God
he doth acknowledge here,
But purse and pens his chief delight:
nor sees the unhappy best
How short the life of man is here,
how frail, how soon deceased,
And how that from his bending bow
death evermore doth cast
His deadly shaftes, that pierces hearts
of mortal men so fast,
And neither spares the young nor lernd,
nor yet the wealthy wight:
But every man without respect
with bloody blow doth smite:
And oftentimes is nearest then,
when furthest of he shows,
And sudden tumults then doth cause
when no man of him knows,
But thou regard not riches here,
nor goods that subject be
To blinded chance nor let no care
of such things tro^ thee:
For proper unto no man are
the things, which as she likes
Doth fortune give, and takes away
when she inconstant strykes:
Or passing doth with life away
to diverse men descend.
Nay, other riches shalt thou seek
that never shall have end,
On which no chance nor kind of death,
shall ever power obtain:
These riches labour thou to get
both days and nights with payne,
For that thou shalt be truly rich,
and truly blessed by that.
The others that the common sort
like fools do wonder at,
And wish to have, if thou enioyest,
as money, house and land,
Them use and occupy at will,
who doth against it stand?
But justly yet, and modestly,
and when thou may or can,
Have pity on the poverty,
despise no needy man.
By this means shalt ye wyn thee praise
and health for ever more,
And for this earthly baggage here
the Skies above shalt gain.
No man is he, but sure a wolf
that doth not mercy show,
That is not moved to see the state
of others overthrow.
But if of poor estate thou art,
then bear it patiently,
And in good part sustain the lot
of this thy poverty:
For greater overthrows hath he,
and greater grief and care,
Whom Fortune most enriched hath,
and given the greater share:
And so much ouerlayd he is,
with wayght of substance great,
That by no means he can behold
the hie celestial seat.
For light, and void of earthly dregs
it him behooves to be,
That will with mind ascend the place
where as the heavens be.
For more a man seeks earthly state,
more falls he from the Sky,
And from the ever lasting light
he farther of doth fly:
And eke in place where as a man
his treasure up doth hyde,
There lies his heart, and there his mind
doth evermore abide.
Thus prouertie helps many men
vnburdning them thereby
That so with swifter wings they may
unto the heavens fly.
In like sort pride thou must avoid
the spring of strife, and hate,
That with dissention many times
destroys a common state.
with this disease in ancient time
was Rome ne'er overthrown,
Oppressed with rage of fury fierce,
that civil wars had blown.
Fly thou this fiende of hell, if thou
desyrest for to be
A friend of Gods, and after death
the Heavens elere to see:
No proud man loves the Gods above,
nor is beloved of them:
For God estemes the humble sort
and lowly minded men,
And well he likes the gentle minds
where no ambition lies,
Thrusts down ye proud, suffers not
to dwell with him in skies.
wherefore you proud disdainful swarm
what doth your pride you gain?
What helps your great renowned names
and princely titles vain?
which death in shortest time doth spoil,
and in the stream hath dronde
Of Lethes floods, where synking lowe
they never can be found.
You seek to please the common sort,
and of them praysde to he,
Tell, what distretion hath that state
the truth of things to see.
They count you here as Gods to be,
and what doth follow then?
When Asses here in deed you are
with outward sign of men,
Th unskilful sort you do deceive,
but not the Gods above:
But rather them to laughter oft,
and oft to wrath you move:
For all your pretty pranks they mark,
and privy deeds they see,
But you O blinded Asses think
no Gods at all to be,
Nor yet believe the Corse in grave,
the soul shall rise to dome,
And therefore seek these present joys,
and scorn the life to come.
A number great of beasts alive
in shape of men do straye,
Hence springs up your error great
and cause of your decay,
That with your gross capacity,
no other thing you see
but bodies gross, nor true things know
but such as shadows be.
The greatest sort delight in smoke,
and full with smoke they flow,
O fools what lighter thing tha smoke,
what thing doth vayner show?
Or what may more be laughed at?
than honour to pursue
All undeserved, and to despise
the cause of honour true,
We see ill men, unlearned and fond,
in place aloft to stay,
And guide such as do them excel,
whom they should rather obey.
For spiteful fortune st^ll doth sport
(...) mortal mans estate,
And out of order all confounds,
as she doth like, or hate:
Oft times exaiting to the stars
the stouthfull servile kind,
Deserving fetters for to wear,
or in the mill to grind.
But if she were of good estate,
she would the world commit
Of wise men to be guided here,
as meet it is and fit:
Then all things should in order pass,
and laws in strength should stand,
And holy Sacraments be dealt
by Godly Prelates hand:
And God would then contented be
to she we himself in sight.
But harebrainde Fortune always doth
in counter faites delight:
Yet this thalmighty Lord permittes.
Who could it well correct,
And why should not we suffer it?
For unto what effect
Is it, the truth with reason strong
to maintain, and defend
Prevailing not but get thereby
displeasure in the end?
For wisdom is cotemnde, harmed,
with which no force doth rain,
Whom no authority supports,
nor honour doth maintain,
Therefore it is better not to speak:
despise thou in thy mind
The foolish common peoples praise,
and gifts of Fortune blind,
Apply thy self to please the Lord,
with deeds of virtuous kind,
And after death true honour thou,
and true rename shalt find:
That for the just and Godly men,
prepared is in skies,
Whereas the mild and lowly hearts,
do joy in joyful wise.
But proud men woefully do whale
in smothering fiery smokes.
Now last of all restrain thy wrath,
for anger rage provokes,
And rage doth cause unseemly words,
of naughty words doth spring
Both brawls frayes, of frayes comes wouds,
wouds do slaughter bring.
Anger doth so confound the mind,
that drunk when blood doth fry
It knows not what to do, and void
of judgment runs awry:
Sraight grief shame ensues ye deeds
done unadvisedly,
Shun this, guide mind, win thy self
with bearing manfully.
A goodly virtue patience is,
which who so is without
Must needs of force lack honesty,
with cruel mind and stout,
Still using for to brawl and ^ght.
Frayes fittest are for beasts,
And quiet peace is far more meet
to dwell in mortal breasts,
The wise, virtuous man, seeks peace
all other things before,
And suffers things of smaller weight,
for fear of mischief more,
And well takes heed, least that the cole
that yet but kindling lies,
With fiery force of flashing flame
aloft at length arise.
Who nought can bear, let him absent
himself from company,
And lead his life alone in woods,
or else on mountains hye.
And he that dwells in company,
let him learn much to bear,
And to restrain with bridle sharpe
the wrath that him do steer,
Dissembling closely with himself
his anger that doth spring,
And never break the bonds of peace
for every tristing thing,
Forgiving stull the faults of those
that him offended have,
That he may so forgiveness get,
as he to others gave.
Thus much of training of the mind
I thought it good to touche,
Which doth suffyse: to these I could
have added more by much,
But he that doth observe these few
shall never want the rest,
But easily all them obtain
that are not here expressed:
They all contained privily,
and closed in these doelye.
But yet it needful is the while
the wysemens books to apply,
And causes for to search of things,
and to adorn the mind
With diverse ar^es: for void thereof
it is both dull, and blind.
And thus, as hath been said before,
those ^ooles, and foxes, well
May virtuous be, and frame themselves
in seat of bliss to dwell.
These thigs while as my guide declared
in presens Mercury,
The post of Gods, and Atlas Son,
sent down from Jove stood by:
And willde T^malphes in hast
the heavens to ascend,
For all the saints (quoth he) are willds
on Jove for to attend,
And Momus there appointed hath
of wayghty affairs to treat.
If certain Monks (that placed are
upon the hauty seat,
That harde beside the city stands,
where passing by the walls
To Venize goolfe the fyshie streams
of Ariminum fall)
Oflyuing shall depriued be,
or else those parts forsake
That country women use to cut
when they their Capons make:
Since that they are to coltishe waxed,
and bear their heads to hye.
Despising men, and filthy facts
commit licentiously.
Example taking of their Prior,
fie, fie, to great a shame.
And can the Church abide to see
such Porkettes as these same?
That only live to serve their paunch,
their lust, and sleepy sense,
Which heard, in hast Aretes son
departing straight from thence,
Did me commit to Mercury,
who going down to Hell,
The special message of his Lord
unto the fiende to tell:
Me fast embracing in his arms
did through the clouds convey
To ground, what time as Clement Pope
in camp with Caesar lay
Within the walls of Bononye,
and Florenze City fair
With mighty force did long besiege.
Thus cutting swift the air
With wings, at length came Mercury
to rocks that ragged lye,
Of S. Marinus hauty hills,
that seem to touch the Sky:
From thence in small descent he set
me in thy fields so gay
Verruculus, and then to Hell
in haste he takes his way.
Capricornus, the tenth Book.
AL hail to thee good Mercury,
from Stygian lake so soon things
Art thou returned? declare what
in Plutoes court are done:
Great brawls, raging mad vprodes,
what is the cause or why?
I will thee tell, although in haffe
I must to heaven fly.
So great a sort of Turks and Jewes,
and Christians there remain,
That place therein suffices not,
the number to contain:
No empty rome there is, but all
full thwact as they may he,
The Porches full, and full the Hall,
and full the courts I see,
The Temples, houses and the Streets
the Walls, and Market row,
And al the City fields, and hills
and woody valleys lowe,
So full that crowding thick they thrust,
and shove with devilish might:
With fist and heel, and tusk, tooth,
in cruel sort they fight,
For of no weapon have they skill,
nor sprites can ever dye:
Scarce could I pass the place unto
whereas the fiend doth lye,
But through ye midst of swarming souls,
with force I make my way,
And with this rod to get me room
amongst them fast I lay:
At length the privy chamber of
the black and vggly sprite
I come unto, whom there I find
in sad and doleful plight.
And when to him I had declared
my fathers full decree,
Commanding him that Antechrist
should straight vnlosed be
From out the pyt, and sent abroad
to every place and land:
That working wonders strange false
and teaching that at hand
The dreadful day of judgment is,
and cude of all the rest,
May al thing out of order bring,
both Gods, and man, and beast,
As fixed state of destiny
commands to be had:
God Pluto then tell me quoth I
why sy^ste thou here so sad?
So sad quoth he: doest thou not think,
to great a wrong I bide,
When you possess so great a space
of heaven large and wide?
When as but few you are, and when
scarce three (when all is done,)
Or little more, in greatest space
and tract of time do come:
And I to be enclosed within
a kingdom here so small,
Where out of number mortal men
continually do fall:
The Jewes and al the Turkish brood,
not all the Christian bend
(I grant) but sure the greatest part,
do here, do here descend,
And hither to my parks they run:
why come they more to me?
Or why doth not my brother there
that Skies doth oversee
These Friars, Priests, Monks at lest
take up to heaven hye,
And them in blessed place with him
preserve continually?
Is is not shame, these men that in
the Church so sweetly sing,
And day by day, in sacred towers
the restless bells do ring,
That spend such store of Franconcense,
and many Hores relieve,
That pardon others, and can not
their own mysdeedes forgive,
That play the parts of parish Clerk,
the Corse to bring to grave,
And beautify the Church of God,
with Tombs and Pictures brave,
Is it not shame these men to send
to Hell, with pains therefore,
As thirsty Appulia never bred
of Flies a greater store?
Nor once the chiefest Bishops he
doth dread, or more forbear,
But rather wylls that they do feel
extremest torments here:
Thus in the deepest pyt of Hell
enclosed they lye in chains
And plaged are above the rest
with grievous kind of pains.
Wherefore Cyllenius when thou comste
the Stars above unto,
I pray thee show my brother there
that al things I will do
With willing mind as he comaundes:
But yet in any wise
Let him respect my poor estate,
and kingdom not despise,
And either take some souls from hence
or else make Hell more wide:
This said, I will (quoth I) and then
from thence in haste I hied.
And now to Heaven I return
nor longer can I stay:
Forget not me thy client poor
go blessed saint away.
Thou Muse remember well to thewe
to me thy verses fine,
For paper lowe at hand, and pen,
and leisure good and time:
Begin and teach me in what sort
a wise man should be wrought.
First underneath a happy star
he must to light be brought,
That after shall be wise or blessed:
for greatly matter makes
Under what sign or what aspect,
a man his birthday takes:
As they affirm that know the names,
and force, and motions hye
Of Stars, and cast nativities,
and tell the destiny.
O Lord how great and wondrous
doth heavens force appear,
Without whose help the earth nor seas,
could ever creature bear.
The Sky the Occean representes
the father here of all,
And stars the sister Nymphs by name
full aptly may we call,
Fro whence procedes al good on earth.
therefore can no man live
As wise and blessed, who stars in birth,
an ill aspect do give.
Beside of great effect doth seem
their parents state, and kind,
Of whom the infant nourced is,
and who doth guide the mind.
For as the child in tender years
himself at first doth train,
Such custom shall in gra^er age
within his heart remain:
Long time that nature doth endure,
and long in mind doth lye,
That in our childish age at first,
our senses did apply.
Therefore the master needs must be
both wise and learned well,
That guides the child, and also must
to virtue him compel.
And like the horsman good, now here,
now there must wind and wrest
The untamed head, and now with by^e
and now with spur molest:
Nor only him with words persuade,
but with examples teach:
For what if life be contrary
avails it to preach?
And first be diligent to keep
him from the vicious kind,
Ill company doth oft corrupt
a good and virtuous mind:
This poison many hath destroyed,
would th^n be glad to tell
The nature just of any man,
then mark his fellows well,
For like to like do ever go,
and always shalt thou find
That conu^rsant are such as be
of one disposed mind.
Wherefore let both the schoolmaster,
and parents well beware,
Least him whom they do thus instruct
the naughty youth do s^are,
And them with filthy crimes infect:
alas full soon we all
Inclined are unto the worse,
and soon to vice we fall.
Besides this child that here we ^ayne
a wise man for to make,
Let him in Greek, and latin books,
his daily travail take,
And give good will and diligence
in learning to proceed,
Refusing al dishonest books
let him good au^thors read:
For s^ldome is the unlearned good,
for ignorance doth blind,
And darkes with errors commonly
the rude unskilful mind.
But yet from to much study and toil
let him his mind refrain,
Least he prove mad, in searching thus
this wisdom to attain:
Or fall into some great disease
and so himself destroy:
To much of every thing doth harm
and long doth not enjoy.
His sprites sometime to recreate,
and to refresh his mind,
Let him absent him self and play:
for rest in every kind
Doth quickness bring, and play in time
doth former force repatre.
But though each kinds of learning is
both needful good and fair.
Yet chief among the rest are those,
and highest place obtain,
That teaches well ye Stars to know,
and nature opens plain,
Let these our wise men well apply
with all his force and might,
In graver age, and in these arts
let him spend his delight:
And therewithal (as hath been said)
the nurture of the mind
Well put in ur, both just and good
shall be and so shall wind
About his head two Laurel twistes.
How goodly a thing is it
A man both learned and good to be,
to know, and to have wit?
A learned fool is to be feared,
like as the ^urious brain.
With sword in hand, so is the learned
in whom doth vice remain.
But yet suffices not alone:
the mind for to regard,
And with good manners, good arts
to have it thus prepared:
When as the state of body here
we must not lightly way,
For if the body be diseased
it never can obey
The hes^es of mind, you doth command
both worthy things and great.
Wherefore we must our selves apply
to feed on wholesome meat,
That may engender purest blood:
for hurtful humour springs
Of ou^ll meates most commonly,
and such vnholsome things.
All drunkenness must be eschewed,
and surfeits must be fled,
For these the stomach overcharge,
and much annoy the head,
And round with fumes beset the brain,
by this doth always come
The dull appalled sense and spryt^,
and sleeps of afternoon.
To exercise the body well
in due convenient time,
Is great commodity to health,
and makes the force more fine:
By to much s^outh doth strength de^ay,
and by to long a rest.
The synowes faint, and all the lymmes
by this are quite oppressed.
Beside must cold extreme be shunde,
and heate that raging broils,
And all corrupt and filthy airs,
and fennishe moory soils:
Especially in summer time,
when dog with fyerie ^eene
Doth cleave the fields, Grashopper^*
sing under branches green.
In fine our selves we must apply
with all our force and might,
To bodies health, that so it may
obey the mind aright,
Which scarce can well be brought about
if poverty deny:
Needs must we money have by chance
or gift of some that dye,
Or else by trade of occupying
in any facultye,
For evermore the nedy man
doth suffer misery:
Nor without riches, possible
a happy life to lead,
Alas how often virtue poor
doth morn with heavy head?
How much despised she styll doth lye
if money be away?
Him truly and in proper kind
a rich man call we may
That flows with wit, and eloquence,
with wisdom and with art,
And wheresoever he becomes
can gain an honest part,
And portion for himself to live,
and though he journey makes
To diverse places far from home,
his substance with him takes,
And never wants needful things
a joyful life to lead,
Nor fear the thieves, nor doth ye sword*
or cruel robbers dread,
And quickly doth himself repair
though he be spoiled quite:
For virtue true gives never place
to Fortunes frowning spite.
For every dwelling in the world
doth native soil appear
Unto the virtuous man, and well
he lives every where.
But he that virtue lacks, although
he great possessions hold,
And purses stuffed full with coin,
and Coffers full of gold,
Yet can he not go where he list,
nor travail every place,
To see the countries strange abroad,
and men of sundry grace,
And every were to live: for house,
and ground, and Castles strong,
He can not bear about with him
in all his iorneys long,
Least yt perchance with thieves he meet,
or perish on the shore,
And then for Gods sake ask his meat
at every other door.
At home therefore he always dwells,
and in his country lives
Where as his ground a great increase
of Corn and wine him gives,
And as a banished man he fears
beyond the bounds to go,
That slouthfulnesse of mind, chance
to him assigned so:
Whereby the goodly syghtes abroad
he can not view nor mark,
While still at home he hidden lies
as pent in dungeon dark.
Therefore the old Philosophers
by fine invention found,
A certain stone, that where they went
or travailed any ground,
Provided them of needful things,
and never would decay,
By aid whereof, full many lands
and countries far away
They might hehold, and always learn
of many sundry arts.
And thus of old the Gods above
besought with humble hearts,
The sacrifyce on altar slain
before as was the trade
To Mercury, the Sun, and Moon,
Lo thus their prayers made.
O Titan, beauty of the world,
O fairest God in sight,
O thou Latonia driving hence
the shadows of the night,
O swyftly fleecing restless Imp
of Jove and Maia borne,
That able art to change thy self
to shapes of sundry form:
Be present here, and bow your ears
to our complaints and cry,
Behold a few, whose minds wits
are in degree full hye,
That wisdom most of all esteem,
while cause of every thing,
And secrete state of nature hyd
to light we seek to bring,
And meat with mind the mighty sky:
us need doth ouertread,
And many great missehappes we feel,
of hunger almost dead:
While as the doltishe common sort
do all things rake and snatch,
And all the money heaping up
into their coffers catch,
Nor any of them doth pity us,
and if we ask a myte,
Then pointing at us straight they jest,
and make of us but light:
Whereby we are constrained to delve,
or else attendance give
On toiling beasts, or cary doung,
scarce know we how to live:
And Idiotes are we made to serve.
Wherefore you Gods above
Have pyty yet at length of us,
if good men state you move,
And show an easy way by which
we may live honestly,
And for to search the secrete dens
where truth doth hidden lye.
These prayers heard, the Gods anon
thus called came forth in place,
And first did Phebus answer make:
O noble worthy race
Of half Gods, Skies deserving well
and favour eke from hye,
Now hearken well, and in your minds
let these my sayings lye
Take here this young Arcadian blood,
and swyft untrusty swain
And plunged deep in Stygian streets,
let him forthwith be slain:
In bosom thrust of Hyales
him let the Gods receive,
Whom Lemnian country worshippeth
and hye aloft him heave:
Then bury him in warmed womb,
and corrupted him undo,
Whose dropping joints a sprite shall pearce
that falls our bodies fro,
And wondrously shall call again,
deceasde and quenched quite
Him from the dark new clad in cloak,
of gold, and shining bright
With silver show, then him again
amid the fire cast:
An other straight shall spring thereof,
as Phaenix changing fast,
And perfect leave the bodies all
that it shall feale or touch,
The bonds and laws of nature here,
surmounting aye by much,
Shall change the kinds drive away,
this needy poverty.
Here Phebus ceased, and Mercury,
and Dian did agree
To all that he declared had,
forthwith away they fly,
Ascending to the lofty place
and compasde beauens hye.
Then men of hauty sense they blind,
and answer all to dark,
Long pondering in their doubtful mind
do muse thereon and mark,
And scarce in longest race of time
with proves of sundry kind,
And not with little charges did
this art at first out find,
Than which no art more worthy is,
the heavenly stone to frame,
Which wicked people never know,
nor can obtain the same.
And this whosoever doth enjoy
may dwell in any land,
Both free fro fear of fortunes wheel,
and force of robbers hand:
But unto felwe the Gods vouchsaue
so great a gift to give.
Some will demand if it be meet
for wise men here that live,
To linck themselves in wedlocks bond,
and so the time to spend.
In procreation here of youth.
Though some do this commend,
Yet this in mine opinion is
for holly men not meet,
For care of wife doth often let,
and love of children sweet,
The wits divine of wisest men,
that do their minds apply
About such hye and hauty things,
as secretes of the Sky.
Let him that only seeks the world
rejoice in wife and child,
And often to himself procure
the Gods of Marriage mild:
But let the wiseman always joy
in chaste and single plight,
And euerwore live vndefilde
in body and in spright.
For he that doth with slender fare
and small himself content,
And doth abstain from carnal use,
and prayer styll frequent,
And lifting mind above the stars
beholds the chief degree,
Shall oft enjoy the speech of God,
and oftentimes him see,
In happy state, shall tell before
the things that after spring.
A sacred Gem is chastity,
to God most thankful thing.
Unto the chaste he oft appears,
and secretes oft doth tell:
Again the filthy lecherye
and pastimes meet for hell,
He hates shuns and always doth
such wanton mates detest.
But no man can a Virgin be
but he whom God hath blessed,
And doth assyst: This gracious gift
doth from the sky descend,
Of higher state than man can get,
or man can comprehend:
No perfect wyseman can be had
except in this degree.
It seems also good to know
if it convenient be
For wysemen dreadful weapons fieret
of raging Mars to try,
And for to bathe their hands in blood,
of mortal enemy,
And to themselves by fight to get
an everlasting name:
For many judge no greater virtue,
glory, praise, or fame
Can be, than gotten is by wars.
O wretched beasts, O blind,
Why think you wars more worth than peace,
or of a better kind?
For nothing is more vile than this,
nor nothing can be found,
That farther from mans reason seems,
to differ or to sound:
For if that laws and reason should
in every place bear sway,
Then peace should rain in proper force
and wars should quite away:
In time of battle laws do cease,
and overthrown do lye,
Then fury raynes, and vice doth rage,
abroad at liberty,
Then wicked men hold up the head,
and shake their weapons than,
And scotfree thence they kyl and stryke,
and take from every man,
And fearing no decree of judge,
defile each thing they find
More mete is peace for mortal man,
and wars for brutish kind.
To toss the blades mad men love,
and he desires to fight,
That pore and lazy labour hates,
and hath a great delight
To live a lusty vicious state,
though purse do not agree:
And therefore sells his life for gain,
and runs in jeopardy,
Then conqueror he triumph may
with that that others got.
And carry thence the spoil and pray
unto his native plot.
But he that substance hath at home,
and can sufficiently
Him self and his defend and keep
with any faculty,
Doth peace above the rest esteem,
and from the sword abstain:
Except he be of frantic mind,
and fond disposed brain.
But thou will say great Kings dukes
in deeds of arms delight,
And train themselves to follow Mars,
with al their fo^e and might:
What then, are no^ great Kings dukes
oft times in dotage brought,
And flow with vice? by whose fond minds
great cities come to nought.
And though they great reuene we have,
and Kingdoms many one,
Yet more they always seek to have,
and more they heap thereon.
The covetous man though he possess,
as much of golden Mine
As Tagus hath, yet pore he is
and lives in need and pine.
And thus therefore with this mad mind
are Dukes and Princes great
Compelde to join the bloody camps,
with rage of Martial heate,
Enlarging their dominions much
with heaps of Misers slain.
But though that wars be nought, vile
to be abhorred plain,
Yet bring they some commodity,
for false and crafty men,
Expert in fraud and usury,
do heap up al thing then
When peace doth rain, but when ye wars
do rage, the Soldier strong,
The evil gotten goods doth spoil
that he hath raked long.
Then justly doth the rage of Wolves
on Foxes vengeance take,
And due rewards the mighty sort
unto the subtle make.
And like for like they show. Thus time
doth all things alter so,
Besides, the kings with thousand crafts,
and thousand powlings mo,
In time of peace their subjects flees,
and coin in Coffers pour,
Whereby both Gold and Silver all
the Checker would devour,
If battle should not bring abroad
that hidden lay in peace
Distributing to many men
one private mans increase.
Now last of all, in number not
a few, there is a kind
Both void of learning, wealth, Art,
of lasey stouthfull mind,
To mischief given, prone to vice,
and stout, and full of crime:
Such men, or rather shadows vain
at one appointed time
Doth God a warfare send, with death
of cruel kind to dye.
And thus he purges mortal state,
whereby live merrily
Long time the rest that do remain,
this mischief overthrown,
Till that again such wicked weeds
anew be sprung and grown,
That must be rooted out with wars,
and cut with weapon grimm.
Then Iupiter begins again
his pots unclean to skimme,
And sending forth the furies vile,
doth sweep the filth away,
This is the order of the world
that never shall decay:
This course the destinies themselves
decreed long time agone,
When as Promotheus stale the fire
the hawtie heavens from,
And when Deucalion with his wife
dame Pyrrha, made to spring
So many thousand persons with
the stones that they did fling.
Wherefore a wyseman it becomes
to follow reasons grace,
And chiefly peace to love, and peace
with all his mind to embrace.
Except perchance sometime costrainde
he for his country fight,
And for defence of him and his,
then is the quarrel right:
Then fights he void of any blame,
for laws of every srate
Do suffer force with force to dawnt,
and guile with guile to mate,
As due deseries to recompense
convenient is and meet.
Now farther must we search if that
it be for wisemen feet
To exercise some faculty,
wherewith al times he may
Relieve himself if that miss haps
do bring him to decay,
If froward Fortune any time
send needy poverty,
Depriving him of all his goods
and substance violently,
Least that he beg and suffer oft
both cold, and hunger to.
There are for truth some kind of thing,
that wisemen well may do,
Whereby himself he succour may
if poverty constrain,
Let him a good Physician be:
this gets sufficient gain,
And drives away diseases quite.
Old Phebus used this same,
And Phebus son, by this they both
deserude a famous name.
And this Sir Chirons pupil learned
though of the stock he was
Of ancient Aeacus and Thetis sprung,
by this did Paeon pas,
Machaon and Hippocrates
by this gat honour great.
What should I call to memory
al such as by this feat,
Got long ago both pens and praise,
and fame when they were dead.
A good e^pert Physician
shall never beg his bread,
Add more to this, it full besides
of privy knowledge flows,
And both of flower, herb, and stone,
doth secretes plain disclose:
And whatsoever earth doth here
within her bowels hide,
Doth well perceive, and natures force
to open doth provide:
Each part within the body of man
it doth consider well,
And turns again a number that
were almost gone to hell.
What thing than this more requisite,
for wise men can we find?
That not alone the wiseman may
with counsel heal the mind,
But also get the body health,
and so both parts redress:
Thus may a wyseman all preserve
in perfect quietness.
But now when as dame Lachesis
the latest year doth spin,
And hoary whiteness doth defile
both head and bearded chin,
Then meet it is for him to rest,
and then himself to stay,
And longer not to rove about
in countries far away:
But find some certain dwelling place,
and search for his avail
Such things as needful are for life,
least food in age do fail:
And in the mean while to depart,
and shun the common sort,
Contenting him with fellows few,
and with a slender port,
And solitary oftentimes:
to God both night and day,
The mind well purgde of naughty thou ghtes,
in fervent sprite to pray:
And wholly to addict himself
the heavenly state to find,
And all the cares that flesh doth give,
to banish from his mind.
Then shall the Gods appear, though he
in valley lowe do lye,
Or on the hills, or shadowy woods,
or on the mountains hye,
In cottage small do place himself.
it is not safe nor well
With many for to live, or in the
towns of fools to dwell,
And in the company of thieves,
of slaves, and covetous
And cuthrote brawling swering mates,
or men ambitious.
But let the wyseman fly the croude
of rude and common sort,
For of the common people is
envied the wysemans port,
Because of their contrary deeds:
contraries evermore
Do one the other strive against
and let, and hinder sore.
Here of have many wisemen dyed,
because they would not spare
When any naughty thing they saw,
the truth for to declare,
And to rebuke the minds of Fools,
which since it could not bear,
Nor suffer such abuse of Fools,
they slain and punished were.
Wherefore, least that the wiseman see
such store of synful sight,
And least he fall in danger by
defending truth and right,
Let him wythdraw himself forthwith
from common company:
And secret live with two or three
that good and learned be,
Though seldom shall he be without
the Gods that guide the sky,
For Gods do often pleasure take
in wisemens company:
Oft doth the wiseman hear them speak
and sees them oft with eyes,
They fill his heart with comfort great
in wondrous sort and wise:
The wiseman blessed is on earth,
and blessed above in Skies:
Go then O blinded mortal men,
go heap up money than,
And fill your caskets full of Gold
by al the means you can,
Beset with rings your fyngers thick,
and let the Jewels round
In gorgeous linekes of gold about
your graceless necks be wound,
Now ruffie in your sylkes abroad,
and brag it through the street,
Go, go I say you blinded fools,
both Crowns and Sceptre sweet,
And al that Fortune rash can give
to you with al your power
Go seek: yet all these goodly things
shall vanish in an hour,
Al these things are but dreams toys
and have but little stay,
Which quickly chance doth from you take
or death doth snatch away,
Which soon do vanish hence like smoke
and never turn again.
Go, go O wretches seek to get
these mists, and shadows vain.
But when the dying day shall come,
and latest hour shall fall,
Then, then when all your follies past
in vain to mind you call,
You shall perceive that you did dote,
and stepped from truth awry,
And morn to late. Alas in time
your error learn to spy.
O mischievous untoward souls,
O hearts of canckred kind,
Why gaze you styll upon he earth
like beasts of brutish mind?
Why cast you not your eyes aloft
unto the starry Skies?
There, there ye truest world doth stand
there life most perfect lies,
For such as fear and worship God:
there neither chance hath place,
Nor churlish death can there the state
with deadly dart deface:
There is the assured treasure found,
there lies the chief delight,
That God almighty hath prepared
for them that serve him right:
Which never curse of fretting time
hath power to overthrow,
To this apply your minds while states
permit, and life below.
Behold you not of fading life
the slender hold and stay?
Do not you see how all things here
in shortest time decay?
And like to smoke in subtle air
doth vanish quite away.
Where find you now the stately kings
in pomp of proud array
That heretofore have been? or where,
do you esteem to be
The Prelates chief that thought themselves
Gods fellows in degree?
Their rotten bones entombed close
in fylthy caves do dwell,
And for their souls perhaps they do
keep Christmasse now in Hell:
Far banishde from the happy place
where the good are brought,
And there they suffer payne, for pride,
and mischief that they wrought.
O Lord how gladly would they now
if in their power it lay,
(...) Enclose themselves in flesh again,
and take their old array,
That not esteming riches here,
and kingdoms leaving clean,
They might live Godly here on earth,
in pore estate, and mean,
And by their righteous life make him
their friend that guides the Sky,
And after death possess a place
above the heavens hie.
But he that shows his wit to late,
his wisdom shows in vain.
Let every man seek God to please,
and worldly wealth disdain,
And travail, for the heavenly state
of him example take,
Which of this worldly fading joys
a small account doth make,
But only hopes in time to come
the perfect joys to feale,
Which well he knows, for God to him
such things doth oft reveal.
And such a wiseman late there lived
since I remember may,
That with a few upon the top
of hye Soractis lay,
Full lean he was, and bearded well,
his house was small and neat,
All clad he was in russet robes,
a man of learning great.
And comely countnance to be hold.
he had his dwelling place
In wilderness, where round about
the woods did him embrace:
Whose heavenly mind, when as he list
of things to come could tel,
And answers gave, such as for truth
did Delphis not excel.
I moved and provoked thus
with fame that of him ran,
By painful journeys long unto
this sacred hill I came,
And found the old man sitting there
in warm and Sunny cave.
Who (after that I had receiude
the like God Deane I gave)
He wyllde me there to take my rest
so down by him I sit.
And therewithal I asked him thus:
what is the cause of it
(Quoth I) that here you choose to live
upon this mountain steep,
Where almost every thing doth lack,
that life of man should keep.
Then answering me this holy man
on this sort there began:
My great delight was heretofore
to live in cities, when
Both young, and ignorant, I thought
nought else to be requirde
But riches here, and such delight
as life of man desired,
Following ye example and the fault
of rude and common sort:
Then joyed I for to lead my life
with great and much resort,
And with the rest for company
I fell into the flood
Of vain delights, with colour false,
deceyude of troth and good.
But when that greater age began
with fading years to show,
And wisdom more in tract of time
within my head to grow,
I then began to note and mark
the parts that men do play,
And sundry sort of lives they lead.
(as God gave grace) to way.
Then many fylthy things I saw
there done, and full of shame,
And nothing else of justice left
but vain and idle name.
Th'vngilty to be punished,
the gylty scaping free,
The virtue hid in vice, and vice
in virtue hid to be,
The poor in every place oppressed,
and favour more to get
Than just deserts, ye law a bribing craft
for gold a fyshing net:
Each kind of handy craft corrupt
by guile of workmens will,
The thief to fee the Inkeper
his gests thereby to kill.
Besides I many might behold
enriched by theft and guile
Though naughty beasts, more meeter far,
to wear a rope a while,
Yet praysde to be and worshipped,
and feared very much:
The unworthy placed in regal seat,
and honours dealt to such
As have but only shape of men.
Beside religion fled
By conetousnesse, and Priests bent al
to food, and Harlots bed:
And under cloak of holiness
seek privily to gain,
And pick the common peoples purse
by means of wyly train:
While as they open heaven wide,
and bar the hellish way,
And while they bost that they can souls
where as they list convey,
And with their Portas force the saints
to do as they are bent.
By this occasion left I al,
and from the towns I wene,
Accoumpting it more safe for me
to live in desert place,
And in this hill to run the rest
of al my ranging race.
This hill whereas the altar stands
of Syluester the saint,
Where as the Shrine, and monuments
of him his praises paint:
Which place though it seem rough and rude,
not mere to dwell upon
Yet fit it is for saints, and such
as live in peace alone,
And wholly do apply their minds
the Lord to fear and love,
And always seek to join themselves
with saints in Skies above:
But hard perchance it seems to thee,
and strange it doth appear,
That I can live in desert such,
and stony places here,
Where seldom any man doth come,
where wanting seems to be
Most things that should sustain the life
of man at liberty.
Yet is it not so hard in deed,
nor strange it seems than,
If that the holy Ghost enspire
the heart of any man,
Descending down from heavens hye:
of God the sacred sprighte
That purifies the heart from sin,
and raises souls to light
That ouerwhelmde in flesh do lye:
as Mercury sublimde
By force of fire is, and takes
a colour white full find.
This holy sprite adournes the mind,
and heart doth upward move
This cutts away the worldly cares,
and breads heavenly love:
Wherewith the mind inflamed once
all things doth easy seem,
Though never so sore: for he that loves
doth labour light esteem,
Especially if any hope
there be reward to hold:
For hope, love, are two strong pricks,
that makes us always bold,
And not to care for any toil,
wherefore continually
Our daily prayers must we make,
to him that guides the sky,
That so this holy sprite vouchsafe
into our hearts to fall,
That he may plant a Godly hope,
and Godly love withal:
Wherewith ye mind inspirde may mout
above the starry sky,
Despising much the world, and joys
that vain do please the eye,
And strive to join it self to God,
with all the force and might.
No marvel then it is all,
if aided of this sprite
I here can dwell, and lead a life
full harde so patiently,
Upon this steep and desert rock,
and stony mountain hye.
Yet never lacked I meat, nor clothes
upon this lofty spyre,
As much as nature doth content,
not wanton fond desire.
A little thing doth nature serve,
a small thing doth content,
Such one as loves none overplus,
a man to virtue bent,
That rather seeks celestial life,
than fleshly fading days.
For life (least thou be ignorant)
is double, in her ways:
One, wherewithal the body lives,
still followed and pursued
Is this, of all the route of fools,
and common people rude.
The people fond that nothing know
of any worthiness,
But stouthful beasts do make their God
of filthy fond excess.
This life is proper unto beasts
of wild and savage kind,
The other unto God above,
and men of godly mind,
That for their great and worthy deeds
do well deserve the name
Of perfect men, and holly saints
of everlasting fame.
But such hye minded virtuous Imps
the earth doth seldom brood,
The earth a mother to the nought,
and stepdame to the good.
Agui se falta un Renglon por ligereza.
But now because I see thee bent
to give attent^u^ ear,
Some things of this celestial life
I will declare thee here,
Which ought well understood, to please
the mind of any wight.
First, man consystes not only of flesh,
but also of the spright:
This gives life to them that line,
by this we feel and move,
This gives us mind, ye worthiest thing
by which men wondrous prove.
But many doubt if that the soul
do live the body dead,
Or whether it do finish ^o
when as the life is stedde:
Assaredly the worser sort
that to the flesh do cleave,
And bent to vice, despising God,
do wish and eke believe,
The soul to have a dying day:
^icause (alas) they fear
The cruel forments for the sins
that they committed here:
And therefore will allow no hell,
nor Devils for to be,
And so they do persuade themselves
to escape with mischief free.
An other better sort of men
that sinful life do hate,
Provoked with the Godly love
of virtues goodly ^iate,
Do think the soul doth always live,
and not to dye with grave,
Because they hope a glorious Crown
for their good works to have,
And make account of perfect bliss
when death hath shot his dart,
And of a better promisde life
for to enjoy their part.
Of these two sorts who judges best*
who is but the just?
For evermore in doubtful things
the opinion must we trust
That pleases best the better sort,
and that which follow most
Such men as virtuous be, and such
as have the holy Ghost.
More safe it is to cleave unto
the virtuous, and the just,
Than fansyes of the wicked men
to credit or to trust.
No must we note their number great
that any thing have said,
But in what sort they lead their life
must well of us ^e wayde.
Wherefore it better is with few
of virtuous sort to say,
That souls do live continually
and have no dying day,
Than with a number of the lewd
against it to reply,
Contending that there are no spri^s,
and that the soul doth dye.
But more b^cause thou shalt believe,
I will declare to thee
By reason good, the state of soul
immortal for to be.
For if that God in better things
doth cunning still express,
As wisdom tells, and as the good
and virtuous must confess:
Then doubtless must we judge he gau^
the souls no time to dye,
Since better far it is for them
to live continually,
Than with the flesh to be extinct,
and feel a full decay:
Which thus I prove, if death do take
from us the soul away,
If that we have no other life,
but in this body here,
Then God may be accounted ill,
and shall unjust appear,
For thousands every day we se^
that flourish prosproustye,
In riches, substance and rename,
in reigns and Empyres hye,
Yet idle lubbers, vnlearnde, naugh^,
that sin at liber^ye,
And run the race of all their life
in great prosperity.
On the other side we may behold
the just oppressed to be
With spiteful chance, a wretched life
and py^ious prouertye.
Thus either God unrighteous is
that doth these things permit,
Or after death hath every man
as he deserves it:
Or else he doth disoaine the deeds
of mortal men to know.
Besides, what gracious mind apperes in God
what goodness doth he show*
If this be all that he doth give,
a life so short, and vain,
That swyftly runs to an end,
and doth no time remain:
The half where of is spent in sleep,
the rest in grief, and ^oyle,
And dangers great as fast doth fleet,
as rivers swyft in soil.
Therefore go to, O wretched men,
build Gorgeous Churches hye,
And let with costly offerings great
your altars pestered lye,
Set up your joyful branch of baize,
your sacred doors about,
with pomp of proud processyon pass,
let Hi^es be rattled out,
Spend frankconsen^e, and let the nose
of God be stretched wide
With pleasant smoke: do this, and add^
more honour much beside,
That he preserve your goodly life,
wherein doth you torment,
Sometime great cold, sometime hea^,
^ow plague, now famishement
Now bloody wars, now sickness great
or chance to sorrow at,
Sometime the busy biting fly,
sometime the stynging ^nat,
The Chyn^h and Flea. Keioyce I say
that here you lead your life
With thousand painful labours great,
in travail, toil, and strife:
And after in a little space
in pain you drop away,
And lompishe lye in loathsome vawlt,
to worms a grateful pray.
O worthy life, O goodly gift of God:
man in this world is bred
Among the brutish beasts, and fools
and ^aues his life is led,
Where storms, and flakey snowes ise
and dirt and dust, and night,
And harmful air, and clouds mists
and winds, with hellish sight,
And grief wailing raynes, where death
beside doth work his feat.
Is this our goodly country here,
is this our happy seat,
For which we owe such service here,
unto the Gods above?
For which it seems mete with vows
the heavenly sayn^ts to move?
And if none other life we have
than this of body vain,
So frail and full of fylthinesse,
when death hath carcass stain:
I see not why such praises should
of God resound in air,
Nor why we should such honour give
to him in temples fair,
That hath us wretches framed here
in this so wretched soil,
That shall for evermore decay
after so great a toil.
Wherefore least God shall seem unjust,
and full of cruelnesse
Shall well deserving counted be:
we must of force confess,
That death doth not destroy the soul,
but that it always is:
None otherwise than sprite in air,
and saint in heaven lives,
Both void of body, sleep, and meat.
And more we must confess
That after death they live in pains,
or perfect blessedness.
But let this reason thee suffice,
for if thou this do show
Unto the wicked kind, they laugh,
no light the blind doth know.
But thou, believe for evermore
and know assuredly,
(For ground of saving health it is,)
that soul doth never dye,
Exempted from the Sisters power
and fatal destiny.
These things foretold made evident
let us begin to tell
The perfect life, that makes us like
to saints above that dwell:
By which the heavens we desire.
But sith doth best appear
Contrary things, when they be seen,
and joined something near.
Wherefore it is convenient first
the bodies life to show,
That draws us down fro heaven hie,
to mind the earth below,
And makes us like to brutish beasts,
contrary to the soul.
This life he lives (though nought) yt doth
for stately honours prowle,
And seeks with al his force the fruit
of praise and glory vain,
Desiring only men to please
with fond vain glorious brain:
And he that wholly doth apply
himself a wealth to get
By right or wrong, and hath his heart
upon his riches set:
A two leggde Mole, that always doth
in earth en^ombed lye,
Not casting once his eyes aloft
unto the heavens hye.
And be that drowned in lechery,
and surfe^s ever lies,
Regarding only fleshly joys,
doth shamefastness despise,
Runs headlong into whoredom vile,
and fattes himself with meat,
A foolish man, that so the worms
may have more food to eat.
Al these same vile and fylthy kinds
that I have reckned here,
May well be called fleshly men,
for love to flesh they bear:
Whose life doth differ small fro beasts.
But now on the other side:
He that doth praise of men depise,
and pomp of worldly pride,
Doth live with chaste and Godly mind,
is called a spiritual man:
Because his sprite the body ruled,
and lust subdued than,
Doth freely guide and hath his place
in hiest part of brain.
Therefore the Godly life, is first
with bridle to restrain
Fond pleasure, Gluttony, and lust,
to conquer flesh with sprite,
For to neglect al worldly things,
and only set delight
On heaven, heaven most to wysh,
and chie^ly to regard:
There is the soil for souls and seat
for virtuous men prepared:
There to the body laid in grave
the righteous souls do clime,
Most glorious souls that brightly do
with glorious virtue shine,
And feel in ever lasting light
an everlasting joy.
But chiefly let the virtuous man
his time and toil employ
In learning, using styll to read
such books as do entreat
Of God, of soul, and wretched state,
of this our dwelling seat,
Of death, or other honest things,
and let him night and day,
Of these both often read, and talk,
and well in mind them way.
But wanton works, wanton words,
let him with head eschew,
Alas how sore do such affairs
a virtuous mind subdew:
For reading is the food of mind,
which if it virtuous be
Doth profyt much, if it be ill
doth hurt excedinglye:
None otherwise than evil meat
doth hurt the man that chawes.
These things though they must all be kept.
yet nothing more withdraws
A man from love of filthy flesh,
nor leads to God more ny,
Than oftentimes to ponder well
of life the misery:
Which since it is so short, and full
of such calamity,
Seems rather death than life to me,
yea, worse than death to be.
For who is it that doth not see,
who doth not plain perceive?
That irksome gall, and bytternesse
to every part do cleave.
If every thing thou well doest sift,
nought perfect shalt thou find:
For nature poisoned hath the parts
of all and every kind.
Most things have double face: full black
within, and outward white,
And with their colour, do deceive
the judgment of the sight.
If ought there be here in this life
both fair and good beside,
Like smoke and mist it flies away,
and doth no time abide.
Time suffers nothing long on earth,
death makes al things vain,
And turns and tumbles under foot,
of man the proud disdain.
Alas how al this worldly pomp
doth quickly pass away,
How wavering is rename of man,
how soon doth it decay:
Much like the bubble swelling great
amid the waters clear
Is soon destroyed, and with a puff
of wind doth not appear.
For in a moment al the joys
of man are fetched away,
Then only doth the talk remain,
wherein they thus do say,
Lo, here he was, lo, this did he,
he fought, and triumph wan,
He loved, he reigned, he conquered realms,
subdued many a man,
A goodly sor^e of books he wrote,
but now where shall we find
These things? no where. Himself where now?
both out of sight and mind.
What is he now? Nothing. Or whether
did he himself convey?
Lo, fled from hence with winds he is,
and vanished quite away.
Alas, alas, but trifles fond,
and fancies mere they be,
Whatsoever goodly thing on earth,
or wonderful we see.
What tell you me of Was, or Did,
one Is more worth coumpt I,
Than Was a thousand times. But fast
this Is away doth fly,
And al our pomp with him he bears.
These things who well doth way,
And uses to consider oft,
shall quickly cast away
This worldly love, and hating earth
shall seek the Skies to find:
Especially if therewithal
he use to bear in mind
How fylthy and how miserable,
mans body doth appear,
Of fading flesh, and brittle bones,
with skin encompast here:
Al flowing full with dregs unclean,
and blood corrupt, and vile,
Still dirty, soul, and filthy looks,
except it every while
Be washed, and kept with daily care,
and so made fair and white.
O doleful hospital of mind,
and vessel of the sprite,
By which such sycknesse great we feel,
by which such need we have.
O heavy garment, prison strong,
O quick, and lively grave:
That chokest here both mind, sense,
and them in darkness hyde:
Whereby so great an ignorance
in breast of man doth bide.
O earth to earth returning soon,
that in a smallest while
In tomb, shalt freshly feed ye worms,
with food, of carcass vile.
In what a wretched case lives he,
that led away with love
Of thee, doth leave the perfect life,
and gift of God above,
While more than meat esteming thee,
thy pleasures here prepared,
He only seeks: and good, and right
(...) smally doth regard:
And thinks there is no other life
than this, that here we hold.
A foolish Ass, forgetful of
himself, and country old,
From whence into this darksome dale,
and doleful place he went,
That so a wretch he should become,
in wretched carcass pent.
For every soul that is enclosed
with flesh and members here,
Hath wretched life, till losed fro thence
it fly to heavens clear:
Except the heavy weight of sin
do bar him of his way,
And cause it in the lowest air,
or on the earth to stay.
For purest heaven never can
a thing unclean abide,
Nor wicked men, nor doltishe fools,
may come where God doth guide.
These words while as the holy man
in teaching me had spent,
The Sun almost had ended day
with Wane that weary went:
And night was ne'er at hand, that thoe
began abroad to cast
Her dreadful darksome shade, upon
the world approaching fast.
I thence depart, and towards Rome
my way in hast I take.
And while with speed I pass the path
that journey new doth make:
Lo Cynthia shining compass full,
did call the lightless night,
With silver beams, that dew she cast
to appear both fair and bright.
Thus went I all alone, and with
my self in mind I wayde,
The Godly words that late to me
the ancient Father said.
But lo, three men in company
therewith I might behold,
whom meeting thus by chance, I asked
which way they travail would:
To Rome they said: and one of them
looked full vyon me thoe,
And naming me, from whence quoth he,
what country comste thou fro?
I aunswerde him, from that wise man,
which in the part most hye
Of fair Apolloes stately hill,
in lofty place doth lye.
Wherewith he smylde, said, O fool
synkes it into thy mind,
That possible on earth it is
a wise man here to find?
He seems wise that is least fool
the other sort among,
Although a dolt for wisdom doth
to Gods alone belong:
Of number which we here are three,
for I am called by name
Sarracilus, and Sathiell he,
Iaxa is this same.
which though we walk in humain shape,
thus seeming men in face,
Yet Gods we be, and ne'er the Moon
we have our dwelling place.
Whereas a number great of Gods
of meanest sort do lye,
That have the guiding of the earth,
and Seas that rise so hye.
This when I heard, amazed I was,
and sore to dread began:
Yet seming bold and void of fear,
full like a pretty man*
I asked wherefore they went to Rome,
then aunswerde me the same:
A fellow there of ores we have
that Ammon hath to name,
whom bound to serve by Magic Art
a young man there kepes straight,
Of Narni soil, that doth in court
of Vrsin prelate wayght.
O what great power is granted man,
the sprites he guides by line.
By this you well may understand
your souls to be divine,
And void of death. For if no part,
of you should after rain,
If that your soul should dye, as body
here by death is slain:
What power should have such foolish beasts,
and trifling pyctures vain,
Upon the sprites above? And if
no sacred thing remain
In you, how should such Ghosts as we
the force of man so way,
Or unto man of fading state
in such a sort obey?
Yea I my self was once Constrained
to serve a German wight,
Enclosed within a compassed stone
of Crystal clear and height*
But at the length a bearded sire
vnlosde me of these bands,
And prison broken thence I fled,
in hast from out his hands.
To Rome therefore we go with mind,
if that we may t'vntye
From service straight, a mate of ores
that there doth captive lye.
And so that down, to Hell we may
convey this present night,
A sort of Romish prelates proud,
that live in great delight.
These words while as he spake, a wind
forthwith did pittling blow:
Quoth Sathiell then, O friends, fro Rome
Remisses comes I know:
This wind that comes before declares,
nor herein did he lye,
For therewithal a fair young man
Remisses stood them bye.
They at his coming all reioist,
and bid him welcome there,
And ask what great affairs in Rome,
what news do there appear.
There all quoth he are bent to lust,
and Glotony do mind,
With theft, and guile, all ours they be,
both man, and womankind.
But Clement there the Pope prepares
an army great in hast,
And seeks to have the present state
of Luther clean defaced,
And Spanish ensynes therefore kepes:
nor will he now dispute,
And him with scriptures overthrow,
but with the sword confute.
Away with counsel now, and hence
with Luthers works again,
For Bishops now are battles meet,
all other ways are vain,
No care they what the Apostles taught,
no for the words of Christ,
But boast themselves as Lords of all,
that may do what they list.
They that have power do fear no law,
law is with force oppressed.
But we (my mates) do hope thereby
of gain to be possessed,
And of the spoil of such a sort
some souls to bear away
Unto the dreadful dungeon dark.
These words he thus did say:
The whispring something wc themselves,
from thence they do depart:
And me they leave remaining there
alone, with heavy heart.
For when Sarracilus had said
that none on earth was wise,
Immediately a doleful thought
within my heart did rise:
And thus unto my self I said,
is wisdom evermore
In vain of us desyrde, and praised,
and vainly looked for.
And only dealt to saints above?
Then of necessity
Here in this wretched mortal life,
all men must foolish be,
And laughing stocks, pageants fond,
unto the Gods in sky.
O state in most unhappy kind
of man in misery,
O rash unbridled wantonness
of such as parents be,
O filthy lust that doth beget
the Children that we see,
What do you now? you do beget
hoth fools, and wretches here,
A boy is borne, be merry sirs,
rejoice, and make good chere,
Fill in your cups, and daynty dish
upon the table place.
But soon the child shall prove a fool,
or live in wretched case,
Or dying soon, he shall depart
unto the Ghost below.
O blinded minds, that of the things
to come do never know.
We mortal men in wretched things
have oft a great delight.
These words I muttred in my mind,
and wrapped in woeful plight
I went unto my lodging straight,
for sleep oppressed my eyes,
And made me reel. Of wisemans state
these words shall here suffice.
Now meet it is thy wearied harp
my Muse at rest to lay,
And for to spare the jarring strings,
let us this time go pray
The Lord and maker of the world,
that grace he may us send,
The other signs that do remain,
with pleasant song to end,
For greater things I must declare
than yet from me did flow:
And sore my simple mind doth fear,
such Mysteries great to show.
My watery sign shall search the parts
of nature perfectly,
And last of al my labour shall
set open wide the Sky.
Aquarius, the eleventh Book.
THe Love of nature parent chief
and great desire of mind,
The secret causes of al things
for to reveal and find
Persuades me now again, my self
with Aeon streams to fill,
And once again to rest on tops
of hye Parnasus hill.
My Muse draw near, bring thy Harp,
now need thy wit to show
It is, and of a learned voice,
and verse at full to flow.
No small things here we must declare
I purpose now in mind,
Dame natures face for to disclose,
about the world to wind.
And first what hath been here before,
what is, and what shall be,
Is called Eus: this name contains
al things of each degree,
But of the sorts that God hath framed
by power and wisdom hye,
Some lead their life of body void,
some either lifeless lye,
Or else do live in body here.
Of former state of twain
This B^ke speaks not, ye next shall show
in time that doth remain:
Now (Muse) let us the other show.
The far^hest parts most high
Of al the world, with ample space
encompast is of Sky,
That whirling round with daily course
doth al things here enclose.
Five Zones divide it into parts,
but every part of those
Replenished with his dwellers is,
nothing forbyds the same.
For cold can neue^ hurt the Gods,
nor heat^ can them inflame.
Such things do best agree with earth,
the sacred Skies are free
From cold congeled, quivering ise,
and fierce that flaming be.
Which though it roll continually.
yet kepes it still one place,
And from the part where first it stood,
doth never shift his pace.
For placed between two fixed Poles,
it steadfastly doth stand,
And is sustaynde between them two
by Gods almighty hand.
Whereof the one doth plain appear
to us continually,
And doth behold the Bears above
that keep their course so hye:
The other under earth is placed
against it fixed well,
And in the night is scene to them.
that under us do dwell.
This compassed globe of al the Sky,
from East to West deuides
As many Spheres in compass round,
as there are Zones besides.
That which is next unto the Bear
the Artic hath to name:
And next to him the Circle stands
wherein doth Cancer flame,
Which doth constrain the Sun to fall,
and backward to retire,
And farther of for to withdraw
his beams of flaming fire.
Then next in order doth ensewe,
the Equinoctial line,
Which doth declare the days, nights,
of equal length and time.
Not far from thence by Capricorne,
another line doth run,
Which cannot pass, but doth return
from hence to us the Sun.
The circle next that placed is
unto the South so ne'er
The Autarticke circle hath to name,
contrary to our Sphere.
Beside these lines a circle crookt
there stands in Skies so clear,
By which ye Sun in months twice syx,
doth pass a perfect year.
An other circle white there is,
whose course by knees doth train
Of Gemini, by Scorpius tail,
and by the Tropicks twain,
And through the crooked path of Sun
by midst of Archers string,
And passes by the Centaurs legs,
and by the Egles wing,
And both the Carter and the Swan,
and Perseus doth it touch.
And Paralels there are, this name
give Greekes to Circles such,
And day by day the Sun doth pass
a circle of this kind,
When as he falls amid the West,
and leaves the East behind.
Two Colures eke besides there are,
the one where Sun doth stay
By Cancer, Capricorne, and both
the Poles doth cut his way:
The other by the Balance runs,
and by the Wethers face:
This shows the times when night day
are both of equal space.
Besides a number great there is
of sundry circles framed,
That pass by both the foresaid Poles,
Meridians rightly named,
That over us directly runs,
a Circle more doth lye
The Horizon called, the world in midst
divided is thereby,
And where our sight doth cease it stands
thence term the Greekes it so.
Besides the Heavens parted are
with many Circles more.
And nine there be, whereof the highest
that mover first we call,
Doth rolling from the farthest Indes,
with Moors and Spaniards fall:
Within a day he runs his race,
and fiercely doth he twine
About with him the other Spheres,
in whom no Star doth shine:
But clean contrary to the same
move al the Spheres beside,
And towards ye streams of Ganges great
from Cales in course they slyde.
Whereof the greatst doth shine with stars
that void of number be,
And scarcely in an hundred years
doth move but one degree.
And next to this doth Saturne stand
above the other Spheres,
Who finishes his course at full
inspace of thirty years.
And next to him stands Iupiter,
that end of course doth gain
In years twice syx. Him Mars ensewes
that turns in tweluemonths twain.
Next stands the Sun that (as they say)
his journey doth contrive
Beside sir hours in space of days
three hundred, sixty, five.
Then next in place doth Venus roll
her whyrling whele about,
And sooner than the Sun her course
by seuentene days falls out.
Then moves in Circle Mercury,
which if report be right,
Doth nine days sooner end his course
than Venus planet bright.
The Circle of the Moon is lowest,
and passes through the l^e
Of all her course in hours cyght,
and twenty days and nine.
Seven planets thus there are, yt greeks
as wandering stars do call:
The highest of which Saturnus hath,
to him for house and hall.
The Got and servitor of Jove,
and Iupiter doth hold:
To houses dark amid the sky
the fish and Archer bold.
The Scorpion and the Phyrygean Ram,
to foolish Mars pertain:
And in the flaming Lyon fierce,
the Sun doth East remain.
But in the Bull and Balance doth
the tender Venus rest:
Mercurius doth in twins rejoice,
and in the Virgins breast.
A goodly Rome the Crab doth make,
wherein the Moon doth dwell.
But of the fair Celestial signs,
let us begin to tell.
Within the Zodiake, where the Sun
a year by course doth try:
Twelve Signs there be, syx of them,
are named Northerlye.
The other six are Southern signs,
from beast that gilded shines:
Unto the pleasant Virgins foot,
they are called the Northern signs.
But from the foremost of the waytes,
unto the cattayle twain
Of Neptunes drove, whatsoever are
unto the South pertain.
The names of these celestial signs
I will disclose in verse.
These are the Ram, the Bull, the Twins
the Crab, the Lyon fierce,
The Maid, the Scales, the Scorpion,
the Shooter, and the Got,
The Waterpourer, and in skies,
the Fishes two that flote.
Each seventh stand contrarily,
for when the one doth rise
The other syttes, when as the Ram
apperes before our eyes,
Then down therewith descends ye Scales
so stands contrary full:
And rising each when other falls
the Scorpion, and the Bull.
From head of Crab, to Shooters foot
directly do they lye:
And from the Got unto the Twinnts
they are said to hang awry.
Thrice ten degrees in length, twelve
in breadth hath every sign:
And earthly named are, the Got,
the Bull, and Virgin fine.
But airy are these three, the Scales,
the Waterman, the Twins:
And waterishe are the Scorpion, and
the Crab, and fishy finns.
The three that rest are fiery
the Lyon, Shooter, Ram:
And Masculin be these with three,
that Airy signs we name.
And Fortunate they called be,
the rest are Faeminine:
And are unfortunate, they say
that state of Stars define.
These moving are, the Ram, the Crab,
the Scales, and Capricorn:
And fast the Lyon, Scorpion, Bull.
and Boy with Egle borne.
The Twins, the Shooter, Maid, and Fish,
are common every sign.
More, three and thyrtie Images
in sacred skies do shine,
Whereof are twenty placed fast,
amid the Northern Rain:
And storming South doth challenge all
the rest that do remain.
These are the stars that in the North
do give their blazing light:
Two Bears, of which doth H^lice
shine forth with Stars more bright.
The lesser Cynosura is,
Ph^niceans faithful guide:
Between them both the Serpent fierce,
doth creep with crawling pride,
There Cepheus shines, and Cassiopey,
and Candian glistering Crown:
And next unto the milk white Swan
is placed the Kneeler down,
And harkneth to the pleasant Harp.
The Berwarde there doth show
His glistering stars, and Perseus stands
in this celestial row:
That bears in hand Medusaes face,
and in this part is seen,
The Carter, he that Serpent holds,
and eke his Serpent keen,
And by the Serpent stands the Shaft,
and there the Egle ny,
And Dolphin that in airy seas
above doth swiftly fly.
Here shines the noble Pegasus,
a Horse of ancient fame:
And thereby stands Andromeda,
and Delta, last of name.
Now thirtene signs the South in part
contrary doth retain:
The Whale, that scarce is yet at length
with sword of Perseus slain.
Orion armed thou shalt behold
in this same part of skies.
There Nilus runs wc Channels store:
and Hare that swiftly flies,
Whom ne'er a brace of Dogs pursue,
the greater and the small.
Among these Stars doth Argos sail
a goodly Ship, and tall.
Here may thou both the Altar, and
the mighty Cup behold.
And Phaebut Crow, that glisters all
with Stars of flaming gold.
The Centaur fierce, and Dragon slain,
with strong Alcides sweat,
The stinking plague of Lernaes lake
a grisly monster great.
And in this part a certain Fish,
may well perceined be.
Lo here the shapes that move above
my verse hath told to thee.
Now will I show how many Stars
in every sign appear:
In Elice do seven shine,
by name the greater Bear,
Because it gives the greater light
but Cynosura hight:
The lesser bear because she doth
appear with smaller light,
Though one and twenty Stars in her
do evermore abide:
Fifteen the waking Serpent hath
that doth the Bears divide:
And Cepheus. xix. stars contains:
Cassiepey doth shine
with thirtene lights: ye gorgeous crown
hath never more than nine:
And three the Swan, twice five and nine
the Kneeler bright doth wear:
And fourtene Stars describes the ma
that drives about the Bear,
Of which the star doth brightest shine
that in his girdle lies:
Full seuentene brondes doth Perseus hold
that glisters in the skies:
The Carter seven: but that clear Star
that on his shoulder stands
Is called the Got, the other twain
are Kids he hath in hands:
A dreadful sight to shypmen oft.
The man that holds the Snake
Hath seuetene stars: his Serpents shape
doth two and twenty make.
Nine lights do shine in Orpheus Harp:
four frames the Shaft a hye:
Four fires do flame in him that lift
the Trotan to the sky:
Ten sparks do make the Dolphin clear:
with eightene Stars of night
Shines Paegasus: and twenty gives
Andromeda her light:
But three alone doth Delta bear.
Now will I take in hand
To tell in verse how many stars
in sign of Zodiake stand.
The Ram is first, that. xviij. lights
doth in his body bear,
The Bull hath one and twenty stars
but seven shining clear,
Behind his back Vergiliae are called
and eke Athlantides,
As many in his head he hath,
of showers called Hyades:
Eightene betwixt them have ye Twins,
one. x. the other eight:
And eightene hath the Crab above,
two stands behind him straight
That Asses, and the Stall are named,
but next that clearly shine,
The Lyon glisters there with stars
in number ten and nine:
The Virgin holding ears of Corn
with eyghtene lights is clear:
In Balance four, and. xv. in
the Scorpion doth appear:
And. xv. in the Shooter shines,
before whose feet doth lye
A certain Crown where seven lights
do glister to the eye.
The Got hath two and twenty stars,
the Trojan Boy fourtene:
In the one Fish viij. and. ix. appears:
in the other. xij. are seen.
Now will I show what stars there be
in signs of Southern side,
Though far from us they be, scant
can of our sight be spied:
The monstrous Fyshe hath. xxx. lights:
like sort in Nilus flows,
Six hath the Hare, and. xvij.
in great Orion shows,
With. xix. flames the Syrian Dog,
the little Dog hath three,
The sides of Arcos bravely decked
with three and twenty be,
One star doth Chiron more relay,
the sacrifice in hands
He holds eleven hath, decked with. iiij.
the goodly Altar stands,
With six and twenty Hydra shynes,
three signs that lies in length
And mates the Crab, the Virgin fair
and Lion great of strength.
The Raven shynes with seven stars,
the Cup hath eight in sight,
The Southern Fish with. xij. doth cast
abroad his starry light,
The rising and the setting of
the Signs let us display.
Three sorts of ways ye stars do rise,
three sorts they fall away,
That rising called Cosmike is,
the setting termed likewise,
When early in the East the sign,
with Sun is known to rise:
But when soever any sign
doth rise, or downward fall,
And Sun in setting, lets them shine,
this term we Cronicall.
And Heliake is the rising named,
when as the Sun full ne'er
The sign lies hyd, and passing thence,
forth with doth bright appear:
The Heliake setting that we cal
when as in any sign
The Sun doth walk, and with his light
permit it not to shine,
But now the rising of the Signs
and how they down descend
I will declare, if Muses aid
and Phoebus be my friend.
When Ram doth rise then mounts up
left part of Andromaed
Unto the half, and ioynde therewith
Sir Perseus flaming head:
Then backward comes the Bull aloft,
who while he upward hies,
Al Perseus springs, and greatest part
of Carter then doth rise,
And Thurlpoles tail, and fading quite
the altar down doth fall:
Then hydes himself in flashing floods,
the Berward first of all.
With Twins doth all the Whale arise,
and former parts of Po,
And with this same Orion great
all armed up doth go:
Then he that holds the Snake with both
his feet, the water tries:
The Crab arising up takes half
the Crown away from eyes,
The tail of Whale, the Southern Fyshe
and head of Kneeler lowe,
And half his Haunch: fro knees to back
of him that Snake doth show,
And all his Snake except the neck,
the Bearward almost quite.
But now again from girdle up
Orion comes to sight,
With al the course of Nilus great.
These Signs beside do rise
With Lion fierce: the Egle, Hare,
and Dog of lesser syse,
The former legs of greater Dog,
and head of Hydra springs:
But these against the Bearward hot,
and he that Serpent wrings,
With head and neck of Snake in hand,
and part that did remain
Of glistering Crown, and Kneeler eke,
(excepted yet again
His left foot and his knee beside)
in Western waives do fall,
With Virgin rises whole the Dog,
and Serpent up doth crall,
Unto the Cups, and then appears
the Ship of Thessaly,
As much as Mast and sail may show,
Contrary hid do lye
These stars, the Dolphin, al the Swan,
his tail except, the Dart,
The Scorpions cley, and of the floude
of Nile the former part:
But Pegasus hides head and neck,
the rest appears bright,
Al Argo with the Scales doth rise,
and Bearward clear in sight.
Save tip of tail, al Hydra seen,
the right knee and the shin
Of Kneeler down, and Centaurs tail
to shine doth then begin:
Then may yt half the Crown perceive
the rest of Horse that flies,
And parts that hindmost do stand
of Swan then hidden lies:
And al save head the Whale doth set,
her head in Seas doth hyde:
Andromaeda then shalt thou see,
old Cepheus down to slyde,
The Father of Andromeda,
and down in floods to fall
With hands, his shoulders, his head.
These shapes and figures all
With Scorpion rise: the Dragons tail,
and Chirons horse appear,
And rest of Crown and Sacrifice
that he in hands doth bear,
Also the Serpents head doth rise,
and eke her holders head,
Then syts the part that doth remain
of corse of Andromed,
And Cepheus syts from head to waste,
and double winding way
Of Padus streams, and downward then
doth fall dame Cassiepey,
Then first the Dog himself doth hyde,
and down Orion flings.
When as the Shooter up doth rise,
the Serpent holder springs,
With Serpent whole, the left hand and
the head of Kneeler down,
And al the Harp, the breast and head
of him that ware the Crown
Of Aethyops land King Cepheus called.
Then hidden quite doth lye
Orion, Hare, and greater Dog
and Carter of the Sky,
Excepting only Head and Feet
then Perseus down doth fall,
His right foot and his thigh except
the Ship (save sterne) syts al.
When as the Got ascends up,
the Swan, and Shaft thereby
The Altar and the Egle fair.
begin to appear in sky.
But sterne of Argo then descends,
and lesser Dog doth hyde
His stars in Sea, and under ground
therewyth doth Perseus slyde.
When as of Ganimedes fair
the goodly stars do rise,
Then first the limbs of Pegasus
do clime into the Skies:
Contrarywyse the neck and head
of Dragon down doth slyde,
And Chiron doth his hinder part
beneath the waters hyde.
When as the Fyshes twain are brought
to rise aloft in Sky,
The right side of Andromeda
appears to the eye.
And he that Southern Fish is called:
then both the bodies quite
Of Dragon and of Centaur great,
are taken from our sight.
Thus much of rising of the Signs
and setting shall suffice,
Now let us touch the rest that doth
remain, in speedy wise.
But first we must Vrania call
my verses here unto,
That she may aid and succour send
such secrets to undo.
Vrania, thou that know the things
aloft that hidden lye,
That walk oft by seats of Gods,
and starry temples hye:
Vrania beautiful draw ne'er,
and open unto me,
The secrete seats of Gods above,
and things that hidden be,
And help thy Poet, that in song
thy Scepters seeks to show,
And grant the whirling Skies above
in mind that I may know.
And first good Lady show to me
if that the Skies above
Consist of matter hard and thick,
or soft and apt to move:
None otherwise than is the air,
which well we may divide:
This told thou shalt declare to me
strange matters more beside.
Two springs of nature chief there be
Materia and Forma named:
Of these same twain al kind of things,
that here we see, are framed,
Of these the earth, the Seas, the air,
and flaming fire springs.
Wherefore they lye, that matter none
admit in Heavenly things:
For contraries should then in them
be found, thus they do say,
And by this means corrupted quite
they should in time decay.
But as me seems, this reason here
doth from the truth decline,
For neither matter is in fault,
if that in tract of time
The bodies fade: nor contraries
themselves will thus undo
If that their forces equal be,
and stronger none of two:
For when the strength power is like,
then equal is the fight,
And victory on neither part,
and neither side doth light.
Therefore God seking in his mind
the heavens hye to make,
The chief and purest fined parts,
of matters, first did take,
And tempered them in such a sort
that harm in them should cease,
And that the things contrary thus,
should styll remain in peace:
So lastes the sky continually
and never doth decay.
But for because the harder things
last longer far away,
And take less hurt: therefore the sky
of all the hardest seems
More than the Diamond, that form
and fire it light estemes,
And every force save only Gods,
of whom it first toke ground.
An other reason proves this same,
for first that moves round,
The Spheres beneath him turns about
and West ward them doth drive,
And rolls them daily moving round
though they contrary strive:
Which could not be if that they were
not hard assuredly.
Lake there withal that part of Moon,
the likest is to sky,
Which Sun doth not behold, nor tuchd
with beams of brothers eyes.
So Stars at noone are thought to be
in colour like to Skies,
Which Moon Stars the selves be harde,
and dark they also be:
The experience of the Eclipse doth this
declare apparently,
For Moon betwixt doth hide ye beams
that from the Sun do flow,
And suffers not the shining light
upon the earth to show.
Why should not this same hardness here
unto the Skies agree?
For never should it else hold fast
the Stars that fixed be,
But wander far abroad they would,
nor one place them should hold.
Yet dark is not the firmament,
as of the Stars we told,
For placed here upon the earth
the highest Stars we see:
And well our sight descernes the signs
that farthest from us be.
Sith hardest are celestial shapes,
and purest eke are such,
Perchance they give a sound besides,
and sith they roll and touch,
They make some he auenly melody,
as some that long ago
Both learned and sobre written have,
my Muse this doubt undo.
Though hard and many be the kinds
of Heavenly bodies hie,
And though they subject are to sight
of earthly human eye,
Yet noise for troth they none do make,
for nothing them doth beat:
Nor beaten would they more resound
that are most thick and great.
And sith no air is there, without
the which no sound is made,
And therefore void of noise run
they round in rolling trade.
Beside, the inferior Circles eight
gaynward the mornings seat
Are turned about one self same way,
nor on themselves they beat
With meeting course, but pass one way,
with easy rolling round,
As dance in order compassing
about do softly drive:
The Mover first against them all
in course doth only strive,
Yet noise doth it never make,
no sounds it at all,
For air there lacks and outward parts
of Spheres are smooth always:
Whereby they swiftly pass about,
no roughness them doth stay,
And easly thus with gentle touch
their neighbours next are kyst,
Wherefore there motion they do make
all silently and whyst.
Therefore the Fathers old did earl,
that earnestly believed
Spheres moving to make Harmony,
but not to be perceived,
Because it passde the ears of man,
as is not heard at all
The rush of Nilus streams, where from
the mountains they do fall,
But farther of the sound doth roar.
They trifle thus to teach,
And fond and vain the reason is,
that herein they do preach.
For if such things were never heard,
why should they then devise
A sound amid the Skies to be,
tis nought to enterprise
Of things to talk, that never can
be shewde or proved plain,
That justly may denied be:
no new things must we fain,
Except a troth in them be proved,
where reason is away,
No faith nor credit must we give
to words that men do say.
But is the Heaven round my Muse,
as fame of old hath spied,
For compassed form see mes perfecter
than all the rest beside,
Because it hath beginning none
nor end in it doth lye,
Because it aye contains most,
more fine and fair to the eye
And apter is it to be moved.
chiefly the myddest about:
As Heaven turned about the earth,
that hath her standing stout
In midst of all the world. This form
so worthy doth agree
To Heaven, to the Sun and Moon,
and all the Stars we see:
Though folly fond of Painters doth
them other wise desc^ ye.
But are the Stars as some do say
the thicker part of Sky?
Not so: for every one of them
unlike to Heaven be,
Among themselves they differ eke,
as Elm from Seruise tree,
As Pear from Cherry differs
in fashion and in fruit:
Their diverse virtue this declares,
and eke their sundry suite.
A power alone hath every Star,
and nature eke at hand.
The Heaven therefore is but seat
and place where Stars do stand,
No substance thoe, or matter of them.
What virtue hath the Sky?
All force and virtues in the Stars
and glistering planets lye.
The stars do guide the copassd world,
and every change doth bring,
The Stars create all things on earth
and govern every thing:
Thus teach th'Astronomers, and thus
the common fame doth fly.
No must we think in thick and thin
the substance of the Sky
To differ from the Stars, but eke
their natures diverse be.
And sundry is their shape and force, and
fashion that we see.
The bygnesse of the Stars, and if
their turning never stay,
And in what place they fixed be,
(as Plato once did say)
And if they void of dwellers be,
or any there doth dwell,
My Muse I would be glad to know,
wherefore I pray thee tell.
All stars are not of bygnesse like,
for many less there be,
And in such sort, as comprehend
no man may them we see:
Some are again of larger syse,
in number few and fine,
That in clear nights amid the skies
with gorgeous light do shine:
Of which th'Astronomers have framed
fair shapes and figures bright,
And pictured have the Heavens brave
with signs of sundry sight.
Thus of these greater sort of Stars,
(as learned in Stars do tel,
And as the Suns eclipse doth show,
wherein appears well
How great the Moon in body is
while under him she glydes,
And darkening all with shadows black,
her brothers beams she hydes,)
Some do in compass far exceed
both seas, and earth, and all,
And bigger are their shining globes
though they do seem so small:
Because so far from us they be.
For every thing beside,
The farther it is from our eyes,
the less in sight is spied,
And doth deceive the lookers on.
The stars that fixed be
As Plato greatest clarke doth say)
are each in their degree
About their Centers rolled round,
and turned continually,
And by this reason are they thought
to twinckle in the eye:
And not as certain feigned have,
because far of they be,
Therefore they yield a trembling light
to such as them do see:
This reason surely is but vain,
and childish for to write,
For nothing seems to twinckle tho,
because tis far from sight:
But dimmer then and less it seems,
nor twinkling can they be
Without a motion sure. Wherefore
the Stars that fixed we see,
Do move together with the Sun,
as we declared late,
But Saturne, Iupiter and Mars,
do move in no such rate,
No more doth Moon, nor Mercury.
nor Venus pleasant Star:
But move in little Circles that
to them annexed are.
Why sparkles not Saturne, and Jove,
and Mars, as doth the Sun?
Sith farther far from us in Spheres
aloft more hye they run:
Nor differ they in difference great
from fixed Stars above?
Because they do not as the Sun
about their Centers move.
But in these Epicycles roll
their bodies round about.
Some man perchaunte if so the Sun
doth sparckle, stands in doubt.
But if he shall the same behold
when first it doth appear,
Or when in Winter time it falls,
and sets in waters clear,
When as his eye may best endure
his sight thereon to cast,
He shall perceive it plain to turn,
and eke to sparkle fast.
Let no man think this thing to be
so great and strange to mind,
If all the gorgeous Stars do move
in such a sort and kind:
Seems it not far more wonderful
that Heavens compass wide
With such a motion swift about
the world doth always glyde,
That Birds and winds, lightnings flash,
in swiftness it doth pass?
Thus now th'almighty Lord, by whom
the world created was,
All things he made, divided in
these two, moving and rest.
But in the Center rest upon
the earth her place possessed:
In all the others motion dwells.
The streams do swiftly fly,
The air and fyry flames on earth
do move continually.
But chiefly in the firmament
hath moving greatest spright,
And every Sphere the higher it is
doth move with greater might,
And swiftlier runs about the world.
Wherefore that Heaven hie,
That called is the mover first,
with motion most doth fly.
But that the greatest motion is,
that in the time most small,
Doth soonest run his course about
the greatest space of all.
Thus would it run about the world
in twinkling of an eye,
But that the other Spheres do let
that under him do lye,
Restraining it of course so swift,
least that in turning round,
The Seas with it, it should convey,
and all the earthy ground:
For then no kind of creature could
lead here his life in them.
O matter to be wondered at,
who is not mazed when
He weighs with himself in mind
so great a quantity,
So far to pass in so short time,
and back again to fly,
And never for to cease this course,
and labour none to feel?
Hereby do some believe that Gods
the world about do wheel.
Of them to every Circle is
a mover strong assigned,
Who like as they that are condemned
in bakehouse for to grind,
May never cease from turning round
the Skies both day and night,
Nor though he would can once have (time
to rest his weary spright.
Now surely happy is that God
that serves in the same.
But these are toys, and fancies fond
of such as seek for fame.
What store of fond Foolosophers,
and such as hunt for praise,
The earth brings forth, it is not good
to credit all he says,
Though great his estimation be
in mouths of many men,
Though many Keames of Paper he
hath scribbled with his pen.
For famous men do oftentimes
make great and famous lies,
And often men do miss the truth
though they be never so wise.
Therefore must reason first be sought,
for in such doubtful things,
More credit reason ought to have,
than men ymaginings:
For such are often proved false.
What thing doth reason say?
That Skies or Stars are moved of Gods
or of their proper i way?
What honour great, what kind of joy,
what pleasure can there be,
Unto these Gods that turn about
the Skies continually?
That they for life of foolish man
may needful things provide,
And that the Birds and savage beasts
and Fyshes they may guide.
Becomes it Lords in such a sort
their servants here to serve?
And Gods for ever to be thrall,
that they may beasts preserve,
That they may foster Foals Knaves:
is it not rather meet
For Gods to enjoy their liberty,
and pleasant freedom sweet?
That they may where they list go walk,
least as in fetters tied,
They can not pass from place to place,
but styll at home abide?
Or as the potters plying styll
the wheel and lump of clay,
Can have no time of quiet rest,
nor steppe from place away.
Seems it so sweet asporte to them
the compass round to move,
Or can this labour never grieve
the Gods that sit above?
O sentence worthy to be markde
of grave and witty men,
But reason bars them this, and cries
contrary quite to them.
For nothing is eternal here
but only God alone,
And after him continual be
the Natures euerychone.
Of things that he of nothing made.
But yet by sure decree,
That otherwise they cannot show
than they appointed be,
By him when first he framed the world,
so styll continual shall
The waters soft, the ster hot,
the earth a sted fast ball.
So shall the air for ever move,
so of necessity
The circles of the Heanens round
shall turn continually,
So force and fashion every herb
deliured doth retain,
And every tree, and every beast
that never time can stain.
As long as vnremouing state
of nature doth endure,
As long as changes not the will
of GOD divine and pure.
Wherefore if thus continual be
the course of Heavens bright,
It must be natural as shows
in wayghty things and light.
For what of nature propre is
doth never feel decay,
But if another move the same
in time it falls away.
For no such state of violence
doth last continually.
Have heavy things light more force
than state of Stars and Sky,
That they can move of propre strength
and these can not do so
Except of Gods they caused be
about in course to go?
Then is the earth and fire far
more noble than the Sky
At least for this because they need
no help of mover by.
But of themselves from Center they
or can to Center fly.
Wherefore we must believe that these
celestial states above
Of proper force and of their forms,
as fire and earth do move.
For nature is of greater might
than mover any one.
This nature only God excelles
and him except alone,
No better thing than nature is
nor in the world more hie.
I nature call the fixed law
of him that guides the Sky,
Which fro the worlds foundation first
to all things he assured,
And wyllde that it should stand in force
while age of world endured,
For this same law hath God unto
the forms of things assigned
That when from thence do things proceed
forms well fulfil Gods mind,
He can they once this order break,
for of their forms do spring
Such things as he commanded hath,
who framed each formed thing.
This true and proper nature is
of higher state again
Then matter or form as some have (taught
for certainly these twain
Are rather springs of eury thing
or causes first above
Or framers first, not nature sure
if truest names we love,
Except we have a better will
false names to give such things.
But of this same enough we have,
now strike we other strings,
And whither that the stately roonies
of Heaven empty be,
Or whither any dwellers there
have place and souraintie.
The present time doth me persuade
in wonted verse to sing.
Sith Heaven is so vast and wide
and such a gorgeous thing,
All garnished round with glistering Stars
so bright and fair to th'eys
Shall only void and empty it
and vnreplemsht lye?
And earth and seas such dwellers have?
or is the seas or ground
A place more pleasant, fair and good
or more in compass found
Than all the Sky by which they more
than Skies deserve to hold,
Such store of creatures fair shapes,
and fashions sundry fold?
Is it a part of prudent Prince
to build a palace wide
With gold and Marble beautified
throughout on eury side
And not (save stable) to permit
there any man to lie
And furnish out such goodly rooms
and sumpteous buildings hie?
For Earth is stable to all the world
wherein all filth doth bide
Dust, dirt, dung, bones and carton,
and loathsome thing{is} beside.
Who can at any time rehearse
the heaps of things unclean
That on the seas and earth appear
and ever shall be seen?
Who knows not the showrs ye mists,
the clouds and flakes of snow,
The force of winds rage of storms,
that on the seas do blow,
That shakes the earth moves ye air?
Yet plainly may we see
The Seas and Earth with sundry sort{is}
of creatures full to be.
Shall then ye heavens clear be thought
as void and empty made?
O rather void and empty minds
that thus your selves persuade.
For creatures doth the Skies contain
and eury Star beside
Be heavenly towns seats of saint{is}
where Kings and Commons bide
But perfect Kings and people eke,
all things are perfect there,
Not shapes shadows vain of things
as we have present here,
Which death soon takes time destroys,
defiles, and drives away.
There wise and happy folks, and such
as never do decay
Do live, here misers dwell and men
that certain are to dye
And doltish fools. There peace light
and pleasure chief doth lye:
Here daily wars and darkness blind
and eury kind of payne.
Go now, and praise this world take
delight in life so vain,
Presume thou fool than Heavens fair
the earth to set more by.
But some may doubt if that more strong
than Diamond be the Sky,
And empty place is none therein,
how Gods there dwelling be
And moving there? this seems sure
with reason not t'agree.
Besides since that the Heavens bright
can not with plow be torn,
Nor digd with spade, how there shall vines
and needful grain be borne?
These are but toys laughing stock{is},
for though the Skies be harde,
Yet passage have the dwellers there,
nothing their course hath bard.
For unto these celestial states
the Majesty divine
Appointed slendrest bodies hath
of substance light and fine,
So that no need of doors they have,
nor yet of windows wide,
For through the thickest walls they run
and through the Marbels slide,
So pure and fine their nature is,
and of so strong a might.
Who, (if so be they never had
been subject to his sight)
Would think that fish in floods should be
and frogs in slime to breed,
And Salamander live by fire,
of air Chamelions feed
And Greshops nourished with dew?
yet true this same we see,
And we confess them wonderful,
for many things there be
Which though we think can not be do
yet can and oft are done,
Why could not God then creatures make
that through ye earth should run
And of no meat nor drink have need?
if he so could he did,
Fond were it such a space to build
and leave unfurnished.
But Heaueners have no need with plow
and spade for food to strive
Since that their bodies are not such
as food doth keep alive,
Nor Gods do ever suffer thyrst
nor Saint{is} an hungered be
In fine they never grieved are
with lack or poverty.
Because beyond the Moon there dwell{is}
no kind of doleful case
For eury kind of mischefe, God
upon the earth did place
And in the miost did them enclose
forbydding them the Sky:
O happy such as lead their lives
thus in those places hie,
That Nectar drink, styll fed with food
of sweet Ambrosia green
Whereof in those Celestaill meads
abundance great is seen.
More happy and better is the life
of such as dwell above,
The hier they in Heaven have
their place to rest and move,
For places such as in the Skies
are hier in degree,
More blessed are, and better far,
than those that lower be.
What are the blackish spot{is} that in
the Moon we may behold?
For of these same men diversely
their fancies oft have told.
Nought of it self doth shine in Skies
save only Phoebus clear,
Of him the Moon receau{is} her light
and Stars that glister there,
Who for bicau^e she is the last
of all the Stars on hie,
And lowest part of Heaven keeps
unto the earth most nie,
She needs must darkest be of all
whereby since eury side
She hath not white, nor thick, nor pure
nor me e where light may bide,
For whitest part{is} and thick and light
sunbeams at night receive,
The other part{is} that are not apt
the same doth lightless leave.
Thus in the night the Moon doth shine
but when the day gives light
Much like in show to spotted cloud,
in Sky she waxes white.
So Gloewormes in the night do shine,
but when the day return{is}
By light they lose their light again
that in the evening burn{is},
And then their propre colour show
all fraud and guile away,
^he night is meetest for deceit{is}
true things appear by day.
Now if the world eternal be
or if in time begone
It doth abide a final end
when many years are done,
Is worthy to be understood.
For of this question hie
Have diverse wisemen written books
he saith he doth deny,
And authors fancies differing
the thing doth doubtful try
And that the troth in secrete plight
all dark doth hidden lye.
Some think that it beginning had
and that the world did spring,
Of matter that for ever last{is}
and force of mightiest king,
When as before it had no state:
and say that these same twain
Continued always have, and shall
for evermore remain,
Matter, and the almighty Lord,
from whence all things do floe.
Some think the world of nothing made
and those deny also
That any matter was before,
but by the word and will
(Of God) all made. But others say
so moude by reasons skill,
That never it beginning had
nor never shall have end.
Of these whose sentence truest is?
sure I should condescend
(But that Religion me forbyds,
and Christians that defend
The doctrine old of Moyses books)
to credit none beside,
But that the world hath always been,
and always shall abide.
For why might not this world have ben
for ever here to fore?
Because he could not do it till time,
had taught him knowledge more,
And then at length he finished it?
Or could he always it have done
but would not utter more?
What is the cause? why rather would
he after than before?
Or else what reason altered thus
his mind to other trade?
If nought it were this world to make:
why was it ever made?
But if it meet and profitable
were this world to frame,
What is the cause that God so late
created hath the same?
Wherefore hath it so short an age?
For, if we boldly may
Deuines believe, eight thousand years
are not full past away,
Since Adam old created was.
Beside whence doth proceed
The cause why God should make ye world?
for that he this did need?
If so: he should at first it made
least he should grieved be
The lack of such a goodly thing
so long a time to see.
If not: why made he it? in vain*
ought he for to devise
The thing that to no purpose is?
of fools this is the guise.
Thereof the was some cause, but what?
of troth assuredly,
His goodness great and mighty power,
least that in vain should lye
These two shut up in secrete close,
but rather open be
To eury man, for mighty and good
in vain is coumpted he
By whom no great nor godly thing
hath never yet been wrought.
If God therefore was ever good,
and ever mighty thought,
Why would he not have always built
this goodly world we see?
Why let he such a thing till now
of late deferred be?
No reason truly can be found
except some subtle brain
Make more account of ^oyes than truth
and foolish fancies fain.
Wherefore, if we to reason stick
then must we surely say
That this same world hath ever been
and never shall decay.
But if that GOD said otherwise
long since, and then did give
To Moyses knowledge of his works,
we Moyses must believe:
Let reason always yield to faith,
and there as prisoner leave,
For GOD can not deceived be,
nor never doth deceive,
If any time he do vouchsafe
by words with men to deal,
If that appearing unto man
his secrets he reveal.
But they that first this Chaos and
continual matter taught,
Do trifle much. For why should God
leave it so long unwrought
If he forthwith could make the world
and at the first create
All kind of things? In vain it is
for to deliberate
That presently may well be done.
But some have surely thought
Eternal state the world to have
of no man made or wrought,
But of it self as now it is,
before all ages past,
And of it self as now it is
for evermore shall last.
Which sure is false: for reason doth
her self this same deny,
For two most perfect things can not
in order ever lye:
But would fall out between themselves
and strife thereby maintain.
Well, grant that in a faithful league
they always do ^emayne,
In vain two heads allowed are,
for one shall well suffice,
Because at least dame nature ought
before the rest to rise.
And if before the rest she be,
then is she cause of all,
For foremost cause doth always frame
the things that after fall.
Wherefore doubtless the almighty lord
this world himself did make
Of nothing, and eternal to.
But how? the reason take.
Eternal goodness hath the Lord,
eternal power hath he,
May not likewise his will to make
the world eternal be?
Which if it were, as reason shows:
nought let{is} but world may be
Continual built by workman hie,
in such a fair degree.
As who soever grant{is} the Sun
continual to have been,
Must needs confess, the light thereof
continually was seen:
Yet is ^he light the Suns effect,
and Sun the cause we call.
But let us search the Elaments
and from the Heavens fall,
And not unworthy things of them
let us now v^er plain.
Some men have said that underneath
the Skies a fire doth rain
Near to the Moon, but void of light:
and kindling hastily,
And wondrous hot, which to be true
doth perfect reason try.
For in the night we may behold
the fire in Skies to fly,
And f^ashing flames throughout ye air
and Stars to shoot from hie.
Which doth proceed of damps that in
the air do rise more hye,
And burned is by force of fire
that there al^ft doth lye.
For of two sor^{is} is vapoure, one
light, dry, and soon begun
To fire, whereby the flaming sigh^{is}
in Skies are caused to run,
The other more cold, more weighty gross,
engendered of this same
Are showrs clouds snowes mists
and winds with flashing flame,
And thunder, haylestones, dew rain,
if fire were none above,
No vapour there could kindled be,
in evening{is} dark to move.
Moreover, since in lightness thus
the fire doth air excel,
No remedy, but needs it must
have hier place to dwell.
His seat therefore is under Skies,
and next to Moon doth lye.
Beneath this fire hath air his place
which in his parts most hye
A fervent heate of fire doth take.
The middle parts most cold,
Doth thuder, clouds, lightnings bred^
and tempest{is} sundry fold.
The lowest part is warm and moist
for vapour that doth rise
From flood{is} continually it moys^{is}
ascending toward{is} the Skies,
And warmd it is by beams of Sun
that back from earth rebound,
Here ^sts showrs and pleasant deaw^
and snowes and frost{is} are found,
Which sundry sorts of winds do breed
for no small power is dealt
Unto these winds, and oftentimes
their force in air is fealt,
These can in time of Summer cause
the nipping coldes to come
And in the winter season send
abroad the warming Sun,
These can both give and take away
from us our corn and grain,
These can both breed and bear away
great sicknesses and payne.
From out the East doth Eurus blow.
and from the Lybian coast
Doth Austere come, and Zephyrus
from western parts doth post,
But Boreas blasts in Scythian hills
and Northern parts doth rise.
More winds there are, all rule
the air that lower lies,
And with the air both land and sea.
Of winds the clouds do breed,
And from the clouds do flakes of snow
and showers of rain proceed:
Dews, lightning, hayle early frosts:
but with diuersty of times,
And eke by sundry ways and means
and blasts of sundry winds.
Whereof such as from South do blow,
breeds clouds showers, heaty,
But those that from the Scythian parts
do come, cause coldenesse great.
From these coms ise snowes frosts
when winter dwells here:
But in the Summer time they serve
to make the weather clear.
The western wind breeds flowers, grosid
with green doth new array,
And gives the birds a cause to sing,
and filles the woods with May.
Oft times the Eastern wind is good
yet now and then doth raise
Such tempests great, that seas land
by force thereof it frayes.
These winds the airy sprites above
or Stars abroad do send,
And oft when as the Conjurer
for treasure doth intend
In earth to delve, or consecrate
his book in Magic wise
Some sprite to bind, then have I heard
that winds which then did rise
And sudden storm hath laid ye corn,
and grapes did downward fling.
The matter making winds is mists
that from the floods do spring,
The cause that moves them are sprites
that in the air do dwell,
But this will not the common sort
allow, nor credit well.
What the? cast not such precious pearls
to Dogs or filthy swine:
Believe it you that learned are,
whose minds are more divine,
That not alone in Skies but in
the air, there thousands be
Of sprites that move the raging winds
and tempests that you see
And thunder down wc lightning throw.
Yet do I not deny
But other causes are that blasts
of winds are moved by,
As Sun and Moon and Stars, but chief,
the seven which they name,
The wandering stars that of these mists
effects do diverse frame.
I saw while as at Rome (P. Leo
the tenth there raygning than)
I was, a piece of potters work
and picture of a man
That from his mouth of straightest sis,
a mighty wind did blow,
For all his breast being hollow made
with water full did flow
Which being with heate of fire resolved,
out of his mouth it went
In mighty wind, and far from it
the force thereof was sent.
This proves yt wind proceeds of floods
that thus resolved be
While vapour mounting up is forede
by means of heate to fly,
For contraries do evermore
each other drive away.
In this same lowest part of air
as we before did say,
The blazing stars do oft appear
that fall of Prince doth show
And there with diverse colours died
appears the stormy bow.
This same ye beams of Sun doth cause
that on the clouds we see,
The other made by some one star
of them that mouers be,
Which while the vapour underneath
doth shape thereof receive,
Appears a tail, and in the clouds
his flaming light doth leave
Like as the Circled mist that doth
encompass round the Moon
The circled mist (as men do say)
a sign of wind to come.
As when three suns are thought to shine
and yet they are not three
But shaps of sun that framed in clouds
as in a glass we see.
But underneath this air so gross
and lowe, the Seas have place:
The Occean Seas that all the earth
in circuit do embrace,
Which passing through ye narrow stratghts
where Hercles pillars shows
It spreds it self, and thus abroad
both far and wide it flows.
And this is named by sundry names
Aegian floods it makes
Ionian, Tuscan, Adriatike
Red Seas and Persean lakes.
This Sea doth search the secrete caves
that lowe in earth doth lye,
And evermore doth ebb and flow
and tastes diversely,
As diverse is the earth, by which
he doth his passage make,
And of the brimstone sulphured veins
doth smell of brimstone take.
This is the cause that fluds their course
maintain continually,
For to their springs they oft return,
and oft to seas they fly,
And roll and pass from place to place
and round in compass drive:
And do preserve the earth as blood.
preserves the corse alive.
The self same fluds doth make ye lakes
and fens of filthy air,
And clear and Crystal running springs
and wells for ever fair.
In fine from Occean seas proceeds
all course of waters here,
That round about the world retaynes.
This made the waters clear
That part beneath the earth do lye,
and part above do run,
And such besides as from the clouds
of Hellish dye do come.
But wherefore is the Seas so salt?
doth it of nature spring?
I think not so. For every taste
that seas with them do bring,
Doth fetch his cause from out the earth
for in the earth are found
Great hills of salt that underneath
the waters deep are dround,
Seas sucks this salt and doth resolve
it into water clear.
Thus Salt not Sun, is cause that saltness
doth in Seas appear.
For why doth not the Sun likewise
of Ponds salt water make?
For all such parts of earth as were
not meet for man to take
Because they were to full of salt
hath nature vnderlayde,
The Occean seas more frutefull parts
to us she hath displayed,
Wherein are mountains, hills cliues
rocks, fields and valleys lowe,
Straights, countries, woods and pond{is}
lakes, springs streams that flow,
Small towns, great cities, broughes holds
with ^ones and metalls pure
Such things whereby the life of man
the better doth endure.
The rule of all this earth and goods
to man the Lord did give,
And made him King of eury kind
in seas or land that live:
And wit and reason to him dealt
by which he might excel
And guide the world, and serving God
him love and worship well.
Amid this earth a Center lies,
whereby it is sustaynde,
For thither falls each weighty thing,
as God at first ordaynde,
That never of their propre force
can from this Center fly,
And therefore fixed stands the earth
and in the midst doth lye
Sustained with her heavy weight,
that fast on eury side
To Center runs and frames a ball
both dark and thick, and wide:
About the which with Crimsin horse
the Sun is always lead
And on the part contrary styll
the darksome night is spread.
For nothing else but shade it is
of earth and waters great,
Which shadow if in night it chance
upon the Moon to beat
Doth cause Eclipse, and filles with fear
the woeful gazers heart,
Supposing that oppressed she is
with charm of Magic art.
This shadow makes the longest night{is}
when farthest from us burns,
The flaming Sun, and shortest when
to Northern signs he turns.
The cause thereof is swelling earth
and stately mountains hie,
Which subtle nature hath devised
in place between to lie,
That with their tops in change of time
the nights they alter may.
For look when nearer unto South
the same doth keep his way,
Then farther forth their shadows dark
these hills abroad do fling
Such shades as hide the light and cause
the day more late to spring,
And force the day in shorter time
and space his course to end.
Then frosty winter unto us
his quaking cold doth send,
Then somer makes the Indians black
with raging heate to fry.
But when the Sun returns back
to top of Cancer hie,
Then shorter are the night{is} with us
and heate begins again,
Then winter vexes those with cold
that under us do rain.
Thus doth the Sun with diverse course
both alter times and tides,
And in four equal parts the space
of all the year deuides:
And rolling round about the earth,
both nations serves well,
Both them that under us do live,
and them aloft that dwell.
For men live also under earth,
not only woods and streams,
Nor nature willde that Sun and day
in vain should cast their beams
And only serve for brutish beasts
and sorts of swimming kind,
For all the earth is dwelt upon
no place therein we find,
Nor any clime there is, but that
there mortal men may dwell
And find out places fit for them
and seats that serve them well:
Though cold extreme, or to much hear
rain there continually:
Where nature mischiefs doth permit
there plants she pleasure by
And wise she mixes sour with sweet,
and where diseases raynes
There hath she pointed remedies
that can release the pains.
Therefore wheresoever to much heate
anoyes the inhabitant
No mountains cold nor cooling blast{is}
no shaddowing trees do want
Nor pleasant streams with store of spring{is}
whose coldenesse may defeat
The harms that happen unto man
by force of raging heate.
Besides the night hath equal length
there all times with the day
Which with an even cooling force
doth heate of Sun allay.
whereby we judge the middle Zone
not void nor empty ^es
But peopled well, by nature safe
and means that they devise.
So th'vtter Zones where as they say
no kind of people dwell,
with snowes and ise all couerde styll
men may inhabit well,
As reason good doth us persuade.
for there great store of wood
Doth always grow, garments there
are made both great and good,
with furs of sundry sorts of beasts,
and stoues are many there
where with men well may warm themselves
and winter nothing fear,
And bitter cold by many means
they well may drive away.
Nor food convenient do they want
but Cates at home they may
(Or brought fro other countries) have
and daynty kind of fare,
wherefore it is not true that some
brought up in Greece declare,
That nature only hath assigned
one Zone of smallest sis
For man to dwell, and all the rest
that void and desert lies
Alone to serve, for beast and fish
this world unworthy seem,
That nature granting greater place
to beasts them best esteem.
Wherefore if he may be believed
that troth doth plainly tell
No place there is upon the earth
but men may safely dwell.
Dame natures aid in nothing doth
sustain or feel decay,
And wit of man the hardest things
doth break and bear away.
Now last because unto the end
with haste apace we hie,
And time doth will us to attempt
the fishes of the Sky:
Therefore I briefly will declare
the cause why earth doth quake
What force doth drive it for to move
what might doth make it shake.
And thus we may be bold to think
that in the earth below
Are many caves and mighty vawtes
where boisterous winds do blow.
Which whilst with force they rage and strive,
upon the earth they beat
And in this rage do overturn
the walls and Cities great,
Till breaking out at some one place
with force abroad they fly
And blow about in puffing air
not long in rest they lye.
These winds are bred within the earth
of damps, which fiery heate
Doth draw from moisture near about
for many fierce great
The earth within doth nourish styll,
a wondrous thing I tell
But yet no feigned thing I show,
he can bear witness well
Who so hath Aetna ever seen
or bathes of waters hot,
Or who so knows the wonders of
Veseuus viney plot.
These winds the wicked sprits do move
that in the lowest Hell
Possess their place, and in the depth
of dongeons dark do dwell.
For trifles surely are they not,
nor words of vanity
That of the Stygian lakes, and of
Auernus spoken be.
No place doth void or emptyly
but dwelt in every where,
Both under earth and on the earth,
in air and fiery sphere,
In Skies and eke above the Skies
where Heaven shines bright,
where as the glistering pallayce stands
of Prince of greatest might
That owner is of all the world.
My Muse adieu farewell:
And finally prepare thy self
thy ending tale to tell.
Pisces, the tvvelueth Book:
MOst glorious GOD almighty King
thou Parent chief of name
Whose wisdom great this wodrous world
of nothing first did frame,
And governs it and evermore
preserve{is} it day by day,
The spring and end of all that be
to whom all things obey,
Than whom more great, more good, or fair,
is nothing, nor more hie,
That blessed lives for evermore
above the starry Sky,
My mind desiring now to thee
to clime doth nothing need
Apollo, Muse, Parnasus hill
or springs that wont to feed
The prattling Poets, fancies vain
when as they list to write
Disguised tales that frantic heads
of country Clowns delight.
For, other aid, and other grace
it needful is to have,
And streams of other fountayns sweet
I thyrsty now do crave.
I thee beseech and humbly pray,
on thee alone I call,
That this my work of late begun
and labour last of all
Thou favour wilt, and grant me grace,
to touch the appointed end,
O Lord thy holy sprite vouchsafe
into my heart to send,
wherewith inspirde I may behold
the secrets of thy rain
And others teach, and with my verse
immortal honour gain.
A sort there are that do suppose
the ends of every thing
Above the heavens to consist,
and farther not to spring,
So that beyond them nothing is
and that above the Skies
Hath nature never power to clime,
but there amazed lies.
Which unto me appears false
as reason doth me teach.
For if the end of all be there
where Skies no farther reach
Why hath not God created more?
because he had not skill
How more to make, his cunning stayed
and broken of his will?
Or was it because he had not power?
but troth both these denies,
For power of God hath never end
nor bounds his knowledge ties.
No kind of thing may God conclude
nor limits him assign,
Nor propre force doth once restrain
the Majesty divine.
Great things I tell, and reason great
shall also this defend,
If any thing the power of God
may end or comprehend
Then is yt thing more strong than God.
For what thing can be found,
That if it have not greater force
another thing can bound?
But nothing passes God in power
nor stronger is than he,
Therefore he neither can nor will
with limits compassed be,
For who wold have his force restraynd
when that he may be free
And walk abroad where as he list
with power at liberty?
No man there is that doth desire
himself for to abase,
But rather all men arrogate
to them a higher place,
And always seek for to enhance
the state that here they lead,
And though their wings be large wide
yet farther them to spread.
will GOD then while he may be greatest
of power omnipotent
His propre force himself restrain
and live in limits pent?
This surely doth not well agree
nor ought to be believed
That God hath bounds, if that of none
he ever them received
Nor hath assigned to himself
as we before did prove.
These things foretold, we thus conclude
the works of God above
Unbounded for to be, least that
his power and majesty,
And knowledge should be counted vayn.
For if above the Sky
He could and might have framed more
and goodlier things by much
But would not: then in vain is all
his power and knowledge such.
For if that any man have skill
and cunning in an art,
And never will in practise put
the knowledge of his heart:
In vain he should unto himself
procure a workmans name,
In vain with words he should commit
his faculty to fame,
Which should be rather folly called
and not a faculty.
But in the state divine of God
and glorious majesty,
We must believe is nothing vain
since Godliest is the same.
Thus God what so ever he could do
assurely did frame
Least that his virtue were in vain,
and ever should lye hyd,
But since he could make endless things
it must be thought he did
And all his power there in employed,
so that there did remain
In him no kind of power or force
that idle were or vain.
But learned Aristotle saith
there can no body be
But that it must of bounds consist:
to this do I agree,
Because above the Skies no kind
of body we do place,
But light most pure, of body void
such light as doth deface
And far excel our shining Sun,
such light as comprehend
Our eyes can not, and endless light
that God doth from him send,
Wherein together with their King
the sprites that are more hie
Do dwell, the meaner sort beneath
in Skies do always lie.
Therefore the raygne and portion of
the world consists in three
Celestial, Subcelestiall: which
with limits compassed be,
The rest no bounds may comprehend
which bright above the Sky
Doth shine with light most wonderful.
But here will some reply
That without body is no light,
and so by this deny
That light can never thoe be found
above the heavens hie.
But at us vainly doth he bark,
in vain he doth contend,
For reason doth my words approve
and verity defend.
I pray thee show what is the cause
that here the Sun doth shine?
Because his matter gives him light
or rather form divine
That doth so great a globe contain?
for form and fashion gay
To all things state of being gives,
as Naturesearchers say:
With whom we also do agree.
this same doth plainly show
That Form, not Matter makes ye su^
to shine. From Form doth flow
All kind of force and comeliness.
And if so great a light
Assigned be to bodyly Forms,
why should we in this plight
Deny that incorporeall states
may any light contain?
Since that more pure and fine they are
and fairer far again.
Wherefore the sprites and ghosts above
do shine with wondrous light
Although it can not be discernde
of our corrupted sight:
So that among these Saints the more
their state and power is hie
With brighter beauty much they show
and greater majesty.
No gold, no pearls nor precious stones
nor pomp of purple gown
Doth them as it doth us set out
but light is their renown.
And as the Sun amongst the stars
doth shine with goodliest light,
So shines among the Saints above
the LORD of greatest might
And never darkneth them a whit,
but makes them all to shine,
Such is the goodness of his grace
and majesty divine.
But here perchance he will object
that in the air doth lye
No ground of light, and since no air
there is above the Sky
He will deny that there is light.
But now he lies again,
For air is not the ground of light,
nor as some fondly fain
Is light in air, but contrary
the air in light doth dwell,
If reason what, not Aristotle
doth say he makes well.
For if without the doors fast shut
a candle burns bright,
Or by some clift the fire shine
in house all void of light,
And some there with the air about
the beam with striking shakes
The air is forced to pass the light
but light no moving makes.
And if the air were ground of light
then with one motion so
Both air and light should moved be
and both together go.
Beside, if that in time of night
a man with Torch in hand
Should pass, yt light doth places change
but air doth quiet stand.
Which if to light it subject were
it should continually
Go wander place by place with light
and styll keep company.
But now this same is nothing so
but doth contrary prove,
For light doth pass when air doth stay
and styll with torch doth move.
Whereby it appears that light doth not
the air as subject need,
But well may stand and well wy^
the use of air proceed.
Especially the light of God
whereof a part doth pass
Into our sun and there is kep^
contaynde as in a Glass.
For as within his propre sphere
that under Moon doth lye
No fire can discerned be
by force of any eye,
But if that any matter chance
to kindle with the same,
Then Stars do fall and fiery streams
in Summer nights do flame
And other sights that fear the minds
of men in dreadful wise.
So as it is the light of God
can not be seen with eyes,
But fixed in the Sun it shines
because the matter clear
Whereof the Sun is made is fit
and apt for light t'appeare,
For God hath framed it in such sort,
as there his light may bide
And shine, creating day and life
and goodly things beside.
That light doth also shine in shapes
of sundry sacred sprites
Though not alike to all as Stars
shine not with equal lights
But some more bright than others be
as they are set before.
And as a candle can give light
to many candels more
And yet doth neither lose nor less
his beauty burning bright,
So light of God decreasing not
to other Saints gives light.
But some perchance will here demand
and doubtful question find
If that besides this light that I
declared of endless kind
Doth any other thing consist
without the world so great
Though this be neither meet nor fit
for mortal men t'entreat
Yet will I prove to pass the path
wherein no Poet yet
That hath been hither to before
might ever set his feet,
And will attempt to bring to light
the treasures hie in place
Of God if he be pleased and help
with his accustomed grace.
First must we grant that God is spring
and Father ^ke of all
Who made all things and best chief
him may we truly call.
Therefore where so ever GOD abides
his glory there is found,
And every good and gorgeous sight
doth in that place abound.
And thus what so ever good the earth
the seas or air contains,
All this is seen in place whereas
the LORD almighty raygnes.
And though no matter be in such,
yet judge not thou therefore
They being lack, for perfecter
and fairer they be more
than things that are of matter made.
For form that can it self sustain
without this matters hand,
Is perfecter than that which void
of matter cannot stand.
Therefore all void of matter there
things perfect are and pure
And in despite of fretting age
and force of fate endure.
And store of goodly things are there
that in this worldly light
GOD hath not made, from which proceeds
great joys Saints delight,
Such joys as tong of mortal man
can never full define,
Such joys as never can decay
with space of any time.
These incorporeal forms were known
to mind of Plato hie,
Although the envious sort do scorn
his books full bitterly.
But eury man doth not aspire
these mysteries to know,
A few them find to whom the LORD
above doth favour show,
And gives to them his light that they
these things may plain behold.
In fine, there sprites and Angels are
as many thousand fold
As all the woods contain in leaves
or all the shores in sand,
Or all the Fishes in the seas
or s^arres in Sky that stand,
Yea, number none can them contain,
for since that GOD could frame
Them numberless, he sure so did
the more to spread his name,
Especially since that the world
doth void of li^s lye,
As is before declared plain
and reason strong doth try.
But since they void of body be
and Matter all away
Therefore they never change in time
nor age doth them decay,
No greese they feel, nor sleeps nor food
at any time they crave
Nor labour know but joyful youth
continually they have
And freedom chief, no bondage there
no servants in degree
Nor none there are that there compels,
nor none compelled be,
One only Lord they do confess
the King and spring of all
Him worship they and him they love
and serve in general,
They willingly do him obey
and serve in every thing
Rejoicing all his laud and praise
and wondrous acts they sing
Each one doth there apply himself
to please with goodly grace,
No fighting there, no cankered spite
nor envy can have place,
Continual peace there flourishes
great love and concorde great
Among them is suspicion none
no craft nor false deceat.
In fine the goodliest part it is
of all the world beside,
And far more worthy are the sprites
that in this place abide,
Than those that in the Skies do dwell
and in the Stars do lye,
For look as lower every sphere
doth come to earth more ny,
The meaner sprites it doth con^ayne,
and meaner goods doth give,
And so much baser is the same.
whereby such things as live
Above the Sky, as they most fair
and good, and blessed show,
So those that in the bowels dark
of earth do dwell below,
Are most ylfauoured, vile, and ill,
and there not all in vain
The stinking lakes and soyels of Hell
to be did Poets fain:
Of Hell where men do after death
their pains for michiefe take
And vainly seek for rest and peace
in ever darkened lake.
But wherefore waste I words in wind
and striving all in vain
Do seek unto such Buzzards blind
the troth to open plain?
So sore the state of mankind dotes
that it will never know
That either Gods in Heaven be
or sprites in Hell below.
But most men laugh if any man
do tell them credibly
That after death the souls do live
and never more do dye.
Hence springs it that night and day
they riches seek to gain
This is their greatest cark and care
their greatest toil and pain
That they in Gold and Jewels may
their neighbours far excel,
Gold is the thing that all men seek
in gold their hope doth dwell.
For this, runs into raging wars
the Captain stout of mind
For this, his Children wife and house
and country left behind
The Merchant cutting foaming seas
in ship with sails set out
Assays the blew and dreadful gulfs
and coasts the world about.
Each man doth practise craft and theft
this gold to keep in sight
Gold every man desires and loves
gold pleases every wight.
No fear they any kind of pains
that after death is due
O altogether earthly men else
that only in the view
Fro beasts are know. Ca you nought
than gold to knowledge call?
By which a wise man from a fool
doth differ nought at all
Wherewith fond fortune ill men oft
habundantly doth feed
Learn you that many things there are
that gold do far exceed
Which unto fools and wicked men,
of God not given be
These are the virtues: Godliness
justice and prudency
And wisdom passing far the rest.
These goods who doth retain
A mortal God is and the same
immortal man again
That after death shall happy be,
but he that hath them not
And staines himself with filthy sins
(when death his shaft hath shot)
shall headlong into Hell be cast.
These are not trifles, tales or dreams
but true and sure they be,
Yea most assured, believe it well,
you blind, believe you me,
Woe be to you if that you will
not me herein believe
For life shall quickly you forsake,
and then you shall perceive
That I said true even then when as
your souls in Hell shall lye,
You laugh: but this your joy shall change
to tears and grievous cry.
The time shall come when many men
that now in wealthy pride
Do bear the sway and scornfully
both God and man deride
All naked, bare, in misery
and wretched case shall lye
And shall of others aid require
with piteous woeful cry.
Wherefore O you that have delight
in good and Godly things
Endowed with a better soul
whose roots from heaven springs.
These earthly Gods that as the clouds
away do swifely fly
Which fortune unto fools and knaves
doth give most commonly,
And which a few years ended once
doth death take clean away
Regard not much, nor in such things
your heap or treasure lay.
Seek you no more than that, which is
for life sufficient
A small thing certes will suffice
with little live content.
But let your chief delight be in
the sacred seats on hye
Seek heavenly things with all your force
to this your minds apply:
In Heaven are the perfect goods
that evermore remain
Which never foolish dolt shall have
nor wicked man obtain.
In earth whatsoever doth delight
are trifles all and toys
Which fools and beastly people seek
and count as chiefest joys
For which a thousand hazards great
they rashly undertake
And offering up their foolish breasts
to death, they skirmish make
Of this they bost the Bytle doth
in dong rejoice to lye
Things filthy, filthy folks do love
and villains villainy.
Leave earthly things to earthly minds
let swine in dirt delight
And let your only travail be
to gain the heavens bright.
The goodliest things do best become
the men of best degree
And valiant things most meetest are
for them that valiant be.
The earth is but a Cheri fair
God hath to you assynde
The heavens for your country sweet
your country seek to find.
That when from bonds of body thou
escaped art and gone
And left your flesh for dogs to feed
or worms to gnaw upon
You there may always happy live
from flesh unclean exempt
And lame and often weary limbs
wherein whylest you were pent
Remaining in the vale of tears
and in the mortal rain
Both many harms and sicknesses
and griefs you did sustain
For so the earth may called be
which is the stable sure
Of all the world, the mother and
the nurse of vice impure
Whereas the raging Devil dwells
the king of sinful kind
Wherefore it needful is that you
have often death in mind
And with your selves consider well
how ne'er the door he stands
Still threatening with his deadly dart,
in pale and dreadful hands
How suddenly he strikes therewith
how oft he doth destroy
The lusty youth and takes away
our fair and flowering joy.
O fading life that subject art
to thousand casualties
O to to short and doubtful state
that smoke like from us flies
Now this now that man drops away
and thou this present day
To morrow I, thus at the last
we all do pass away
None otherwise than simple sheep
that Butcher hath prepared
In fold to kill, now these now those
with knife he strikes harde.
To morrow other the next day more
thus all in time they dye
Till that by this his slaughters great
the fold doth empty lye.
This fading life therefore despise
which first beginning takes
with tears his midst is toil grief
and death conclusion makes.
Who will delight in such a life
except a foolish brain?
Seek you an other life to have
an other life to gain
Whereas no mourning grief or pain
whereas no death is found
Thus happy state you shall receive
when carcass comes to ground
You that have hated sin, and God
have worshipped holylie
And have not put your confidence
in things that worldly be
But chaste, vnhurtful, mild and true
have lived in pure degree.
But some perchance yt think how gods
do dwell in Heavens clear
wold also learn some ways or means
(if any such there were)
By which they might with them have talk
and see them face to face
O what a goodly thing were this
and what a wondrous grace
Than which no greater thing on earth
I think can man obtain
But few deserve so great a state
and honour for to gain
For many I grant with devils talk
which easily they entice
By humble prayers made to them
or means of sacrifice
Since far they be not from the earth
but in the air do lye
And oftentimes behold and keep
the people company:
Yea unto many they appear
and serve them willingly
And with the beauty great of youth
enamoured oft they be.
But Gods that in the heaven dwell
the things that mortal be
Disdain to know and wicked facts
of men abhor to see
As they that well do understand
how foolish and how vile
Mans nature is how false and bold
and eke how full of guile
Despiser and blasphemer of
the chiefest majesty
Wherefore to have the speech of them
and see them presently
Is labour great and seldom had
because their ears they close
To voice of men and turn away
their eyes from gifts of those
Which after that they be enrichde
with seeds that others sow
A portion small of others goods
upon the Church bestow,
Thinking that Heaven may be sold
O two legged Asses blind
Think you that God is covetous?
and precious stones doth mind?
Or hath delight in glittering gold?
or needs your help to have?
Do you suppose that he is such
as doth your favour crave:
Think you that bribes can him corrupt
as many men they do?
No sure he is not got with gold
nor gifts he looks to:
When that he lives in happiest state
and blessed on every side,
When his are all that earth contains
or seas or heavens wide
How can you give to God the things
that his already be?
Doth not he rather give to you
the things that here you see?
Therefore since neither they with gifts
nor vows will moved be
A matter very harde it is
them presently to see.
Although the matter be so harde
yet will we pass the way
And what our force in this can do
by proof we will assay.
First needs we must the means find out
that God doth best content
Who is not moude with noble blood
nor unto riches bent
No king nor Ceysar he respectts
nor triumphs doth esteem
No cares he for such as are
most strong and fairest seem.
But these doth utterly despise
nor for the love of them
^ouchsafes the prayers to behold
or present sight of men
Thus must we seek an other way
by which we may obtain
Their speech and presence for to have
perchance my verses plain
This way means shall bring to light
if that the Gods above
So fair attempts do aid and help
and with their sprite approve.
The first thing is the clenlinesse
of body and of mind
By which, man well esteemed of God
doth love and favour find
For all vncleanesse doth he hate
and doth abhor to see,
So fair and blessed is his state
and of so hye degree.
Wherefore we must at first take heed
that we be perfectly
Well purged and pure from filthinee
and all iniquity
Unclothed of our garments black
and clad in comely whites
Which colour best with God agrees
and black with fiendishe sprites.
A harde thing is this same I grant
for who doth here remain
That leads his life without a fault
and free from blot or stain?
To every man hath nature dealt
some crime or vicious kind
And nothing is on earth so fair
but fault therein we find.
Yet are there certain sins so small
and to such trifling end
That in a manner nought at all
the eyes of God offend
Wherewith he is not grieved much
no sores are these nor staines
But as the little freckels that
in body fair remains
Which easily the Lord forgives
since well perce^ueth ^ee
How weak and frail the nature is
of such as mortal be.
But great heinous crimes do much
offend the mighty state
And wicked men he always doth
abhor, despise and hate
Nor will he once their prayers hear
except they cleanse before
And wash away their sins with ^eares
and white for black restore
Requiring pardon for their faults
with voice of mourning mind
Obtaining once again the paths
of virtue for to find
And casting of his canckred skin
as in the pleasant spring
The Serpent uses all his skin
of old away to ^ing.
who thus renewed departes leaves
his slough in stones behind
And casting up his head alo^t
with proud and stately mind
His breadfull hissing doubles oft
with tong of triple kind.
Thus Gods are pleased, thus when as
we rightly on them call
They show themselves and thus to us
their prophecies let fall.
Yet must there one thing more be had
unto this perfect whight
A Crymsin colour must be ioynde,
the beauty then is bright
When as a purple red with white
well entermedled lies
What means this ruddy colour here:
sure, love it signifies.
For love resembled is to fire
which fire hath reddishe flame
And both a colour and an heate
proceeds from the same.
Therefore it needful is beside
that we the Gods above
Do heartily love for he that loves
deserves to have love.
For whosoever loves the Gods
and lives Christianly
Can not be odious unto them
but shall rewarded be
And shall in happy state obtain
whatsoever he doth require
But who is he that loves the Lord?
the man that doth desire
In filthy entisements of the flesh
and pleasures for to sleep?
Or he that hath a great delight
the ravening hawk to keep,
And (mad) in feeding dogs horse
his living doth decay:
Or he that seeks for hye estate
that quickly fades away:
An Owl that in the roufe doth fit
a mate of Fortunes play?
Or is it he that upon God
hath heart and fancy set
And which he worships as a God
by all means seeks to get?
Believe me: they that earthly things
do covet to obtain
The things that in the heavens are
regard not for to gain.
No man can well two masters serve
for who so joys in white
It follow must that he detestes
the black and grisley sight.
Who so delights in light of Sun
him darkness heavy makes
And he that sweetness loves in bitter
things no pleasure takes
Who so approaches to the earth
must needs the heavens fly
And where as love of earth remains
no man can love the sky
But few (alas) and all to few
these earthly things despise
And able are with wings of mind
to mount unto the skies.
Wherefore? because it is so harde,
to this do I agree:
But great rewards makes greatest pains
both easy and light to be.
what greater thing can be obtained
than here with Gods to walk?
And to behold them with our eyes
and thus with them to talk?
This is chiefest Jewell sure
for which we ought to bear
Each kind of travail toil and grief
with good and pleasant cheer.
The Cat would gladly milk receive
but feet she will not wet
The way to virtue sure is harde
yet shall th'vnslouthfull get
Both virtue and honour virtues price
the soldier good ob^aynes
A due reward whereas no praise
the slothful coward gains.
Therefore we must apply our selves
with all our force and might
That these so glorious states above
in us may have delight
Then every thing we shall be sure
here prosperously to have
Both whilst we live upon the earth
and when we are laid in grave.
why do we thus esteem the earth
that soon we shall forsake
O blinded fools of fading joys
we more account do make
Than of the goods that always lastes
what madness is this same?
Now last remaynes that prayers o^
with humble mind he frame
That seeks the sight of Gods to have
which once for to require
Suffices not but oftentimes
we must and much desire
Till at the length in space of time
we get the victory
And as our mind desires most
obtain the Gods to see.
One stroke doth not cut down ye Oak
of old and ancient years,
Nor yet the stone by falling of
one drop of water wears
Nor Rome was builded in a day
each creature, grain and tree
In time spring up, and in great space
of years increased be.
And think thou such a wodrons thing
and of estate so hie
Can with so little pains be done
and wrought immediately?
So easly can we n^t the sight
of earthly Kings obtain
Nor come to tell our tales to them
and hear them talk again.
Think thou that Gods (...) better are
than Kings that here we see
Wherefore then should they come except
they oft desired be,
Except we them as we do Lords
in humble sort desire
Wherefore we must on every day
them oftentimes require.
That they vouchsafe themselves sometime
to show to us in sight
And with their talk the secrete things
to bring abroad to light
This if we do (believe me well)
at length they will appear
And with their presence will us bless
in wretched carcass here
And shortly bring us to the skies
an end of all our strife
whereas the perfectest pleasure is
and eke the happiest life
Then shall we pass and come before
the maker great of skies
And have the Prince of all the world
in view of these our eyes
Than which no better state can be
nor more renowned thing
who is of goodness and beauty all
the fountain head and spring.
But many think it can not be
that unto any here
On earth the sacred sprites above
should talk or thus appear
And think that I but trifles tell.
to these I pardon give.
For nature hath not dealt like wit
to all that here do live.
Some still do ponder in their mind
the Heavenly joys above
And always think of hauty things
some, mean things only love
And have no pleasure much to raise
themselves from earthly place
And thousands on the ground do lye
nor thence will rise an as.
But earthly joy do only mind.
sure in none other wise
Than certain birds that in the air
alo^t most hylye fly
Where many keep the midst thereof
and mount not very hye
The reast frequent the lowest parts
and ne'er the earth do fly.
Wherefore it is no wonder great
if what I here declare
The common people not believe
whose minds most brutish are.
Yet true it is that I have told
for how should any one
Live on the mountains cold dwell
in wilderness alone
And willing lead so harde a life?
sure perish should he staight,
Except some God him comforting
should ease him of this weight.
Believe me he that lives alone
avoiding company
Is either mad, or more than man
doth talk with Gods on hye.
In this sort lived the Prophets old
as it apperes by fame,
And many after Christ whom men
did holy Fathers name
And in this present age of ours
full many may we find
That lead their life sped their years
in this same sort and kind.
These men when they do wisely speak
and reason fair and well
And wonders great do bring to pass
and things to come foretell
Wilt thou esteem as mad or fond
or to be weighed light?
Or rather wilt thou judge they be
inspirde with holy sprite?
Bestdes the holy Church affyrmes
that erst have many been
That sacred shapes of blessed ghosts
full oftentimes have seen
Why should not I believe since that
the Church doth tell it me?
Therefore it is no fable fond
but doth with truth agree,
That men may come to speak with God
and them in presence see
Which I suppose the chiefest good
and final end to be
Of all good things that unto ma^
may any ways arise
While as of this his present life
the troublous seas he tries.
And when escaped from mortal chain
the soul hath passage straight
Conveying with her self these three
that always on her wait
The mind the sense and moving force
unto the heavens hye
Shall joyful go and there remain
in bliss perpetually:
And dwelling there with Gods a God
shall it created be.
O Heaven great O house of Gods
of fairest dignity
How pure art thou how wonderful
with Majesty divine
How garnishte round about with stars
dost thou most brightly shine?
Thou palayce well replenished
with every sweet delight.
For if the earth habounds with things
so fair and good to sight
The earth a place for man and beasts
the vilest part of all
what should we think of thee where dwells
the Gods celestial
The Lords and happy kings of all?
O would to God that when
My doleful threads the Systers three
had fully finished, then
It thither were my hap to come
my Carcass cast in grave:
And evermore such wondrous joys
before my eyes to have.
And now by grace of God I have
of Zodtake finished here
Twelve starry s^gnes which number doth
in these my books appear:
A labour great with study long
and tedious travail penned
Yet finished now and closed up
with last and final end.
What thanks shall I thee give O Lord
and Prince of every land
That hast me willde so fair and great
attempt{is} to take in hand
And given me mind and might thereto?
the praise is only thine,
If any fair or goodly thing
in these my books doth shine,
For every fair and goodly thing
from thee doth first descend
Thou were the first beginning of
this work and final end:
My mind and hand were gouernde by
thy Majesty divine,
To thee I only give the thanks
the honour all is thine.
But yet if any due desert
on these my pains attend
I thee beseech O Lord that when
my life is at an end
This life that night by night I spend
in dreams of vanity
And when the day retornes still vexed
with grief and misery
Thou will vouchsafe in wyping out
my sins to pardon me
Whatsoever I have done (alas)
with mist of mind oppressed
And suffer this my soul with thee
in Heavens hye to rest.
And thou my book in this mean while
thorough* andry cities run,
Assured under cankered claws
of envy great to come,
For Carpers and Correctors thou
shalt find in every place,
Whose mouths with teeth enuenomed
shall tearing thee deface.
Nor some shall surelywatin ng be
which when they nothing can
Do worthy praise will yet rejoice
to rail at every man:
And finding fault at others works
will purchase foolish fame.
Shun you such enui^us whelps as these
and mouths that thus defame
And search for good and learned men
which though but few they be
Yet happy may thou dwell with few,
for few of best degree
Hath God created here on earth
to such go reverently
And all that we have done lay thou
before the virtuous eye
which if they like it doth suffice
and what the rest doth say
Regard not thou, but clownishe words
with laughter pass away.
The judgment of the common sort
is gross and eke their mind
Is wondrous weak and foolish things
delights the foolish kind:
All men the meat do most desire
that them doth best delight
Each pleasure is not acceptable
to every kind of sprite
But good and learned men the things
of good and godly sense
Give ear unto and read and mark
the same with diligence
This is the food that them doth feed
and comfort of their mind
And if foresh^wing do not lye
unto this virtuous kind
Thou shalt be heartily welcomed
and with a smiling look
Of them thou shalt perused be.
Go therefore blessed book
Abide along and happy time,
and when the ghastly grave
Encompast round about with earth
my carcass cold shall have,
Through every country (thou alive)
and realms of sundry fame
Go pass, and seek in every place
to blase abroad my name
FINIS.
Non nobis Domine sed nomini tuo.
