Unto his right entirely beloved sister in christ Ioyeuce Leygh Thomas more
gretyng in our lord.
HIt is and of lunge time hath been my well beloved sister a custom in the
beginning of ye new year friends to send between presents or gifts / as
the wytnesses of their love and frendeshyp also sygnyfyenge that they desire
each to other that year a good continuance and prosperous end of that lucky
bygynnynge. But communely all those presents that are used customably all in
this manner between friends to be sent: be such things as pertain only unto
the body either to be fed or to be cledde or some otherwise delyted: by which
hit seems that their frendshyp is but flesshely stretches in manner to the
body only. But for asmoche as the love amyte of christen folk should be
rather goosty frendshyp then bodily: sith yt all faithful people are rather
spyrituall then carnal. For as ^hapostle says we be not now in flesh but in
spyryte if christ abide in us. I therefore mine hertly beloved sister in good
luck of this new year have sent you such a present as may bear wytnes of my
tender love zele to the happy contynuaunce and gracyouse encreace of virtue in
your soul: and where as the gifts of other folk declare y^ they wishes
their frend^s to be worldly fortunate mine testyfyeth y^ I desire to have you
godly {pro}sperous. These werkes more {pro}fitable then large were made i laten
by one Iohn pic{us} earl of miradula a lordship in Italy of whose conning ^tue
^e need here nothing to speak for asmoche as here after we peruse the course
of his hole life rather after our little power slenderly then after his merits
suffycietly. The werkes are such that truly good sister I suppose of the
quantyte there comes none in your hand more profitable: neither to
thachyuynge of temperance in {pro}sperite / nor to ye purchasing of patience
in aduersite / nor to the dyspysynge of worldly vanyte / nor to the desiring
of heuenly felycyte / which werkes I would require you gladly to receive: no
were hit yt they b^suche that for the goodly matter (how so ever they
b^traslated) may delyte please any person that has any mean desire and love
to god. And that your self is such one as for your virtue and fervent zele to
god can not but joyously receive any thing that meanly sowneth either to the
reproach of vice commendacyon of virtue or honour and laud of god who
preserve you:

The life of Iohn Picus Earl of Mirandula.
IOhan Picus of the faders side descended of the worthy lynage of themperoure
Constantyne by a neuew of the said Emperor called Picus by whom all the
Auncestres of this Iohn Picus undoubtedly bear that name. But we shall let his
auncestres pass to whom (though they were right excellent) he gave again as
much honour as he received. And we shall speak of him self rehersynge in part
his learning and his virtue. For these be the things which may account for
our own / of which every man is more proprely to be comed then of ye
nobleness of his auncestres: whose honour makes us not honourable. For either
they were them self vertuouse or not: if not / then had they none honour them
self had they never so great possessyons: for honour is the reward of
virtue. And how may they claim the reward yt proprely longs to virtue: if
they lak the virtue that ye reward longs to. Then if them self had none
honour: how might they leave to their heirs y^ thing which they had not them
self / on y^ other side if they be virtuous so consequently honourable / yet
may they not leave their honour to us as enheretaunce: no more then the virtue
that them self were honourable for. For never the more noble be we for their
nobleness: if our self lak those things for which they were noble. But rather
the more worshipful that our auncestres were / the more vile and shamfull be
we: if we decline from ye steppes of their worshipful living: y^ clear beauty
of whose virtue makith the dark spot of our vice the more evidently to
appear to be ye more marked. But Pic{us} of whom we speak was him self so
honourable / for ye great plentuouse habundauce of all such virtues / ye
possession whereof very honour follows (as a shadow folowith a body) y^ he
was to all them y^ aspire to honour a very spectacle in whose codycyons as in a
clear pullished mirror they might behold in what points very honour
stondeth: whose marvelous conning excellent virtue though my rude learning
be far unable suffyciently to express: yet for as much as if no ma should
do hit but he yt might sufficiently do hit: no man should do hit / better it
were to be vnsufficietly done then utterly undone. I shall therefore as I can
brefely rehearse you his hole life: at the leest wise to give some other man
here after (yt can do hit better) occasyon to take hit in hand when hit shall
happily grieve him to se the life of such an excellent conning man so far
vnkonnyngly written

Of his parents and time of his birth.
IN ye year of our lord god.M.CCCC.lxiij. Pi{us} the second being than the
general vycare of christ in his church: and Frederyk the third of y^ name
rulynge the empire this noble man was borne the last child of his mother Iulya
/ a woman come of a noble stok / his father hight Iohn frauncise a lord of
great honour and auctorite.

Of the wondre that appeared before his birth.
A Marvelous sight was there seen before his birth / there appeared a fyery
garland standing over ye chaumbre of his mother while she travelled suddenly
vanished a way: which apparece was peradventure a token that he which should
y^ hour in the copanye of mortal men be borne: in the perfeccion of
understanding should be like y^ perfyte figure of that round circle of
garland and that his excellent name should round about the circle of this
hole world be mangnyfyed whose mind should always as the fire aspire upward to
heuenly thing. And whose fyry eloquence should with an ardent heart in time to
come whorship praise almighty god with all his strength. And as y^ flame
suddenly vanisshyd so should this fire soon frome ye even of mortal people be
hid we have oftyntymes red that such unknown and strange tokens has gone
before of follows the natyuytese excellent wise and vertuouse men departing
(as hit were and by gods commandment) seuerynge the cradyls of such
specyall children fro ye copany of other of the comune sort. And showing yt
they be borne to the accheuynge of some great thing. But to pass over other.
The great saint ambrose: a swarm of bees flew about his mouth in his cradle
some entered in to his mouth and after yt yssuynge out again and fleing up on
high hydynge them self among the clouds escaped both y^ sight of his
father and of all them that were present / which pronostycacyon one Paulin{us}
making much of: expowned it to signyfye to us the sweet honey combs of his
pleasant writing: which should show out the celestial gifts of god should
lift up the mind of men from earth in to heaven.

Of his person.
HE was of feture and shappe semely and beauteous / of stature goodly high: of
flesh tender and soft / his visage lovely and fair / his colour white
entermengled with comely ruddes / his even gray and quick of loke / his teeth
white and even / his here yelowe and not to piked.

Of his setting forth to scole and study in humanyte.
UNder ye rule and governance of his mother he was set to masters to
learning: where with so ardent mind he laboured the studies of humanite: ye
within short while he was (and not without a cause) accounted among the chyef
Orators and Poets of that time in learning marvelously swyfte and of so ready
a wit / that y^ versis which he herd ones red: he would again both forward
and bakwarde to the great wonder of the herers rehearse / and over that would
hold hit in sure remembrance which in other folks wont comenly to happen
contrary. For they yt are swyfte in taking be oftentimes slow in remembrynge /
and they yt with more labour dyffyculte receive hit: more fast suerely hold
hit.

Of his study in Canone.
IN the fouretene year of his age by the commandment of his mother (which
longed vere sore to have him priest) he departed to Bononye to study in ye
laws of the church / which when he had two year tasted / perceiving that
the faculte leyned to nothing but only merry tradicions and ordinances: his
mind fill frome hit / yet lost he not his time therein for in that two year yet
being a child he copyled a breuyary or a sum upon all the decretalles in
which as brefly as possible was he comprysed theffecte of all ye hole great
volume and made a book no scleder thing to right conyng perfyte doctors.

Of his study in phylosophye deuynyte.
AFter this as a desyrours enserchour of the secretes of nature he left these
commyn trodden paths and gave him sefe hole to speculation philosophy as well
humane as deuyne. For the purchasing whereof (afte the manner of Plato and
Appollonius) he scrupulously sought out / all the famous doctors of his time.
visytynge studeously all the vnyuersytes and scoles not only through Italy but
also through france. And so infatigable labour gave he to those studies: that
yet a child and berdles he was both reputed and was in dede both a perfyte
philosophre and a perfyte deuyne.

Of his mind and vayngloryouse dispicious of Rome.
NOw had he ben.vij. year conversant in these studies when full of pride
desirous of glory and man praise (for yet was he not kendled in ye love of
god) he went to rome and there (coveting to make a show of his conynge: little
considering how great envy he should reyse against him self).ix.C. questions
he purposed / of diverse sondry maters. as well in logic and philosophy as
dyuynyte / with great study piked and sought out as well of the laten auctours
as the greeks. And partly set out of the secrete mysteries of the hebrewes /
caldeyes / arabics. And many thyges drawn out of y^ old obscure philosophy
of Pythagoras / trimegistus / and orphe{us} / many other things strange: and
to all folk (except right few specyall excellent men) before that day: not
unknown only: but also vnherde / of all which questions in open places (yt
they might be to all people ye better known) he fastened and set up / offering
also him self to bear the costs of all such as would come hither out of
far countrees to dyspute / but thorughe ye envy of his malicyous enemies
(which envy like ye fire ever draws to ye highest) he could never bring
about to have a day to his dyspicions appointed. For this cause he tarried at
Rome an hole year in all which time his enuyours never dared openly with open
dispicyons atempt him but rather with craft and sleyght and as it were with
pryuey trenches enforced to under mine him for none other cause but for malice
and for they were (as many men thought) corrupt with a pestylent envy.

This envy as men deemed was specyaly raised against him for this cause that
where there were many which had many years: some for glory: some for couetyse:
given them self to learning: they thought that hit should happily deface their
fame minysshe thopynyon of their conynge if so yonge a ma plenteouse of
substance great doctrine: dared in the chyefe cite of the world make a
proof of his wit and his lernyng as well in things natural as in diuinit^ in
many such things as men many years never attained to. Now when they
perceived that they could not against his conning any thing openly prevail:
they brought forth the serpentynes of false crime. And cried out that there
were.xiij. of his.ix.C questyons suspect of herysye. Then Joined they to them
some good simple folk that should of zele to y^ faith and pretence of relygion
impugn those questions as new things with which their eres had not be in
ur. In which impugnacyon though some of them happily lacked not good mind:
yet lacked they erudycyon and learning: which questyons: notwitstondynge
before that / not a few famous doctors of diuynyte had approved / as good and
clean and subcribed their names vndre them. But he not berynge the loss of his
fame made a defence for those xiij. questyons. A werke of great erudicyon and
elegant and stuffed with the cognytyon of many things worthy to be learned.
which werke he copyled in xx. nyghtes. In which hit euedently appears: not
only that those conclusyons were good and standing with the faith: but also yt
they: which had barked at them: were of folly and rudeness to be reproved /
which defence and all other things that he should wrytethe comytted like a
good christen ma to ye most holy judgment of our mother holy chy^che / which^
defence received: ye.xiij. questions duly by delybera^yo examined: our holy
father ye pope approved Pic{us} and tenderly favoured him / as by a bull of our
holy father pope Alexandre the.vj. hit plainly appears: but the book in which
the hole.ix.C. questions with their conclusions were contained (for as much as
there were in them many things strange and not fully declared and were more
mete for secrete communycacyon of learned men then for open hearing of commune
people which for lack of connyge might take hurt thereby) Pic{us} desired him
self y^ hit should not be red. And so was the redynge thereof forboden. Lo
this end had Picus of his hye mind and proud purpose / that where he thought
to have gotten perpetual praise: there had he much werke to keep himself
upright: that he ran not in perpetual infamy and sclaundre.

Of the change of his life.
BUt as him self told his nephew he judged y^ this came thus to pass: by the
especial provision and synguler goodness of almighty god / that by this falls
crime untruly put upon him by his evil wyllers he should correct his very
errors / and that this should be to him (wandering in derkenes) as a shynynge
light: in which he might behold consydre: how far he had gone out of y^
way of troth. For before this he had been both desirous of glory and kindled
in vain love: and holden in volupteouse use of women. The comelynes of his
body with the lovely favour of his visage / and therewith all his marvelous
fame / his excellent lernynge^ great rychesse and noble kindred / set many women
a fire on him / frome y^ desire of whom he not abhorrynge (y^ way of life set
a side) was somewhat fallen in to wantonness. But after that he was ones with
this variance wakened he drew back his mind flowynge in riot turned hit to
christ / women's blandimentes he changed in to y^ desire of heuenly joys
dispisynge the blast of vaynglorye which he before desired / now with all his
mind he began to seek the glory and profit of chrystes church and so began
he to ordre his conditions y^ from thens forth he might have ben approved
though his enemy were his judge.

Of the fame of his virtue and the r^sorte unto him therefore.
HEre upon shortly the same of his noble conning and excellent virtue both
far nygh began gloryously to spring for which many worthy philosophres (
that were taken in nobre of the most conning) resorted bisely unto him as to
a market of good doctrine / some for to move questions and dyspute / some (that
were of more godly mind) to here and to take the wholesome lessons and
instruccyon of good living: which lessons were so much y^ more set by: in
how much they came from a more noble ma and a more wise man and him also
which had him self some time followed y^ crooked hills of delycyouse pleasure
/ to the fastenynge of good dyscyplyne in the minds of y^ herers those things
seem to be of great effect: which be both of their own nature good also be
spoken of such a master: as is couerted to the way of justice from the crooked
ragged path of voluptuouse living.

The burning of wanton books.
EYue books that in his youth of wanton ^sis of love with other like fantasies
he had made in his vulgar tongue: all together (in detestacyon of his vice
passed) and lest these tryfles mygh be some evil occasyon afterward he burned
them.

Of his study and diligence in holy scrypture.
ERom thensforth he gave him self day night most fervently to the studies of
scrypture in which he wrote many noble books: which well testyfye both his
angylyke wit / his ardent labour / and his profoude erudicyon of which books
some we have some as an inestimable treasure we have lost. Great lybraries hit
is incredible to cosydre with how marvelous c^leryte he red them over / and
wrote out what him liked: of y^ old fathers of y^ church / so great knowledge he
had as hit were harde for him to have y^ hath lived lunge all his life hath
done nothing else but red them. Of these newer dyuynes so good iugement he had
y^ it might appear there were nothing in any of the y^ were unknown to him /
but all thing as ripe as though he had all their werkes ever before his even /
but of all these new doctors he specyaliy comendeth saint Thomas as him y^
enforseth him self in a sure pillar of truth / he was very quick / wise /
subtle in dispicions had great felicite therein while he had y^ hye stomach. But
now a great while he had bode such conflicts farewell: and every day more
more hated them / and so gretely abhorred them: that when hercules Estenlis duke
of ferrare: first by messengers and after by him self: desired him to dispute
at ferrare: because the general chapytre of freres prechours was holden there
/ lunge hit was or he could be brought thereto: but at the instant request of
the duke which very syngulerly loved him he came thither where he so behaved
himself y^ was wodre ^o behold how all y^ audience rejoiced to here him for
hit were not possible for a man to utter neither more conynge nor more
conyngely. But hit was a commune saying with him y^ such altercacyons were
for a logition and not merely for a phylosophre / he said also that such
disputacyons gretely {pro}fitted as were exercised with a peasyble mind to
thenserchynge of the treuth in secrete copany without great audience: but he
said that those dispicions did great hurt: y^ were holden openly to the
stentacio of learning to win the favour of the comune people the comendacyon
of fools. He thought that utterly hit could vnneth be but that with the
desire of worship (which these gasynge dysputers gape after) there is with an
inseparable bond annexed the appetite of his cofusyon rebuke whom they argue
with / which appetite is a dedly wound to y^ soul / a mortal poison to
charite there was nothing passed him of those capicions soteltes cauilacions of
sophystrye / nor again there was nothing y^ he more hated abhorred cosyderyng
that they served of nought but to y^ shamyng of such other folk as were in
very seyence much better learned and in those trifles ignorant. And y^ unto
thensercherchynge of y^ treuth (to which he gave continual labour) they
profyted little or nought.

Of his learning vnyuersally.
BUt because we will hold the redder no longer in hand: we will speak of his
learning but a word or twain generally / some man has shined in eloquence
but ignorance of natural things has dishonested him / some men hath floured
in the knowledge of divers strange languages but he hath wanted all the
cognicion of philosophy. Some man hath red the inuencyons of the old
philosophres but he hath not ben excercised in the new scoles. Some man hath
sough conning as well philosophie as dyuinite for praise and vain glory and
not for any profit or encreace of chrystes church. But Pyc{us} all these
things with equal study hath so received y^ they might seem by hepis as a
plentyouse streme to have flown in to him. For he was not of ye codycion of
some folk (which to be excellent in one thing set al other aside) but he in
all sciences {pro}fyted so excellently: that which of them so ever he had
considered in him ye would have thought y^ he had taken that one for his only
study. And all these things were in him so much the more marvelous in y^ he
came thereto by him self with ye strength of his own wit for the love of god
and profit his church without masters so that we may say of him that
Epycure the philosophre said of him that he was his own master.

Five causes yt in so short time brought him to se meruclouse conning.
To the bringing forth of so wondreful effects in so small time I cosidre
five causes to have come to gyder: first an incredible wit / secodely a
marvelous fast memore. Thyrdely great substance by y^ which to y^ byenge of
his books as wellaten as greek other tongues he was especially helped.vij.M.
ducats he had laid out in the gaderynge to gyther of volumes of all manner of
litterature. The fourth cause was his besy and infatigable study. The fyfte was
the contempt dispysynge of all erthly things.

Of his conditions and his virtue.
BUt now let us pass over those powers of his soul which appertain to
vnderstondynge knowledge let us speak of them y^ belong to y^ acheuynge of
noble acts / let us as we can declare his excellent codicions y^ his mind
inflamed to godwarde may appear. And his riches given out to poor folk may be
understood / thetent y^ they which shall here his virtue may have occasyon
thereby to give especial laud thank therefore to almighty god of whose
infynyte goodness all grace and virtue comes.

Of the sale of his lordeshyppes and almysse.
Three year before his death (to the end that all the charge besynes of rule or
lordship set a side he might led his life in rest and peace wele considering
to what end this erthely honour worldly dignite comes) all his patrymonye and
dominyons y^ is to say the third part of therldome of Mirandula and of
concordia: unto Iohan francis his nephew he sold / and that so good chepe that
hit seemed rather a gift then a sale. All that ever he received of this bargain
partly he gave out to poor folk / partly he bestowed in y^ byenge of a
little land to the finding of hy his household. And over y^ much silver
vessel plate with other precyouse costly utensils of howsholde he divided
among poor people. He was content with mean fare at his table how be hit so
what yet reteynyge of ye old plenty in deynty vyande silver vessel. Every
day at certain hours he gave him self to prayer. To pore men always if any
came he plentiously gave out his money: not content only to give that he had
him self ready: he wrote over y^ / to one. Hierom Benineui{us} a florentin a
well letred man (whom for his great love toward him ye integrite of his
codycions he singulerly favoured) yt he should with his own money ever help
poor folk: give maidens money to their marriage: and always send him word
what he had laid out that he might paye hit him ageyn. This offyce he comytted
to him that he might ye more easily by hy as by a faithful messenger releue ye
necessyte miseri of poor nedy people such as hy self happily could not come
by ye knowledge of.

Of ye volutary affleccio paynig of his own body.
Over all this: many times (which is not to be kept secrete) he gave alms of
his own body: we know many men which (as saint Hierom saith) put forth their
hand to poor folk: but with the pleasure of y^ flesh they be overcome: but
he: many days (and namely those days which represent unto us y^ passion death
y^ Christ suffered for our sake) bet and scourged his own flesh in the
remembrauce of that great benefyte and for clensynge of his old offences.

Of his placabilite or benygne nature.
HE was of chere always merry of so benygne nature y^ he was never troubled with
Ang^e he said ones to his neuew that what so ever should happen (fell their
never so gtete mysaduenture) he he could never as him thought be moved to
wrath: but if his chystes perysshed i which his books lay: y^ he had with great
travail watch ^piled. But for as much as he considered y^ he laboured only
for y^ love of god {pro}fyte of his church: y^ he had dedicate unto him all
his werkes / his studies his doings since he saw y^ sith god is almighty they
could not miscarye but if it were either by his commandment or by his
sufferance: he verily trusted: sith god is all good: y^ he would not suffer
him to have that occasion of heuynes. O very happy mind which none aduersyte
might oppress / which no prosperyte might enhance: not the conning of all
philosophie was able to make him proud / not the knowledge of the hebrewe /
chaldey arabie language beside greek and laten could make him vayngloryouse /
not his great substance / not his noble blode could blow up his heart / not
y^ beauty of his body / not y^ great occasyo of sin were able to pull him back
in to y^ voluptuouse broad way y^ ledeth to hell: what thing was there of so
meruaylouse strength y^ might ouertorne y^ mind of hy (which now as seneke
saith) was gotten above fortune as he: which as well her favour as her malice
hath set at nought / y^ he might be coupled with a spiritull knot unto christ
and his heuenly cytezeynes.

How he eschewed dygnites.
When he saw many men with great labour money desire bysely purchase ye offices
dygnites of y^ ch^che (which are now a days alas y^ while ^munely bought
sold) him self refused to recyue them: when two kings offred the: when an
other man offred him great worldely {pro}mocyon if he would go to ye kings
court: he gave him such an answer / that he should well know that he
neither desired worship no worldly riches but rather set the at nought y^ he
might y^ more quyetly give him self to study y^ service of god: this wise he
{per}suaded / y^ to a phylosophre and him y^ seeks for wisdom it was no
praise to gather rychesse but to refuse them.

Of the dispysynge of worldly glory.
ALl praise of people and all erthly glory he reputed utterly: for nothing but
in y^ renayeng of this shadow of glory / he laboured for very glory / which
ever more follows virtue as an unseparable seruaunt / he said that same often
times did hurt to me while they live / never good when they be deed / so much
only set he by his lernyge in how much he knew that hit was profytable to y^
church to y^ extermynation of errors. And over that he was come to that
prycke of perfyte humilite that he little forced wyther his works went out
under his own name or not so that they might as much profit as if they were
given out under his name. And now set he little by any other books saueouely
y^ bible / in y^ only studi of which: he had appointed him self to spend the
resedewe of his life / saving that y^ comune profit pricked him when he
cosydered so many so great werkes as he had coceyued lunge travailed vnpon howe
they were of every man by and by desired and looked after.

How much he set more by deuceyon then conning.
THe little affection of an old man or an old woman to godwarde (were it
never so small) he set more by: the by all his owene knowledge as well of
natural things as godly. And oftentimes in communicacyon he would admonysshe
his familyar friends how greatly these mortal things bow and draw to an end
howe slyper how falling hit is y^ we live in now: how ferme how stable it
shall b^ y^ we shall here after live in / whether we be thrown down in to hell
or lyfce up in to heaven. Wherefore he exhorted the to turn up their minds to
love god which was a thing far excellynge all the conynge y^ is possible for
us in this life to obtain. The same thing also in his book which he entytled
de ente et vnolyghtsomely he treats where he interupteth y^ course of his
dispicion and turnynge his words to Angel{us} Politianus (to whom he
dedycateth that book) he writes in this wise. But now behold o my well-beloved
Angel what madness holds us. Love god (while we be in this body) we rather
may: than either know him or by speech utter him. In loving him also we more
profit our self / we labour less serve him more / yet had we lever always
by knowledge never find y^ thing that we seek: then by love to possede y^
thing: which also without love were in vain found.

Of his liberalite contempt of rychesse.
LIberalite only in him passed measure for so far was he from y^ begynyng of
any diligence to erthely things that he seemed somewhat be^prent with the frekyll
of negligence / his friends oftentimes admonysshed him that he should not all
utterly dispycerychesse / showing him y^ hit was his dishonest and rebuke
when it was reported (were it treue or false) that his negligence setting
nought by money gave his servants occasyon of disceye robbry Nevertheless that
mind of his: (which evermore on high cleued fast in cotep^acion in
thenserchynge of natures counsel) could never let down hit self to y^
cosideracion and ouerseynge of these base abiecte and vile erthly tryfles. His
high stuarde came on a time to him desired him to receive his accomt of such
money as he had in many years received of his: and brought forth his books of
reckoning. Picus answered him in this wise / my friend (saith he) I know well
ye have mought oftentimes and yet may desceyue me and ye list / wherefore the
examinacyon of these expeses shall not need. There is no more to do / if I be
ought in your det I shall pay you by by / if ye be in mine pay me / either now
if ye have hit: or here after if ye be now not able.

Of his loving mind ^tuouse behauour to his friends.
HIs lovers and friends with great benygnite courtesy he entreted / whom he
used in all secrete comuninge ^tuously to exhort to godward whose goodely
words so effectually wrought in y^ herers: y^ where a conynge man (but not so
good as conynge) came to him on a day for y^ great fame of his lernyng to
comune with him as they fell in talking of ^tue he was with the words of
Picus so thoroughly pierced that forth withal he forsook his accustomed vice and
reformed his conditions. The words y^ he said unto him were these if we had
ever more before our even ye painful death of christ which he suffered for the
love of us: and than if we would again think upon our death we should wele
beware of sin. Marvelous benignyte courtesy he showed unto th^ not whom
strength of body or goods of fortune magnified but to them whom learning
{con}dicios boude hy to favour / for simylytude of manners is a cause of love
frendeshyp. Alikenes of conditions is (as Appolloni{us} saith an affinyte.

what he hated what he loved.
THere was nohyng more odiouse nor more intoliberable to hy than as (horace
saith) ye proud palaces of stately lords / wedding and wordly besynes / he
fled almoost a like: notwithstondynge when he was axed ones in sporte wither
of those two burdeynes seemed lighter which he would chese if he should of
necessite be driven to that one and at his elec^n: which he stiked thereat a
while but at ye last he shoke his heed and a little smiling he answered yt he
had lever take hy to marriage / as ye thing in which was less servitude not
so much ieoperdy / lyberte above all thing he loved to which both his own
natural affeccon ye study of philosophy inclined him: for yt was he always
waderyng flytynge would never take him sefe to any certain dwelling.

Of his fervent love to god.
OF outward obseruauces he gave no very great force we speak not of those
obseruaunces which the church {con}maunds to be observed for in those he was
dilyget but we speak of those ceremonies which folk bring up setting ye very
service of god a side which is (as christ saith) to be worshipped in spirit in
treuth. But in the inward affects of the mind he cleued to god with very
fervent love and devotion / some time that marvelous alacrite langwysshed and
almoost fell: and efte again with great ftrength rose up in to god. In the
love of whom he so fervently burned that on a time as he walked with Iohan
fraucis his nephew in an orchard at farrare in y^ talking of the love of
christ he brake out in to these words / neuew said he this will I show the I
warn the keep it secrete: the substance y^ I have left after c^rtayne books
of mine finysshed I entende to give out to pore folk seneynge my self with
the crucifyx ^ about the world in every town and ca^ ^ pose to preche of
christ. Afterward I ^ by the e^pecyall commandment of god he (...) that
purpose and appointed to pro^ (...) in the ordre of freres prechours.

Of his death.
IN ye year of our redempcion.M.CCCC.iCiiij. when he had fulfilled ye.xxxij.
year of his age (...) at florence he was suddenly taken with a fervent axes
which so ferforth crept in to ye interior^ pert^s of his body y^ hit dyspysed
all medycynes overcame all remedy and compelled him within three days to
^atisfye nature and repay her ye life which he received of her.

Of his behauyour in the extremes of his life.
AFter that he had r^ceyued the holy body of our sauyour when they offred
unto him the crucyfyx (y^ the image of chrystes ineffable passion suffered for
our sake: he might ere he gave up the ghost / receive his full draught of love
and copassyon in the beholdynge of that pytefull figure as a strong defence
against all aduersyte and a sure port culiouse against wikked spirits / the
priest demanded him whether he fermly believed y^ crucyfyx to be the Image of
him that was very god very man which in his godhed was before all time begoten
of his father: to whom he is also equal in all thing: and which of ye holy
ghos^ god also: of him of the father coeternalli goy^ge forth (which.iij.
persons be one god) was in y^ chaste womb of our lady a perpetual virgyne
coceyued in time / which suffered hungre / thrust / hete / cold / labour /
travail / watch. And which at the last for washing of our spotty syne
contracted and drawn unto us in the sin of Adame for the sovereign love that
he had to mankynde: in the alter of the cross wyllyngely gladly shed out
his most precyouse blode. when y^ priest enquired of him these things such
other as they be wont to enquere of folk in such case. Pic{us} answered him
y^ he not only believed hit but also certainly knew it. when y^ one Abert{us}
his systers soon a yonge man both of wit / conconynge / codicyons: excellent:
began to coforte him against death: by natural reason to show him why hit was
not to be feared but strongely to be taken: as y^ only thing which makes an
end of all y^ labour / payne / trouble / sorrow of this short miserable
deedly life: he answered y^ this was not the cheyese thing y^ should make him
^tent to dye: because y^ death determyneth the many fold incommoditees and
painful wretchedness of this life: but rather this cause should make him not
content only: but also glad to dye: for that death makes an end of sin: in
as much as he trusted: y^ shortness of his life should leave him no space to
sin and offend. He asked also all his servants forgyuenes / if he had ever
before that day offended any of them. for whom he had provided by his
testament.viij. years before / for some of them mete and drink / for some money
/ each of them after their deseruynge. He showed also to the above named
Albert{us} many other credible persons y^ y^ queen of heaven came to him y^
night with a meruaylouse fragrant odour refresshynge all his mebres y^ were
brosed frusshed with that fever {pro}mysed him that he should not utterly dye.
He lay always with a pleasant and a merry countenance and in the very twytches
and pangs of death he spake as though he beheld y^ heuens opene. And all y^
came to him saluted him offering their service: with very loving words he
received / thaked / kissed. The executour of his moveable goods he made one
Antony his brother. The heyer of his lands he made y^ pore people of the
hospytall of florence. And in this wise in to ye hands of our sauyoure he
gave up his spiryte.

How his death was taken.
What sorrow and heuynes his departing out of this world was: both to rich
and pore high lowe: well testyfyeth the princes of Italye / well wytnesseth the
cites people / well records the great benygnyte and synguler courtesy of
Charles king of france / which as he came to florence entendynge from thens to
Rome and so forth in his voyage against the Realm of Naples hearing of the
sykenes of Picus in all convenient haste he sent him two of his own phisicions
as embassiatours both to viset him and to do him all y^ help they might. And
over that sent unto him letters susbcribed with his own hand full of such
humanyte and courteyse offres: as the been volent mind of such a noble prince
and the worthy virtues of Picus required.

Of the state of his soul.
AFter his death (and not lunge after) one hieronim{us} a frere prechour of
^errare a man as well in conynge as holynes of living most famous. In a
sermon which he reherced in the cheyfe church (...) all florence said unto
the people in this wise. O thou Cite of florence I have a secrete thing to
show the which is as true as y gospel of saint Iohn I would have kept hit
secrete but I am compelled to show hit. For he that has auctoryte to
command me / hath bid me publysshe hit. I suppose verily that there be none
of you but ye knew Iohn Picus earl of Mirandula / a man in whom god had heped
many great gifts and synguler graces / y^ church had of him an inestimable
loss / for I suppose if he might have had the space of his life prorogyd: he
should have excelled (by such works as he should have left behind hy) all
them y^ dyed this.viij.C. year before him / he was wont to be conversant with
me and to break to me y^ secretes of his heart in which I perceived that he
was by priuey inspyraciou called of god unto rely gio. wherefore he purposed
oftentimes to obey this inspyracyo and follow his calling. howbehit not being
kind enough for so great benefices of god: or called back by the tenderness of
his flesh (as he was a man of delicate coplexion) he shranke frome the
labour / or thinking happily y^ the religion had no need of him differred hit
for a time / howbehit this I speak only by conjecture. But for this delay I
thretened him two year together: y he would be punysshed if he for slowthed
that purpose which our lord had put in his mind / certeynely I prayed to god
my sefe (I will not lye therefore) that he might be somewhat beten: to compel
him to take that way which god had from above showed him. But I desired not
this scourge upon him y^ he was beten with: I looked not for that: but our
lord had so decreed that he should forsake this present life and leave a
part of that noble crown that he should have had in heaven. Notwithstondyng y^
most benygne jug hath dalt mercyfully with him: and for his plentyouse alms
given out with a free and liberal hand unto poor people for the devout
prayers which he most instantly offred unto god this favour he hath: thought
his soul be not yet in the bosom of our lord in the heuenly Joy: yet is
hit not on y^ other side deputed unto perpetual payne but he is adiuged for a
while to the fire of purgatory there to suffer payne for a season / which I am
y^ gladder to show you in this byhalfe: so the intent y^ they which knew him:
such inspectally as for his many fold benyfy^s are singulerly beholden unto
him: should now with their prayers alms other suffrages help him. These
things this holy ma hierom this seruaunt of god openly affermed / and also
said that he kn^w well if helyed in that place: he were worthy eternal
dapnacion. And over y^ he said y he had known all those things within a
certain time / bu^ y^ words which Picus had said in his sykenes of y^ aperyng
of our lady caused him to doubt to fere lest Picus had be deceived by some
illusyon of y^ deuyll^ In as much as the {pro}myse of our lady seemed to have
ben frustrate by his death / but afterward he vudersode y^ Picus was deceived
in the e^ocacyon of y^ word while she spake of y^ second death ever lastyg: he
vndertoke her of y^ first death temporal. And after this y^ same hierom showed
to his acquayntauce y^ Pic{us} had after his death apered unto him all ^paced in
fire showed unto him y^ he was such wise i purgatory punyshed for his
neglygence his vnkyndnes. Now sith hit is so that he is abiuged to y^ fire from
which he shall undoubtedly de{per}t unto glory no man is sure how lunge hit
shall be first: may be y^ shorter time for our intercessyons. Let every christen
body show their charite upon him to help to speed him thither where after the
lunge habitation with y^ inhabytauntes of this derke world (to whom his goodly
couersacio gave great light) after y^ dark fire of purgatory (in which
venyall offences be clesed) he may shortly (if he be not all ready) entre y^
inaccessible ifinite light of heaven where he may in y^ ^sence of y^ some raygne
godhed so pray for us y^ we may y^ rather by his in^cessio be perteyners of y^
inspecable Joy which we have prayed to bring hy speedily to. Am.

Here ends ye life of Iohn Pic{us} earl of Mirandula.
Here follows three epistles of y^ said Picus of which three: two be written unto
Iohan Fraunsces his neuew / the third unto one Andrewe Corneus a noble man of
Italy.
The argument matter of the first epystle of Picus unto his neuew Iohan
Fraunsces.
HIt apereth by this epistle y^ Iohan Fraunsces the neuew of Pic{us} had broken
his mind unto Picus and had made him of counceyll in some secrete godly
purpose which he intended to take upon him / but what this purpose should be:
upon this lettre can we not fully perceive. Now after y^ he thus intended /
there fell unto him many impedunentes diverse occasyons which withs^ode his
intent and in manner let him pulled him back / wherefore Pic{us} coforteth him
in this epystle and exorteth him to perseuerauce / by such means as are in
the epystle evident and plain enough. Notwithstondynge in y^ beginning of this
lettre where he saith that the flesh shall (but if we take good heed) make us
drunk in the cups of Cerces and mysshappe us in to the likeness a figure of
bruyte beestes: those words if ye perceive them not: be in this wise
vnderstonden. There was sometime in a woman called Circes which by
enchantment as vyrgyll makes mention used with a drink to turn as many
men: as received hit in to divers likeness a figures of sondrye beestes / some
in to lyones / some in to beeres / some in to swyne / some in to wolfes / which
afterward walked ever tame about her house and waited upon her in such use
or service as she list to put unto them. In likewise the flesh if it make us
drunk in y^ wine of voluptuous pleasure or make the soul leave the noble use
of his reason enclyne unto sensualite and affeccions of y^ body: then the
flesh chaugeth us from the figure of reasonable men in the likeness of
unreasonable beestes / and y^ dyuersly: after the couenience symylytude between
our sensual affeccyons and the brutysshe proprytees of sondry beestes. As the
proud hearted man in to a lyon / the Irous in to a beer / the lecherouse in to
a got. The droken gloten in to a swyne / the ravenous extorcyoner in to a
wolf the false desceyuoure in to a fox / mokkynge gester in to an ape. From
which beestly shappe may we never be restored to our own likeness again: unto
the time we have cast up again the drink of the bodily affeccyons by which we
were in to these figures enchanted. When there comes sometime a monstrouse
be to the town we run and are glad to paye some money to have sight
thereof / but I fere if men would loke upon them self advisedly: they should se
a more monstrouse be nearer home: for they should perceive themself by y^
wretched inclination to diverse beestly passyons changed in their soul not in
to the shap of one but of many beestes / y^ is to say of all the whose brutysh
appetytes they follow. Let us the beware as pic{us} cocelleth us y^ we be not
broke in y^ cups of cere{is} y^ is to say in y^ sensual affeccios of y^
flessh lest / we deform y^ image of god in our souls after whose image we be
made make our self worse then idolatres for if he be odiouse to god which
turns y^ image of a be in to god: how much is he more odious which
corneth the image of god in to a be.

Iohan Picus earl of Mirandula to Iohan Fraunsces his neuew by his brother
health in him that is very health.
THat thou hast had many evil occasyons after thy departing which trouble the
stoned against the vertuouse purpose that thou hast taken there is no cause my
soon why you should either marvel thereof / be sorry therefore / or dread hit /
but rather how great a wondre were this if only to y^ among mortal men y^
way lay open to heaven with out sweat as thought y^ now at erst / the
disceytfull world the cursed devil failed / as though thou were not yet in
y^ flesh: which coueyteth against the spyrite: and which false flessh (but if
we watch loke well to ourself) shall make us drunk in ye cups of circes so
deform us in to monstrous shappes of brutyssh unreasonable beestes. Remember
also that of this evil occasyons the holy apostle saint Iames saith you hast
cause to be glad writynge in this wise. ^ aude^e fratres qm in temptationes
varias in cideritis. Be glad saith he my brethren when ye fall in divers
temptacions / and not causeles for what hope is there of glory if there be
none hope of victory: or what place is there for victory where there is no
battle: he is called to the crown triumph which is {pro}uoked to the
conflycte namely to that conflyct: in which no man may be overcome against his
will / in which we need none other strength to vaynquyssh but y^ we list our
self to vaynquissh. Very happy is a christen ma sith y^ y^ victory is both
put in his own frewyll: the reward of the victory shall be far greater than
we can either hope or wysshe. Tell me I pray y^ my most dere soon if there be
ought in this life of all those thingis: y^ delight whereof so vexes and tossith
these erthly minds Is there I say oni of those trif^es: i y^ getig of which a
man must not suffer many labours many displeasurs many miseries or he get hit.
The merchant thikith him self well served if after.x. years sailing / after
a.m. incomoditees / after a.m. Ieopardyes of his life he may at last have a
little the more gadered to gyther. Of the court service of this world there is
nothing y^ I need to write unto the / the wretchedness whereof the experience hit
self hath taught the daily teaches. In obtaynyng y^ favour of y^ princes / in
purchasing the frendshyp of y^ company in ambicyouse labour for offyces
honours. What an hepe of heuynes there is: how great anguissh: how much
besynes trouble. I may rather learn of the then tech y^ / which holding my
self co^ent with my books rest / of a child have learned to live within my
degree as much as I may dwelling with my self nothing out of my self
labour for / or lunge for. Now then these erthly things slyper / uncertain /
vile comune / also to us and bruyte be: swetynge pantynge we shall vnneth
obtain: and loke we than to heuenly things goodly (which neither eye hath
seen nor ere hath herd nor heart hath thought) to be drawn slubry slepyng
magrey our teeth: as though neither god might reygne nor those heuely citezyns
live without us. Certaynely of this worldly felicite were gotten to us with
ydelnes and ease than might some man that shrynketh frome labour: rather chese
to serve y^ world then god. But now if we be for laboured in the way of sin
as much as in the way of god and much more (whereof the dampned wretches cry
out. ^ assatisum{us} in via iniquitatis. we be wearied in the way of wyckednes)
then must it needs be apoynte of extreme madness if we had not lever labour
there where we go from labour to reward then where we go from labour to payne.
I pass over how great peace felycite hit is to the mind when a man hath
nothing that grudges his conscience nor is not appalled with the secrete twiche
of any preuye cryme^ this pleasure undoubtedly far excells all y^ pleasurs
y^ in this life may be obtained or desired: what thing is there to be desired
among y^ delytes of this world? which in y^ seeking weary us / in y^ having
blyndeth us / in y^ lesyng payneth bs. Doubt y^ my soon whether the minds
of wicked men be vexed or not with cotynuall thought and torment: hit is y^ word
of god which neither may deceive nor be deceyuer Cor impij quasi mare feruens
quod quicscere no potest. The wicked man heart is like a stormy see y^ may
not rest / there is to hy nothing sure / nothing peseable but all thing
ferefull / all thing sorrowful / all thing deedly. Shall we then envy these
me: shall we follow them: forgetynge our own coutre heaven / our own heuely
father where we were / free borne: shall we wylfully make our self their
bondemen: with them wretchedly living: more wretchedly dye. And at y^ last
most wretchedly in everlasting fire be punished. O the derke minds of men. O
the blind hertes. Who says not more clear than light that all these things
be (as they say) truer than truth hit self / yet do we not that y^ we know is
to be done. In vain we would pluk our foot out of the clay but we styk styll.
There shall come to the my soon doubt hit not (in these places namely where
thou art couersaut innumerable impediments every hour: which might fere the
frome the purpose of good and vertuouse living ( but if thou be ware) shall
throw the down hedlynge. But among all things the very deedly pestylence is
this: to be conversant day and night among them whose life is not only on
every side an allectyue to sin: but over that all set in the expugnacio of
virtue / under their captain the devil / under the banayre of death / under
the stipend of hell / fighting against heaven / against our lord god and
against his church. But cry thou therefore with y^ prophet. Diru pamus vincula
corum proijciamus a nobis iugum ipso{rum}. Let us break the bands of them and
let us cast of the yooke of them. These be they whom (as y^ gloriouse apostle
saint Paule seith) our lord hath delivered in to the passyons of rebuke and to
a reprouable sense to do those things that are not conuenyente / full of all
iniquite / full of envy / manslaughter / contenton / gyle / malice /
backbiters odiouse to god ^tumeliouse proud / stately / fynders of euell
things / foolish / dissolute / without affecion without covenant / without
merry which when they dayely the justice of god / yet vnderstonde they not y^
such as these things comytte: are worthy death / not only they y^ do such
thyges: but also they which consent to y^ doing: wherefore my child go thou
never about to please them: whom virtue displeases / but evermore let these
words of y^ apostyll be before thyn even. O porter magis deo placere {quod}
hoib{us}. We must rather please god then men / and rembebre these words of
saint Paule also. Sihominibus placerem ^eru{us} christi non essem If I should
please men I were not christ's seruaunt. Let entre to thyn heart an holy pride
have dysdayne to take them for masters of thy living which have more need to
take y^ for a master of theyrs. Hit were far more semyge y^ they should with
y^ by good living begin to be men then thou should with them by ye leuynge
of the good purpose shamfully begin to be a best. There holds me sometime by
almighty god as hit were even a swone and (...) insensibilite for wondre when I
begin in my self: I wot never whether I shall sey: to remember or to sorrow /
to meruayule or to bewail the apetytes of men / or if I shall more plainly
speak: y^ very madness not to believe the gospel whose truth the blode of
marters cries / y^ voice of apostles sowneth / miracles proves / reason
cofermeth / y^ world testifies / y^ elements speaks / deuylles confesses.
But a far gr^ madness is hit if thou doubt not but that the gospel is true:
to live then as though thou doubt not but that hit were false. For if these
words of the words of the gospel be true / that hit is very harde for ^
kyngedome of heaven why do we daily th^ gape after the hepynge up of riches. And
if this be true that we should seek for the glory and praise not that comes
of men / but that comes of god / why do we then ever hang upon the iugement
opinyon of men and no man rekketh whether god like him or not. And if we surely
believe y^ ones the time shall come in which our lord shall say go ye cursed
people in to eueuerlastynge fire / again come ye my blessed children possede
ye the kingdom y^ hath ben prepared for you from y^ fourmynge of the world /
why is there nothing then y^ we less fere then hell or y^ we less hope for
then the kyngedome of god. What shall we say else but y^ there be many
christen men in name but few in dede. But thou my soon enforce thy self to
entre by the streygh gate y^ ledeth to heaven take no heed what thing many men
do: but what thing y^ verey law of nature / what thing very reason what thing
our lord hy self shows y^ to be done for neither thy glory shall be less if
y^ be happy with few nor thy payne more easy if y^ be wretched with many. Thou
shalt hour.ij. specyally effectual remedies against y^ world the devil with
which two as with.ij. whynges: thou shalt out of this vale of misery be lift
up in heaven / that is to say alms dede prayer / what may we do without the
help of god or how shall he help us if he be not called upon.

But over that certaynely he shall not here the when thou call on him if
thou here not first y^ pore man whai. he calls upon y^ and verily hit is
according that god should despise the being a man when thou being a man
despysest a man. For hit is written in what mesure y^ ye mete: hit shall be mete
you again And in an other place of y^ gospel hit is said blyssed be merciful
men for they shall get mercy / when I styre the to prayer I styre y^ not to y^
prayer which stodeth in many words but to that prayer which in y^ secrete
chambre of the mind / in the privy closet of y^ soul with very affect
speaks to god and in y^ most lyghtsome darkness of contemplation not only
presents the mind to the father: but also vnteth hit with him by inspekable
ways which only they know y^ have assayed. Nor I care not how lunge or how
short thy prayer be / but how effectual how ardent and rather interrupted
broken between with sighs then drawn on length with a continual row nombre
of words / if thou love thine health if thou desire to be sure from y^ grennes
of y^ devil / frome the storms of this world / frome thawayte of thyn
enemies if y^ long to be acceptable to god if thou coueyte to be happy at the
last: let no day pass the but thou ones at the lestwise present thy self to
god by prayer and falling down before him flat to y^ ground with an humble
affect of devout mind not frome y^ extremyte of thy lips but out of y^
inwardnes of thyn heart cry these words of y^ prophet. Delicta iuuetutis me
ignoratias meas no meminer^s sed secudum misericordia tua memento mei {pro}pter
bonitate tua dne. The effences of my youth and mine ignoraunces remember not
good lord / but after thy mercy lord for thy goodness remember me. when y^
shalt in thy prayer axe of god: both y^ holy spyryte which prays for us eke
thyn own necessyte shall every hour put in thy mind / also what thou shalt
pray for: you shall find matter enough in y^ redynge of holy scrypture which y^
thou would now (setting poets fables tryfles a side) take ever in thyn hand
I heartily pray y^. Thou may do not hynge more pleasant to god nothing more
profitable to thy self: then if thyn hade cease not day nor night to turn and
rede the volumes of holy scrypture. There lies pryuely in them a certain
heuely strength quyk and effectual with a marvelous power transfourmeth
chaugeth y^ reders mind in to the love of god if they be clean and lowly
entreated. But I have passed now y^ bounds of lettre / y^ matter drawing me
forth the great love y^ I have had to the / both ever before: specyally: sith
y^ hour in which I have had first knowledge of thy most holy purpose. Now to
make an end with this one thing I warn y^ (of which when we were last
together I often talked with y^) that y^ never forget these.ij. things / y^
both y^ soon of god dyed for y^ y^ thou shalt also thy self dye shortly live
y^ never so lunge / with these twain as with two spurs y^ one of fere y^
other of love: spur forth thyn horse thorugh y^ short way of this momentarye
life to y^ reward of eternal felicyte sith we neither ought nor may prefexe
our self onye other end than the endless fruycion of y^ infinite goodness both
to soul body in everlasting peace. Fare well and fere god.

The matter or argument of the epistle of Picus to Andrewe Corncus.
THis Andrewe a worshipful man and a especial friend of Picus had by his
lettres given him counceyll to leave the study of philosophy as a thing in
which he thought Pic{us} to have spent time enough which: but if it were
applied to y^ use of some actual besmes: he judged a thing vain vnprofytable /
wherefore he couceyled Pycus to surceace of study and put him self with some of
y^ great princes of Italy / with whom ( as this Andrew said) he should be
much more fruytefully occupied the always in the study lernyng of philosophy
/ to whom Pic{us} answered as in this present epestle appears where he saith
these words (By this hit should follow y^ hit were either servile or at the
lestwyse not pryncely to make y^ study of philosophy other then mercennari)
thus he means. Mercenary we cal all those thiges which we do for hire or
reward. Then he makes philosophy mercenary uses hit not as conynge but as
marchaudyse which studyeth hit not for pleasure of hit self: or for the
instruccyon of his mind in mortal virtue: but to apply hit to such things
where he may get some lucre or worldly aduauntage.

Iohan Picus earl of Myrandula to Andrewe Corneus gretynge.
Ye exhort me by your letters to the cyuyle and actyue life saying y^ in
vain: and in manner to my rebuke shame have I so lunge studied in philosophy.
But if I would at the last exercise y^ learning in y^ entretynge of some
{pro}fitable acts outward bysynes. Certainly my well-beloved Andrewe I had cast
away both cost and labour of my study: if I were to minded that I could
find in my heart in this matter to assent unto you follow your council. This
is a very deedly and monstrous persuacyon which hath entered the minds of men:
beleuynge that ye studies of phylosophye are of estates pryces: either utterly
not to be touched: or at lest wise with extreme lyppes to be sypped (and rather
to the pomp ostentacio of their wit) then to the culture {pro}fyte of their
minds to be little easily tasted. The words of Neoptolent{us} they hold
utterly for a sure decree that philosophy is to be studied either never or not
lunge / but the sayenges of wise men they repute for I apes v^ry fables: that
sure steadfast felicite stondeth only in the goodness of the mind that these
outward things of ye body or of fortune little or nought pertain unto us. But
here ye will say to me thus. I am content ye study / but I would have you
outwardly occupied also. Ind I desire you not so to embrace martha that ye
should utterly forsake Mary. Love them use them both as well study as worldly
occupation. Trewly my welbe loved friend in this point I gain sey you not /
they that so do I find no fault in nor I blame them not / but certainly hit is
not all one to sey we do well if we do so: and to sey me do evil but if we do
so / this is far out of the way: to think that from contemplacyon to the
actyse living that is to sey from the better to the worse is none error to
decline And to think that it were shame to abide styll in the better and not
decline.

Shall a man then be rebuked by cause that he desyryth and ensues virtue only
for hit self: by cause he studyeth ye mysteryes of god: by cause he ensercheth
the counceyll of nature by cause he uses continually this plesaut ease rest:
seeking none outward thing despising all other thing: sych those thyges are
able suffyciently to satisfy ye desire of their folowers. By this rakenynge
hit is a thing either servile or at ye lest wise not princely to make ye study
of wisdom other then mercenarye / who may well here this who may suffer hit.
Certainly he never studied for wisdom which so studied therefore that in time
to come either he might not or would not study therefore / this man rather
excercised ye study of marchaundyse then of wysedom. Ye write unto me that hit
is time for me now to put my self in houshoulde with some of the great princes
of Italy but I se well yt as yet ye have not known the opinion that
phylosophres have of them self which (as horace saith) repute the self kings
of kings: they love lyberte: they can not bear ye proud manners of estates:
they can not serve. They dwell with them self and be content with the
tranquyllyte of their own mind they suffyce them self more / they seek
nothing out of them self: ye things that are had in honour among ye
{con}mune people: among them be not holden honourable. All that ever the
voluptuouse desire of men thyrsteth for: or ambycyon sygheth for: they set at
nought despise. Which while hit belongs to all men: yet undoubtedly it
{per}teyneth most proprely to them whom fortune hath so lyberaly favoured
that they may live not only well and plenteously but also nobly. These great
fortunes lift up a man hye and setteh him out to the show: but oftentimes as a
fierce and a skyttyssh horse they cast of their master. Certeynly always they
grieve and vex him and rather tere him then bear him. The golden mediocrity the
mean estate is to be desired which shall bear us as hit were in hades more
easeli. which shall obey us not maystre us. I therefore abiding fermely in this
opynyo: set more by my little house my study the pleasure of my books / y^ rest
and peace of my mind: then by all your kings palaces all your comune besynes
/ all your glory / all the aduauntage that ye hawke after and all the favour
of the court. Nor I loke not for this fruit of my study y^ I may thereby
herafter be tossed in the flode and rombelyng of your worldly besynesse: but y^
I may ones bring forth the children that I travail on: y^ I may give out some
books of my nowne to the comune proffyte which may somewhat savour: if not of
conyng yet at the lest wise of wit and dylygence. And by cause ye shall not
thynk that my travail diligence in study is any thing remytted or slakked. I
give you knowledge y^ after great fervent labour with much watch and
infatygable travail I have learned both the he brew language and the chaldey
and now have I set hand to overcome the great dyffyculte of the Araby tongue.
These my dere friend be things: which to apertaine to a noble prince I have
ever thought and yet think. Fare ye well. written at Paris the.xv. day of

The argument of the epystle following.
AFter that Iohan Fraunsces ye neuew of Picus had (as hit apereth in ye first
epistle of Pic{us} to him) begone a change in his living: hit seems by this
lettre y^ the copany of the court where he was couersaunt diversely (as hit is
there vnmanerly manner) descanted thereof to his rebuke as them thought: but as
truth was unto their own. Some of them judged hit folly / some called hit
ypocresy / some scorned him / some sclaundred him / of all which demeanour (as
we may of this epistle coiecture) he wrote unto this earl Picus his uncle
which in this lettre comforted encourages him as hit is in y^ course thereof
evident.

Iohan Pic{us} earl of Myrandula to Frausces his neuew gretynge in our lord.
HAppy art thou my soon when that our lord not only gives the grace well to
live but also that while thou live well he gives y^ grace to bear evil words
of evil people for thy living well. Certainly as great a praise as hit is to
be commended of them y^ are commendable as great a comendacio it is to be
reproved of them y^ are reprouable. Notwithstondynge my soon I call the not
therefore happy by cause this falls reprofe is worshipful glorious unto the / but
for because y^ our lord Iesu christ (which is not only true but also truth
hit self) affermeth that our reward shall be plenteous in heaven when men
speak evil to us speak all evil against us living for his name. This is an
Apostles dignyte: to be reputed dygne before god to be defamed of wykked folk
for his name. For we rede in the gospel of luke that the appostles went
joyful and glad frome y^ counseill house of the iewes because god had accepted
them as worthy to suffer wrong and repreffe for his sake. Let us therefore
Joy and be glad if we be worthy so great worship before god y^ his worship be
showed in our rebuke. And if we suffer of y^ world any thing that is grievous or
bitter: let this sweet voice of our lord be our consolation. Simundus vos odio
habet scitote ^priore me vobis habuit. If the world (saith our lord) hate
you: know ye y^ hit hated me before you. If y^ world then hated him by whom
y^ world was made: we most vile simple men and worthy (if we cosydre out
wretched living well) all shame reproufe: if folk bakbyte us say evil of us:
shall we so grievously take hit y^ lest they should say evil we should begin to
do evil. Let us rather gladly receive these evil words and if we be not so
happy to suffer for virtue truth as the old seyntes suffered betynges /
byndynges / prison / swerdes / death. Let us think at the lest wise we be well
served if we have ye grace to suffer chiding / detraccion / hatred of wikked
men / lest y^ if all occasion of deseruynge be taken away there be left us
none hope of reward / if men for thy good living praise the: thy virtue
certainly in y^ hit is virtue makes the like unto christ: but in that hit is
praised hit makes the unlike him: which for the reward of his virtue received
y^ opprobryouse death of the cross for which as the apopstle saith god hath
exalted him and given him a name y^ is above all names. More desyrefull is than
to be condemned of the world and exalted of god then to be exalte^ of the
world and condemned of god / y^ world codemneth to life: god exalts to
glory: y^ world exateth to a fall / god condempneth to y^ iyre of hell /
fynably if y^ world fawn upon y^: vnneth hit may be but y^ thy virtue (which
all lift upward should have god alone to please) shall somewhat unto y^
blandisshynge of y^ world favour of y^ people incline. And so though hit
less nothing of y^ integrite of our perfection yet hit leases of the reward
which reward while hit begins to be paid in y^ world where all thing is
little hit shall be less i heue where al thing is great. O happy rebukes which
make us sure: y^ neither y^ flower of our virtue shall wyther with the pestile^t
blast of vaynglorye: nor our eternal reward be mynysshed for the vayn
promocion of a little populate fame. Let us my soon love these rebukes only of
y^ ignomynye and reprefe of our lords cross. Let us like feythfull seruautes
with an holy ambyeyon be proud. we (saith saint Paule) preche christ cruci^yed
which is unto y^ iewes despite / unto y^ gentyles folly / unto us y^ virtue and
wysedom of god. The wisdom of this world is folysshnes before god the folly of
christ is y^: by which he hath overcome y^ wysedom of y^ world by which hit
hath pleased god to make his beliuyg people safe. If that thou doubt not but
y^ they be mad which bakbite thy virtue: which: the christen living y^ is
very wisdom reputes for madness / ^sidre than how much were thy madness: if
thou should for the iugement of mad men swerve frome the good institucio of
thy life namely since all error is with amendemet to be taken away not with
imitation following to be encreaced. Let them therefore nyghe / let them bawl
/ let them karke / go thou baldely forth thy journey as thou hast begone and of
the wyckednes mysery cosidre how much thy self art beholden to god which
hath illumined y^ sitting in the shadow of death and translatynge the out of
the copany of them (which like droken men with out aguyde wandre hither and
thither in obscure derkenes) hath associate the to the children of light. Let
that same sweet voice of our lord always sown in thyn eres. Sine mortuos
sepclire mortuos la tu me la. Let deed men alone with deed men: follow
thou me / deed be they that live not to god and in the space of this temporal
death laboryously purchase them self eternal death. Of whom if y^ axe where
they draw: where they refer their studies / their werkes their besynes
fynally what end they have appointed them self in the adopcyon whereof they
should be happy / either they shall have utterly nothing to answer / or they
shall bring forth words repugnant in them self contrary each to other like
the rauynge of bedelem people. Nor they wot never them self what they do but
like them that swyme in swyfte flodes they be borne forth with y^ violence of
evil custom as hit were with the boystious course of y^ streme. And their
wikkednes blyndynge them on this side: the devil prikkynge them forward on
that side: they run for the hedlyng in to all mischief. As blind guydes of
blind men / till that death set on them vnware till that hit be said unto them
that christ saith in the gospel my friend this night y^ deuylles shall take
thy soul frome the: these goods then that thou haste gedered whose shall they
be. Then shall they envy the whom they despised. Then shall they commend them
that they mokked then shall they coueyte to ensew them in living when they may
not: whom when they might have ensewed they pursewed / stop therefore thyn eres
my most dere soon what so ever men sey of y^ what so ever men think on y^
account hit for nothing / but regard only y^ iugemet of god which shall yield
every man after his own werkes when he shall show him self frome heaven with y^
angels of his virtue: in flame of fire doing vegeauce upon them that have not
known god nor obeyed his gospel which (as the apostle says) shall suffer in
death eternal peyn. From y^ face of our lord frome the glory of his virtue
when he shall come to be gloried of his seyntes to be made marvelous in all
them y^ have believed. Hit is written. Qolite timere qui corp{us} possunt
occidere sed qui anima potest mittere in gehenna. Fere not the (says our
lord) that may slethe body: but fere him y^ may cast the soul in to hell.
How much less then be they to be feared: y^ may neither hurt soul nor body
which if they now bakbyte y^ lyunnge virtuously they shall do the same never
the less: if (virtue forsaken) thou were over whelmed with vice not for y^
vice displeases them but for y^ y^ vice of bakbytynge always pleases them flee
if thou love thyn health flee as far as thou may their company / and
retournynge to thy self oftentimes secretly pray unto y^ most benygne father
of heaven cryenge with the prophet. Adtedne leuaui animam meam deus meus in te
cofido non erubescam etia si irrideant me inimici mei eteni vniuersi qui
sperant in ^e non confunde^r. Cofundantur miqua agetes su{per}uacue. vias tuas
dne demostra mihi et semitas tuas edoce me. dirige me in veritate tua et doce
me quia tu es deus saluator meus et in te sperabo tota die. That is to say. To
y^ lord I lift up my soul in the I trust I shall not be shamed though mine
enemies mok me. Certainly all they y^ trust in the shall not be a shamed. Let
them be a shamed that work wyckednes in vain. Thy weyes good lord show me
and thy paths tech me direct me in thy truth and tech me for thou art god
my sauyoure in the shall I trust all the day. Remember also my soon y^ the
death lies at hand. Remebre that all the time of our life is but a moment yet
less than a moment Remember how cursed our old enemy is: which offers us
y^ kingdoms of this world that he might beryue us y^ kingdom of heaven / how
false the flesshly plesures: which therefore embrace us y^ they might strangle
us. how disceyteful these worldly honours: which therefore lift us up: y^ they
might throw us down / how deedly these rychesses: which the more they fed
us: y^ more they poison us / how short how uncertain how shadow like false
ymaginary hit is y^ all these thyges together may bring us: though they flow
to us as we would wyssh them. Remebre again how great things be {pro}mysed
and prepared for the: which ^ispisynge these present things desire and lunge
for that coutre whose king is y^ godheed / whose law is charite / whose mesure
is etnite. Occupi thy mind with these meditacyons and such other y^ may waken
the when thou slepest / kindle y^ when you waxes cold / coferme the when thou
wauerest exhibit y^ whynges of the love of god while thou laborest to
heuenwarde that when thou come home to us (which with great desire we loke
for) we may se not only hy that we coueyte but also such a manner one as we
coueyte. Fare well and love god whom of old thou hast begone to fere.

The interpretation of Iohan Pic{us} upon this psalme Conserua me domine.
COnserua me dne qm speraui in te. Dixi domino deus me{us} es tu qm bonorum
meo{rum} no eges Sactis q sunt in terra mirificauit voluntates suas.
Multiplicate sut infirmitates postea accelerauerut. Non cogregabo couenticula
eo{rum} de sanguinibus: nec memor ero noim eoru per labia mea. Dns pars
hereditatis me calicis mei: tu es qui restitues hereditatem meam mihi. Funes
ceciderunt mihi in preclaris eteni hereditas mea ^clara est mihi. Bendicam dum
qui tribuit mihi intelleccu insu{per} et us{que} ad noctem increpuerunt me
renes met. Prouideba dnm in conspectu meo semper qm a dextris est mihi no
commouca^ Propter hoc letatum est cor meum et exultauit lingua mea insuper et
caro mea requiescet in spe. La non derelinques animam meam in inferno nec
dabis sanctu tuum videre corruptionem. Notas mihi fecisti vias vite adunplebis
me leticia cum vultu tuo. Delectationes in dextera tua us{que} in finem.
Conserua me domine. Keep me good lord. If any perfyte man loke upon his own
estate there is one apparel therein yt is to wit lest he wax proud of his
virtue and therefore Dauyd speaking in ye person of a ryghteous man of his estate
begins with these words. Conserua me domine. That is to say keep me good
lord which word keep me: if it be well considered takes away all occasyon
of pride. For he that is able of him self any thing to get: is able of him
self that same thing to keep. He that asks then of god to be kept in the
state of virtue signifyeth in that asking that from the beginning he got not
that virtue by him self. He then which remembers yt he attained his virtue:
nor by his own power but by the power of god may not be proud thereof but
rather humbled before god after those words of thapostle.

Quid habes quod no accepisti. What hast thou that thou hast not received and
if thou hast not received hit: why art thou proud thereof as though thou had
dest not received it. Two words the be there which we should ever have in our
mouth: y^ one. Miserere mei deus. Have mercy on me lord when we remember our
vice: that other. Conserua me deus. Keep me good lord when we remember our
virtue.

Quonia speraui in te. For I have trusted in ye. This one thing is it that
makes us obtain of god our petycio y^ is to wit when we have a full hope
trust that we shall speed. If we observe these two things in our req^estes y^
is to wit y^ we require nothing but that which is good for us and y^ we
require hit ardently with a sure hope that god shall here us / our prayers
shall never be void wherefore when we miss the effect of our petycyon either
hit is for y^ we ask such thyge as is noyous unto us (for as christ saith) we
wot never what we ask and Iesus said what so ever ye shall ask in my name hit
shall be given you. This name Iesus signifyeth a sauyour and therefore there is
nothing asked in y^ name of Iesus but that is wholesome and helping to the
salvation of the asker) or else god hears not our prayoure because that
though y^ thing y^ we require be good yet we ask hit not well / for we ask
hit with little hope. And he y^ asks doubtyngely asks coldely therefore saint
Iames bids us ask in faith nothing doubting. Dixi dno deus meus es tu. I
have said to our lord my god art thou. After that he hath warded fenced him
self against pryd he descrybeth in these words his estate. All the estate of
a ryghteous man stands in these words. Dixi domino deus me{us} es tu. I have
said to our lord my god art thou. which words though they seem comune to
all folk yet are there very few y^ may say them truly / that thing a man
takes for his god that he takes for his chyefe good. And that thing takes
he for his chyefe good which only had thought all other thyges ^ak he thyketh
him self happy which only lakyng though he have al other things he thinks
him self unhappy. The negard then says to his money. Deus me{us} es tu. My god
art thou. For though honour fail health and strenghte and friends so he have
money he thinks him self well. And if he have al those things y^ we have
spoken of if money fail. he thinks him self unhappy. The gloton says unto
his flesshly lust y^ ambyciouse man leyth to his vaynglory my god art thou. Se
than how few may trewly sey these words I have said to our lord my god art
thou. For only he may trewly say it which is content with god alone: so y^ if
there were offred him all the kingdoms of the world and all the good that is
in earth and all the good that is in heaven he would not ones offend god to have
them all. In these words than / I have said to our lord my god art thou /
stands all the state of a right wise man. Quonia bono{rum} meo{rum} non eges.
For thou hast no need of my good in these words he shows y^ cause why he
saith only to our lord. De{us} meus es tu. My god art thou the cause is for
that only our lord hath no need of our good. There is no creature but y^ it
needs other creatures and though they be of less perfection than hit self as
philosophers and diuynes {pro}uen: for if these more imperfyte creatures were
not / y^ other that are more parfyte could not be. For if any part of y^ hole
vnyuersyte of creatures were destroyed fallen to nought all the hole were
subverted. For certainly one part of that vniuersyte perisshyng all parties
perissh and all creatures be partis to y^ vniuersyte of which university god is
no part but he is the beginning nothing there upon dependynge. For nothing
truly wanne he by y^ creacyon of this world nor nothing should he less if
the world were adnychylate and turned to nought again. Than only god is he
which hath no need of our good / well ought we certainly to be a shamed to
take such thing for god as hath need of us / such is every creature.
Moreover we should not accept for god y^ is to say for the chyefe goodness but
only y^ thing which is the most sovereign goodness of all things and that
is not the goodness of any creature / only therefore to our lord ought we to
say my god art thou. Sanctis qui sunt in terra eius mirificauit voluntares
suas. To his sayntes that are in y^ land of him he hath made marvelous his
wills. After god should we specially love them which are nearest joined unto
god as be the holy angles blyssed sayntes that are in their coutree of heaven
therefore after that he had said to our lord my god art thou he adds
thereunto that our lord has made marvelous his wills y^ is to say he has
made marvelous his loves and his desires toward his seyntes that are in the
land of him that is to wit in the coutree of heaven which is called y^ land
of god and the land of living people. And verily if we inwardly cosydre how
great is the felicite of that coutree how much is y^ misery of this world how
great is y^ goodness and charity of those blessed citezyns: we shall continually
desire to be hens that we were there. These things such other when we remebre
we should ever more take heed y^ our meditations be not vnfruytfull but that of
every meditacyon we should always purchase one virtue or other / as for
ensample by this meditacyon of the goodness of that heuenly country we should
win this virtue that we should not only strongly suffer death and pacyently
when our time comes or if hit were put unto us for y^ faith of christ: vut
also we should wyllyngely and gladly lunge therefore desiring to be departed
out of this vale of wretchydnes y^ we may reygne in y^ heuenly coutree with god
his holy sayntes. Multiplicate sunt infirmitates eorum postea accelerauerut.
Their infyrmytees be multyplyed and after they hasted. These words the
{pro}phete speaks of wicked men. By infyrmytees he vnderstondeth Idoles so hit
is in y^ hebriew text. For as good folk have but one god whom they worship so
evil folk have many gods and Idoles for they have many voluptuouse pleasurs
many vain desires many divers passyons which they serve / wherefore seek they
many sondry pleasures? certainly for by cause they can find none y^ can set
their heart at rest for y^ (as y^ prophet saith) wicked men walk about in a
circuet or copace whereof there is none end Now after these words: their
Idoles be multiplied hit follows. After they hasted y^ is to say: after their
Idoles after their passyons and beestly desires they ro^e forth hedlynge
vnaduysedly without any consideracyon. And in this be we taught that we should as
speedily run to virtue as they ron to vice y^ we should with no less
dylygence serve our lord god than they serve their lord y^ devil. The just
man cosyderyng y^ estate of evil folk determines fermly with him self (as we
should also) that utterly he will in no wise follow them therefore he saith. Non
congregabo conuenticula eorum de sanguinib{us} nec memor nominum. I shall not
gather the cogregacyon of them frome the blode nor I shall not remember their
names he saith from the blode both because Idolatres were wont to gather the
blode of their sacrefyce together and theraboute to do their serymonyes. And
also for that all the life of evil men forsaken reason which stondeth all in
the soul and folowen sensualyte that stondeth all in y^ blode / the {pro}phete
saith not ouely that he will not gather their cogregacyon together from ye
blode that is to say y^ he would do no sacrefyce to those Idoles but also that
he would not remember their names that is to say that he would not talk nor
speak of y^ voluptuouse delytes which are evil peoples gods which we might
yet lawfully do: showing us by y^: that a parfyte man should abstain not
onley from unlawful pleasures but also frome lawful / to the end y^ he may all
together hole have his mind in to heaven ward and the more purely entende unto
the contemplation of heuely things. And for as much as some man would
peradventure think y^ hit were folly for a man utterly to depryue him self
from all pleasures therefore y^ {pro}phete adds. Dns pars hereditat{is} me.
Our lord is ye part of mine enheretaunce / as though he would say marvel the
not though I forsake all thing to thentent y^ I may have y^ possession of god
in whom al other thyges also be possessed. This should be the voice of every
good christen man. Dns pars hereditatis me. God is the part of mine
enheretauce. For certainly we christen people to whom god is promised for an
enheretauce ought to be a shamed to desire any thing beside him. But for y^
some man might happily repute hit for a great ^sumpcion y^ a man should
{pro}myse himself god for his enherytaunce therefore y^ prophet puts
thereto. Tu es qui restitues hereditatem meam michi. Thou good lord art he
that shall restore mine enherytaunce unto me. As though he would say. O good
lord my god I know well that I am nothing in respect of y^ I wot well I am
unable to assende by mine own strength / so high / to have y^ in possession
but thou art he y^ shalt draw me to the by thy grace thou art he that shalt
give thy self in possession unto me. Let a ryghteous man then consydre how
great a felicite hit is to have god fall unto him as his enherytaunce hit
follows in the psalme. Eunes ceciderunt michi in preclaris. The cords have
fall to me nobly. The parts and lots of enherytaunces were of old time met
out and dyuyded by cords or ropes. These words then the ropes or cords have
fallen to me nobly be asmoche to say as the part of lot of mine enherytauce is
noble. But for as much as there be many men which though they be called to
this great felycite (as in dede all christen people are) yet they set little
thereby and often times change hit for a small simple delyte therefore y^
prophet saith suyngly. Hereditas me^ ^clara est michi. Mine enheritauce is
noble to me. As though he would say that as hit is noble in hit self so hit is
noble to me that is to say I reputed hit noble. And all other things in
respect of hit / I repute (as saint Paule saith / for donge / but for as much
as to have this light of understanding whereby a man may know this gift that
is given him of god to be the gift of god / therefore the prophet suyngely
saith. Budicam dnm qui tribuit intellectu. That is to say I shall bliss our
lord which hath given me under stondinge but in so much as a man oftetymes
entendeth after reason to serve god and y^ notwithstondyng yet sensualite and
the flessh repugneth: than is a man perfyte when y^ not his soul only but
also his flessh draw forth to godwarde after those words of the {pro}phete
in an other psalme. Cor meu caro mea exultauerut i deu viuu. That is to say my
mind my flesh both have joyed in to living god for this the prophet saith
here suyngely. ^t us{que} ad nocte mere puerut me renes mei. My reins or
kidney hath chyden me unto the night: that is to say my reins in which is
wont to be the greets inclinacyon to cocupiscence not only now enclyne me
not to sin but also chydeth me that is to say withdraw me fro sin unto the
night that is to say they so fersorth withdraw me from syne that wyllyngly
that afflyet and payne my body. Afflyccyo is in scrypture oftentimes signified
by the night because hit is the most dyscofortable season. Then suyngly the
prophet shows what is y^ rote of this priuacion or taking away of flesshly
cocupiscence in a ma saying. Prouideba deu sem per in ^spectu meo. I provided
god always before me sight / for if a man had god always before this even as a
ruler of all his werkes in all his werkes he should neither seek his own lucre
his glory nor his own pleasure but only to y^ pleasure of god he should
shortly be perfyte. And for as much as he y^ so doth prospers in al thing
therefore it follows. Ipse a dextris est mihi no comouear. He is on my right
hand that I be not moved or troubled. Then the {pro}phete declares how great
is ye felycite of a just man which shall be euerlastyngly blyssed both in
body and in soul and therefore he saith. Letatum est cor meum. My soul is glad
knowing yt after death heaven is made ready for him. ^t caro mea requiescet in spe
my flesh shall rest in hope that is to say that though it joy not by and
by as in receyuynge his glorious estate medyatly after the death yet hit
rests in the sepulchre with this hope that hit shall arise in the day of
Judgement unmortall and shynynge with his soul. And also the {pro}phete more
expressly declares in the verse following. For where he said thus my soul is
glad he adds the cause saying. La non derelinques animam in inferno.
For thou shalt not leave my soul in hell. Also where the prophet said that his
flessh should rest in hope he shows the cause saying. Q^ dabis sanctum tuum
videre corruptionem.

Nor thou shalt not suffer thy saint to se corrupcyon that is to say thou
shalt not suffer y^ flesh of a good man to be corrupted. For that that was
corruptyble shall arise incorruptible. And for as much as christ was the first
which entered paradise and opened the life unto us and was the first that rose
again and the cause of our resurreccyon: therefore these words that we have
spoken of the resurreccyon ben pryncipally vnderstonden of christ as saint
peter y^ apostle hath declared / secondaryly they may be vnderstonden of us in
y^ we be the mebres of christ which only never saw corrupcyon for his holy
body was in his sepulchre nothing putrified / for asmoche the as y^ way of good
living brings us to a {per}petuall life of soul body therefore y^ {pro}phete
saith. Qotas michi fecisti vias vite. Thou hast made the ways of life known
unto me and because that all the felycyte of that stondeth in the clear
beholdynge and ftuycion of god / therefore hit follows. Adimplebis meleticus
cum vultu tuo. Thou shalt fill me full of gladness with the chere for that our
felicite shall be everlasting therefore he saith. Delectationes in dextra tua
us{que} in fine. Delectacion Joy shall be on thy right hand for ever: he saith
on thy right hand because y^ our felycite is fulfilled in the bysyon and
fruytion of the humanyte of christ which sytteth in heaven on ye right hand of
his fathers majesty / after y^ words of saint Iohan. He est tota merces vt
videam{us} deu quem misisti Iesum christum. That is all our reward that we
may be hold god and Iesus christ whom thou hast sent: to which reward he
bring us that sytteth there and prays for us. Amen.

Here begin.xij. rules of Iohan Picus earl of Myrandula partly excytyng
partly dytectynge a man in spyrytuall battle.
WHo so to virtue esteems the way
Because we must have war continual
Against ye world / ye flessh / ye devil / that aye
Enforce them self to make us bond thrall
Let him remember that chese what way he shall
Even after the world / yet must he need susteyn
Sorrow / aduersite / labour / greyfe / and payne.
The second rule.
Think in this wretched worlds besy woo
The battle more sharpe longer is Iwys
With more labour and less fruit also
In which the end of labour: labour is
And when the world hath left us after this
Uoyde of all virtue: the reward when we dye
Is nought but fire and payne perpetually
The third rule.
Consydre well that folly it is and vain
To loke for heaven with pleasure and delight
Since christ our lord and souereyne captain
Ascended never but by manly fight
And bitter passion / then were it no right
That any seruaunt / ye will your self record
Should stoned in better condition then his lord
The fourth rule.
Think how that we not only should not grudge
But eke be glad and joyful of this fight
And lunge therefore all though we could not Judge
How that thereby redound unto us might
Any profit but only for delight
To be confourmed and like in some behauour
To Iesu Christ our blessed lord sauyoure
As often as thou dost war and strive.
By the resystence of any sinful mocyon
Against any of thy sensual wits five
Cast in thy mind as oft with good devotion
How thou resembles christ / as with sour pocyon
If thou payne thy taste: remember therewithal
How christ for the tasted eysell and gall
If thou withdraw thyn hands and forbere
The raven of any thing: remember than
How his innocent hands nailed were
If thou be tempte with pride: think how that when
He was in form of god: yet of a bond man
He toke the shap and humbled him self for the
To the most odiouse and vile death of a tree.
Consydre when thou art moved to be wrath
He who that was god / and of all men the best
Saying him self scorned scorged both
And as a thief between.ij. thieves threst
With all rebuke and shame: yet from his breast
Came never sign of wrath or of disdain
But pacyently endured all the payne.
Thus every snare and engyne of the devil
If thou this wise peruse them by and by
There can be none so cursed or so evil
But to some virtue thou may it apply
For oft thou shalt: resystyng valiantly
The fendes might and socle fyery datte
Our ^auyour cryst resemble in some part
The fyft rule.
Remember well that we in no wise must
Neither in the foresaid espyrytuell armour
Nor any other remedy put out trust
But ouely in the virtue strength of our sauyour
For he it is by whose mighty power
The world was veynquyisshed his prince cast out
Which reigned before in all the et the about
In him let us trust to overcome all evil
In him let us put our hope and confidence
To ^uddene^ he flesh and master y^ devil
To him be all honour and lowly reverence
Oft should we require with all our diligence
With prayer / with teeres / lamentable plaints
The aid of his grace and his holy sayntes
The syxte rule.
One sin vanquished loke thou not tarry
But lye in a wait for an other every hour
For as a wood iyon the fend our adversary
Rynneth about seeking whom he may devour
Wherefore continually upon thy tower
Lest he the vnpurueyed and vnredy catch
Thou must with the prophcie stoned keep watch
The.vii. rule
Enforce thy self not only for to stoned
Unuayn^uysshed against the devils might
But over that take valiantly on hand
To vaynquysshe him and put him unto flight
And that is when of y^ same dede thought or sight
By which he would have the with sin contract:
Thou take occasyon of some good vertuouse act.
Some time he secretly castyth in thy mind
Some laudable dede to stere the to pride
As vayn glory makyth many a man blind
But let humylite be thy sure guide
Thy good wark to god let hit be applyede
Think hit not thyn but a gift of his
Of whose grace vndowtedly all goodness is
The viii. rule
In time of battle so put thy self in preace
As though thou should after that victory
Enjoy for ever a perpetual peace
For god of his goodness and liberal mercy
May grant the gyfte / eke thy proud enemy
Confounded and rebuked by thy battle
Shall the nomore happily for very shame assail
But when thou may ones y^ triumph obtain
Prepare thy self and trim the in thy ger
As thou should incontinent fight again
For if thou be ready the devil will the fere
Wherefore in any wise so even thou the bear
That thou remember and have ever in memory.
In victory battle in battle victory
If thou think thy self well fenced and sure
Against every sotell suggestion of vice
Consydre frail glass may no dystres endure
And great adventurers oft curs the dice
Ieopard not to far therefore and ye be wise
But evermore eschew the occasyons of sin
For he that loves apparel shall peressh therein
The.x. rule.
In all temptation withstonde the beginning
The cursed infantes of wretched Babilon
To suffer them wax / is a Ieoperdous thing
Beat out their brains therefore at the stone
Perylous is the canker that catches the bone
To late comes the medicine if thou let the ^ore
By lunge contynuaunce increase more more.
The.xj. rule.
Though in the time of the battle and war
The conflecte seem bitter sharpe and sour
Yet consydre hit is more pleasure far
Over the devil to be a conqueror
Then is in the use of thy beestly pleasoure
Of virtue more joy the conscience hath within
Then outward the body of all his fylthy sin
In this p^ynt many men err for necligence
For they compare not the Joy of the victory
To the sensual pleasure of their concupiscence
But like rude beestes unadvisedly
Lakkynge discrecyon they compare apply
Of their foul sin the voluptuouse delight
To the laberous travail of the conflyct fight
And yet alas he that oft hath known
What gryefe it is by lunge experience
Of his cruel enemy to be over thrown
Should ones at the lest wise do his diligence
To prove and assay with manly defence
What pleasure there is what honour peace rest
In gloriouse victory triumph and conquest
The.xij. rule.
Though thou be tempted despair the nothing
Remember the glorious apostle saint Poule
When he had seen god in his perfyte being
Lest such reuelacyon should his heart extolle
His flesh was suffered rebel against the soul
This did almighty god of his goodness provide
To preserve his seruaunt fro y^ danger of pride
And here take heed that he whom god did love
And for his most especial vessel chose
Ravished in to the third heaven above
Yet stood in peril lest pride might him depose
Well ought we then our hertes fence close
Against vaynglorye the mother of repryefe
The very crop and rote of all myschefe
Against this pomp wretched worlds gloss
Consydre how crist the lord souereyne powere
Humbled him self for us unto the cross
And peradventure death with in one howre
Shall us bereave: wealth riches and honowre
And bring us down full low both small great
To vile caryon and wretched worms mete
Here follow the.xii. wepens of spirytual battle which every man should have at
hand when ye pleasure of a synful temptation comes to his mind.

The pleasure little short The folowers gryef heuynes The loss of a bettyr thing
This life a dream and a shadow The death at out hand vnware ye fere of ipenitet
de{per}tyng Eternal joy etnal payne y^ nature dygnyte of ma ye peace of a good
mind The great vnfytes of god The peynful cross of cryst The wytnes of martyrs
and example of sayntes.
The.xii. wepens have we more at lengh declared as hit folowyth.

The pleasure little and short
Consydre well the pleasure that thou hast
Stand hit in towchyng or in wanton sight
In vain smell or in thy lycorouse taste
Or fynally in what so ever delight
Occupied is thy wretched appetyght
Thou shalt hit find when thou hast al cast
Little / simple / short / and suddenly past
The folowers gryefe heuynes
Any good wark if thou iwth labour do
The labour goth / the goodness doth remain
If thou do evil with pleasure joined thereto
The pleasure which thine evil wark doth cotayne
Glydeth his wey thou mast him not restrain
The evil then in thy breast cleueth behind
With grudge of heart heuynes of mind
The loss of a better thing.
When thou laborest thy pleasure for to bye
Upon the price loke thou the well advise
Thou sellest thy soul therefore euyn by by
To thy most vttre dispitcouse enemies
O mad merchant o folissh merchaundyse
To by a tryfle / o chyldysshe reckoning
And pay therefore so dere a precyouse thing
This life a dream and a shadow
This wretched life (the trust confidence
Of whose contynuaunce makes us bold to sin)
Thou perceives well by experience
Since that hour in wiche hit died begin
Hit holds on the course and will not lynne
But fast hit rynneth on and passen shall
As doth a dream or a sadowe on the wall
Death at our hand and vnware
Consydre well that ever night and day
While that we besyly provide and care
For our disport revel mirth and play
For pleasant melody and deynty fare
Death stelyth on full ^yly and vnware
He lies at hand and shall us entreprise
We not how soon nor in what manner wise
Fere of impenitent departing
If thou should god offend think how therefore
Thou were forthwith in very Ieoperdous case
For happily thou shouldest not live an hour more
Thy sin to cleanse / thought thou had space.
Yet peradventure should thou lack the grace
Well ought we then be a ferde to done offence
Impenitent lest we departen hens
Eternal reward eternal payne
Thou see this world is but a thoroughfare
Se thou behave the wisely with thy host
Hens must thou needs depart naked bare
And after thy desert loke to what coost
Thou art conveyed at such time as thy goost
From this wretched carcass shall dysseuer
Be hit Joy or payne / endure hit thou shall for ever.
The nature and dygnite of man
Remember how god hath made the reasonable
Like unto his Image and figure
And for the suffered pains intolerable
That he for angel never would endure
Regard o man thine excellent nature
Thou that with angel art made to been eagle
For very shame be not the deuyllles thrall.
The peace of a good mind.
Why love thou so this brotle worlds Joy
Take all the mirth take all the fantasies
Take every game / take every wanton ^oye
Take every sport that men can the deuyse
And among them all on warantyse
Thou shalt no pleasure comparable find
To thynwarde gladness of a virtuous mind
The great benefyces of god.
By side that god the bought formed both
Many a benefyte hast thou received of his
Though thou have moved him often to be wroth
Yet he the kept hath and brought us up to this
And daily calls upon the to his blys
How may thou then to him vnlouynge be
That ever hath ben so loving unto the.
The painful cross of christ.
When thou in flame of the temptation fryest
Think on the very lamentable payne
Think on the pyteouse cross of woeful christ
think on his blode vet out at every vain
Think on his precious heart kerued in twain
Think how for thy redempcyon all was wrought
Let him not less that he so dere hath bought
The wytnes of martyrs example of sayntes
Sin to withstonde say not thou lakkest might
Such allegacyons folly hit is to use
The wytnes of sayntes martyrs constant fight
Shall the of slothful cowardyse accuse
God will the help if thou do not refuse
If other have stand or this: thou may left soon
Nothing impossible is that hath been done
The.xij. {pro}pertees or codicyons of a lover
To love one alone and contempne all other for yt one

To think him unhappy that is not with his love

To adourne him self for the pleasure of his love

To suffer all thing though hit were death to be with his love

To desire also to suffer shame harm for his love and to think that hurt
sweet

To be with his love ever as he may if not in dede yet in thought

To love all thing yt perteyneth unto his love

To coueite the praise of his love and not to suffer any dysprayse

To believe of his love all things excellent to desire that all folk should
think the same

To weep often with his love: in presence for Joy in absence for sorrow

To languysshe ever and ever to burn in the desire of his love.

To serve his love nothing thinking of any reward or profit.

The.xij. propertees we have at length more openly expressed in balade as hit
follows.

THe first point is to love but one alone
And for that one all other to forsake
For who so loves many loves none
The flode that is in many chanelles take
In each of them shall feeble stremes make
The love that is divided among many
Unneth suffices that any part have any
So thou that hast thy love set unto god
In thy remembrance this enprynt grave
As he in sovereign dignyte is odd
So will he in love no partynge fellows have
Love him therefore with all that he the gave
For body / soul wit / conynge / mind thought
Part will he none but either all or nought
The second properte.
Of his love lo the sight and company
To the lover so glad and pleasant is
That who so hath the grace to come thereby
He judges him in perfyte Joy and blys
And who so of that company doth miss
Live he in never so prosperous estate
He thinks him wretched and unfortunate
So should the lover of god esteem that he
which all the pleasure hath / mirth and disport
That in this world is possible to be
Yet till the time that he may ones resort
Unto that blyssed to joyful heuenly port
Where he of god may have the glorious sight
Is void of parfyte joy and delight
The third properte.
The third point of a parfyte lover is
To make him fresshe to se that all thing been
Appointed well and nothing set a mys
But all well fasshoned / propre / goodly / clean
That in his parsone there be nothing scene
In speech / apparayll / gesture / loke or pace
That may offend or mynysshe any grace
So thou that will with god get in to favour
Garnysshe thy self up in as goodly wise
As comely be as honest in behauoure
As hit is possible for the to deuyse
I mean not hereby that thou should arise
And in the glass upon thy body prowle
But with fair virtue to adourne thy ^oule
The fourth properte.
If love be strong / hot / mighty / and fervent
There may no trouble greyfe or sorrow fall
But that the lover would be well content
All to endure and think hit eke to small
Though hit were death so he might therewithal
The joyful presence of that person get
On whom he hath his heart and love I set
Thus should of god the lover be content
Any dystres or sorrow to endure
Rather then to be from god absent
And glad to dye so that he may be sure
By his departing hens for to procure
After this valey dark / the heuenly / light
And of his love the gloryouse blessed sight
The fyft properte.
Not only a lover content is in his heart
But coueyteth eke and longs to sustain
Some labour incommodite or smart
Loss aduersyte / trouble / greyfe or payne
And of his sorrow Joyful is and fain
And happy thinks him self that he may take
Some mysaduenture for his lovers sake
Thus should thou that love god also
In thine heart wysshe / coueyte and be glad
For him to suffer trouble payne and woo
For whom if thou be never so woo bestade
yet thou no shalt sustain (be not adrad)
Half the dolor gryefe and aduersyte
That he all ready suffered hath for the
The.vi. properte.
The parfyte lover longs for to be
In presence of his love both night day
And if hit happily so be fall that he
May not as he would: he will yet as he may
Ever be with his love that is to say
where his heavy nyl be brought
He will be conversant in mind and thought
Lo in like manner the lover of god should
At the lest in such wise as he may
If he may not in such wise as he would
Be present with god and conversant always
For certes who ^o list he may purvey
Though al y^ world would him therfro beryuen
To bear his body in earth his mind in heaven
The.vii. properte
There is no page or seruaunt most or lest
That doth upon his love attend wait
There is no little worm no simple best
No none so small a tryfle or conceit
Lase / gyrdell / point / or propre glove strayte
But that if to his love hit have ben ne'er
The lover hath hit precious / leyfe / dere
So every relyque Image or pycture
That doth pertain to gods magnyfycence
The lover of god should with all besy cure
Have hit in love honour and reverence
And specyally give them preemynence
which daily done his blessed body wyrche
The quyk relyques the mynystres of his church
The.viii. properte
A very lover above all erthly thing
Coueyteth and longs evermore to here
Thonoure lawed commendacyon and praysyng
And every thing that may the fame clear
Of this love / he may in no manner
Endure to here that ther^fro myghten vary
Or any thing sown in to the contrary
The lover of god should coueyte in like wise
To here his honour worship laud and praise
whose souereygne goodness none heart may copryse
whom hell / earth / and all the heaven obayse
Whose parfyte lover ought by no manner ways
To suffer the cursed words of blasphemy
Or any thing spoken of god irreverently
The.ix. properte.
A very lover believes in his mind
On whom so ever he hath his heart I bent
That in that person men may nothing find
But honourable worthy and excellent
And eke surmountynge far in his intent
All other that he hath known by sight or name
And would that every man should think the same
Of god like wise so wonderful and hye
All thing esteem judge his lover ought
So reverence worship honour magnyfye
That all the creatures in this world I wrought
In comparison should he set at nought
And glad be if he might the mean deuyse
That all the world would thynken in like wise
The.x. properte
The lover is of colour deed and pale
There will no sleep in to his even stalk
He savours neither mete / wine / nor ale
He minds not what men about him talk
But etc he drink he sit lye down or walk
He burns ever as hit were with a fire
In the fervent hete of his desire
Here should the lover of god ensample take
To have him continually in remembrance
With him in prayer and medytacyon wake
While other play / revel / singe / and dance
None erthly Joy / disport / or vain plesaunce
Sold him delyte or any thing remove
His ardent mind from god his heuynly love
The.xi. properte.
Dyuersly passyoned is the lovers heart
Now pleasant hope now dread and grievous fere
Now parfyte bliss now bitter sorrow smart
And whether his love be with him or else where
Oft from his even there falls many a tere
For very Joy / when they together be
When they be sondred: for aduersyte.
Like affeccyons feleth eke the breast
Of gods lover in prayer and meditacyon
When that his love likes in him rest
With inward gladness of pleasant cotemplacyon
Out break the teres for Igye and delectacyon
And when his love list efte to part him fro
Out break the teres again for payne woo
The.xii. properte.
A very lover will his love obey
His Joy it is and all his appetyght
To payne him self in all that ever he may
That parsone in whom he set has his delight
Dylygent to serve both day and night
For very love / without any regard
To any profit gwerdon or reward
So thou like wise that hast thine heart I set
Upwarde to god so well thy self endeuere
So studyously that nothing may the let
Not for his service any wise disseuere
Frely loke eke thou serve that thereto never
Trust of reward or profit do the bind
But only faithful heart loving mind
wageles to serve.iij. things may us move
First if the service self be desyrable
Second if they whom that we serve love
Be very good and very amiable
Thyrdely of reason be we seruysable
Without the gapynge after any more
To such as have done much for us before
Serve god for love then / not for hope of mede
What service may so desyrable be
As where all turns to thine own speed
Who is so good so lovely eke as he
Who hath all ready done so much for the
As he that first the made: and on the rode
Left the redeemed with his precious blode
A prayer of Picus Mirandula unto god
O holy god of dredefull magestee
Verily one in.iij. and three in one
Whom angles serve whose werk all creatures be
Which heaven and earth directest all alone
We the beseech good lord with woeful moan
Spare us wretches wasshe away our gilt
That we be not by thy just anger spylt
In stray^ balance of rygorous judgment
If thou should our sin pondre and wey
Who able were to bear thy punysshment
The hole engyne of all this world I say
The engyne that enduren shall for aye
With such examynacyon might not stand
Space of a moment in thine angry hand
Who is not borne in sin original
Who doth actual sin in sondry wise
But thou good lord art he that sparest all
With pyteouse mercy temperynge justice
For as thou doest rewards us deuyce
Above our meryte / so doest thou dispense
Thy punysshement far vndre our offence
More is thy mercy far then all our sin
To give them also that unworthy be
More godly is and more mercy therein
Howbehit: worthy Enough are they perdee
Be they never so unworthy: whom that he
List to accept where so ever he takes
Whom he unworthy finds worthy makes
Wherefore good lord that aye merciful art
Unto thy grace and sovereign dygnyte
We sely wretches cry with humble heart
Our sins forget and our malygnite
With piteous eyes of thy benygnyte
Friendly loke on us ones thine own
Seruautes or sinners whether hit likes the
Sinners if thou our crime behold certain
Our crime the warke of our vncorteyse mind
But if thy gifts thou behold again
Thy gifts noble wonderful and kind
Thou shalt us then the same persons find
Which are to the and have be lunge space
Servants by nature children by thy grace
But this thy goodness wryngeth us alas
For we whom grace had made thy children dere
Are made thy gylty folk by our trespace
Sin hath us gylty made this many a year
But let thy grace / thy grace that hath no pere
Of our offence surmounten all the preace
That in our sin thine honour may encreace
For though thy wisdom / though thy sovereign power
May other wise appear suffycyently
As things which thy creatures every hour
All with one voice declare and testyfye
Thy goodness: yet thy synguler mercy
Thy piteous heart thy garcyous indulgence
Nothing so clearly shows as our offence
What but our sin hath showed that mighty love:
Which able was thy dredfull magestee
To draw down in to earth fro heaven above
And crucyfye god / that we poor wretches we
Should from our fylthy sin I cleansed be
With blode and water of thine own side
That stremed from thy blyssed wounds wide
Thy love and pity thus o heuenly king
Our evil makes: matter of thy goodness
O love o pity our wealth ay prouydynge
O goodness serving thy servants in distress
O love o pity well nygh now thankles
O goodness mighty gracious and wise
And yet almost now vanquished with our vice
Grant I the pray such hete in to mine heart
That to this love of thine may be eagle
Grant me fro sathanas service to astert
With whom me rues so lunge to be thrall
Grant me good lord and creator of all
The flame to quench of all sinful desire
And in thy love set all mine heart a fire
That when the iournay of this deedly life
My sely goost hath finished and thence
Departen must: without his flesshly wife
Alone in to his lords high presence
He may the find: o well of indulgence
In thy lordeshyp not as a lord: but rather
As a very tender loving father.
Amen.
