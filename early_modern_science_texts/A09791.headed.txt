Tho. wyatis translatyon of Plutarckes book / of the Quyete of mind.

To the redder.
It shall seem harde unto the parauenture gentle redder / this traslation /
what for short manner of speech / and what for divers strange names in the
stories. As for the shortness advise it wele and it shall be the plesaunter /
when thou understand it. As for the strange names stycke not i them / for
who that can take no fruit in it / without he know clearly every tale that is
here touched / I would he shulde not rede this book.

Farewell.
To the most excellent and most vtuous princes Katheryn / queen of Englande and
of France c. encrese contynuaunce of much health and honour.
The book of Frauces Petrarch / of the remedy of ill fortune / at the
commandment of your highness / I assayd / as my power would serve me / to
make into our englyss^. And after I had made a proof of nyne or ten Dialogues /
the labour began to seem tedious / by su{per}fluous often rehersyng of one
thing. which tho {per}adventure in the latin shall be laudable / by plentuous
diuersite of the speaking of it (for I will not that my iugement shall disalowe
in any thing so aproued an auctour) yet for lack of such diuersyte in our
tong / it shulde want a great del of the grace. Although / as me seems / and as
saith this Plutarch / the plentuousnesse and fair diuersyte of lagage / shulde
not so much be desired in such things / as the fruit of the aduertysmentes
of the / which in my opinyon / this said Plutarch hath handsomely gadred
together / without tedyousnesse of length / contaynig the hole effect / of that
your hyghnes desired of Petrarch in his little book / which he wrate to one of
his friends / of the Quiet of mind / nerawhyt erryng from the purpose of the
said Petrarch. which I have made now of late i to our tong not pcisely (I
confess) without error as one shulde have done that had ben of perfect lernyng /
but after my rudeness / seking rather the profit of the sentence than the
nature of the words. but howsoever it be / if it may please your hyghnesse to
accept it / it shall not only be a defence for the symplenesse of the book /
against over busy searchers of other means act{is} / when the good will shall
have the alowance of so virtuous a iugemet / but also courage to the simple
endeavour of this hand / toward better entprises. And tho the smallness of the
present be great / in respect of that / that accords to your exellence / the
sentence parauenture shall not be much unacceptable / if it grieve not your
grace to mark it after your accustomed wisdom. Pleases tha your hyghnesse to
pardon thouerboldnesse of your most humble slave / where he presents you /
for the good luck of this new year / with this his simple labour / and with
as much quiet of mind as this book pretends / always prayeng god to send
you thonorable desire of your virtuous heart.

At Alyngton the last day of Decembre. M.D.xxvij. your most humble subject and
slave / Tho. wyat.

Of the Quiet of mind.
I received very late thy letter / wherein thou exhortes me that I shulde write
sothyng unto the of the quietness of mid and of those things / in Timeus /
that thou think needs more exquisite declaration. Trewly / where as Eros my
fred was ready to sail towards Rome and I had received hastily of Fudanus the
honest man the letters / I had not therefore leysar to apply me to that that
thou desyredest / as I would have done / nor again could I suffer the man to
be seen sent fro me with empty hands / certain chosen things I have taken
forth of the quietness of mind / out of the cometaris that sometime I made.
And (as I think) i such declaration thou seeks not the delicacy of saying /
and the piked delight of speech / and thou hast consyderatyon only of some
doctrine / to be as help for the life to be ordered. I jug it very well done
/ that where thou hast great priualte with princes / that not in come
thing{is} / that i the glori of maters of iugemet / no man is before the / yet
for all that thou dasyst not folysshly at the fawning of glory / that woders
and exaltes the / as doth Merops in the tragedy. Oftimes also thou remebrest
that thou hast herd / that sore toos are not esed with gorgeous shows / nor
the whit thlowe with a ring / nor the hedach with a crown. For to what purpose
is thuse of money for the eschewyng of the sickness of the mind / or for the
easy sure passage of life? Or where serves the use of glory / or among
courtiers apparece? Onelesse that they to whom these thing{is} chance / can
wisely use the when they have them: and again when they want the / over suffer
the desires of the. and what any other thing is that / than reason accustomed
and fore thought / to restrain quickly / not to suffer to stray the apasionate
part of the mind / wanting reason / when it breketh forth / and to suffer it
to forbear when it is ouertwharted / with assailing affections. Therefore / as
Xenophon bad men in prosperous things chefely to remebre the gods / and to
worship them than best / that when case required with bet^ hope what so ever
they need they might ask of the / thereby contented and merciful. So those
princyples that are most mete for to apese troubles / must be taken and
received before hand / only of the that are hole minded / that long before
prepared / they may be long most profytable. For like as feyrs dogs raging
at every voice / yet at one voice that they are used to and know / they apese
the self. So the wood affections of the mind / it is no little busynesse to
order and apese / Onlesse the princyples for that purpose used / be familiar
and ready at hand / that may clearly appese them / when they are troubled and
m^ued. Fardermore / they that are of opinyon not to do many things / nor
^uat^ly nor openly / for the quiet passing of life. These first of all will make
unto us / quietness of mind of a dere price / as to be bought / with
sluggardy and slouthfulnesse / and as tho he were sick / they warn every man
/ as it were with this word / lye still wretch in thy bed. Trewly where as it
is an hurtful medicin to the body that deedly sluggardy / nerawhit better
phisicien for the sickness and trouble of the mind / is sloth and
tenderness / faint heart forsaker of friends / kin / and country. Besides that
it is false / that vnac^yfe men led a quiet life / for else it must be that
the life of women were more quietous than that of men / as they that sit
watching at home / occupied i huswifely occupatios. And yet when somoch / as
the north wind can not trouble the yonge maidens / as Hesiodus saith / the
diseses of the mind / the troubles / the passion of an ill thought / by
ielousy / su{per}sticion / ambicyon / and vain glory / whereof no man can
attain the nobre / crepe nevertheless / in to the house of their occupation.
Laertes lyueng twenty years i the country (as it is said) only with an old
woman to serve him of his meat and drink / fled from his country and
princely paleys / had nevertheless sadness and frowning debate in copany. what
if that same / nothing to do / hath troubled many from the right order of the
mind? as saith Homere by Achylles / that he sat among the ships folowig his
ire / with ferme purpose / flyeng from the fight / the worthy counsayls of the
nobles and the people / and dyuertig the name of men vnactyfe / he fails in
his heart / and again straight he seeks the batails / and stereth him self i
the cruel stryffes of Mars. Therefore / when he could not suffer him self to
wyther i ydelnesse / he saith angrily / I sit like a deed lump of earth / as
the keeper of the ships. Nor yet Epycure the alower of voluptousnesse / is not
their auctor / that are outher ambitious or desirous of glory by nature / that
they shulde give the to ydelnesse / but unto the gouernauce of comynaltees / as
nature ledeth them. for men that are borne to busynesse / can not suffer with
euyn and untroubled mind to be de^ued / of that they most desired: Although like
a foal / he calls them to a common wealth / that can not hold them self from
it / and not rather the that are mete for the rule of it. Nor trewly the surety
and trouble of the mind / ought not to be measured / with multitude or scarsty
of businesses. For to overslip honest thiges / is no less displesaunt
troublous than (as we have before said) to do foul things. But the also that
have chosen one manner of life to be void fro trouble / as some do the life of
these husbadmen / some of single men / and some of king{is}. Menander warns
with these words / that they err far (as they say) out of the way. I think o
Phania that these rich men that need not to make eschange for gain / nor to
plain in the night / nor in turning them up and down / to say often alas /
sleep the sweet and soft slepes. but when he came and {per}ceyued the rich men
/ as well as the nedy to be troubled / it is no marvel / {quod} he / they are
of kin both borne at a burden / life trouble. for it is the fellow of
voluptuous life / of that brought up by need it encreseth. And trewly / as
fearful and sick folke^ out of a little boat leap in to a great ship and from
thens again in to a galy / thikyng ever to be better / till they {per}ceyue
them self nothing the ne'er / (as who saith) clean done / as they that cary the
coler and fearfulness everywhere with them / so to take another another kind
of life / can not deliver the mind from cobre and troubles / such as are
vnknowlege of things / vnconsydred adventure / nouther to know nor to can use a
right things present / for a matter that is happened. These things trouble the
rich as well as the nedy / and vexes with sadness the single men as well as
the married. And for these causes / many that think much wealth is i opyn places
/ can not suffer a secrete restful life. for these self same causes / it
repents many / of that they have begone / that with great labour have thrust
the self in to the courts of kings. It is an vnplesaut thing of sick men /
as Ion saith / for the wife troubles the / they blame the phecisyen they be
angry with the bed / ye and their friend noyeth them visytyng them / and again
departing displeases them. After that when the disese forsakes them and that
by returned tepre health comes making althyng merry and pleasant / so that he on
the ton day that could not broke an egg nor fine bred / on the next day eteth
hugerly wheti bred crosses. such effect strength is there in resonig / for to
change each purpose of lyf^ / for the happy passing of the same. Alexader when
he herd Anaxarchus argue that there were infynite worlds / it is said that he
wept / and when his friends asked him what thing had happened hi to be wept
for. Is it not to be wept for / {quod} he / syns they say there be infyn^te
worlds / we are not yet lord of one? Crates cotrarywyse / wearing an old
cloak lined with sport and laughter / as in holidays till his last. Again to
Agamemno^ it was grievous that he ruled so many / when he said / Thou shalt know
Attrides Agamenon / whom above all men Iupiter exercises and troubles with
labours. Diogines / when he was on the stone to be sold / he scoffed with the
crier that should advance the sale / and when he bad him arise / he would not /
saying at the last / what if thou should have sold a fish? And So^rates in
his bond{is} did dispute of wisdom among his pursuers. Lo on the othersyde /
Pheton clymyng in to heuin / optayning wepigly / that his father shulde take
him his chare and his horse to rule. Trewly as a show may be wrested to the
facion of a divers foot / but not the foot likewise to the facion of the
wrested show / So do the passions of the thought make each manner of life that
is offred the conformable like to the self / nor unto the that have chose the
best lyf custoe makes it not plesaut / as so say / but rather wisdo makes
the best life to be also most plesat. Therefore the well of surete of the mid /
spriging i our self / let us assay to make most pure clear / that those
thing{is} that give us foren thing{is} chauceable / we may make mete accordig /
in suffrig with great uprightness of the mind. For trewly it accords not to
be wroth again things that chance amiss. for our anger nothing {per}tayneth
to them. but he that can amend by craft ill chauces / he tre^ly doth more
laudably. Therefore Plato compares manes life with the dyse / in the which the
best cast is to be of the dyser desired most. but how soever it happen / there
should be a ware heed / that he use right that that the chance gives / whereof
it is to parceyue that the tone is not in our power / that is the chance of
the dyse / the other is / if we be wise / that we take with euyn mid / that
that chance gives / to give to each of the his place / that that which
chances well / may be most profit / and that lest hurt that happeth
ouertwhartly. But vnconnyng men / and ignorant howe to led their life like
sickly men / that can another suffer h^te nor cold / as in {pro}speryte they
are with an hye forhed outrageous / keeping no measure. so are they in aduersyte
/ with knyt bent brows foully distempred. So are they troubled of both / or
rather i both / of the self / and likewise in those that are taken for good
thing{is}. Theodorus that was called Athens / was often wont to say / ^hat he
reched words to his herers with his right hade / they toke them with their
lift hand. Foals oftentimes when fortune offreth her right hand / uncomely
turning them self / set her on their lift hand. wise men do better / that
like as bees make honey a right sweet thig / out of dry time / an herb of very
byt^ taste / so of very unhandsome things / oft times they choose out some
handsome and prefytable things to the. which thing would be much thought on /
laboured with great exercise of the mind. For as he that cast a stone at a
froward dog / when he mist the dog / and hit his step mother vnware / It is
not much amysse {quod} he. So may we mend and turn another way fortune / when
she chances otherwise than we would. Diogynes because of his exile / left his
coutre / it was not so greatly ill / for it gave him occasyon of lernyng
philosophy. Zenon of Citius that had but one ship / when he herd that it was
perished / the mariners the merchandise / and (as they say) every crom /
Fortune / {quod} he / thou doest very well with me / that drives me to mine old
cloak / and to the porch of philosophy. what therefore shall let us / that we
may not follow them? Thou art fallen from some rule or authorite / thou shalt
live i the country. Aplyeng thy private busynesse / with great compass
assayeng to advance thy self in the princes fauour^ thou art refused / thou
shalt live surely every where / with no busynesse laid unto the. Again thou
art tagled with many cares and busynesses / warm water doth not cheryssh so
much / tender members (as saith Pyndarus) as honours and glory joined with
power / doth make labour sweet / and suffrable. But some office doth trouble
the / of backbiting / of envy / or nouhhty sclaudre / the best remedy is with
the muses / or in some place of leruyng to suffer over / as it happened unto
Plato / as in a cruel tempest / when he was taken i to the favour of Deny s^
Therefore it is of no little effect / for the quietness of mind / diligently
to mark noble and famous men / if they have suffered any like thing / by those
same causes / as by example / want of children makes the sad / Loke on the
Romayn kings / of whom never a one dieng / left his reign to his child.
Pouerte / thou cannat suffer with euyn mind / who than had thou lever be of
al the Boetians / rather than Epaminodas / or of al the Romayns / than
Fabricius? But set case thy wife be not chaste / know thou not thepygram of
Agys in Delphos? Hast thou not herd how Alcibyades defiled Time a his wife /
and how she was wont to name the child that she bare / privily to her maids /
Alcibiades? yet that let not Agys / to be a very worthy and a noble man / no
more tha unchaste daughter of Stylphon did let him to live the merylyst of all
the philosophers of his time. which shame when Wetrocles laid unto him / is
it my faut or my don ^his? {quod} he / thy doughts {quod} tother / but ^hy
misfortune / howe can that be? {quod} he / are not fautes fallynges? yes {quod}
the other / and fallynges / are not they also the errors / of them that they are
the fallynges of? true {quod} tother / and what be errors? are they not the
mysfortunes of them / that they be errors of? with such a soft resonig pesable
speech he taught the vayn checkis of the dogged man / to be but trifling
^arking{is}. Lo now / there are many / whom not only the vices of their
friends and kynsfolke / doth vex / but in godd{is} name / they also of their
enmys. for scoldyng / anger / envy / follies / combrous riualytees ^ar the
foulyst spots of the that they be in. yet they trouble foals / like as the
anger of neighbours or thiportunat famyliers / or the noughty wits of
seruautes / wherewithal I think thou be oftymes incued. And as it is in
Sophocles / the phisiciens wassh away the bitter coler / with a bitter medicyn
/ so thou (not as aparteyneth the) again their diseses / and ill affections of
the mind / art angry / and answer the with like sowernesse of the mind /
whithe things that thou doest / a^ not meued with god thrifty manners / as
most metest instrumetes / but for the most {quod}^e with sharpe and froward
conditions. truly for to correct these things / when it is more than thou
can do / ^o is it not esy by any means. So that if thou cast use these
things when they grow / no another wise than these surgies use their sharpe
scrapynge instruments / than if thou use them thus / beryng always with the /
as case requires / softness and mesure / truly thou shalt no more vex thy
self / with others wantones folly / than thou shalt be gladded with the cosciens
of thine own affection. for thou shalt thike they do it not without a cause /
no more than dogs when they bark / do naughtly of their nature. or else
folowig such wekenesse and feblenesse of mind / if thou care not to be
troubled with others ylles / they shall disceyue the wrechedly / daily sucking up
many troubles / flowing unto the / as tho thou sa^est in a low bottom. what?
many philosophers have reproved pity / with which we are meued in beholding
mesurable men / thinking that it is thooffice of a good man to succour
neighbours / that be oppressed in misery / not to be sor^ therewith / or with
slack^esse of a low mind / to give place to fortune. ye / and that that every
man will say is more / they would not suffer us / if we parceyue our self to
have done amysse / or to be of naughty mind / therefore to be troubled in our
thought / to be sorry / for without sorinesse / such things should be mended /
which when it is thus / consider well / how beestly it is to suffer our self
to be any thing wrath or angry / if they that we have dealt with all do not
gentylly kyndly with us. Truly I fear me my friend / leest the love of our
self disceyue us / nor the frowardness of ill speech vexes so much the mind /
as we prefer it over much deserving of our selves / for vehemently / as it
were with dasyng / to be affectionate to certain thiges / and uncomely to desire
and follow them / or again to be against them abhor them / no marvel if
these bring stryues and offences among men / when diverse men take it diversely
/ outher these to be taken from them / or that they are fallen in to the other
/ but if any man / as chance requires / uses him self with measure to be
aplyable / which way so ever he turns him / he surely lerneth / with handsome
esynesse to haunt the copany of men. Now let us take our purpose that we
left of the self things / likewise as to them that are sick of agewes / all
things tasted / seems strait / bitter / and loathsome / till they have scene
other take the same things / without any token o^ vnplesaunt savour / which
they lothly have cast up / where at last they ley the faut in themself in the
sickness / and not in the mete or drink. So we / if we consider other that
use with great uprightness of the mind and merry chere / that that we pass
not without playntfull heuynesse / must needs leave to be so anger with the
self things. But truly for to keep constancy of mind in aduersite / it is of
great effect / not to forget with a wynkyng eye (as they say) those things that
sotyme hath happened hapely unto us / as we would have wysshed / and with due
medlyng to way the {pro}sperous things / with every ill chance. But where /
as wear wont to turn our eyes / that be dased with beholding bright thiges /
unto fresh and grene colours / for to refressh them / contrary wise / we turn
our mind to heavy thing{is} / and by force costrayne it to the remembrance of
thiges most of repentance / and we pull it away again the will of it / from
agreeable and suffrable things. And here I remebre I may bring in meetly / that
that ones was spoken to a busy fellow / medlyng in that that partayned nothing
to him / what the myschefe ungracious fellow / thou se^st other means vices
with kites eyes / thyn own thou let{is} pass / with wynkynge owls eyes? To
what purpose good man doest thou cosyder so diligently thy harms / renews
them always with busy remembrance (and hast no regard to that welfulnesse
that is present? And like as these surgen boxinges sucks out of the flessh the
worst blode / so doest thou / all the worst of thy things / gader in to thy
self / ^ra whit better than Chius the merchant / that where he sold much
wine of the best / he gadred to him self / the sower and deed wine. whose
seruaunt when he ran away from him / and one asked him for what cause he
forsook his master / answered / for because when he had good things in his
hands / he sought for il. Many like unto him forsaking sweet drinks / give
them self to sharpe bitter drikes. So did not Aristyppus len unto the heavy
balance of harm / but reched him self to the lighter. He when he had lost a
pleasaut manner / asked of one of them that showed them self most sorry and agry
for his fortune. Know thou not / {quod} he / that thou hast but one little
house / and I have yet three good fermes left me? yes {quod} tother. Than
shulde I / {quod} he / rather be sorry for thy fortune? for it is like madness
to be sorry for thing{is} lost / not reioysig in thiges that be safe. And as
little children / when one hath taken from them one tryfle among many / casting
away al the rest / they weep and cry. so likewise we troubled by fortune in
one thing coplayning and lametyng make all other things to us vnprofytable.
But one will say / what have we? ye / rather what have we not? He hath glory /
he a house / another a wife as he would wysshe / and he a faithful friend.
Antipater of Tarsis dyeng / when he rekened on his fyngers / the things that
he had had in his life / he^ forgot not the good se passage / that he had out
Cilicia to Athens. pardy / these common light things are not to be passed / and
there is cosyderacion to be had of them / that we live / that we are in health /
that we se the son / that we have no war nor rebellyon / that the ground
is erable / that the see may be sailed with little labour. ye / and for the
last / that we have lyberte to speak and to hold our tong / to be busy idol.
Truly the possession of these things / shall give unto us / a plentous matter
of quietyng the mind / if we fasten in our mind thimage of the absence and of
the desires of them / thereby warning our selfes (how health is much desired of
sick men / peace of them that are encumbered with war / how much desired unto a
streyer abroad / and unto an unnoble man is glory / and toptayne such a name
in such a cite. again how displesaunt it is / to less it when thou hast it.
And yet I think not / that any of these thiges or like should be so great / to
be desired / that when it is lost / nothig shall be safe. for it should be nowhit
more esteemed for that it leueth to be. Nor they shulde not be possessed / as so
worthy things / nor kept with such busynesse / watching busely / leest we be
spoiled of them as so precious thiges / that we shulde therefore set light / and
not regard things that we have safe / as tryfles. for these would be used /
and the fruit taken of the with gladness / most for that cause / that when
chance happens / we may suffer more pesably and temperatly / the loss of
the. But trewly / as Archesilaus said / some think it a great thing / with
diligent in tent of mind and of eyes / to behold others enditynges / pyctures
and ymag{is} / exquisitely / as they come to their hades and they not regarding
their own life / tho they that behold others chances / loke upon him that
hath many consyderations aduertysmentes / and they not vnplesaut / like these
adultrers / that loathing their own wives / follow other men / err (as the
proverb saith) all the world out of the way. For it makes much toward the
constant state of the mind. first to esteem him self / his own things / and
the particulers of one / if not / at the lest to turn thyntent from
consyderacion of courser things / ^at as the common sort of menlin divers manner
to wonder on th^ / whom fortune hath exalted to the height of things / when
she listed to sport. as by example / they that are in prison think bondmen
happy that are losed / they them that be free / they that be free think them
that have the law of cities in their hands happy / and they rich men / rich
folk prouostes governors / and they kings / and at the last kings / the
gods / whom (I had ny said) it irketh also of their godheed / outcept they
might have power of thunder and lightning / so that where they ca not be euyn
with their superiors / they can not (as they say) rest with in their bonds. I
care not for the goods of rich Gygis / {quod} Thasius / nor yet I wondre
greatly at them / nor I envy the marvelous works of the gods / nor yet gape
I greatly after any kigdome / for fer fer are these thiges fro my eyes / said
this Thasius. Lo now cotrariwyse such another as Chius / or another Galates or
Bithynus / not content that he hath gotten glory may stership among the
cytezins / but on gods name he must ask pleyningly to be a senator / when
thou hast given him that he must be provost / and set case that thou grant
him that / than must he be cosull and when at last thou hast put to that / all
is not worth a pe^s / outcept he be {pro}nounced the first. And what other
thing I pray the is this / but in gadrig causes of vnkyndnesse again fortune /
to tourment him self / and him self {per}petually to punish him self? Truly a
man well assured of his mind / tho one or other of mortal people (where as we
are six. C. times / hundred thousand seers of the son / and children of the
earth) pass him in glory of name / or habundaunce of riches / sytteth not
abject or lamentable with wringing hands (as they say) but rather where he sees
him self better hadled / tha an infynite multitude of undone men / as often as
he comes abroad / he rejoices in his fortune. In the assays of Olympias /
there was no vyctour that might refuse to meddle with who so ever came first /
having no lyberte to choose his match. In our life the state of things gives
lyberte to each man / that copareth him self his fortune / with many / with the
fortune of many / to have an hye and an upright mind / to make him thereby to
be seen and wodred at to other / rather than him self to wonder at other / so
that he be not so foolish to compare him to Briarcus or to Hercules. So when
thou marueylinge / see some great man carried in a litter / let down thyn
eyes / loke upon the berers thereof. Again when thou shalt wonder on Xerxes / as
very happy / when he passed the strait{is} of Hellespont / with a brigge shaped
of ship wood / behold also them / some their noses some their eres smitten of
and magled / by reason of the brig broken / with shaking of the furor of the
sees rage / brekyng in by Athon / and believe that they praise with great
commendation / the and thy fortune. Socrates when one of his friends told him
/ that all thing was dere in the town / for wine of Chia was at a pound / and
purple at three pound / and honey at.v. shyllynges the gallon / toke him by the
hade and led him in to the meyle house / it is sold / {quod} he / for an
halpeny the half busshell / therefore v^tell is good chepe. from thens he
brought hi i to the oil house / it is sold / {quod} he / for two brass pens
two gallons / al thing than is not dere i the town. So likewise we / if we
here any man say that our fortune is bare wretched / for that we have nouther
the consulship nor other maistershippe / we may say unto him / that our fortune
is fair and goodly / and that we go not fro door to door / and that among
porters and berers / we weary us not with burdens / nor like flatterers / are
constrained to be as parasites to princes. Although (for we are now come to that
madness / that each of our lives hangs upon other men's / more than our own /
and that our nature is so altered / in to a certain unkind and enuyous
affectyon / not so much to glad i our own / as to be troubled with other
folks welthes) if thou loke not only upon those wonders / and famous things
in them / whom thou wenest very blessed / (as they say) in Iouis lap / but the
curte the fair travers drawn / letting pass their glory and utter apparece /
if as well thou loke with in them / thou shalt truly find many inward{is} /
sower troblous. Pyttacus / whom the sure fame noyseth to have ben endowed with
wisdom / fortitude / and justice / when he was cheriggest{is} that he had / it
is said his wife cae and angrily overthrew the table / wherewith when he saw
his gestes abashed each of you / {quod} he / is troubled with some ill / I am
in this state always very well. This man that was deemed abroad to be very happy
/ when so ever he entered his threshold / he seemed to be a wretch / I say not
that he was one / where his wyf had all and ruled pricely / where oftimes always
he needed to fight with her. Many things do trouble you / no^hyng doth trouble
me. Many such like things do cleue unto glory / unto riches / ye and unto a
kingdom. but truly of the ignorant multitude un{per}ceyued / for the pope is
drawn / behind the which those thiges lye hid. Happy Attrides glory of
greeks / eueriwhere mild fortune the favours / while she exalts her
child. This vtward blyssednesse to be compased with wepyns / horse / and arms
/ let us here likewise / the repentyng voice of an ill troubled mind / cryeng
against such excess of glory. Mighty Iupiter hath tagled me with grievous
chauces / i another place. O happy blessed that far out of danger / unnoble /
and vnglorious / have ^assed their lives. By these and such like declaracions /
it may be sesably parceyned / the playntfull unquietness of the mid /
scoldyng with fortune and casting away it self with wo^dring at other / to rise
for top ^sse it self / and the own things. For of troth it breketh
marvelously the constant quiet state of the mind / with hyer intent to strive
above the power to get any thing as to sail with gretter sails than
proporcion / as when hope shines never so little / {pro}mysing folisshly unto
our selfes vnmesurable and great things / than when chance follows not / we
accuse wicked fortune and our destiny / when rather we shulde dam our selfes of
folly / as it were to be angry with fortune / that thou ca^st not shot an arowe
with a plou / or hut an hare with an ox / and that some cruel god shulde be
against them / that with vayn endeavour / hunt an hart with a drag net / and
not that they attempt to do those impossibilytes / by their own madness and
folysshnesse. Surely the cause of this error / is the noughti love of our
self. For men / ouermoch deseruig of them self / where as with great strife
they allow them self best / enhanced with pride / leave nothing vnassayd. For
it is not enough unto them to be rich eloquent / and among merry gladsome
festes. but that they must be famyliers of princes and in auctorite / but that
they must have the best horse the best dog{is} and (if god will) the best
cockerels and quayles / or else they can not be quiet in theie mind. Denys
thelder thought it not enough to be the grettest tyrant in his time / but
yuell content also / that he was not so good as the poet Phyloxenus in poetry
/ and as Plato in the c^ft of resonyng / meued with ire / him he put in to a
dogion / and tother he sold / and banished in to Aeginas. So did not
Alexandre / that where he was greatly meued with Brison / with whom he stro^e
in swyftnesse of the chart / with deliberation ^emed pleasant / forberyng his
own right. Therefore Homere spake it very well by Achylles / such a one as was
no among the greeks in battle / and after he saith / but there were other that
were more eloquent. Megabysus of Per^a on a time when he came in to Appelles
shop / he began to babble I wot not what of the craft of painting. Appelles that
could not suffer his folyes / before / {quod} he / that thou shewedest thy self
with thy words / I had a good opinyon in the / by reason of thy gold purple /
auaucy^g thy silence / now the pretises and boys that grind me my colours /
do mock thy babbling. There is that thy^ke that the Stoyik philosophers do
mock us / i discribyng a wise man af^ their facion / not only to be wise /
just / and strong / but also an orator / an emperor / a poet / ye^ a king.
and they are not ashamed to ascribe all these names unto him / although if they
{per}ceyu^ them self in dispeyre of the / they are always il content / which how
it accords with reason / they may se when that they know the gods contented
/ each with his godheed to be satisfied / as to be called Enyalius / that hath
auctorite over the furor of bataylc / another Mantous / that is over
{pro}phecies. ano^her Cerdous / that is ruler of lucre. So that in Homere /
Iupiter forbyddeth to Uenus werly maters / as nothing {per}teynyng to her /
byddeth her to take heed to marriage maters. Besides this / somthynges of the
that seem to us to be desired / accorde not togider of their own nature / as
by example. He that desires the study of saying of lernyng / he must be quiet
and without busynesse / again auctorites and familyarite with prices^ are wont
to make busynesses / to bring often cobraunces. Pletous use of wine and flessh
/ makes a man strong mighty / and the mind frayler and weker. Again /
vnmesurable diligence to encrese / or busy trouble for to keep / agrees for
the gadring of riches. A the other side / contempt dispisyng / is a great
instrument for the beginning of philosophy / and almost the first and chefyst
exercise of it. So al things is not for every man / but he that will obey the
poesy of Appollo / must first know him self / and so take advise of his own
nature / as she ledeth to take an order of life / rather than passing from one
to another / to force constrayn his nature. An horse for the cart / an ox is
mete for the plow / after a ship that sails / a dolphin is mete to swym /
and to hunt the bore a ^cirse dog. So that if one be troubled / for that a
mighty lyon may not be norisshed i a womans lap / as well as a little whelp /
surely he is a great foal. And he is ne^awhit wiser / that will write of the
world seek the nature of things / both after Empedoclis facion or Platos / or
Democritus togider / or to lye with a rich old woman / as Euphorion / and to be
like those that were wont to baket late with Alexadre / as Medius / and think
it uncomely and scant to be suffered / outcept he may by riches be as notable as
Ismenia / by virtue / as noble as Epaminoda. Ronners when they have their game
/ are content that wrestlers have their reward / if thou have gotton / saith
Solon / the town of Sparta / order it with laws decrees. we will not change
with you / saith the sae man / vtue for riches / syns the one is our own stable /
riches is but chaunceable / passes fro one to another. Strato when he herd
that Menedemus had more scolers than he. Lo / {quod} he / is it not to be
marveled / if many had rather be washed than perfumed? Aristotle writing to
Antipater / it is mete saith he / to be as glorious for Alexander / and to be
consydred / not only to reign over many people / but also to have beside
other / a right opinyon of godly thing{is} / so that they that under this manner
/ call their glad things glorious / and not so little to be esteemed / they with
out dout shall not be troubled / with wondering at strange things. yet now
when none of us sees a vine bear figs / nor an olyue bear grapes / we
brawl with our self nevertheless / and with vngentyll gredynesse oppress
our selfes / are so weary of our selfes / outcept we may attain to the highest
degre / both of richmen and of learned men / both at home in the w^rres / both
of philosophers and of warryers / ye and both of flaterers of them that by
trusty and free playnesse / are known to be true / and at last / both of
nygard{is} wasters. Although that we se nature to tech us marueylusly. For as it
is scene by nature divers beestes to feed for their lyueg dyuersly / nor that
she would that all should be norisshed with s^edes or with flesh / or with
rotes / but as they are divers to ete divers meates / so hath the same nature
given to mankynde divers orders of lyueng / as pasturyng / plowyng / foulyng /
and fysshig. we must therefore each of us choose that / that we know is most
metest for us / and with all our endeuoir give us to that / to part from the
possession of that that we parceyue parteyneth to another / or else it is to
no purpose that Hesiodus said. The potter envies the potter / and over the
smythes craft his fellow is envious. Truly now men are not led with envy of
the craft or order of their fellows / but rich men with envy of learned men /
nobles of rich men / men of law / of deceyuers / and of players and of
tomblers / and at the last / free and noble men of ancient famyles dasyng for
wonder at the good fortunes of men of bondage in the courts of kings / while
they thike that all their own fortunes are to be loathed / they trouble them
self / with no little cure of mind kill them self. Surely that every man hath
cof^rs receytes / and as who saith springes / of surety trouble in his own
thought / and Homers tonnes of good ill / not as he said i Iouis door / but
with in his own mind / the dyuersite of men proves greatly / whom we se by
affections of the my^de to be diversely tempered. for foals let good things pass
tho they be present / and regard them not when they perisshe / so much doth
their thoughts gape gredily after things to come. Cotrariwyse / men of wit
with sharpe remembrance / reducyng them self to things that be present / make
those thiges that yet are not / to be at hand. For that that is at hand and
present / offering it self to be taken i on only instant / after that
unremembered / seems unto foals another to be ours / nor to partein to us. and
as the roper that is painted in Plutos house / as much as he did wreth out of
his basket in to his rope / he suffered folisshly an ass that stood by him to
ete / no notherwyse doth the unkind slothful forgettinge of many / setting
aside the comodites of thiges past / the worthy do^ deeds / the noble acts /
the pleasant ydelnesse / the merry and gladsome copany / forgetting and scrapyng
out all the delyte of the life / suffers not their life to be all one facyoned
and weued together ^ with the things past the things present / deuyding
yesterdays lif from that of to day / that from that of to morrow / althyng do^
they make vndo^ / with the weryng out of their remembrance. Truly they that i
the scoles of philosophers toke away encresynges of bodies / as vanisshing
substance by wast / they only in their words made each of us / another another
than our selves. But they that contayn not things passed / as tho memory
failed / nor again remebreth them / they do not now in words / but in very
dede / make them self daily more nedy more void / gaping always on to morrow
/ as tho things of last year / of late / of yesterday / {per}teyned nothig to
the / as tho they had never chased unto the. So that the constant state of the
mind / by this manner is troubled. And euyn as flies slyp of when they crepe upon
smooth glasses / in rough rugged places they cleue esely / so men sliding fro
gladsome and pleasant things / hold fast the remebrauce of heavy things. And
like as at Olinthus / there is a place they say / where in these horned flies be
taken / and when they be i / they can not get out again / but a great while
flyeng up and down with in / making many circles in vain / they dye at last.
so men enwrapped in the remembrauce of ylles / can never after get forth nor
get succour. Therefore as painters are wont in tables to underlay dim colours to
the eyes / and to en^lyne and draw fair and bright colours upon the so shulde
men in their own minds / all heavy and dark chauces / ouercouer and
overthrow with glorious fair chauces / worthy to be remembered. for thiges
past can not clearly be fordone / nor be again afterward / by man only. For
so variable / divers and reboudable / is the tune of this world / as of an
harp / nor in mortal things / is there any thing that is pure / clear /
simple. But as musyke stands by hye and lowe sounds / and gramer by letters
/ vowels mutes / and that he is not a musycien or a gramarien / whom eitherlyke
of these doth offend / but he that can use them temper the most accordingly /
no notherwise it seems / that he wisely hath stablished his life / that most
divers chances contrary among the self / hath learned to migle handsomely /
wayeng prosperite with aduersite. for clearly to set apart / good or ill /
mortal comodite will not suffer / but it behooves to make a temper with both /
if we will determyn right of these things. It is not therefore according / in
the tone of these to plain / fainting in the mind / to fall down as it were
under to heavy a burden / but the power and thipression of every worst chance /
to repulse with the remebrauce of better thiges / always wrappig up
discomodites in comodites / as it were in a napkyn / to make the tenor of the
hole life / made gadered with prosperites aduersytes / as a certain accorde /
tepred with conning reason. And truly / not as Menander thought / a man hath as
soon as he is borne / a good spirit / as beginner of his life techer of right
lyueng / but rather as Empedocles thought / two spyrites of diverse condition /
to who he gives divers many names doth receive us as soon as we coo i to the
light / fro thensforth given unto the / as it were almost by right of service.
He said that our generation did receive the seed{is} of al these affections /
that therefore the draught of our life was not euyn and level / but rather
brackish sower / therefore the wise man should have the best thiges in his desire
/ loke for the worst / in the temper of the both use of neither {per}te to
much. Nor yet shall he coo plesantly to to morrow / as Epicurus saith / that
with great debating doubts whyder he shall live to it / but riches / glory /
power / authorite / gladeth rejoices such men most / that with contrary thiges
a totherside / if case hap / can be as god as upright. For truly vehement
appetit of any thig / hath always fere his fellow of lesig it / that dulls the
gladness / makes it more to be desired / as when flame is resisted with great wind.
who truly reason hath taught assuredly vnferfully thus to say to fortun / if
thou give it I shall be rizt glad / if thou take it again / I shall be indifferent.
this ma that can thus use hi self / without marvel / must ned{is} use thiges
that happen plesantly / and not be pulled from thens with fear of that loss
rennynge in the thought. Anaxagoras when he herd that his son was deed / I
knew {quod} he / when I begot hi that he should dye / I have suffered over that
awaytig. this affection of Anaxagoras / is asmoch to be followed of us / as
wodred at. Surely we may stay forthwt each misfortun / I knew I had slypy riches
/ not nailed with six penny nayl / as they say in my possession / and that I
had them / but to use the. I knew well enough that they that gave me power /
might also take it from me. I knew that my wife was wise / but that she was
also a woman ^ and for the last I knew that my friend was a man / that is to
say / a lively thing ready of nature to be depraved / as Plato oft said. Truly
he that compares thus the reasos of his affections / byldeth him such rapers
of reason / if ought happen other wise than he wold / or ouerthwartly / yet is
it not to him sudden / and where as he never admits those come thiges^ I
would never have went it / I was i great hope / I never thought it wold be thus
/ there truly doth he fordo the vneuynnesse of a stertynge or glytteriug heart
/ of one that was troubled and meued / he makes forthwith to him self / one
pesable and constant. Carneades was wont to warn men most in prosperite of
aduersite / for that every sudden thiges nature is to be received all with
grutchynge of the mind / as a manner melting. How great apart is now Macedony
/ of the romayn Empire? yet Perses when he lost it / not only accused fortune
with foul complaints / but seemed also to divers / most unfortunate wretched of
all men. Loke on the other side / Emilius when he had overcome him / parting from
the country / gyueng place in the lordship of the see and of the land to the
right successor / was received with the garlands / and reioysynges of all men
/ and in the sacrifice extolled unto heue with praises / and not undeserved /
but most deserved. For he remembered him self to have gotten a chaunceable
kingdom / the to thereby vnwened and vnforthought chance was put frome the
height of his kingdom. Me thiketh Homer teaches with a proper example / how
much more hurtful those things are that stryke suddenly. Uli^es at his return
home / wept at the sudden death of his dog / and not to his wife that sat by
him and wept. for in coming / consydringe the weeping image of his wife / he
had subdued the affection that else now would have broken out / and by former
shittyng of the mid / had reduced it in to his own power / and was troubled
with the vnforethought death of the dog / for that in the sodeyn thing he had
no space / to let the power of his affection. to conclude shortly / things that
chance against our minds / are scant herdly suffered / partly by nature / and
partly we se they are grievous / by corrupt custom and naughty opinion / and
they be the most part. it is of great effect against the / to have at hade this
sentence of Menader. Thou hast suffered no great grefe / onles thou make it so thy
self / for what touches it the / if it another streyne thy flessh / nor reche
to thy soul / as by example / thunnoblenesse of thy father / the adultry of
thy moder / the dignite of the first place taken from the / the reward of thy
victory bereft the / what {per}teyn these things to the? for truly tho these
thiges happen / it should not let the in thy body nor in thy mind to be well /
ye right well. Against these thing{is} that by nature doth sothing offend / as
siknesses / hurt{is} / dethis of kinsfolk / this must be set. alas / wherefore
alas? for we have suffered nothig / that {per}teyneth not to man to suffer. For
there is no speech that sooner rebukes thaffectionate {per}te of the mind /
when it is drawn ouertwhartly with affections / when it snatches the bites of
reason i the teeth / tha that that warns us of our come natural necessites /
unto which necessite man is borue / entangled as the body grows / which
shall give unto stryuing fortune / a knot / sure of all other things / that are
most chief grettest. They say Demetrius when he sacked the town of Megaresis^
asked of Stylpo if any of his go^des was taken fro him? to whom he answered. I
saw no body take away mine / for where as fortune hath suffered / all her thiges
to be taken fro her / yet have we no such thiges i us / as another the grek{is}
ca do nor suffer. it is not therefore mete so much to forsak nature / as having
no strength nor sufferauce / to match fortunes violence. where as we know
rightwell / that that / that i man may be hurt with fortune / is but a little /
and the worst part of us frail overthrown with every impression / by deynte
tenderness / and that we our self have the power over the better parts /
wherein be set those grettest good things / as in an vnslypper place / and
where also true glory / leruiges / studys {per}taynig to vtue have their beig /
another mortal nor byreueable by no strength. thus I say / knowig our selfes of
vnuyncible mid / for trustig to our self{is} / it becomes us to be assured
again thiges to come / to say that to fortune / that Socrates faynig did say
by Auitus Melitus his accusers / truly {quod} he / to the jug{is} Auytus and
Melitus may slay me / but to do me hurt or displeasure / they can not. for tho
fortune might overthrow him with divers sicknesses / take fro him his riches or
accuse him to a tyrant / or to the people / yet might she not truly make him
ill / or faint herted / or fearful / or altered of his mind / or else make him
malicyous / but only a good man / endued with manlynesse and courage of the
mind / at a word she might not bereave him the right order of the mind /
which truly profits more to man / for the ledyng of the life / than the
craft of sailing / for to pass the sees. For the mariner be he never so coning
/ can not by any means redress the fury of the water / nor repulse the assaut
of the feirce wind / no more than get a haven where he would / when so ever he
would return from the see. No / nor this comes not to him by craft that when
he is taken with tempest / constantly and vnferfully to handle the necessite /
herto it helph not / that whilst he dispayreth not / for place for his craft /
taking i the sail / drives as he may with the tempest / the coward now sits
down with wriging hades from all this ge^e / while the mast is drowned with
force of wind / he shakes with trebling fere. but in a wise man / an ordered
mid with the body brigeth fair whether / that is to say with contynence / and
tempre of fode and labour / wiping away the causes of sickness / and if there
be any outward cause of trouble / in the which a mans mind is ron / as i the
roky fla^tes / with quick pulling up the sail yard (as Asclepiades saith)
it passes over. And if so be it en^rese and grow more than can be socourd or
suffered by man / the haven is not fer of / and there rests to the to swym out
of the body / as out of the ship boot / when it will hold no more. Truly
foals / not so much for the desire of life / as for the fear of death /
hangig on the body cleue fast with clasping hades / no notherwise than Ulixes
did hag on the wild fig tree / when he feared the russhing of the horelpole
Caribdis / whom Homer saith / was so ne'er taken in the see of Sycill / that he
could another stop by reason of the wind that shoved him / nor yet get out /
so did that let him / and as tho he held the wolf by the eres / as the
proverb saith / could another hold the ire / for werynesse discomodite of the
chance / nor let it go for fere of the dredfull pyll. But if any maneuer so
little cosyder / the nature of our soul / and doth reckon with him self / the
passage from the state of this life to be to a better / or at the lest to no
worse / by death truly he hath already / no little forderaunce for his journey /
that is to say / the contempt of death. For who that / what with valiant
virtue / which is the properte and peculyarite of man / and what with ordrig
assuredly the mind / against for rain and strange things / which coo
beside nature / mightily to overthrow our proper things / may live so
plesatly / that he may say / I may go / I may go my way surely at the first tym
/ with the good leave of god / when I will / when I pray the / other grievous or
cobrous / or troublous thing can happen unto him? Of troth / what soever he is
that saith this word / I have prevented the / o fortune / and all thy entres
were they never so streyte I have stopte / this man not with berres / nor nails
/ nor byldinges hath coraged and stregthed him self / but rather with decrees
of philosophy / and rules of wisemen / which also be open so ready for every ma
/ that they need but only the taking. Nor we may not take away believe in those
things / that have ben left to our remembrance of our elders / nor dispeyre
in nothing of the / as tho they were not possible to be folowd / but as it is
mete to loke upon them / and to marvel much of them / as it were by grace
wondringe of them / so must we make our selfes / by confyrmynge us to their
following lyklihodes of them / that by beginnings set in small things / as
saying gretter and gretter / we may profit to the highest. But we must
diligently loke / that we put not the thoughts of these things out of our
mind / nor that we let to turn oft these things in our thought / and (as
they say) to think on them with all our heart. Nor this busynesse ends no
great labour (for as a certain swetnesse of the mind / noyeth us and hath
taught us with slothful and vnexercised tenderness / and hauntynge most prone
things of lest busynesse / by an naughty favour hath taught it self / out of
vndelightsome things / to turn it self to each pleasant thing / so lykwise if
any man use to fain in his mind / the images of sickness / of labour / of
exile / to gader unto him the stregthes of his reason / to discus diligently
each by him self. this man / this / s^all without fail se that those things
/ for the most part / are vayn and dispi^able / that seem heavy / ferefull / and
horrible / and to say troth / threten more with their loke / than they do in
the departing But many abhor that word of Menander / that any man a live may
not glory / in ^ayeng / this I will not suffer. for that they know not what
it aueyleth for to avoid heuines / to think and to use to behold fortune /
with unagreeable and f^irs eyes / and not to le^e to tender thoughts / and
trifling delytes / and norisshmentes of esy life / rising at every little hope
/ and falling at every little thing. Although it may be thus answered to Menander.
It can no wyse^e said / why^e I live this I will not suffer / let it be so /
but this I may say while I live / this I will not do / I will not lye / I will
use no crafty deceits for to compass men / I will not beguile / I will not
disceitfully lye in an ayte. this syns it is in us / it is a great help to the
that lift them self up to the surety of mind / in which manner like as
botches be in the body / so is a naughty consciece in the soul / as that that
leueth repentance / busely pricking and pulling the mid. For where all other
heuinesses are wont to be taken away by reason / only this repentance it self
provokes by shame / as one that byte^h and gnaws him self. And truly / as
they that shake of a cold ague / or burn of an hot ague / are more sharply and
fervently vexed tha they that suffer the same things / of vtwarde cold or
hete. so casual and chauceable things / have more blunter heuynesses / as
outward and forayn thiges. And this thing / no body is to blame for me but my
self / which is wont to be plainynly cried / when an offence is done / makes
the hurt tha^ (...) grievous of it self / more grievous / and drives it in
de{per}. So nouther gorgiousnesse of building / nor weight of gold / nor
nobleness of kin / nor greatness of empire / nor eloquece fair speaking /
brinketh so much clerenesse of life / and so pleasant quietness / as brings a
mind discovered from trouble of busynesse / lyueng (as they say) with him self
far from ill advise. which having the well of life (I mean ^yt conditions /
from which commendable deeds do sprig) clear and untroubled / shall bring forth
all his ded{is} / merry upright as it were with an heuenly grace / by the
remembrauce whereof / he is feed with a more certain / than Pyndarus hope /
norishmet (as he saith) of old age. And as Carneades was wont to say / the
sweet fyrres tho they be cut or pulled up by the rotes / they keep a sweet
savour a loge while / truly in the mind of a wise man / honest deeds do ever
leave a certain fresshe and pleasant remembrance. with the which remembrance
that same inward gladness springs by a cotynuall river / as who saith
bering fruit / to the great shame of their error / that so lametably blame
this life / saying it is a cogregation of ylles / and a certain resort of
outlaws / in to the which only the souls that be banished from above be
put. I reken that word of Diogines worthy remembrance / which he said / when
he saw a strauger in Lacedemona / curiously pyking him self again a holiday.
what {quod} he / is not every day holiday with a good man? yes and if we be
wise most gladsom holiday. For this world is a certain most holy temple /
most mete for god / in to this temple man is admytted when he is borne / not to
be hold karuyn images wanting senses / but the son / the moan / the sterres /
from which comes moving / the first principles of life / which providence
hath given unto us to behold / that they shulde be sensyble images and
folowynges of intelligible things / as Plato saith. be sides these / the
flodes that bring forth always new waters / and the earth producing fode /
both unto trees unto all kind of bestes. with this goodlynesse prospect
beginning truly our life / it must be full of surety and of overspread
gladsonesse / nor (...) are not to be looked for of us / Saturn^ festes / or
Bacchus festes / or Myneruas festes / as many do that receive these and such
other festes with great awaytige / gladsomnesse and sporte / in which they may
more liberally / glad them self with bought laughter gyueng wages unto
minstrels and tomblers for their mind sake. And what is more vncomly / than
that in such plays we sit with such pertynax s^ylence doyn^ nothing else (as
they say) (for there is no ma that lameteth or wepeth / when he seith Pythia
begin / no more than he is hugry after the feest) and those goodlynesses whereof
god him self is auctor unto us / and in manner player / with lametyng and
sowernesse of mind / ledyng a dolorous life / we defile and make soro^full.
And yet most vnsely is this / when we delyte in orgaynes played and sounded /
and in little birds songs / and behold gladly the be{is} playng and
dausyng / and again are offended with their froward noise and their cruel
looks / yet nevertheless saying our own lives sad and heavy / frowning /
overthrown with most troublous affections and tangled busynesse^ ^nd cures /
and driven with vntempe^esse / that not only we can not get us some lyberte
and space to take our brethe / but another here also other exhorting us to it.
To whose warnynges with clear and opyn cares / if we would give heed / we
shulde use thiges present as they come without any blame / and shulde rest with
the pleasant remembrance of things past / and at the last we shulde draw
toward things to come / vnferefully and assuredly / with sure and glad some
shining hope.

The end.
