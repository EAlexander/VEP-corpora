1528.

To the right excellent and honourable lord Iohu Earl of Oxforde / and high
chamberlain of Englande Thomas Paynell gretynge.
REdynge of old authors and stories my most honourable lord / I find / that
me in time past were of lodger life / and of more propsperous helthe / than they
are now adays. Which thing as hit grieved me / so in manner hit enforced me /
to seek the cause of this sudden and strange alteration. For why / it is
written / Gen. v.
yt Adam lived.9^0. year. The Sibyls of Cumane lived.iii C. wynters:
Nestor.iii.C. wynters: Arganton / king of Tartesses.iii.C. years: and Galen
that famous doctor.C. and.xl. years: but now adays (alas) if a man may approach
to.xl. or.lx years / me repute him happy and fortunate. But yet howe many come
thereto? To search give ye very true reason hereof passes my small capacite:
without I may say hit be / because we fulfil not the commandementes of
almighty god: which to well willing {per}sons are very light / and of no
burden. For our lord saith: My yocke is sweet / Mat. x^. Psal. 127
and my burden light to be borne. Saith not the prophet Dauid: that who so
fears god / and walk in his ways and preceptis / shall se his childers
children? And Salomon saith: O my children / Prouer. 3.
forget not my precepts laws: for they shall keep you {pro}loge your days
years. And I will (saith our lord god by Dauid) lengthen his days. Psal. 90.
Than may not this be a reasonable cause of this our so short and wretched
life? Truly I suppose hit be by our myslyuynge and fylthy sin? which
being so abominable and so horrible / Cap. quia infirmitas de peni et remis.
is at sometime the very cause of corporal infirmite / and of short life. Said
not our lord / the physician of all physicians / to the sick man: Now I have
healed the / depart thou from hens: and loke thou syn no more / Ioan. 5.
lest a worse harm hap upon the? Or whether shall I say / yt hit chances by
our mys diet? and to much surfettynge? Truly the proverb saith / that there
dye many mo by surfeit / than by the sword. Ecclesiastici. 37.
According where ye wise ma saith: Surfeit sleeth many a one: and temperance
prolongs the life. Surfeit and diuersites of meates and drynkes / letting and
corrupting the digestio febleth man / and very oft causes this shortness of
life. Plin. li. 7
What other thing but mys diet caused Ptolomeus Philadelphus to be so
miserably peynfully vexed with the gout: and so (as hit is written) that
nothing could relesse his peyne / saving death? What caused Antipater / that
noble man Mecenas / to be continually vexed with the fever but ill dite? What
other thing infected Aristarcus with the dropsy / but i'll diet? Ill diet (as
me thinks) is chiefcause of all dangerous and intolerable diseases: and of
the shortenes of mans life. Than hit must needs follow / that a teperate and a
moderate diet / prolongs mans life: and saves him from all such peynfull
diseases. And therefore Asclepiades that noble phisicia / v. necessa^ things in
regiment of helthe.
professed There are.v. necessary things to conserve and prolong mans
prosperite and helthe: that is abstinence from meat / abstinence from wine /
rubbing of the body / exercise / and digestio. O howe wholesome is hit than to
use good diet / to live temperatly / to eschew excess of meatis and drinks?
Salerne.
Yea howe greatly are we English men bound to the masters of the vnyuersite
of Salerne (Salerne is in the realm of Naples) which vouchsafed in our
behalf to compile thus necessari / and thus wholesome a book? But what avails
hit / to have gold or abundance of riches / if one can not use hit? What
helps costly medicines / if one receive them not? So what profits us a
book / be hit never so expedient and frutefull / if we understand hit not?
Wherefore I / consydryng the fruit yt might come of this book / if hit were
translated in to the english tongue (for why / every ma understands not the
latin) I thought hit very expedient at some times / for the welthe of vnlerned
{per}sons to busy my self there in: For learned {per}sons / and such as have
great experience / need no instructions to diet them self / nor to conserve
their helthe. Yet if such other wise and discrete parsones / as is your
lordeshippe / by chance rede this book: they may {per}adventure find that shall
please them: and that besides their own diet and custom of living / shall
be for their corporal welfare and good helthe. I will not / nor it becomes me
not / to exhort your lordship / with let of other your great busynesses / to
rede this my power traslacion: but if per chance at your leisure ye rede hit /
I humbly desire and pray your good lordeshyppe to rede hit with forgyuenes /
and to accept the same as hit is worthy.

Regimen sanitatis.
Anglorum regi scripsit schola tota salerni.
Si vis incolumem / si vis te reddere sanum
Curas toll graves. Irasci cred prophanum.
Parce mero. cenato parum. non sit tibi vanum
Surgere post epulas. somnum fuge meridianum.
Non mictum retine. non comprime fortiter anum.
Hec been si serves / tu longo tempore viues.

THis little book was compiled at the instance for the use of the most noble
and victorious king of Englande / and of Frace / by the doctors and
physicians of the university of Salerne / to conserve and keep mans body in
good helthe and prosperite. The auctor in the beginning of this book
teaches.viij. general doctrines / which here after be specified and also
declared. The first doctrine is to eschew avoid (if we desire corporal
helthe) great charges / thought and care. For thought dries up mans boby /
hurtynge and leaving the spiritis in desolation and comfortless: which so
left / and full of of heuines dries up the bones. In this doctrine be
comprehended melancolynes and heuines / which greatly hurt the body: for by
their operation the body waxes len and cold / the hat shrynkethe up / the
wit and understanding comes dull / the reason troubled / the memory
utterly marred. Yet nevertheless / it is very expedient for fat and corsye
folk to be some time pensyue and heavy / that there by they may moderate the
rank heate of their spiritis / and make their bodies leaner and more sklender.
The second doctrine is / to eschew anger. For anger in like manner dries up
the body / and excessively chaffeth inflames the members. And to great heate
(as writethe Auicen in the first did. and first chap. of the.iij. doctrine)
dries up mans body. Secondly anger hurtethe by the heate and inflammation of
mans heart / and lettethe also the operations of reason. Some there be that
naturally / or by sickness / or chance of poison / are cold: for such folk
to be angry is very necessary for their bodily helthe / that their natural
hete by such means may be stered up / gotten / and kept. The third doctrine
is to eat and drink soberly: for eating drynkyge excessively causes us to
be vnlusty / drowsy / slothful / hurtynge infeblynge the stomach. Many other
inconuenientises (as saith Auicen in the chap. of wine and water) grows and
chances through excess of meates and drynkes / as here after shall be
declared. The.iiij. doctrine is / to make a light supper. For to much meat
take at night causes and engenders gnawynge and payne in the bealye /
vnquietnes / let of natural rest / and other grefes / which we feel and se by
experience: the which here after shall be more playnlye declaredde. The.v.
doctrine is to walk after meat. For thereby the meat discedeth to the bottum
of the stomach / where (as Auicen saith) restethe the virtue of digestion. For
the mouth of the stomach desires food / and makes digestio. The.vj.
doctrine is to eschew sleep incotinent after meat / which causes helthe and
avoids diverse infirmities / as hit is after showed in these verses: Febris /
pigrities c. The.vij. doctrine is to make water as oft as nedethe: For who
that kepeth or holdethe his water longer than nature requirethe / shall avoid
it with great peyne: and so hit may chance that death shall follow / as Auicen
saith in his.xix. did. li.iij. and chaptre of the difficult of making of
water. Also to keep the dregs and superfluite of mans food longer tha nature
requires / engenders many incouenientises in the body. For the liver and
veins called meseraikes / dry up (for the most part) the humours of the
foresaid superfluite / and so made hard / can not be avoided: and thus causes
opilations in the guttis and ventosites / and (so it may chance) impostumes: as
after shall be showed. The.viij. doctrine is / that one doing his easement and
avoiding ordeurs and filth of the body / should not much enforce and constrain
his fundement: for so doing the emerardes fistule shall grieve him / and the
fundemet many times is mysordred and thrust out of his propre natural place.
Finally thauctor says / that who so will observe the forsayde doctrines /
shall live lunge in good helthe and prosperite.

Si tibi defitiunt medici / medici tibi fiant
Hec tria. men's leta / requies / moderata dieta.
Here thauctor gyuethe.iij. general remedies to conserve in health al creatures
/ and specially noble men. The first is to live joyfully: for joy and mirth
causes man to be yonge and lusty. By moderate joy and mirth youth is
conserved / natural virtue comforted / the wit sharped / thereby man is more
prompt / quick / and of abilite to do all good and honest operation. Nor it is
not said without a cause that our joy and mirth must be moderate. For when
it is without measure / it engenders death both bodily and goostlye. This
moderate joy is most convenient for them that have much care and trouble.
Which joy may begot by the use of delicate meates and drynkes / by auoidynge
of such things as ingendre melancholy. And also (as Auicen saith in his.xj.
book chap. of faylynge of mans heart) by dwelling and accompanyng among our
friends. The.ij. remedy is traquillite of mind / of vnderstadyng / and of
thought. For noble men through their great busynes and charges / are much
more grieved troubled tha other mean persons. Great care of mind and
understanding distroyeth the natural rest of man / most expedient for noble me
/ which most commonly are naturally dry and colerike: for whom rest is right
profitable and convenient. The.iij. remedy is moderate diet / that is to eat
and drink moderately. And after shall be declared what inconveniences grow
through excess of meates and drynkes.

Lumina mane manus surgens gelida lauet vnda.
Hac illac modicum pergat. modicum sua membra
Extendat. crinem pectat. dentes fricet. ista
Confortant cetebrum / confortant cetera membra.
Lote cale / sta / pasce / vel infrigisce minute.
Here are declared.vj. doctrines / which conforte mans brain the other
members of the body. The first is when we rise in the morning yearly to wasshe
our eyes with clear cold water. The eyes would be washed to clese away the
ordure and fylthynes that hang in the bries of them. And Auicen says in
the.xiij. did. of his.iij. book / and chap. of conseruacion of the eyes / that
the souerast thing to mundifie and cleanse / and to make sharpe of sight the
eyes / is to open them / for the eyes.
and so to put plunge them in clear water. And again he saith in the.iij.
did. and chaptre of feeble syghte / that to bathe and plunge the eyes in clear
water / therein to open them / coforteth and concerueth the sight / and
specially of yonge folk. The reason why the eyes must be cleansed with cold
water / is because every thing must be conserved by that that is like hit.
For Galen in his.iij. book de reg. says / that hot bodies have need of
hot medicines / cold bodies cold medicines: Considering than that mans eyes
be cold of nature: hit standethe with reason / they shulde be washed with cold
water not with hot. The.ij. doctrine is to wash our hands when we be up in
the morning / for they be intrumentes ordained to keep to mundifie the members
/ by the which the su{per}fluites of the brain be expulsed and avoided / as
by the nostrils / the eyes / the ears / and other natural conditis. And
therefore the hades specially ought to be washed with cold water / for the
washing of the hands with hot water engenders worms in the bealy: and
specially to wash them in hot water incontinent after meat / as Auicen
says in the.xvj. did. of his.iij. book / the.v. treatice / the chap. of
worms. For the washing of hands in hot water incontinent after meat /
draws the inward and natural heate of man to the exterior partis / and so
the digestion is un{per}fet: the which un{per}fet digestion is the principal
cause that worms be engendered. The third doctrine is to rome a little hither
and thither when we are risen from rest / that so the superfluites of the
stomach / guts / liver (as the gross matter of the urine) may ye spediler be
thrust under. The.iiij. doctrine is competently after rest to extend and
stretch out our hands / fete / and other lymmes / that the lyfely spiritis
may come to the exterior partis of the body / and so cause the spiritis of the
brain to be more quick and subtle. The.v. doctrine is to comb our heed in
the morning / to open the pores of the heed / to avoid such vapours as yet
by sleep were not consumed: and also to quick the spiritis of the brain.
Farther more to comb the heed is very wholesome / and specially for aged me. And
Auicen saith in the.iij. did. of his.iiij. book / and chap. of feeble sight /
that to cobe the heed is wholesome / specially for old men. Therefore one shulde
daily oft comb his heed. For oft combyng draws up the vapours to the
superior partis / and so seperateth them from the eyes. The.vj. doctrine is to
wash and purge the teeth. For the filthynes of the teeth causes the brethe
to stink. And of the filthynes of the teeth growethe certain vapours / that
greatly annoy the brain. Farther more the filthynes of ye teeth mingled with
thy meat / causes the meat to putrefy in the stomach. Auicen in his.vij.
did. of the.iij. book and chap. of coseruacion of the teeth / for the teeth.
teaches how we may keep the teeth from ache stynche. That is to wash the
mouth with wine twyse a month: but to make the brethe sweet / it must be
boiled with the root of spurge. Who so ever vsethe the forsayde decoction
medicine shall never have the tothe ache. In the last verse are certain
general rules: The first is that after we have washed and bathed our self /
we must keep us warm: For than the cunditis of the body / that is the pores
/ been open: whereby cold will pierce in to the body / and ingendre in us
diverse diseases. The.ij. is / that after we have dined or taken our repast / we
must for a while stand up right / that so the meat may discende to the
bottum of the stomach / and tha walk a little softly: for hasty mouynge
drives natural hete from the interior parts to the outward / and causes il
digestion. The.iij. is / that one of cold complexion shulde not warm him
self to suddenly / but little and little. for sudden change hurts nature:
as Galen saith in the glo^e of this canon: Secundum multum et repent c. All
strong things and of extreme nature corrupt the body.

Sit breuis aut nullus tibi somnus meridianus.
Febris / pigrities / capitis dolor / at{que} catarrus
Hec tibi proueniunt ex somno meridiano.
Here are declared.iiij. incouenientices engedred by after none sleep. First
the after none sleep causes and ingedreth fevers by reason of opilatios. For
the natural hete and spirit of man by day draws to the outward parts of
the body: and therefore digestion by day is but feeble: But when natural heate
and spiritis of ma draw to the inward partis of the body: than through
their motion natural heate is stered up: and therefore the night is the very
season of perfect digestion: and the vndigested raw humours are ye cause of
opilations / which opilations engedre fevers / as Auicen says in the.j.
did. li.iiij. and chap. of putrefaction. Secondly after none sleep causes
man to be slothful in his operations business / by the reason before said /
for gross humours and vndigested cause mans spiritis slowelye to move the
body: For as a subtle quick spirit causes lightness of body / so a lumpish
spirit causes a sluggish boby. cause of heed ache.
Thyrdly / the after none sleep engedreth heed ache: For the gross and
vndigested meat that remains in the stomach lift up to the brain gross
vapours / which trouble hit. And of very cosequens / if vapours of gros
mattier be stered up caused / they must also be gros. For Galen says in the
gloss of this aphorism: qui crescunt c. that hit must needs follow / that all
things be like those things / of whom they be engendered. The.iiij.
incovenience is the pose and reume. Reumes be humours that rounne from one
membre to an other / and as they rounne in diverse partis of the body / so they
have diverse names. For when the reume comes to the lights / they be called
catarri: and when they discende to the chekes / they be called branchus: and
when they come to the nose / they are called corizam: as appears by these
verses:

Si fluit ad pectus / dicatur reuma catarrus /
Ad fauces branchus / ad nares dico corizam.
But besides the reasos of the diseases before rehearsed / there be many other
reasons / and more effectuell. The cause of the first incoueniece / that is of
fevers / which some time are called putrified fevers / and some time fevers
effimeres. A fever effimere is engedred of vapours and smudge fumes kept and
retained after the after noone sleep / the which absteynynge from sleep is
wont to consume. The forsaide smudge fumes mixyng them self with mans spiritis
engendre an vnordinate and a strange fever called effimere. The putrified fever
is ingengdred of the humidites in man vndigested / and augmeted by the after
noone sleep. The.ij. inconvenience that is to be slow in operation and motions
/ chances by reason that by the after noone sleep the humidites and fumes in
ma are retained about ye muskyls / veins / iointis / and causes the forsayde
members to be astonished and a sleep: and therefore the body after dinner is slow
and heavy in operations. The third inconvenience (that is the heed age) comes
/ as is before declared in the.ij. incoueniece: that is to say / by the
humidites vapours retained in the body through sleep and rest: which by such
means are troubled and moved toward the brain / and so cause the heed age.
The.iiij. inconvenience is (that is the catarr) signyfyenge al manner of reumes
/ chances to man and vexes him / through vapours and fumes / which are wont
to be dissolved consumed by watch / by sleep they draw to the inward partis
of ma / and fume upward toward the brain: which fumes engrossed by cold /
return to the lowe partis caterrisans of mans body. Auicen in the.xiii.
did. li.j. in the.ij. doctrine and.ix. chap. allegeth many other
inconueniencis diseases engendered of the after noone sleep. The first disease
is the gout and palsy. Which grieve us / by reason that the humidites / that
are wont to be dried up and consumed by the heate of the son / and by watch
remain styll in the body. The second is the color / and corruption of the
face / through the wattrishe humidites like unto mans urine mingled with the
blood / which are wont to be wasted by watch / yt now with the blood they
ascend toward the brain the face / and cause it to swell / and to wax
pale. The third incovenience is / that after noone sleep engenders the spleen
/ and that by the keeping in of the gross melancholy humours by the day rest.
For as watch with the heate of the day (which do open) gives mouynge and way
to melancholy humours / by the strayte cundites of the body: so the day sleep
lets and distroyeth the passages and {pro}pre ways of them: specially it
destroys the cundites / yt come from the spleen to the mouth of the stomach /
made to provoke mans appetite / by which cundite all melancholy superfluites
are wont commonly to be clarified. The.iiij. is / that after noone sleep
mollifies the veins / by cause the humedites / which are wont to be
desolved by the day watch / can not be resolved: which so remaining in mans
body dry up the veins. The.v. incovenience is / that ma by reason of rest or
sleep / losethe his appetite / for lack of humours resolution: which
resolution is chief and principal cause of ye appetite. An other reason is
the replenisshynge of the stomach by fumes and humidites / mollifies and
fyllethe the mouth thereof. The.vi. incovenience / that after noone sleep doth
engendre / is impostumes / by means of humidites increased by ye day sleep /
which draw to one membre or other / and so cause it to swell. Auicen saith /
that besides all these aforsayde / there be.ij. other special causes / that
prove the after noone sleep to be hurtful. The first is / that the day rest is
soon corrupted / because the heate of the day draws the corporal heate to
the exterior partis of man: but the night rest doth clean contrary / for it
draws the corporal heate of man toward the inward partis. Of the which
two motions there is engendered a violent motion that distourbethe nature. And
therefore they that will sleep rest them by day: are counsayled to sleep in
dark places / and in the shadow. The.ij. cause is that the day rest makes a
man vnlusty / drowsy / and as half a ferde / and that by the changynge of
nature from his old custom / that is from digestio of his meat: yet not
withstanding that the after noone rest is generally dispreysed / the night
rest greatly commended and praised / yet the sleep that is taken in the morning
from.iij. hours before the son rysynge / till.iij. of the clock after ye
son is risen / is not to be dispreysed: As Hippocrates saith in his.ij. book
of pronostic. Sleep convenient and natural taken by night or by day is
allowable / and contrary is hurtful: but the morning sleep of all the day is
lest worthy dispreise. And all be hit the day sleep and at after noone are
forbyden by old fathers and doctors / yet for all that / now adays sleep
taken in the day time is not greatly to be blamed specially as Bartrutius
says / if these.v. conditions therein be diligently observed. The first is /
if hit be customably used: The.ij. that it be not taken immediately after dinner.
The.iij. that one sleep not with a lowe heed. The.iiij. not to sleep to loge.
The.v. not to be waked suddenly ferfully / but with good moderatio.

Quatuorex vento veniunt in ventre retento.
Spasmus. hydrops. colica / vertigo. quatuor ista.
Here are declared.iiij. inconveniences that come by to lunge holding of wind
in mans body. The first is called the cramp. The ventosites of the body /
run oft among the iointes veins fyllynge them with wind. Qf the which
fyllynge comethe retraction and wrynkelynge to gether of the veins. And Auicen
says in his.ij. did. the cramp is a disease that lyethe in the veins: by
the which the members of man move extend them self. This cramp is diverse:
one is caused by replenyshynge: whereby the membre is made short and great /
and wrynkelynge to gether as leather / or a harp string / through the matter
/ replenyshynge the mebres. This kind of cramp comes suddenly. There is a
another kind of the cramp much like a taboret: which enforces the membre
after his length largeness to crompull to gether like parchement cast in the
fire. This kind of cramp comes slowly. The second incovenience is called
the dropsye / a material disease engedred of mattier right cold entering and
inflatynge the members or places of mans body / in which is the regiment /
that is the digestion of meates and humours as the stomach / the liver / and
the void places about the bealye. For dropsye never engenders / but when the
liver is corrupt by reason of the blood. There be.iij. spices of dropsy.
Iposarca / asclides / tympanites: of the tympany this.ij. incoueniece is
understand. A tympany (as saith master Bartruce) is ingedred of ill
coplextion / by coldenes of the stomach / liver / not suffering mans drink or
meat to be couerted in to good humours / but turns them in to ventosites /
which if they be avoided by belchynge / by sweat / or other wise / they will
stop the ways of voidace. Also these ventosities gether to gyther between
the places of the bealye called mirac / and siphax / and there engenders the
dropsy. The.iij. inconvenience / is called the colike / a perilous a painful
disease / it engenders in a gut named colon. Like as the disease called
ilica / is engendered in one of the guts called ylion. And these.ij. diseases
are engendered by ventosites closed in the guts. The.iiij. inconvenience and
disease is the heed ache called vertigo: which makes a man to wene that the
world turns: the ventosites of the brain causes this infirmite: which
draw to the brain / myxte with the lively spiritis / causes the heed age
called vertigo. Auicen in his.xvj. did. rehearses these inconveniences with
other: and he saith that ventosites kept lunge / cause and ingendre the
colicke / by reason they assende and gether to gether / feblysshynge the
guts. And some time engenders the dropsye: and some time darkness of sight /
and some time the megryme / and some time the falling yuel / and some time it
runs in to the joints and causes the cramp.

Ex magna cena / stomacho fit maxima pena
Vt sit nocte senis / sit tibi cena breuis.
Here we be taught to make a light supper. For to much meat lettethe mans
natural rest / and causes anguish gnawyng in the bealy / causes the face
to break out: makes one to have a heavy heed in the morning / and an
vnsauerye mouth. Here this question comes well to pourpose. Whether a man
shulde eat more at dinner or at soupper? For a diffinicion here of / it is to
be noted: that after the quantite of the body more or less / meat is
convenient at soupper / or at dinner. For other the bodies be hole and sound /
orelles sick. If they be sick either incline to material sickness / or to
vnmateriall: If ye sickness be not caused through some humour: one may eat the
more at soupper: because in such sickenesses / nature only endeuereth to
digest the meat. If the sickness be material / one may eat the more at
diner / as it is declared in the.iiij. treatise in the.v. chap. of the curation
of falling sickness on this wise: He that can not be sufficed with one repast
in a day / because he is other wise accustomed / he must divide his meat in
three partis / and eat.ij. partis at dinner / and the other part after
temperate exercise at soupper. The reason here of is this: For in such sesonne
ye feeble nature hath help by the natural heate of the son to digest / and
the superfluites there by are more resolved / wherefore the refection shulde be
larger at diner tha at soupper. And more over because the heate of the day /
which causes digestion / joins with the natural heate of mans body: and so
by day are.ij. sondrye heates to help the digestion: but it is not so in the
night. Like wise nature endeuereth by night to digest the su{per}fluites.
Therefore it shulde not be hyndred to digest with to much meat. And though it
be so that the natural heate of ma be in many things fortified in the night:
as by retraction of the spiritis and reductio of sleep: yet that self heate
can not digest.ij. diverse things / as the meat / the su{per}fluites. Than it
follows that such folk shulde eat less at supper. If the bodies of such
seem hole / or else be very hole / strong / without any sensibilite of
superfluites / avoiding all through their vigour / as mighty big men: such
may eat more at soupper. For the nature of these bodies / labour only by
night to digest the meat received: and not to ripe the superfluites: for in a
manner they have none. Also they labour only to fortify their bodies / which
waxethe more stronger by night / than by day: because the blood and
corporal spiritis be engendered by night in a more quantite / and better
divided through out the body. If the bodies be not greatly disposed / as is
rehearsed: but are disposed to be lightly sick: Than whether they travail and
labour sore continually with their arms and hands or not: hit is best they
eat more at dinner than at soupper. For meat is not only taken to norishe
restore ye body: but also to make moyste / to over sprynkylle and water the
members / that through great labour and travail they wax not dry: and like
wise to withstade the dissolution of natural heate. Nor such travail labour
lets not their true digestion. For we se by experience / that they eat
twyse or thryse in a day with good appetite / and good digestion. If the
bodies be not apt nor disposed to labour continually / as ye bodies before
rehearsed: hit may chance.ij. ways: For either they labour very sore / but not
continually: or they labour febly: whereby su{per}fluites encreace. They that
travail much: as in rydyge or going about their worldly busynes / shulde
eat more at soupper than at dinner: because the unaccustomed great travail
would not suffer the meat taken at dinner to digest / but corrupt hit. Yea and
farther through superfluous motion the natural heate is disolued / spread in
every mebre of the body: which in the night draws to the inward partis of
the body / and is the principal cause of good digestion. And therefore a good
and a large soupper is more expedient for them / than a large dinner. Also the
same {per}sons were not brought up before this sesonne in such great travail:
and therefore their bodies are full of humidites: which little meat at dinner
may resyste ye resolutions caused by great motions travail. But in case they
travail little and easily by the way / to eat more at dinner tha at soupper
is best: as hit is declared in sick bodies / for they most commonly are feeble
both of coplection of digestion / and the heate and light of the son coforte
their natural heate and spiritis. Also the reason hereof is this / the
corporal cudites and passages by day are open: wherefore the su{per}fluites of
the body are sooner expulsed by day than by night. Farther they ought to eat
but little meat by night: for tha nature is greatly occupied to digest raw
humours: the which sleep must digest and bring to good point. And though the
digestion to digest and great repletions of meates / and the superfluous
humours be help by the night. Yet never ye less / the streingthynge thereof is
not sufficient to digest great repletions of meates / and also superfluous
humours. And weteth well / ye custom in eatyge much or little at dinner or
soupper / ought to be regarded / and kept. For custom is good and necessary
/ for helthe of ye body / and to cure sickness: as appears.li.ij. of sharpe
diseases. For sudden change of custom is very hurtful / and specially for
old folks. For nature can not bear nor yet suffer sudden mutation. And thus
it is well proved / that we ought to eat more at dinner than at soupper: and
that because sickenesses are most commonly materialles / yet for all that / if a
man could be contented with one repast in a day / it were better to take it at
soupper / than at dinner: so that he be not diseased in the eyes / or the
brain: for than it were better to take it at dinner / than at soupper. For the
repletion of the soupper / hurtethe sore the brain and the eyes. And witteth
well that not only the repletion of the soupper / hurts the stomach / but
also al manner of other repletions. For they ingendre opylations / fevers /
putrifactions / the lepre / and vndigested humours. And Auicen (in the.xiij.
did. of his.iij. book / and chap. of things that hurt the stomach) saith /
that al manner of repletions hurt the stomach: nor ye great eater by repletion
augments not his body / for he digests not his meat: but he that eats
moderately / hath always some appetite / increases his body: for he digests
well his meat. Therefore we ought to take good heed we hurt not our stomach by
over much repletion: nor yt we make not our self poursye / and the pulse to
beat more vehemently. In like manner repletion that ingedreth lothynge of meat
/ ought principally to be eschewed / but specially when it comes of ill
meates. For if hit come by ill meates / hit engenders payne in the joints /
in the raynes / in the liver / and the gout: and generally al other fleumatike
diseases. And if it come by clean meates: it ingedreth sharpe fevers / and
hot impostumes. It follows than that this repletion must be eschewed above
al other. For it grieves both soul and body. Secondly we must take heed we
over fylle not our stomachs: and utterly distroye our appetite: but we must
keep some appetite: and specially they that have a strong and a good appetite.
Some there be that have a feeble appetite / these ought to eat more than their
appetite requires.

Tu nun{quam} comedas / stomachum nisi noueris ante
Purgatum / vacuum{que} ^ibo quem sumpseris ante
Ex desiderio poteris cognoscere certo
Hec tria sunt signa subtilis in ore dieta.
Here are certain comandementes / which man desiring health / must of
necessite observe keep more duly than eat or drink. The first is / he
shulde eat no manner of meates / without his stomach be net / and purged of all
ill humours / by vomet or other convenient ways. For if a man receive meat
with corrupt humours in to his stomach: they will myngle them self to gether
and cause the meat newly eaten to corrupt. The second is / to eat no more
till the first meat eaten be digested and avoided out of the stomach. For
there is nothing more hurtful to mans body / than to caste meat upon meat
not digested / but only begun to be digested. For the meat last taken /
shall let the digestio of that yt was first eaten: and the digestion of the
meat first taken / shall be first finyshed: which departs to the liver by ye
veins called miseraikes / and therewith cariethe the meat last taken not yet
well digested. Whereof raw humours and vndigested be multiplied in mans body.
Farther in the text are put.ij. tokens / to know when the stomach is void of
the meat before taken. The first is very hunger. And for a knowledge hereof /
witteth well yt there is ij. manner of hungers / very hunger / and feigned
hunger. Very hunger is discriued by Galen in ye comment of the canon of the
aphorism / Indigentia non oportet c. Very hunger (says he) is when a man
needs meat: But feigned hunger is an appetite to have meat / though the
body hath no need thereof. And as very hunger comes by contraction and
corrugation of the veins procedyge from the mouth of the stomach / by
sugillation of the members nedynge meat: so in like wise feigned hunger is
wont to be caused of them that costrayne that they shulde {pro}uoke the mouth
of the stomach / the members having no need of food / as by cold things
harde or sharpe. And of this sign.ij. precept precedent / Auicen.iij.j.
doct.ij. cap. de eo quod c. says: No man ought to eat but after he hath a
lust: Nor he shulde not tarry lunge therein / when lust pricks / onles it be
a feigned lust / as the lust of kronkers / or such whose stomach aborrethe
meat: For to endure hunger lunge fylleth ye stomach with putrified humours.
And after in the same chap. he says: That who so ever love their health /
shulde never eat till they have a sure lust: nor till their stomach and
uppermost entrails / be voided of the first food. For the dangerust thing
that may chance mans body / is to receive meat upon dndigested meat. The.ij.
that signifies true lust / or very hunger / is sklendre diet precedet: that
is small sustinace before taken: for when hunger follows there upon it is very
true hunger. Farther more know ye / that to eat much and of sondry meates
mixed to gether at one repast or refection / is worst of all: as flesh and
fish / chekyns and pork: and after to {pro}lunge the time in eating: For the
first meat begynnethe now to digest / when the other are brought to the
table: and so the partis of ye meat are unlike in digestion: So that the
first taken are digested / or the last taken come to the midst of their
digestynge: And this causes that some partis corrupt other some. And this
thing Auice iij.j. doct. cap. ij. de eo c. warns / saying: There is nothing
more dangerous than to myngle diverse sustinances to gether: and after to
prolong the time in eating. For when the last meat is received / the first
is welnere digested. Therefore the said meates in diverse of their partis (as
touchyg digestion) be not like. But yet witteth well / that prolongynge of time
in eating moderately (as an hour space) to chawe and swolowe our meat well /
^loginge ^ne at ^ynet.
is allowable / helps much to the conservation of helthe. For good chawynge
and swalowynge down is as half a digestion: And ill chawyng of the meat doth
either let digestio / orels doth greatly hyndre it. But prolongynge of time in
eating / with talking and telling of tales.ij. or.iij. hours / is right
hurtful: thereof are engendered the diseases before rehearsed.

Persica. poma. pira. lac. caseus. et caro salsa.
Et caro ceruina. leporina. caprina. bouina.
Hec melancolica sunt / infitmis inimica.
Here are declared.x. manner of meates or foodes that ingendre melancholy / and
are vnholsome for sick folks. Of which the first is eating of peches:
Eating of peches.
Whereof Galen.ij. alimentor / cap. ix. saith / the ieuce of peches / and their
material substance is soon corrupted and utterly ill. Wherefore they ought not
as some say / to be eat aft other meat. For they swymmynge above are
corrupted. But this ought to be minded / which is a commune thing / that all
that is moist / slyppery / lightly gothe under / shulde be eaten first: and so
shulde peches: which swyftely go to the bottum of the stomach / and make way
for the meates that come after. But when they be eaten last / they corrupt
them self and the other meates. And thus it appears / that this saying ought
to be vnderstade of peches eaten after other meat. For when they be eaten
before meat they be good for ye stomach / mollify the bealye / and provoke
the appetite: as Auicen in the.ij. Canon chap. of peches says: Ripe peches be
good for the stomach / gives an appetite to meat. And farther he saith: They
ouhgte not to be eaten after other meat: for they corrupt after / but they
must be eaten before. Like wise Serapion / in ye chaptre of peches / by
auctorite of Dioscorides / saith: Ripe peches are good for the stomach / and
they mollify the bealy: But when they be not ripe they make a man costive: and
when they be dry they bind sorer. And decoction made of dry peches and
drunken / doth let the flowynge of humidites to ye stomach bealy. And the
powder of peches cast upon ye place where one bledeth / stancheth the blood.
And al though peches have these medicinable virtues aforsaid: yet because they
ingedre putrified humours / they be hurtful to sick folks / and specially
when they be not taken dewly. Peches be cold in the first degree / and moist
in the second. The second is peers / or eating of peers. The cause is /
Eating of peers.
for peers (and generally al manner of new and raw fruit) fylle ye blood with
water / boylynge up in the body: And so prepares the blood to putrefy / and
by consequens hurtful for sick folks. Peers / as Auicen in.ij. canon / and
chap. of them / saith / engendre the colicke. But yet peers above all fruit
make folk fat. And therefore hogs fed with peers / are made fatter tha with
any other fruit. And because peers ingedre ventosites / and so cause the
colicke: therefore they be used to be eat with such fruit that break or
avoid ventosites: or else to withstade the ill operation of these fruit /
drink after them / a draught of old wine of good savour. And the sweter
savour that peers have / the more doulce / the better they be. And also sod
peers be better tha raw: and they may be sod with anys sede / fenell sede /
sugar. The third is eating of apples: Eating of apples.
which as Auicen says (.ij. can. cap. j.) to eat often and much cause ache
of the senowes. And also apples have an ill {pro}prete / in engedryng
ventosites in the second digestion / wherefore they be vnholsome for sick
folks. And also for like cause as hit is before said of peers. And these
sayenges of peers and apples ought specially to be understand when they be
raw / and not when they be sod or roast. And not only these fruit shulde be
eschewed of them that be sick / but also all other fruit that fill the blood
with boylynge water: as new fruit / whose ieuce boylethe in mans body as hit
were must or new wine. And ieuce of fruit boyle without in a vessel and that
is through the hete of the son that remains in them when they ryped. These
new fruit / through boylynge of their ieuce / cause the blood to putrefy.
All though when they be eaten they comfort a mans body with their moisture. And
for this cause Auicen forbyddeth them specially eating of fruit / yt have the
ague / in his.iiij. did. and chap. of the universal cure / saying: All
fruit hurt them that have the ague / through their boylynge and corrupting
in the stomach. The.iiij. is eating of milk: Eating of milk.
the cause why eating of milk is not good / is because it is lightly
corrupted / and turns unto fume or sharpness in the stomach / as in their
stomach specially / that are diseased with putrified fevers: therefore they that
have a putrified fever are forbyden eating of milk. And to them also hit is
hurtful yt have the heed ache / to them yt have the swyns pockes / to many
other. Whereof Hippocrates speakethe in the Aphorism: Lac dare caput c. to give
them milk that have the heed ache is very hurtful. Yet not withstanding in
some diseases / milk is agreeable for them that have the tysike / the fever
etike / and for some other: as Hipp. saith in ye before allegate aphorism. And
also following / some thing shall be said when we come to Lac ethicis c. And
all though milk in the foresaid diseses is blamed / yet in them that be hole
it is allowable / and that if it be well digested in the stomach liver. For
tha it washes the etrayles with it wattrishenes / and hit mundifieth with hit
buttrines: and strives against venomous humours: and with hit chese moysteth
the members / and alleuiateth the grefes of the breast: and hit doth mitigate
the shotynge or prickynge of the lunges / guts / raynes / entrails / and of
the bladder: and it is good against prickynge humours in the entrails. Farther
more milk is good for teperate bodies / whose stomach is clean from colerike
and flumatike humours. For to such folk milk well digested is great
nourysshynge / hit ingendrethe good blood / it nourishes the body / and
conveniently moysteth and makethe fair ye exterior partis: as Isaac saith in
the universal dietis. And there also he saith by auctorite of Ruffus: that
they that will drink milk / must drink it fasting: and it must be drunk
hot from the cow: and to eat nothing till that be digested: and not to
labour nor stere about much than. Yet seldom or at no time one shulde
forbear walking / but than one must walk an easy pace / till he parceiue
hit be descend to the bottum of ye stomach. But milk is vnholsome for these
bodies that be distepered. For in hot bodies it is soon turned in to
colerike fumosite. In such as be cold / hit tournethe to sharpness and
putrefaction. Also milk is vnholsome for an vnclene stomach: for therein it
corrupts. Choice of milk.
Touching the choice of milk / hit is to be noted / that mean milk is to be
chosen for nourishement / and not thynne milk / as milk of a camel / or of
an ass: nor the most fat and gross is not to be chosen / as milk of kine
sheep: wherefore goottis milk shulde be chosen. For hit is not so wattrishe as
camels milk: the which is not apt to nourish / by reason of humidite / and
hit makes a man to laske: Nor it is not so fat / nor so gross / nor so full
of curdes and butter / as kowe milk and shepis milk is: which by reason of
their fatness / stop the heynes / and engendre ve / tosites: and is more
harder of digestion tha is necessary in governance of health. Therefore milk of
a gootte / not to ne'er kyddynge time nor to far from it / and that goth in a
good pasture / when pastures be at the best / shulde be chosen. The.v. is
eating of chese: Eating of chese.
and it may be understand of all sorts of chese / but specially of old
chese. The reason is because new chese is cold / moist / and of gross
substance / and harde of digestion: engenders opilations and the stone: and
helps or coserueth mans health (by way of nourisshement) very little or
nothing: And old chese is hot dry / by reason of the salt therein / hit
causes digestion: but yet of it self / it is harde of digestion / of small
nourishemet / and hurts the stomach / dries over sore / agrees worse tha
new chese. But chese between both / neither new nor old / The bontie of
chese
not to tough nor to brittill / to harde nor to soft / to sweet nor to sower /
not to salt / nor to full of eyes / of good tallege of good savour when it is
cut / which tarries not loge in the stomach / made coueniently of good milk
/ sufficiently oily. Such chese is good and shulde be chosen before all other:
whereof after meat we shulde eat a little quantite: for much in quatite / in
way of nourishemet is universally ill / and hurts the stomach / will not
digest / and engenders opilations / the stone in the raynes / gross humours
in the body / ventosites. Therefore that chese is only good that comes out of
any guards hands. The.vj. is salt meat: dried with salt or smoke / Salt
meat.
and of what kind of best so ever hit be / hit engenders gross blood and
melancholy: and so per cosequens / it is vnholsome for sick folks: nor wholesome
for them that be hole: as Auicen.ij.j. doct. ij. cap. xv. about the end /
saith: that salt flesh nourissheth but little / and that it is gross /
engedreth i'll blood. The.vij. is hartis flesh / Hartis flesh.
which like wise engedreth melancholy blood / as witnesses Rasis Alma.iij.
cap. de animalibus siluestribus et domesticis. The.viij. is hare flesh / Haare
flesh.
which like wise engenders melancholy blood / as Rasis saith in ye place
before allegate: This flesh engedreth more melacolye than any other. And of
this Isaac in dictis vniuersalibus saith: that hare flesh shulde not be eaten
as meat / but only used in medicines. And witteth well that hare flesh
hartis flesh / when they be old ought utterly to be eschewed: yet never the
les they may be eaten / they be best before caluynge time / that their drines
may be tempered with the age: And yet they ought to be eschewed except they be
fat. For their drines is tempered with their fatness. The.ix. is goottis
flesh. The.x. is ox flesh. For these be melancholy flesshes. For Isaac in
dictis vniuers. says: Gootis flesh and ox flesh be worst / Gootis flesh.
^.
hardest / and s^owest of digestion: and when they be digested / they engendre
gross blood and melancholy. And Auicen in his.ij. canon of goottis flesh
says: Goottis flesh is not very good / and {per}chance the humour is very
ill. And like wise ye shall understand of goottis flesh and cowes flesh:
which are worse than the forsaide fleshes / gootis and ox flesh. For of them
Auicen in the.ij. Canon the chap. of flesh / saith: Cow flesh / hartis
flesh / wild goottis flesh / and great fowls engedreth the fevers quartans.
And yet farther he says of cow flesh: that cow flesh nourissheth much /
and engenders gross melancholy / and melancholy disseases. And he says
farther that cow flesh engenders lepre. And of goottis flesh he says that
hit is absolutely ill. And for as much as hit is touched in ye text what
fleshes shulde be eschewed / specially of.iiij. footed bestes: me seems hit
were convenient / to show / what flesh of.iiij. footed bestis are to be
chose. And in the choice of fleshes the physicians agree not. Choice of
fleshes.
For Galen and certain other say / that pork is best. Some other / as Auicen
/ Rasis / and Auerroys say / that kyddis flesh is best. Yet not withstanding
Auerroys in the.v. coll. blamethe Auicen / by cause he said pork was best:
yet he said it not as though he held therewith / but after the christen
opinion. Some other preyse vele above all other. The.ij. is / a man may know
the best flesh of.iiij. footed bestis ye goodness thereof many manner of ways.
First by great nourisshynge / which thing betokens harde digestion / by the
likeness of mans flesh: and this wise pork is better tha any other flesh /
first for the likeness unto mans flesh: as witnesses Galen.iij. alimentor /
where he saith: That pork is like mans flesh / may be known / by that that
many have eaten mas flesh in stead of pork / and could not perceive neither
by the savour nor the taste / but that hit had been pork. And Auicen.ij.
canon. cap. de sanguine / says: Mans blood and hogs blood be like in
every thing: so that there have been that have sold mans flesh in stead of
pork / which thing was not spied / till a mans finger was fond amoge ye
flesh. Auerrois writes ye same in the.v. coll. cap. de carne. Secondely /
Pork nourishes greatly. For Gal. saith.iij. alimentor / that pork above
other flesh nourish most: whereof those that be called athlete have best
experience. And after in the same book he says: One can eat no flesh ye
nourishes more tha pork. Thirdly pork engedreth a stedfaste and a strong
nourishement / resistynge resolution. This is Galens opinion in the places
before rehearsed / where he preferrethe pork above all other flesh: and in
his.viij. book de ingenio / he says / Pork of all flesh is most laudable:
so that it be wild brought up on montaynes: and next pork kyd. And like wise
in.v. tera. he saith: Of al flesh of.iiij. footed bestis pork is most
laudable / which is temperate in heate and moisture: and engenders better
blood tha any other flesh: so that hit be of yonge swyne / that is of a year
or.ij. old / whether hit be wild or tame: nor yonge suckers are not so good:
for their flesh is most moyste. And of a more lykelyhod wild pork brought
up in the woods / is better than tame brought up at home: for tame pork is
more clammy tha it ought to be. And of wild hogs flesh or boor /
Auicen.ij. Canon / cap. de carne / saith: Christen men and their folowers say /
The best hog flesh
that the best wild flesh that is / is of a wild swyne. For besides that
that it is more light than ye tame swynes flesh / it is of more strength and
much more nourishynge / and more sooner digests: and in winter there can be
no better flesh. So tha it follows that hogs flesh is right good wholesome
for their bodies that be yonge / hole / strong / occupied in labour / and not
disposed to opilatios: for them that desire to be fat. For such have need of
much nourishement: and harde of digestion. And therefore Rasis.iij. Almasoris /
cap. de virtute carniu / saith: Gross flesh is convenable for them ye labour
much: but clean flesh is best for them that do contrary wise. Auicen will
the same.iii.i. ca. de regimine eius quod comeditur. saying: They that labour
much may better a way with gross meates than other. The choice of good
flesh stands in.iij. things: in temperance of coplection / in lightness of
digestion / and ingendryge of good blood: that is to say / the better flesh
is of temperate complexion / easy of digestion / and temperate in engendrynge
blood / between hot and cold / sklendernesse / and grossenes. And for this
cause kydde flesh is better more laudable than any other flesh / after the
mind of Rasis / Auicen / and Auerrois. For Rasis.iii. Almasoris / ca. de
animalibus / siluestribus et domesticis. says: Kydde flesh is temperate /
without any ill mixion: the which though it ingendre temperate blood / yet
hit is not convenient for laborers: but yet for all that / no another flesh
shulde be preferred before it. Hit is not so weke / that man strength is
minished thereby: nor the nourishynge thereof is so much gross / ye replecion
shulde come of it / or gross blood be engendered. The blood also that is
engendered thereof / is between subtle gross / hot and cold. Nor this flesh
is not mete for great labourers / but for attemperate yonge folks / vsynge
mean exercise. For this flesh engenders blood / that by mighty exercise or
labour is soon resolved / but not with mean travail. And (touching the
intetion) as kydde flesh is better tha any other housolde flesh / so gottis
flesh is better tha any other bred in the woods. And next to kydde flesh
many physicians / as Rasis and Auerrois / put mutto. And Auerrois saith.v.
coll. cap. de carne: That most part of physicians are of this opinio / save
Galen which laudeth not mutton. And he thinks that veale nourishes more
than mutton. And perauenture Galen vnderstadeth here the betternes of
nouryshement of that that is to nourish much / and to give nourisshemet more
harde of resolution / which more agrees unto veale than mutton / syns mutton
is of more humidite. Thirdly the goodness and choice of flesh may be taken by
reason of their small clamynes / and by their good savour: and herein veale is
better than any other flesh. And this is showed of Auerrois.v. coll. ca. de
carne / saying: And veale is good flesh because hit is not clamy / cold /
nor dry as befe is / and veale hath a swetter savour than any other flesh:
and in these poyntis it is better than kydde flesh: for in kyd flesh one may
perceive a clammynes before it is sod: and in that ye veale ingedreth better
humours / it is better tha kyd. And thus it appears plainly what is the cause
of controuersite among physicians touching the choice of flesshes. The
cotr^uersite in choice of flesh.
Farther witteth well / that the flesh of dry coplection / is better ne'er
caluynge time tha far from it: And therefore kyddis and caulues be better tha
goottis and oxen: because their drines is abated with the humidite of their
yongnes. But flesh of beastis of moist complexion / is better and more
wholesome in age than in youth. For their ouermoche humidite is dried much
away / as they encreace in age: And therefore wethers of a year old are less
clamy and more holsomer than suckynge lames: and like wise porkes of a year
or.ij. old / are better tha yonge pygges. And therefore Auicen saith
well.iii.i. cap. de reg. eius quod comeditur. It behooves yt the meat / that
conserveth health shulde be such as the flesh of kydde or a sucking caulfe is
/ or lames of a year old. By these reasons it apperethe than that the flesh
of goottis male and female / of old mutton / of befe / of old pork / and
specially of brawn / of pygges / and of suckynge lammes / is not very wholesome
for the conservation of mans helthe: but the flesh of yonge caulues / of
yerelynge wethers / and pork of a year or.ij. old / is convenient enough to
eat to preserve mans health. Flesh.
And it is to be well noted / that flesh inclined to drynes / must be sod:
and inclynynge to humidite / must be roasted / to attempre their humidite: And
therefore the flesh of conies / haaris / hearts / calves / and kyddis / shulde
be sod: and pork and lame roasted: for seething attemprethe the drynes. And
hereby appears / that in moyste seasons / and for moist complexions flesh
disposed to drynes / shulde be roasted: and in dry seasos / and for
complexions dry and old / moist meates be more convenient.

Qua recentia / vina rubentia / pinguia iura.
Cum simila pura nature sunt valitura.
Here in this text been expressed divers nouryshynge meates. Of eggs.
The first are new laid eggs / which be of that sort / that in little
quatite nourish much / as says Auicen.ii. canon. cap. de ouis. and like
wise he says in.iiij.j. cap. j. Things (saith he) of small quantite and
great nourishement are eggs and cocks stones. And the self same he repetethe
in many other places. Touching the choice of eggs / witteth well that the
eggs of hens / pertriches / and fesances yonge and fat are very good in
regiment of health / and simply / better tha any other eggs: For the pressed
daughter said / that loge eggs and small were the best of all / as in these
verses: Filia presbiteri iubet pro leg teneri.
Quod bona sunt oua / candida / longa / nova.


Farther / poched eggs / are better than eggs roasted hard or rear / and they
be of great nourishement / and of good and light digestion / and engedre blood
specially proportionable to the heart: Wherefore they be excedynge good for
such as be recovered from sickness / for aged folk / and for weak {per}sons
/ and specially the yolke. For Auicen in the treatise de viribus cordis saith:
that the yolke of eggs / of fowls whose flesh is good to be eat / as of
hens / pertriches / and fesantis / though they be not medicinable for the
heart / yet they coforte right much. And he addethe following: That they be
lightly turned in to blood: after they be turned / they have small
superfluite: And therefore they comfort most specially the heart. And farther
he says / that they be excellent good to restore the spiritis blood of the
heart: Rear roasted eggs are lightly digested / and they ease ye lunges and the
breast / and mollify the bealy teperately / but they nourish not so much as
poched eggs. Harde eggs sod are harde of digestio / and they nourish the
body grossely / descendynge slowly to the stomach / slowly they entre therein:
Farther witteth well / that eggs by the dressinge of them are made better and
worse: Dressynge of eggs.
For either they be roasted / sod / or fried / or sod with some broth.
Roasted eggs be more gross than sod / and more harde of digestion: for the
herthe or fire driethe up their substantial humidite. And they be roasted.ij.
ways: For either in the shells they be raked in the hot imbers / orels they
be broken in the shells. They that be broken be worse than the other: but they
that in the shells be raked in the hot imbers are done.ij. manner of ways /
either they be all raked in the imbers / orels set upon imbers coals with
part uncovered. They that be al covered be worse: for by reason that the heate
of the fire goth about them / the fumosites / are kept styll in / they that be
set upon the ymbers / part uncovered / avoid out the fumosites and be
modified. They be better sod in water tha roasted: for the humidite of the
water strives with the heate of the fire / drienge their humidite. And so they
be dressed.ij. ways: For either they be sod in the shells / orels broken in
the water. Sodden in the shells are worse than the other. For the shells
let dissolution of fumositees and grossenes. When they be poched / the heate
of the water temperately pierces in / and makes more pure their grossenes: and
takethe away the ill smell and savour. Wherefore poched / they be most wholesome
/ and worst fried: For fried they ingendre most ill humours / Rasis opinio in
dict. vniuersa.
and hurt the stomach / causes fumosite and corruption / and makes one to
loathe his meat. But sod in some good broth are between both / roasted and
poched. Also wytteth well / that there is a diuersite in an egg / touching
his coponde partis. For the yolke is temperately hot: The white is cold and
clammye / and hardly digests / and the blood also thereof engendered /
Rasis.iii. Alm. ca. de vir. ouoru.
is not good. And as the forsayde eggs / that is to say of hens / pertriches
/ and of fesantis / be more couenable in ye regimet of health: so eggs of
ducks / gees shouelardis / such like fowls / are vnholsome in the regiment
of helthe / and shulde be eschewed. The.ij. is red wine. Red wine
Where upon ye shall understand / yt wynes differ in colours. For some wynes
be white / some claret / some citrine / and some black. White wine is febler
tha any other / colder and less nourishing / but they leest hurt the heed /
and they make one to pysse better than other. That they be weaker than other
wynes appears: for after Galen. su{per}.i. canone.iii. {per}ticule regiminis
acutorum. Weak wine is hit / that leest heteth or enflames / less grieves
the brain than other. That white wynes be colder than other apperethe by Galen
in the comment of the canon.iii. partic. reg. acutoru. where he says of white
wine / thus: It is impossible that white wine shulde greatly inflame any man.
And after he saith: White wine enflames or heteth leest of all wynes. Which
thing is true / if one will make comparison between white wine and red of
one country growing / and none other wise. For the red wynes of Frace are
not so hot / nor yet so strong as the white wynes of some other coutre. And
therefore the comparison must be made between the wynes of one manner and
country: and that they nourish less than other wynes appears by Galen in the
comment of this aphorism.ii. particule aphoris. It is easier to fill one with
drink than with meat: where he says: Watterysshe sklender white wine / is
universally neighbour to water: and as touching nourishement is like water /
whereby it provokes one to peace / and nourishes one to pysse. And this is the
cause / that strong wynes / be not convenient for feeble brained folks / as it
is said: But it agrees well with them that have a strong brain: For a
strong brain resists vapours when they smite up there unto / as Auicen
says.iij.j. and chap. before allegate. And here notes well / that the wit
of a man having a strong brain / is clarified and sharped / if he drink good
wine / than if he drank none / as Auicen says.iij.j. and chap. before
allegate. And the reason is / because of good wine more than of any other
drink are engendered and multiplied subtle spiritis clean pure. And this is
the reason why that these diuins / imagynynge studyenge high and subtyle
matters / love to drynge good wynes. And after the opinion of Auicen in the
forsayde chap. these wynes are good for men of cold and flumatike complexion.
For such wynes redress and amend the coldenesse of complexion: and they
open the opilations stoppynges / that are wont to be engendered in such
persons / and they digest fleme / helpinge nature to convert and turn them in
to blood: they lightly digest / and entre quickly / they encreace greatly
quick the spiritis. But wine citrine is not so burning as red claret / as
Galen in the comment of the canon before allegate says. Red wynes be hotter
than white / therefore they grieve the heed more / as Galen says in the canon /
Potus autem duicis. Also claret wine nourishes less than red / and more
than white. And in some places they call claret wine white: and that is ye
cause that some say that white wine doth quickly inflame mans body. The
black wynes be not so fervent hot as the red be. And therefore they hurt
the heed less. But for as much as they discede more slowly in to the bealy /
and provoke more slowly mans urine / they grieve the heed more tha white wine /
as Galen says in the canon Potus autem dulcis. And these wynes nourish less
than white or citrine / and less than red wine. The third is suppynges /
made of good broth of flesh / suppinges or brothes.
but specially of chekyns: for such brothes are very friendly to mans nature:
and are lightly couerted in to good blood / and ingendrethe good blood /
specially when hit is made with fine flower. For flower / principally of wheat
/ is greatly nouryshynge / and causes great nourishemet / as saith Ra^is.iij.
Alman. And these.iij. forsayde things Auicen puts.ii.i. doct. ii. suma. i.
ca. xv. in ye end / where he saith: Example of clean and good nouryshynge
meates and humours be the yolks of eggs / wine / and brothes made of flesh:
and there upon he concludes / that these.iij. forsayde things are comfortable
and of great restorative for mans body.

Nutrit et impinguat / triticum / lac / caseus infans.
Testiculi / porcina caro / cerebella medulle.
Dulcia vina / cibus gustu iocundior / oua
Sorbilia / mature ficus / vue{que} recentes.
Here are touched.xij. manner of things / which greatly nouryshe and make
fat mans body. The first is breadde made of wheat: Breadde.
which as Auicen says.ii. can cap. de pane. fats swyftely / specially
when it is made of new wheat. Rasis iij. Alm saith: wheat is neighbour to
teperace / all though it incline a little to heate: the heuiest and soundest /
nourishes best: and of all grains hit is most wholesome for all folks: And the
blood engendered thereof is more temperate than of any other grain. Choice of
wheat.
Touching the choice of wheat / ye shall vnderstade that the election is to be
considered.ii. manner of ways: First on the bihalfe of his substance: an other
way on the bihalfe of his preparation. The choice on ye byhalfe of his substance
Auic. puts.ij. can. chap. of corn / saying: That is the better that is
neither harde nor soft / great / fat / and new / not to old / between
red and white. Black wheat is an ill nouryssher. Rasis says hit is heavy.
Touching the choice concerning the preparation / witteth well / that all
things made of wheaten flower descede from the stomach slowelye / engendre
gross humours / cause opilations about the liver / augment the spleen / and
engendre the stone / and digested nouryshe much. Wheat sod is heavy meat
and indigestable / but when it is digested / it nourishes strongely /
strength a man much. But wheat made in bread / well leuened / and bake in an
oven / hat with moderate fire / is marvelous wholesome. All these thyges are
gethered of Galen Alimetoru. The.ij. thing is milk: Buttter milk.
and after the mind of some doctors / it is vnderstade by butter milk /
called o^or / and comonlye called balbuca. there is nothing nourishes more
than this milk / when hit is new sopped up with new hot breadde. Hit may
also be understand by goottis milk: Gootis milk. Grene chese.
which nourysheth much: whereof we have largely spoke before. The.iij. thing
is grene chese / which as Auicen says.ii. can. cap. de caseo / is a
nourisher and a fatter. And al though grene chese nourysheth and fattethe / yet
hit is not wholesome in the regiment of helthe: for thereof come the
inconveniences before declared / Persica poma c. The.iiij. thing is stones:
and specially stones of fat cocks: which as Auice.ii. can. ca. de testiculo
/ Coyllion^.
saith: be very good and great nourishers: And he saith that in a small quatite
they nourish much. This also may be understand of hogs stones very fat
/ that hath not boorred a lowe. For as pork of all.iiij. legged bestis
(touching his nouryshynge) is best / in like manner the stones / in regard of
other beastis stones / are the best. And here is to be well noted / that the
stones of aged bestis / whose sede is fermented / be nothing nouryshynge. But
the stones of yonge bestis / not yet able to do their kind / whose sede of
generation is not yet ripe: be of meetly good nourishement / if they be well
digested. The.v. thing is pork / Pork.
in choosing whereof / and of theffecte of the same / is largely declared before
/ there / Persica poma c. The.vj. thing is eating of brains: And wyttethe
well that brain is ill for the stomach / Eating of brains.
and causes lothsomnes / and takethe a way a mans appetite / and engedreth
gross humours: yet never the less hit nourishes the body / if hit be well
digested: But in no wise hit shulde be eaten after other meates. And if hit be
dressed with penyriall or nepte / to attempre the clamynes cold thereof / or
with things / that by their virtue give hete: hit is good and wholesome. And
take heed / eat no brain / outcepte hit be first hat upon the coals. And
witteth well / that it is not good for them that be sick other while of cold
diseases: but for them that be hot of coplection hit is wholesome / as
Rasis.iij. Alm. saith / in the chap. de virtutibus membrorum animalium. And
brefely hit is forbydden in the regiment of helthe. But yet some time hit doth
well in medicine: as the brain of a little gootte is good against venom /
and against venomous byttynges: And a haaris brain against trembling: And
some say the brain of chekyns and capons is good for the memory / and
comfort the wit. Choice of brains.
Yet touching the choice of brains / hit is to be know / that the best
brains be of fowls that flee / and proprely about montaynes. And of.iiij.
foted bestis the best is of a rame / and next of a caulfe / as Auicen
says.ii. can. cap. de cerebro. The.vij. is marie / which well digested
nourysheth much: Mary.
as Auicen saith in the foresaid canon and chap. of marie. And hit is lightly
turned in to blood: yet never the less / it distroyeth the appetite / and
makethe one to loathe his meat: And therefore Auicen teachethe us to eat them
with pepper. And touching the choice / Auicen says the mary of veale / of a
hart / of a bull / of gootis / and of sheep / is most wholesome. And some say
the mary of yonge fat bulls / is very wholesome and good. The.viij. is sweet
wynes: whereof we shall entreat after there / Sunt nutratiua. Delicious meates.
ii. particula aphorismorum.
The.ix. is delicious meates / for such most specially nouryshe / as
Hippocrates saith. And Galen saith / that all souorie meat / wherein one
deliteth when he eats hit / the stomach receives and reteyneth / and
digests that with a far greatter delectation tha other: But if the meat be
loathsome / the stomach will not abide hit: whereof vomit / abhorrynge of meat
/ inflation / and belchynge are engedred. And that is ye cause we se some more
helthye with course meat / tha with good / because the course is more delicious
unto them. The.x. is rear eggs: rear eggs
which in small quantite nourish much / whereof we have spoken before at oua
recentia c. The.xj. is ripe figs: which through their swetnes / nourysshe
and fat much. And touching figs / Ripe figs.
though they nouryshe not as strongly as flesh and grain: yet there is no
fruit so strong a nourysher: as Auicen saith.ii. can. cap. de ficubus. And
there he says / that figs nouryshe more than any other frutis. And he saith
in regimine eius quod comeditur / that frutis of most nourishement / and most
like and ne'er unto flesh in nourishynge / be figs / very ripe resyns / and
dates. As concerning the choice of them / witteth well / Choice of figs.
that after Auicen in the place above allegate de ficubus. The white is best /
for hit is lighter: next the ruddy or citrine / Rasis in the place before
allegate / hit nourishethe well / and comfort the stomach and liver / and
auoydethe opilations. And hit is said / that the liver is fatted with them /
and specially if they be cleansed from ye grains or kyrnels. And thus the
forsaid text may be vnderstade of a fresh gethred grape or a resyn: or of a
dry grape called passula.

Vina probantur odor / sapore / nitore / colore.
Si bona cupis vina. hec tunc probantur in illis
Fortia / formosa / fragrantia / frigida / frisca.
Here in this text be declared.v. manner of proves of good wine. The tokes of
good wine.
The first is ye smell / for wine of good odour and flauour multiplies mans
spiritis: and as Constantine.v. theorice saith / it nourishethe well and
engendrethe good blood: But stynkynge wine is vnholsome for mans nature /
engendrynge gross and melancholy spiritis. And after the mind of the said
Constantine / hit engenders ill blood and heed ache of the ill fume
ascendynge to ye heed. Galen.iii. reg. acut. comento. i. speaking of the
diuersite of wynes / of the odour saith: that wine that hath good smell /
engedreth good blood / but it fylleth ones heed full of fumes vapours /
because of the subtlety heate thereof: But ill smelling wine / after the
quantite of ill blood engendered thereby / hurts the heed very little /
because hit is cold and gross. The.ij. is savour: for like as good sauorye
meat norysheth better and is better received of the stomach / as is aforsayde
/ in like wise so doth wine. But ye shall vnderstade / ye wynes differ in
savour: for some be sweet / more nourishynge tha other / engendrynge gross
blood / and moystynge the bealye / yet they be harde of digestion / and
engendre thyrst. There is a another sort of wynes called pontica or styptica /
which coforte the stomach / and eases the bealy / but hit hurthe the breast
and purtenance / as the lunges / and the pipe thereof: wholesome for the entrails
harde of digestion. There be other wynes yt be sharpe or sower: that {pro}uoke
ones urine / they engendre not / but they dissolve gross humours. There be
other bitter wynes less hot: as says Constantine.v. theorice. The.iij. is
clerenes or brightness / which shows the purenes of the wine / and so
consequently of the spiritis thereof engendered. The.iiij. is the colour. In
colour wynes vary and differ greatly in their nouryshynge. For the ruddier
wynes of the same apparel are more noryshyng than white. And therefore they be
more wholesome for lean folk than white: yet the white be more wholesome for them
yt be fat. And of this diuersite of wine in colour / we have spoken before at
/ oua recentia. Farther in the text are put.v. special thyges / howe a ma
shulde {pro}ue know good wine. First is by ye strength / which is known by
the operation. Gal. commeto.i.iii. pari. reg. acutorum.
For as Gal. saith strong wine is hit that vehemently enflames a mans body /
repleteth the heed. This strong wine is special encreacer of the spiritis / a
great norysher. But yet I advise them yt have a weak brain to be ware howe
they drink strong wine / outcept hit be well allayed with water. For the
fumishenes thereof hurts ye heed. The.ij. is fairness of the wine: For the
fairness or goodlynes of the wine / causes one to drink it desirously /
which causes hit better to digest / better to norishe. The.iij. is fragrant
and of good odour. For fragrant and redolent wine coforteth most / and
engenders subtle spiritis / as it is said. The.iiij. is / that wine must be
cold touching the taste / but hot in effect and operatio. For wine made
hot / by reason of the clerenes / and fynes / over comes a mans brain the
sooner / febleth the senowes / and hurts the heed but if hit be taken
moderately. The.v. is / that wine must be frisk sprynkelynge / and with the
spumynge to make a little noise / and the spume to be thynne and soon flashed
/ and the spume to tarry in the midst. For if it have not these {pro}pretes /
it must be called hanging / that is feeble wine / and specially if hit make no
sown / hath great bubbuls spume / that tarries lunge by the sides of the
cup.

Sunt nutratiua plus dulcia candida vina. Here is one doctrine of wine
declared: which is that gross and sweet wynes be more nourishynge than any
other of the apparel. To this agreethe Constantine in the above allegate place:
so doth Auicen.iii.i. cap. de reg. aque et vini. where he saith: Gross wine
that is doulce / is best for him that would be fat. The reason is / because
the doulce wynes / for their doulcetnes / are vehemently drawn of the mebres /
where with nature rejoices. For Auicen saith.ii. can. tract. i. cap. iii. that
the operations of dulce wynes are digestion / mellowyg / and encreasynge of
nourishement / and nature loves hit / and the virtue attractive drawethe hit.
And all though this text may be verified by all doulcet wynes / yet the
moderate doulce wine / is to be chosen / not that that is excedynge doulce / as
muskadell: For such corruptethe the blood / by reason that nature draws hit
violently from the stomach to the liver / before it be well digested / before
the su{per}fluite thereof be ryped / through the great dulcetnes thereof / hit
fyllethe the blood with vndigested aquosite / that makes ye blood apt to
boyle and putrefy. And this also shulde be understand by other meates
excedynge sweet. And farther wytteth well / Three inconueniece engendered of
doulce foodes.
that of the use of sweet wine and other doulce nourishementes.iij.
inconveniences are to be feared / specially of them yt be inclined thereto. The
first is loathing: for ye sweet foodes / through their heate moisture suppull
fill the mouth of the stomach / and there engedre a disposition contrary to
the vacuation corrugacio of hit / that causes hunger. The.ij. is swyfte
inflammation of these doulce foodes converting in to coler. For doulce things
most aptly engedre coler. Therefore honey above all other things soonest
engenders coler / because of sweet things it is most sweetest: and next
honey is sweet wine / as Galen saith. And here upon rises thyrstynes / Gal. in
cometo can. iii. {per}t. reg. acutorum.
nor hit is not wholesome for them that have ye ague / nor for colerike folks.
The third is opilation of the liver and spleen: For these.ij. members / and
specially the liver draw dulce thyges with their dregs / to them / for the
great delight they have in them / before they be digested. Wherefore there they
lightly cause opilations / through the help operation of the gross substance
/ wherein the sauorynes of sweetness is grounded / as Auicen saith.ii. can.
tract. i. cap. iii. And this is the cause that sweet wine doth less stere one
to pysse tha other wynes. Against these.iij. nocumetis eager or sharpe savoury
things are very wholesome: for with their tartnes they provoke the appetite:
with their coldness they queche enflamation / with their fynes of substance they
open opilations. Farther / wytteth well / that all though sweet wynes / and
other doulce nourishementes / stop or shut the liver and spleen: yet they
vnstoppe the loges. And the reason why they stop not the lunges as well as
the liver and spleen / Gal. declares in the comet of the can.iii. part. reg.
acut. Because doulce things in their passage / resude nothyge there to / but
that that is fine and pure: and the blood engendered of doulce things comes
to the longis / purified first in the liver / Hipp. iii. {per}ticu. reg. acut.
can. Metem lemus c.
and fined in the heart. Also as Hippocrates saith / Doulce wynes do leest make
one drunken. Thus we may conclude / that if wine be drunk for nourishement /
for restorative of the body / and to make one fat / as it chaceth in them
that be lean / whether it be naturally or accidentally: than doulce wynes and
gross / sufficiently coloured are wholesome. For such wynes are nouryshers /
restore ^es of such as be lowe brought / and fatters. Wherefore they be most
convenient to fat lean bodies. But if we entende not to nourish / to restore
or make fat our bodies / as they that be corsye and fat: than though we may
not use sweet wynes but subtle / yet they must chose such as be amiable /
and have good savour and flauour / inclined to whiteness / sufficiently strong.
If one drink wine to quench his thyrste / than he must take white wine /
thynne and feeble. For such wine do moyste more / and coulethe more: so
consequently / better quenches thyrste: And the greatter the thirst is / the
holsomer such wine is. But if so be wine be drunk to refresh ye spiritis /
and comfort the corporal virtue: than hit would be subtle / sweet / of
delectable savour / of mean colour / of sufficient strength: and such wine
ought to be taken with little meat: and hit must be depured from either
super{per}fluite / and to be taken in small quantite. But if we purpose to
scour the breast and lunges / to cause us to laske: than doulce wynes of mean
substance / and of good flauour shulde be chosen.

Si vinum rubeum nimium quando{que} bibatur /
Venture stirpatur / vox limpida turpificatur.
This text shows to us.ij. hurtis / that come by over much drinking of
red wine. The first is / that over much drinking of red wine / makes one
costyue. The cause after the opinion of some / is. For such red wine
heatethe more than other of the apparel / and is more nutratiue. For in that
that hit is hotter / hit dries more: in that ye hit is more nutratiue / it is
more desirously retained of nature. But yet this text may be understand by
over much drinking of byndynge red wine / which is some what eager / sharpe
/ costive. Yet concerning this / wytteth well / that if the stomach or the
guttis be feeble in their natural operation: than red or black wine / called
stypticke / that is some what tart / ought to be used and droken: as they do /
that by debilite of stomach / can hold nothing / but be laxative. This saith
Hippocrates in the canon Palmeus quidem c. And also Galen in the comment of the
same. But if we will comfort the virtue of digestion / the clean wine or mean
in substance and colour / of good odour / and of convenient savour / and of
sufficient strength / some what stipticke / is most wholesome. The.ij. is
horsenes of ye throat / which horsenes / some red wynes / through their
drynes erthynes / cause and induce. And this hurt comes also by drinking of
red wynes growing in the parties of Brabant / through their stipticalnes and
erthynes: and specially when the said wynes be not fined / this grefe
chancethe. But yet they make not a man costive: For must that is very red /
is wont to cause the flixe / by reason of his erthye dregs mingled there
with all: which bites and gnaws the guttis: of which gnawynge comethe the
flixe. And such wine shulde not be drunk till hit be fined. For so lunge as
hit is gnawynge / through the erthy dregs thereof / a mordicant fume is raised
to the brain / which gnawethe or bytethe the eyes / and makes them red:
Such inconveniences are engendered by new vnfyned wynes of Brabant / whether
they be white or red / through their erthynes. The cause why this fume is
mordicatiue is by cause ye wine that he comes of is mordicatiue. Gal. in
comento illius aphori. Et qui crescunt c.
For Gal. says: What so ever is dissolved from a thing / must needs be like
the thing / from which hit is dissolved.

which is very medicinable against such incoveniences / Garlyke.
as are wont to engendre of water: and specially hit is wholesome / if one
drink ill corrupt water. Whereof Serap^on in the segregatis and chap. of
garlyke says: That if one eat garlyke first / and drink corrupt water after
/ hit shall not hurt him. In like wise saith Auicen.ii. can. cap. de alleo.
et.iii.i. ca. de conser. a nocu. diver. aquarum. The same operation is also in
oynions / as Auicen saith.ij. can. chap. of oynions / and so oynions may be
comprehended under garlyke. And Auice in ye fore allegate place saith: That an
oynion is subtle / percynge / and scouring / with stipticite: and opens
strongly: and is hot in the third degree: wherefore it heats ill waters /
{pro}hibitynge / that they with their coldness hurt not the stomach: and hit
makethe pure gross humours / causynge them lyghtely to penytrate. And vinegar
myxte with an oynion doth greatly fortify his virtue subtle and penitratiue
/ and kepeth one from thyrstynes / which oynions eaten are wont to induce.
This same is verifiedde of garlyke. And Auicen saith in the above allegate
place / that one shulde eat garlyke / after drinking of gross and troblous
waters: for hit fyneth them / and makes them lightly to discende: lettethe
that they hurt not the stomach and entrails: and that they stop not the
veins. And garlykeis good eat before one take his journey. and after that hit
is one of the best and most holsomest thyges that can be / for them that come
out of a cold aier or go in to hit: as Auicen saith.iii.i. cap. de regendo
iter. And by this appears that garlyke is specially good for them that journey
and wander over divers countres / use divers drynkes / according to these
verses: Allea qui mane ieiuno sumpserit ore.
Hunc ignoratum non ludit potus aquarum.
Nec diuersorum mutatio facta locorum.


More over garlyke is good against ye styngynge of venomous worms / bytynges
of serpentis / when hit is drunken with wine: which thing Auicen in the.ij.
can. and chap. of garlyke / saith / he hath proved. And also hit is good
against the bytynge of a mad dog: And a plaster made of garlyke / fig
leaves / comyn / is good laid to the place bytten with a venomous be called
mugall. An oynion / as Auicen saith / the.ij. can. and chap. thereof / is eke
wholesome for bytynge of a mad dog / when the place bytten is anointed with
the ieuse thereof / or a plaster thereof made with falte and few. And an oynio
eaten expels the hurt of venomous things. And some say they engedre in a
mans stomach a moist humour very wholesome agayst ye hurt of venomous thygis. And
here is to be noted / that garlic / oynions and also likes are not wholesome for
temperate bodies / nor hot / and specially raw. For they nourish very
little / and they nourish ill / and engendre sharpe prickynge blood: yet
they make subtle gross humours / and break or cut the clamye. And after
they be sod / they lose the prickynge / and yet than their virtue incisiue
and subtilatiue remains. Therefore they be holsomer sod tha raw. Likes be
hot and dry / Eating of likes.
and their norishement is naught / they hurt the eyes / and engendre black
melancholy blood / terrable dreams: they hourte the senowes with their
prickynges: they hurt the teeth and gommes: and colerike melancholy folks
shulde not use to eat them / and specially raw. Oynios be hot / Eating of
oynions.
they have an erthy superfluous heate / with a wattrishe moystnes / subtle /
vndigested. If they be eaten raw they engendre ill humours / and corruptable
putrifactions in the stomach / and they cause i'll dreams and dredful / and heed
ache. And if they be to much used / they mar the memory / and trouble the
understanding / and make one beside him self. But in case they be sod with
the broth of good flesh / eaten / tha they cause good digestio / and their
hurtfulnes is diminished / and they moderate the coldness of meates / where with
they be sod: Eating of garlyke.
but the best is / not to use them. Garlyke is hot / declynynge some what to
humidite / but less than oynions / hit is medicinable against vetositees / and
the cough / and makes one to spit well / but hit hurts the syghte and
causes heed ache: and hit is tryacle for vplandyshe men. And thus the forsayde
things / are wholesome for them only / that have fleumatike gross and clamy
humours / but colerike folks ought to absteyn from them. The use of nuts.
The.ij. thing is walnuttis: whereof Auicen.ii. can. cap. de nuce / saith: That
it with figs and few / are medicinable against all manner of venom / and
thereof / of oynions / salt is made a plaster to lay to the bytynge of a
mad dog. And this specially is understand of a dry nut / taken before
meat / in form before said. And witteth well / that dry nuts are worse /
than new and moist. Diseses egendred by eating of nuts.
For the dry are more oylye: by reason whereof they turn to coler / and cause
heed ache / they trouble the eyes / and engendre swymmynge in the heed / and
specially taken after meat: they cause the paulsye in the tongue / and provoke
one to vomit / and make blisters in ones mouth: and they that have a colerike
stomach ought specially to eschew dry nuttis: and the older they be / the
worse they be. The new nuttis have less of ill oylynes / and therefore they
engendre not the ache or swymmynge in the heed / such like diseases / as the
dry do: and by reason of their slippery humidite / they make one have the
laske. And if they be a little warmed at the fire and eaten after dinner / they
press down the meat. And thus it appears ye new nuttis are more wholesome
for folks in health than dry. Of rue called herb grace.
The.iij. is few. Whereof Auicen.ii. can. cap. de ruta / saith / that it
resists poison. And after he says: If one fear lest he drink poison / or
to be stoge of a venomous best / let him take.3.j. of the sede / with ye leaves
thereof / dryke it with wine / and a nut stamped and mingled to gether. And
Aristotell in his book de animalibus says / that when the wesill will feyght
with the edder / or the toode / she eats few first and sleeth the other: For
the smelle of few is foo to poison. The eating of few in the morning with
figs sweet almondes / preserves from venom. Here is to be noted / yt there
be.ij. kinds of few. ii. kyedes of rue.
The one is garden few / ye other is wild few. The garden few is better
than the field few. For the field few is excedynge dry. Hit is hot / dry
in the.iiij. degree: wherefore it is hurtful to take much thereof. The gardeyne
few is moist hot and dry in the.ij. and.iij. degree. It pierces and
resolves ventosite / and specially / if it be dry. For Serapion in the chap.
of few saith / that dry few of al medicines for ventosites is the best / and
most wholesome: but moist it engenders ventosite. Also few vehemently
quickens the sight / and specially the ieuse thereof / with the ieuse of
fenell / and honey made in an oyntement orels eaten / as Auicen says in
the.ij. canon and chap. of few. But yet for as much as the ieuce of few hath
a proprete hurtful to the eyes / it were best to fan wind upon your eyes
there with: in no wise to tuche your eyes with ye material few. The.iiij. is
peers: Peers.
whereof Auicen.ii. can. cap. de piris / saith: that they be wholesome against
mortal diseases engedred by mushroms or toode stools. For peers / sod with
mushroms / do alaye their hurtefulnes. Orels this text may be vnderstade by
peers aromatike / which by reason of their sweet smell / comfort the spiritis
and so repel poison. The.v. is radishes: Radyshe coolis.
whereof Auicen in his second canon / and chap. of them saith: that they be
wholesome against bytynge of a snake: and broke with wine it is good against the
bytynge of ye be cornute: and the sede thereof is good against all venomes.
And the sede of radish laid upon a scorpion / hit sleeth him / and the water
thereof hath in that behalf ben proved / and it is stronger than the sede: and
if a scorpion bite one that hath eaten radish / hit shall not hurt him. Hit
is also very good against chokynke of mushroms. Or hit may be said hit is
good against venom / because hit provokes one to vomit: and so by reason of
vomit / the stomach is purged of ill humours. And here is to be noted / that
radish and radish rootis are like of coplectio / which are vnholsom for
colerike folk: for they engendre sharpe prickynge blood: and radish is
vnholsome for the stomach / for hit makethe one to belch / and engenders
gross humours. And if the digestio be feeble / hit engedreth raw humours: yet
it is of a subtle and percyng nature. But some men eat radyshe after other
meatis to comfort digestion: whereat Galen maruayleth. And counnynge physicians
say / that if it be eaten after other meates / it helps digestion: and
vnlosethe the bealye. But if radish be eaten before other meates / hit
lygftethe upward the meat / and causes one to vomit. But it is good to
eat a small quatite with vinegar and salt / after other meat. Yet never the
less they hurt the eyes and the heed. Rasis.iij. Alm. saith / that radish /
lyenge loge in the stomach / void fleume / the leaves whereof digests meat /
and helps the appetite / take in a small quatite. The.vj. is triacle / which
of every sort is good against venom: Triacle.
and therefore hit is good both for man and beast / against venom / as well
cold as hot. And under the name of triacle the noble medicine Metridatis
may be comprehended: which.ij. be like in operation. For Auicen of triacle
says: Auice.vi.iiii. cract. iii. cap. i.
Ye shall understand / that the greatest rule in curing of venom is to
comfort natural heate: and to labour to drive hit out / as triacle doth. And
of triacle and the medicine Metridate to gether / Auice.vi.iiii. tract. i. ca.
de med. comun.
Auicen says: There be certain medicines contrary to venom: which will
not suffer venom to approach ne'er the heart / as triacle and Metridate.

Aer sit mundus / habitabilis / ac luminosus.
Nec sit infectus / nec olens fetore cloace.
This text declares.iiij. things touching the choice of wholesome air. Of
which the first is / Choice of wholesome air.
that one ought to chose a clean air / not enfected with vapours: For
unclean aier alters ye hart after the nature of the coplection / yt it is
mingled with / Haly. iii. (...) in cometo illius ^.
as Haly saith. The.ij. is / one shulde chose light air: For dark aier
makethe a man heavy and dull spirited: for such aier myngleth it self with
the humours in mans body / and so trubled runs to the heart: whereby of it
and of the humours / gross and troublous spiritis ben engendered / which make
one lumpyshe slow. Therefore there is nothing makes a ma more jocund and
less heavy / than to walk in a clear aier / or to rise yearly. The.iij. is /
that we ought to eschew infected aier / yt is where slaughter of people hath
been. For commonly in those places where as great slaughter of people hath been
/ and in places ne'er to / follows great pestilence: for when we draw in the
infect aier / hit enfecteth the spiritis in our body. The.iiij. is / we
shulde eschew gunges / synkes / gutters / channels / stinkynge ditches / and
all other particular places infected with carreine / placis where deed carkeses
or deed folks bones are caste / and places where hemp and flacce is wattered.
For aier so enfected enfecteth the spiritis of our body / Auice.ii.i. ^octri^
cap* ii.
and specially hurts the brain. And therefore Auicen says / that as lunge
as the aier is temperate and clear / and no substance contrary to mans nature
mingled there with / hit causes and conserveth mans helthe. And when hit is
changed / it doth contrary to the operation thereof: And for a more
declaration of the forsaide thingis / witteth well / that aier in the regiment
of helthe is necessary.ij. ways. First / for the refreshynge of the heart.
Secondly / for the avoiding out of fumishe su{per}fluites / that trouble the
spirit and natural heate. For like as we se by exterior things / the fire
without fannynge of the aier is schoked quenched: so like wise we may imagine
that the spiritis and natural heate in man have need to norishe conserve and
attempre them. The atteperace of natural heate is caused by drawing of the aier
/ and his purgynge is caused by expulsynge of the aier. The first is done by
motion of the attraction / the second by motion of expulsio. Therefore if we
draw in aier stynkyge vnclene / it corrupts the natural heate and spirit.
Therefore the aier shulde be of good substance / without vapours and mistis. The
aier shulde not be troublous cloudy / nor myxed with ill vapours. For such
aier troubles the humours / and makes a man heavy and sad / as is before
said. The open aier would be chosen / and not between walls or houses: and
truly to speak the shut aier shulde de eschewed. Yet never the less in time
of pestylence / when the aier chancethe to be enfected / the shut aier is to
be chosen. Therefore at such seasons / hit is good for us to abide within our
houses / and to keep our wyndowes fast shut / lest the putrified aier enter
in: But else the open aier is best. Farther in the regiment of helthe / the
aier shulde be eschewed / which is myxed with vapours of lakes / and deep
pittis conteinynge stynkynge waters: and of certain herbs / as cole wortes /
homlockes / and such like: and of trees / as fig trees walnutte trees.
Farther the aier is to be chosen / wherein the wind blowethe from high or
eagle gronde. And also we ought to take good heed / that the aier exceed not in
any of his first qualitees / that is in heate / cold / moystute / and
drought / which if hit chance / hit must be tempered by craft as much as is
possible. These things Auicen teaches.ii. primi. doct. ii. de diuersis.

St tibi serotina noceat potatio vina /
Hora matutina rebibas / et erit medicina.
This text teaches one doctrine / which is / if a ma be diseased by drykynge
of wine over night / He must on the morrow a fresh drink wine again. For
either drinking of wine over night causes dronkenes / thyrst in the morning
/ or inflammation of the body. If hit inflame the body / than hit is right
vnholsome again in the morning to drink wine a fresh / for that were to lay
fire to fire: But if one hap to be drunk there with parbrake a little: than
hit were wholesome to drink wine again a fresh in the morning. For the
drinking of wine again / than doth lightly cause one to vomit / whereby the
stomach is cleansed: For by that clensynge / the hurt of drokennes and
parbrakynge gothe lightly away. And therefore Hippocrates counsayleth to be
drunken ones a month: that of the dronkennes may come vomit: which thing
preserves us from ill diseases of lunge continuance. If drinking of wine over
eve hurt one / and that by reason he is not accustomed to drink wine: than he
may drink wine in the morning / to accustom him: and so the drinking of
wine shall less hurt him. For as Hippocrates saith / Hipp. ii. aphorismo. Ex
multo tepore c.
of a customable thing comes less grefe. But in case that thyrstynes in the
morning follows on drinking of wine over eve: than to drink water in the
morning / shulde cool his thirst better. For as much as we have spoken of
hurt coming by drynkynke of wine: witteth well / that a {per}soon having a
feeble brain / and eke of what so ever other condition he be / he ought most
circumspectly to beware of dronkennes. For oft dronkenes / as Auicen saith:
Auic. iii.i. ca. de regi. de aque vini. Six incoveniences engendered of
dronkennes.
causes.vj. inconveniences. Of whom the first is corruption of the livers
coplection. For wine excessively taken / coming to the liver / resolves the
heate thereof: whereby the liver loses his natural generation of blood: and in
stead of blud / engenders wattrishenes / causynge the dropsye / or hit
cuttethe the liver or the humours thereof / whereby lepre or wodnes is engendered.
The.ij. is / corruption of the brains complexion / through thycke and
continual assendynge of fumes of the wine thereto / disposynge the hot brain
to wodnes and frenesye: the cold to the falling yuel / forgetfulness / and
palsy. The.iij. is weakes of the senowes. For we se that these dronkerdes / as
well in youth as in age have the palsy in ye heed / other their mebres.
The.iiij. is diseases of the senowes / as the cramp palsy. For su{per}fluous
drinking of wine / oftymes turns to vinegar in the stomach / which
hourtethe the senowes. Also often times / for fault of digestion / hit turns
in to vndigested wattrishenes / which mollifies the senowes. And often times
it induces gross humours to the senowes / whereby they be stretched out / or
drawn to gether. The.v. is the palsy / through humidites of the brain /
increased by the wine: so yt they stop holly the ways of the lyfely spiritis
/ procedynge from the brain to the other members. The.vj. is sudden death /
for while the dronkerde snortethe or slepethe / his wind pipes / through
abundance of wine / or humidites thereof engendered / are closed / whereby he is
suddenly strangled. And though the immoderate drinking of wine causes ye
forsaid incouenieses: Yet wine moderately taken / is wholesome diverse ways. And
Auice in ye before allegate chap. rehearses.v. bonties of wine moderately drunk.
The first is / ^. bonties of wine moderately drunk.
that hit easily conveys ye meat / that hit is mingled with / to al the
mebres of the body / through the heate / subtillite / and hyd convenient
proprete thereof. The.ij. is / hit digestethe fleume / and resolves hit
through the heate and subtilite of his substance / making hit apt to avoid
out / opening the ways / and cofortynge nature to drive hit out. The.iij. is
/ hit avoids red colour by urine / and by other insensible vacuations / as
sweat and such like. And this is to be understand of claret wine / or white
/ that is feeble of his nature / or alayde with water: or else hit would
encreace coler / by tournynge it self in to coler / and inflammation of the
liver. The.iiij. is / hit makethe melancholy / which is gross and moves
slowly / easily to slyde by hit propre pypes / from the liver to the spleen /
and from the spleen to the brymme of the stomach: and at last / with the
dregs / to avoid out of the body. And hit declines or represses the hurt
of melacoly / through contrariousnes of complexion / and manner of substance /
in the effectis thereof. For melancholy engedreth heuynes / feintnes of heart /
covetousness: Propreties of melancholy and of wine.
But wine engenders joy / boldness / stoutnes of stomach and liberalite.
The.v. is / hit resoluethe all causes of werynes / outcepte it be myxt with
some other heate. For wine revives the resolute spiritis again abundantly /
and comfortethe natural virtue / and takes away or diminishethe humidites
left in the musculs / senowes of the heart / or in the joints. And if the
body dried by werynes / needs moystynge / wine moystethe hit quickly / so it
be alaide with water. Farther more besides these wine hath many other good
propretees. For above all other thyges wine is a swefte and a sudden
nourisher: hit comfort the heate and natural spirit / and heteth all the
body / hit clereth the wit / appeseth anger / puts away heuynes / and
stereth to bodily lust. And no dryke digests raw humours so well. And wine
makes one manlye both in stomach and body. And they that drink no wine are
nothing in regard of their equals that drink wine / neither in stomach nor
courage.

Gignit et humores melius vinum meliores.
Si fuerit nigrum / corpus reddit tibi pigrum.
Vinum sit clarum{que} / vetus / subtle maturum.
Ac been limphatum saliens moderamine sumptum.
This text declarethe one doctrine of wine: and that is / the better wine is /
the better humours it engedreth. The cause is / for black wine is more gross
and erthie than other: therefore the spiritis thereof engendered be gross: Like
as hit is proved by Gal. saying before. Gross spiritis make the body heavy or
slow. vii. doctrines to cho^ wine.
And farther there are put.vij. doctrines touching election of wine. The first
is / the wine ought to be clear. For such wine by reason that hit is subtle /
engenders subtle and clear spiritis. The.ij. is / hit ought to be old and
not new. For new wine or must doth sooner over come ones brain / and make one
have the laske / than other of the apparel: hit engedreth the colike / and other
accidentis / that shall be declared after / when we come to / Impedit vrinam.
Nor ye shulde not understand / that wine ought to be to old. For such wine /
Auic. iii.i. ca. de regimine aque ^ vini.
as Auice saith / is as a medicine / and not as drink. For such wine doth
rather alter a temperate body to heate and drought / tha nourish it: hit is of
small norishemet. For when hit is so very old / hit receives again hit
first natural verdure and sharpness / and is than all firye: wherefore the
aggregatour / in the chap. de vite / by authorite of Galen writethe / that hit
is hot and dry in the.iij. degree. The.iij. is / that wine ought to be
subtle. For subtle wine makes the spiritis of ma subtle / and gross wynes
gross spiritis. The.iiij. is / wine shulde be ripe / and not vert or eager /
orels hit will deprive man of all his natural vacuations and good helthe / as
Galen saith in the comet of the canon.iii. part. reg. acut. And therefore hit is
hurtful for them / that want evacuation by urine and all other their upper
mebres. Yet as Gal. in the same place says / such wine stypticall / is
wholesome for diseases that chance in the guts. Yet as Galen says there / the
stypticalnes of the wine would be put away by much mynglynge of water. The.v.
is / that wine should be alayde with water: For thereby the fumosite of the wine
is put away: and so ouercometh the brain less. This is treuth / if the wine
be subtle / but if hit be gross / hit ouercometh the brain the sooner: for
thereby it is subtiled made more fumyshe. And of this wine Auicen understood
when he said / Auic. ^ii.i. ca. de regimine aque et vini.
that wine alaide with water doth sooner over come the brain than pure wine.
The.vj. is / wine shulde be sprinkelynge / when one tastethe hit: and this is
one of the conditions of good wine / before said. The.vij. is / taken of the
drynkers condition / and not of the wine: that is / we must drink wine
teperately: For wine temperatly taken / sharpeth the wit / and engedreth all
the wholesome things before declared. By all these. things here expressed we
may conclude / that wine most to be chosen and best in the regiment of health
is mean wine / eagle between old and new / clear / some what red / of good
odour and flauour / of eagle savour / that is neither eager / sharpe / nor
sweet: which is not gross / nor to much subtle: and eke that hit be not to
strong nor to weak: and that hit grow not on stony hylly ground / nor on
simble plain earable ground / but on high ground / lyenge open toward the
southe / in a country not to hot nor to cold. And these thyges are partly
gathered out of Gal. iij.j. the place before allegate. Touching the regimet of
wine / cocernyng the ages / the rules that Auicen puts in ye above allegate
place / are to be noted. The first is / to give children wine to dryke / is as
one laid fire to fire of dry wodde. For children be tender and soon inflamed
/ through thabundace of their natural heate / their senowes and brain be
weak feeble. Wherefore wine hurts them many ways. First by quick inflammation
/ by strykynge of the brain / by lightly percynge of the senowes / and
abundant fumosite. Therefore when one gyuethe wine to children to drink / the
flamynge heate of the wine is added to ye flamynge heate of chyldre bodies /
which is of small resistance / as dry styckes / reeds / or tow is against
the fire. The.ij. rule is / that one give an old man as much wine to drink
as he can bear without hurt / that is / as much as his natural and due
appetite desires. For like as old bootis and buskyns that be dry and
wrynkeled / are made soupull and plain with oil / like wise ben the bodies of
old folks by drinking of chosen wine / as wine of Beuuois. Ancient folks
are cold / and wine heats / their spirit is heavy / and they be fulle of
melancholy: but wynes makes them merry / and represses melacolyes: and commonly
old folks sleep ill / but wine makethe them to sleep well. They be prone to
opilations / but wine opens and lets them. And so / like as wine to
children is most contrary / so for old folks hit is most wholesome. The.iii.
is / that young folks drink wine temperatly / temperately is / touching
measurable quantite / and convenient alayenge with water. And al though young
folks are as hot as children / yet they have their mebres more sound / the
senowes and brain more strong / whereby they may the stronglyer resist the
hurt of wine drinking. There follow many good things of drinking wine
soberly / that is to say / the voidynge of coler / the quickenynge of the
corporal might and wit / and the abundance of subtle spiritis.

Non sit acetosa ceruisia / sed been clara /
De validis cocta granis satis ac veterata.
This text declares.v. thyges to chose good ale by. First that hit be not
sower / for that hurts the stomach. A sower thing / as Auicen saith in many
places / hurts the senowes / for ye stomach is a mebre full of senowes / and
that is touching the brynke. The.ij. is that ale must be clear: for troubled
ale is a stopper / and hurtethe them over much that have the stone / hit
fattethe and enflatethe and makes one short wynded / and engenders much
fleme. The.iij. is / ale should be made of good corn not corrupt / that is to
say of the best barley / wheat or ^otis: for the better ye corn is / the
better is the humour thereof engendered. The.iiij. is / that ale ought to be
well sod: for it is the better digested / and more amiably received of
nature: and the incouenietis thereof growing / are the better borne. For ale not
well sod engenders vetosites in the bealy / gnawynge / inflasio / and
colike. The.v. is / ale ought to be stale well purged / and not over new. For
new ale engenders the same hurt that ale doth that is not well sod: and
there with most easily causes the strain coilion.

De qua potatur / stomacus non inde grauetur. Here is taught one lesson
touching ye use of ale. That we must drink it moderately / so that the stomach
be not hurt thereby / nor drokennes caused. For hit is worse to be drunk of
ale than of wine / and lodger dureth: the fumes and vapours of ale that ascend
to the heed are gross / wherefore they be not so resoluable / as they that be
moted up by wine. Where upon it is to be noted / that in the beginning of
dinner or soupper / hit is holsomer to drink ale before wine: the cause is /
for at ye beginning of our repast or dinner / the body is hungry: so ye stomach
before we began to eat meat was hungry / and so drew superfluites from the
mebres. Therefore if we begin with wine / for that nature greatly desirethe
hit / for the great norishemet thereof: the su{per}fluites / to gether with ye
wine drawn of the stomach / are drawn to the parties of the body: but nature
so desirously draws not ale. Like wise ale washes ye humours hagynge about
the brymme of the stomach. And for this cause physicians counsel / that when
one is most hungry he shulde first assay to vomit or he eat any meat /
that those su{per}fluites draw to gether of the hungry stomach / may be
voided out / lest they be mingled with the meat. Like wise he that fears to
be thyrsty by superfluous drinking of water / shulde drink ale: For it
quecheth unnatural thyrste.

Temporibus veris modicum prandere iuveris.
Sed calor estatis dapibus nocet immoderatis.
Autumni fructus caueas. no sint tibi luctus.
De mensa sum quantum vis tempore Brume.
Here is determined what quatite of meat should be eaten / Diet after
the.iiii. seasons of the year.
after the diuersite of the.iiij. seasons of ye year / which are ver or
spring time / summer / autumn / and winter. He says that in the time of ver
/ we must eat little meat. The same wills Auicen / shows the reason why
/ because / Auice. ii.i. doct. ii. ca. vi..iii.i. doct. v. de reg. tpm cum
recti auris.
saith he / in winter mans body is not greatly given to labour and exercise /
through prohibution of resolution / raw humours are increased / and specially
fleumatike: which after the {pro}portion of the season / tha specially be
engendered: which humours by reason of cold / are enclosed in the body. But
when ver or spryngetyme comes / it causes these raw humours / gethered to
gether / to melt and sprede through all the body: wherefore nature is than
greatly occupied in digestynge of them. Therefore in ver season / if one eat
much meat / hit lets nature to digest such fleumatike humours / and
shulde be diverted an other way: for by these humours and great quatite of
meat nature should be over pressed. And so such humours shulde remain in the
body vndigested: and runnynge to some membre / shulde cause some disease there.
And therefore we ought to take good heed / that we eat no great quantite of
meat in ver. For diminishion of meat in this season / is a special
preservation from diseases reynynge in ver / as Auicen says.ij.j. the place
before allegate. And this saying is of a truth / from the midst to the end
of ver / and not in the beginning: for the beginning of ver is likened to
winter: wherefore than one may norishe the body as well as in winter. And this
also may be understand when vere find the body full of humours / than meat
is to be given after the natural heate and resolution / that is caused of the
body: for than the cause is avoided: for which meat should be diminished. And
the same wills Hipp. j. aphorismoru / where he saith: Bealies in winter and
vere are most hot / and sleep most lunge. Therefore in those seasons / for
the natural heate is much: therefore hit needs larger norishement. Secondly
he says / that to eat to much meat in somer is hurtful: because than the
virtue of digestion is feeble: For the spiritis and natural heate / which are
the instumentes of corporal operation / are than right feeble / sparcled / and
resolute / through outward heate / vehemently drawing them to the exterior
partis: and contrary wise / much meat can not be digested. And here is to be
noted / that for the vehement resolution of humidites / as well substaciall / as
mutrymentall of the body / grosser and more meat in somer shulde be eaten /
if the night digestiue could digest so much meat: but because nature can
not digest much at ones / we must eat a little / and oft: The reason that
one ought to eat little meat in summer.
as Galen says in the comet of this Canon / Et quibus semel aut bis c. In
somer we must eat many times and little: many times because the body hath
need through oft dissolution: a little / for defaute of digestion. And al
though little meat shulde be eaten in the summer / yet one may drink much:
for than is greatter resolution and drought of the body: and the natural heate
of the body excedeth the moisture thereof: and man is more thyrsty than / than
other times. But yet than one ought to drink less wine / specially if hit be
pure / for such wine soon enflames / and causes the natural heate / hat
by the ardent heate of somer / to burn / and therefore if we drink wine / we
must myngle hit with much water: and we must forbear old strong wine.
Thyrdly he saith / To avoid eating of fruit in Autune.
that in Autune we ought to beware of fruit / specially of ye same season / as
grapis / peches / figgis / and such like: or at least to eat but little of
them / for such frutis engendre blood / apt to putrefy / through the
boyllyng that they make in the body humours: specially if they be received in
to an vnclene stomach / or a corrupt body / which for the most part chances
in autumn. And so than / ill and fylthy diseases are engendered / as the pockes
and other pestilent sickenesses. Yet for a farther knowledge of the regiment of
meat and drink in Autumn / wytteth well / that in harvest / hunger and
thyrste shulde be eschewed / to eat much meat at one meal: as Rasis.iij.
Alm saith / cap. de reg. corporis secundum tps. The wine also that is drunk in
harvest / shulde be alayde with much water / that hit may moist the body /
and cole the heate: but not so superfluously alayde with water than / as in
somer: nor to be than drunk so superfluouslye: for tha nature febled / is not
able to weld and digest it: and to much alayenge with water / would distroye
natural heate / encreace vetosites: whereby ye colike may be engedred. Fourthly
he saith / yt in winter we may eat as much as we will / that is to say /
more tha in other seasons / after the mind of Auicen in.iij.j. the place before
allegate. And Galen saith / in the canon of the aphoris. E^ quibus semel aut c.
In winter much meat leiserly shulde be eaten. The reason is because the heate
of our body in winter is strongest / both by reason hit is conieled to gether /
and fortified / by position of his contrary / that is to say / the coldness of
the aier / enuironynge our bodies about. And this is verified in big bodies
fleshie / and not in bare and feeble: for on such bodies coldenes of winter
inclined doth not coforte with heate / but feblethe them more: For in winter as
Hippocrates saith: bealies be hottest of nature and sleep most lunge. Hit
follows / that the grosser norishementis and harder of digestion are holsomer
in winter than in other seasons / by cause the heate is stronger. But the wine
that we must drink than ought to be ruddy as a rose / and not white / and
alayde with a little water. Here is to be noted / that all though / through
the strength of heate / and virtue of digestion in winter / the gross and
strong meatis are holsomer: yet because the seasons than are disposed to
opilations and repletions / through very much fleme / hit were wholesome than
to use mean meates / between heavy and lyghte / gross subtle / as kydde /
veale / mutton / pikes / perch / and creuesses. And they that use grosser
meates / as befe / pork / venson / gottis flesh / such like / shulde eat
but one meal a day: orels to use meatis laxative / as persly / cressis /
mustert / and such like / and to use great labour.

Saluia cum ruta faciunt tibi pocula ^uta.
Add rose florem minuet potenter amorem.
Here are put.ij. remedies against ill drink. Herbs wholesome to put in drink.
The first is sage / the leaves whereof put in to the drink fordothe the hurt
of hit / with it proprete / and also hit comfort the senowes and brain:
which comforted / resist the better the i'll fumes / that of the ill drink
ascend there unto. The.ij. is rue / whose leaves hole without any brusynge /
shulde be put in to the drink / for with hit heate proprete / it fordoth the
malice of the drink. And howe good rue is against poison / hit hath been
declared before at / Allea nux / tuta c. And this text says / to the.ij.
forsayde herbs / we may put the rose flower. And this specially shulde be
understand of a red rose: for the sweet smell stipticalnes thereof / amends
the malice of the drink.

Nausea non poterit quem{quam} vexare marina.
Aurea cum vino mixtam si sumpserit illam.
A remedy for parbrakynge on the see.
Here is put a remedy to avoid parbrakynge or spuynge / for such as are not
accustomed to pass the see. He that will pass the see / must a few days
before he take shyppynge / myngle the see water with his wine. This is a
remedy for the rich: but if hit be a poor man / than he must drink see
water / that he may easelyer eschew spuynge. The reason hereof is / because
the see water is salt: and so with his saltnes and stipticite / that follows
saltnes / it closes the mouth of the stomach / and thereby fordothe spuynge.
And here is to be noted / that as Auicen says / a trauayler on the see /
Auic. iii.i. de reg. iter agentis in mari.
shulde not much go about to withstade or to forbear parbrakynge or spuynge /
at the beginning / but to vomit / until he think him self well purged: for
that preserves from many diseases / and not only preserves / but also heals
or alleuiateth grievous great diseases / as lepre / dropsye / palsy / coldness
and swellynge of the stomach. Thus says Auicen.iii.i. doct. ii. ca. ii. But
in case that the travailer on the see spue so much / that he thereby is right
greatly febled / he must^ than restrain hit by eating fruit stypticall and
sower / as ben vnrype fruit / crabs / sower pomegarnades and such like:
wherewith the mouth of the stomach is comforted / humours expelled down: and
also the stomach thereby comforted / driuethe away humours flowynge there unto
by tossing of ye water. Orels we may take musterte sede dried by the fire /
and drink hit with wine / or wormewode may be eaten or drunken / or a toste
wet in redolent wine is good to eat. And generally tart meates be good for
travailers on the see / for they comfort the stomach / and prohibit vapours
fumes to ascede to the heed / as herbs sod in vinegar / or in the ieuse of
sower grapes.

Saluia / sal / vinum / piper / allea / petrocilium.
Ex his fit salsa / nisi sit comixio falsa.
This text teaches us to make a common sauce if we lack a better. To make a
common sauce.
And.v. thyges goth to the making of this sauce. The first is sage. Wherewith
we may make sauce for a goose roast or sod. For commonly a goose roasted or a
pygge is stopped with sage / to draw up the humidites and clamynes of them /
and also because the flesh shulde smell some what thereof: yet after it is
roasted / the sage shulde be cast away and not eaten. Like wise of sage
vplandyshe folk make a sauce to eat with a goose: for they stamp sage and
garlyke to gether / that the sage may abate some what of the garlykes savour.
The.ij. is salt with wine: this sauce is for rich and noble men. For when
they want mustert / or ver ieuse / they put wine in a saucer / myngle hit with
a little salt. The.iij. is pepper / vplandyshe folks sauce. For they myngle
pepper with beans and peasen. Like wise of breadde tosted / with ale or wine /
with pepper they make a black sauce / as it were pap / that is called pepper /
and that they caste upon their meat flesh and fysshe. The fourth is garlyke /
where of the vplandishe people make a sauce: for they myngle soft chese and
milk / and stamp garlyke to gether / and so eat hit with their meat /
whether it be roast or sod / salt or fresshe / and with harde eggs. The.v.
is perslye: the leaves whereof staped / with ver ieuse or white wine is made a
grene sauce to eat with roast meat. And here is to be noted / that sauce or
sauces vary after the seasons. For in hot seasons / hit must be made of
cold things / or of stuff of little heate / and in cold seasons contrary
wise. Therefore summer sauce shulde be ver ieuse / or eysell / or vinegar / the
ieuse of lemons / or of pom garnades with rose water and such like. And other
while in sauces made in somer / one may put a little pellitorie persly / to
attempre the coldenes of the forsayde things. But the mattier of copetent
sauces in winter are musterte / carloke / gynger / pepper / cynomum / gelofers /
garlyke / sage / myntes / pelitorie / perslye: wine water of flesh / vinegar
not to strong / but very ne'er to the nature of wine: And in mean seasons /
they shulde be mean / neither to hot nor to cold. Secondly sauces differ by
reason of the meates for which they be made: for one meat will have one sauce
/ an other meat a another sauce: as lordis cokes know. Sauce for mutton /
veale and kydde is grene sauce / made in somer with vinegar or ver ieuse / with
a few spices / without garlyke / with persly / white gynger / ver ieuse / and
tosted breadde with vinegar. In winter the same sauces be made with many spices
/ a little quatite of garlyke / and of the best wine / and with a little ver
ieuse / or with mustert. Sauce for roasted befe is made with pepper / tosted
breadde / broth of flesh and grapes. And the same sauce is good in winter to
eat with pork. Also pork in summer may be eaten with vinegar and perslye in
the beginning of our repast. But in case / the forsayde meates be baked /
specially befe pork / in winter / than serve in a white oynion / and a small
quatite of sweet spice beaten in powder. But in somer without oynions / and
with ver ieuse / orels with a few small oynions. But if the pastis be made of
more tender flesh and light of digestion / serve in there with no oynions: but
in somer almon milk with ver ieuse / and a little blanch powder: and at the
last ye may put thereto / an egg broke with ver ieuce. But in winter in stead
of ver ieuse take wine / and more spice. With roasted rabbattis and chekyns /
sauce made with cynomume / Divers good sauces for sondry meates
crumes of breadde / and with ver ieuse in somer is wholesome / and in winter
with wine. For roasted pork take of the dryppynge / tempered with good wine and
oynions in winter: and in summer take the grene sauce above named. For roasted
fesantes / pigeons / and turtyls / take none other sauce but salt. For boylde
capons and cocks take of the same broth with a little blache powder. And
precisely if they be boiled with sage / Isope / persly / this is good sauce in
winter: and in somer / the broth of the capon / and a little vergis mingled
to gether is a wholesome sauce. For fat capons henes baked / serve in none
other sauce / but a small quantite of blanch powder: and at the end the
above named grene sauce in somer / and in winter good wine. But fish the
grosser it is / the harder of digestion / the more superfluous / and moyster of
nature / the more hit needs hot sauces and sharpe: and the same rule is like
wise true in all manner of flesh.

Si fore vis sanus ablue sepe manus
Lotio post mensam tibi confert munera bina

Here are declared.ij. wholesome things that come by washing of our hands
after meat. The first is / the palm of our hands are modified. The.ij. is /
our sight is sharped there by / and that is specially by accidens / for the
hades be ye instrumetis to cleanse the eyes: and hit is right wholesome for them
to be modified: whereof we have before spoken at Lumina mane manus.

This text touches.ij. things concerning the choice of breadde. The first
is heate. For bread ought not to be eaten hot. Eating of hot bread
Hot bread is hurtful to mans nature: as Auicen saith.ii. ca. de pane. Hot
bread is not convenient for mans nature: and bread that comes hot from the
oven is vnholsome. The reason is / because it stops much. And again after
he saith: Hot bread through hit heate causes thyrstynes: and swymmeth by
reason of his vaporous humidite: is of quick digestion / and of slow
discence. And all though hot breadde in the regiment of helthe be vnholsome
to eat / yet ye smell thereof is right wholesome / hit relyuethe one in a sownde:
and hit is possible / that some folks may live by the smelle of new breadde.
The.ij. is / we ought not to eat breadde very stale / or mouldy: for such
breadde is vnholsome for the nourishement of mans nature: for it driethe the
body / and engendrethe melancholy humours: whereon hit folowethe / that bread
shulde not be to new nor to stale / but a day old. Farther the text
declarethe.v. propretes of good breadde. v. {pro}pretes of good bread.
The first / hit must be well leuende / as Gal.i. alimentorum / ca. ii. saith:
The best breadde for digestion / is hit that is very well leuende / and baked
in an oven hat with moderate fire. And again in the same chap. he says:
Vnleuende bread is wholesome for no body. And after the mind of Auicen / Breadde
made with little leven / Auicen.ii. can. cap. de pane.
nourishethe much / but the norishement thereof is a stopper / outcepte they
eat it / that labour much. The.ij. is / that bread ought to be light / for
thereby is known / that the clamynes is gone. Yet never the less this bread /
after the mind of Auicen / in the chap. and place before said / is a swefte
entrer / and of less and worse nourishemet / as bread is / made of much
bran. The.iij. is / that bread ought to be well baked: for breadde ill baked
is of ill digestion / and engendrethe grefe in the stomach. And Auicen in the
forsaide canon and chap. saith: That the bread ill baked / nourishes very much
/ but the norishement causes opilations / outcepte they labour much that eat
it. And bread baken on a stone or in a pan is of the same fashion: for hit is
never well baked with in. The.iiij. is / that bread ought to be temperately
salted. For bread over sweet is a stopper / over salt a dryer. But bread
moderately salted nourishes best / so it have the other conditions. The.v. is
/ that it shulde be made of the best grain / that is to say / of ye best
wheat. More over the text warnethe us to beware of crustis eating: for they
engendre adust coler / or melancholy humours / by reason they be burned and
dry. And therefore great estates / which of nature be colerike / cause the
crustis above and benethe to be chypped away. Wherefore the pith or the crume
shulde be chosen / which is of more and swyfter noryshemet than the crust.
Yet not withstanding crustis are wholesome for them that be hole / and have
their stomach moist / and desire to be lean / but they must eat them after
they have dined. For they enforce the meat to discende / and coforte the
mouth of the stomach. Farther / in the.ij. and last verses is mentioned /
that good bread ought to have these.v. conditions / that is / ye hit be salted /
leuende / well baked / made of good corn / that is / that ye corn be pure /
reaped / gethered / shefte / and housed in due season. And these conditions
Auicen remebreth in the forsayde place / saying: Hit behooves that bread be
pure / salted / leuende / well baked / and a day old. And here is to be noted
/ that if one desire to norishe his body / he must have his breadde made of
pure flower / the bran clean taken out: if one will be leaner / leave some
bran therein. For bran norishethe but little / and vnlosethe the bealye /
and flower doth contrary wise.

Est caro porcina sine vino peior ouina.
Si tribuis vina / tunc est cibus medicina.
Here in this text pork is compared to mutton. If pork be eat without wine
it is less wholesome than mutton / but pork eaten with wine / nourishethe best
/ and it is medicinable: for hit moysteth much. And is to be understand
specially of roasted pygges / and braun well dyghte. And here is to be noted /
that pork / salted / or dried in the smoke / such as men of the country use /
called bakon / are in no manner wise so wholesome as mutton / whether hit be eaten
with wine or no: but hit is understand by roasted pork / or pig / or braun
/ as is before said.

Ilia porcorum bona sunt / mala sunt reliquorum. This text says / that hog
tripes / be better than of other beastis. The reason is / by cause we eat few
entrails / outcepte they be full of blud / and of very fat beastis / as
hogs be. Now only hoggis blood / through the complexion / and similitude of
complexion with mans nature / is blood / of which the bowels be filled. And
like wise hoggis be sooner fat / than any other bestis. Therefore we eat
rather the tripes chitterlyges of an hog than of other bestis.

Impedit vrinam mustum / soluit cito ventrem.
Epatis infraxim splenis / generat lapidem{que}.
This text opens.v. incouenieces / that grow by drinking of new wine or
must. The first is / that must lets the urine: and this may be
understand.ij. ways. First / for gross must / through his grosnes / myxed
with the dregs / stoppethe the liver and the raynes / so that the urine can
not easily have hit course. Secondly / hit lettethe the urine of hit due course
/ as some reinnyshe must doth / and certain other subtle wynes like wise:
For there is some reynnyshe must / that whose lies are mordicat or bytynge:
while hit runs in to the bladder the erthye lies byte and prick the
bladder: and costrayne one to peace contrary to the due order and manner that
he was wont to do. The.ij. is / hit losethe the bealye / by reason that hit
scours the entrails / through the sharpnes of hit lies / hit pricks the
guttis to void out the ordeurs: first / through mordicatenes of the lies.
Secondly through vetosite / which such wine causes. Thyrdlye / by reason
hit makes ye guttis slyppry / by way of vndigestiblenes / and grefe of the
stomach / wherefore the stomach leuseth / and openethe the ways that were
shut. The.iij. is / that must hurtethe the good coplection of the liver: For
hit stops the liver through much mynglynge of hit lies: and causes disease
in the liver called dissenteria / through swellynge / whereby ye liver is
febled. Thus saith Auicen.iii.i. ca. de reg. aque vini. And thus it engedrethe
an ill colour / and ill diseases of the liver / that is to say spices of ye
dropsy. The.iiij. is / that must hurtethe the spleen and disposition thereof /
through the same cause that hit doth the liver: for hit stops the spleen:
and so causes it to be harde. The.v. is / that must engedreth the stone: and
specially that is in the reins: which is ruddy / and lightly frangyble / by
reason of opilation / that hit causes by hit gross substance. And this is
certain if the must be of very sweet wynes / whose lies be nothing bytynge
or sharpe. For must / that hath sharpe bytynge lies / preserves a man from
the stone: for hit makethe one to pysse often: as some reinyshe must / that
causes sand or gravel to be scene in the urine: oft provoking one to make
water: which oft making of water / washes away the small gravel / that
cleueth to a mans raynes / and so avoids hit.

Potus aque sumptus / sit edenti valoe nociuus.
Infrigidat stomachum. cibum nititur fore crudum.
Here are declared.ij. hurts / hurtis that comme by drinking of water.
that come by drinking of water. The first is / that drinking of water
hurts ones stomach that eats: by reason that water cools and leusethe the
stomach: and specially hit distroyeth the appetite. The.ij. is / that drinking
of water with meat lettethe digestio / for it makes ye meat received
rawyshe. After the mind of Auicen / Auic. iii.i. ca. de reg. eiu^ / quod
comeditur. Auic ca. de regi. aque et vini.
saying: Nor after meat / much water shulde not be drunken: For hit divides
the stomach and the meat / and causes hit to swim in the stomach. And he
saith: And when nature doth digest meat / and that sufficient quatite of
water be mingled therewith / than after that / if we drink more water / hit
lets very much the digestion that was begone. And again Auicen says:
Auicen. ii. can. tract. i. cap. iiii.
that drinking of water shulde be eschewed / outcepte hit be to help the
meat down / when hit stycketh or descends slowelye. But with meat water
shulde never be take or used. Auerrois in his comment shows the reason / when
we receive water upon meat / hit makes the stomach cold or it be through
hot: and makes the meat rawyshe: and eke causes the meat to swym in the
stomach: and hit is the cause: that the meat stycketh not fast there as it
shulde digest / as hit coueniently shulde. The operation of the stomach is / to
make a good myxion of things received there in / and to digest them well. That
done there follows an ordinary / and a natural separation of pure impure
things. And as a great quantite of water put in a pot slakethe the
sythynge of the meat therein: so like wise hit chances in the stomach / by
drinking of much water: But to drink a little quantite of cold water /
with our meat / before it descend down in to the stomach / is not forbydden
but allowable / specially if we be very thyrsty: for a little quatite of cold
wat / take after ye forsayde manner / easethe the stomach and quenchethe
thyrste. The coldness of the water enforcethe the heate of man to descede to the
very bottum of the stomach / and so fortifies the digestion thereof. Thus saith
Auice in the above allegate placis. But witteth well / that though water be
more convenient to quench thyrste than wine: yet wine for a mans helthe is more
wholesome than water. And though water universally quench thyrste better than
wine / because hit is cold and moist / yet to make natural and good comixion
of meates / and to coueie them to the extreme partis of mans body / wine is
better tha water. For wine through his subtle substance and operation /
myngleth it self better with the meat / than water doth: and nature delyteth
more in wine than in water: therefore the mebres draw wine more sooner unto
them / mynglynge hit with the meat. This mixynge in this manner is as a
boylynge or sethyng of things to gether: which is greatly help by the heate
of the wine: but warer with hit coldness / lets hit. So than it appears /
that wine in mynglynge with meat and delatynge of the same / is better than
water. For wine / by reason of hit subtilite of substance / and virtuous heate
is a marvelous percer. And so by consequens wine delateth or spreads more
tha water / wherein is no virtuous heate / nor substance of air nor fire: the
water lets ye passage thereof. Farther / water is not so wholesome drink as
wine: for water hyndrethe the norishement of the body: by reason hit
nouryshethe very little or nothing at all: So that the more wattrysshe that
meat is / the less hit nourishes. Therefore hit is very wholesome to drink wine
with our meat: for hit doth not hinder norishement / but greatly fordreth
hit: for wine is a special norishemet and restorative / and nourishes sweftely
/ as hit is before said. Farther / ye shall understand / that to dryke water
with meat / is not only hurtful / but also in many other cases / Auic. iii.i.
ca. de regimine aque ^ vini.
which are declared of Auicen. First hit is vnholsome for a ma to dryke
fasting: for hit pierces in to the body by all the principal members thereof:
mortifienge hit natural heate. This is of truth / if one that is truly
fasting drink hit. Yet for a drunken man / it is some time wholesome: nor it
hurts him not / though he dryke hit fasting: For a dronkerde fasting is not
utterly fasting / his stomach is not vacande / but some what remains of the
other days ingurgynge. But in whose nitrosite / water drunk in ye morning
doth mitigate: and the stomach / there with washed / the vapours fumes
repressed / is disposed to receive new sustinance. The.ij. hurt is to drink
water after great labour travail: and like wise after the fleshely act /
between ma and woman: For than the poris of the body be very open: whereby the
water entrethe in to the bottum of the members / mortifienge the natural heate.
Which heate also after the fleshely act is weaked. The.iij. incovenience is
after baynyng / specially / if one bayne him fasting: for than the cundites
and ways of the body be very open: wherefore the water entering in hurts /
as is before said. Auice.v^. quarti / s^ma.ii. ca. vltimo.
Of this drinking of water Auicen saith: That of water drunk tastynge / after
baynynge / and after carnal copulation / corruptynge of coplection dropsy is
to be feared. Fourthly / it is hurtful to drink cold water to queche feigned
thyrst / in the night / as hit chances to surfetters and drokerdes: For by
drinking of cold water / the resolution and digestion of salt humours are
prohibited / whether it be of wine or other sharpe things / causynge thyrste:
so soon after drink thyrste comes again / as strongly as before. But in
case the thyrste be so vehement / vexynge vnquietynge over much / that neither
coldenes of brethynge / nor washing of the mouth with cold water / can
suffice / than let the thyrstie dryke cold water / out of a narowe mouthed
vesselle or cup / or syppynge / that the water more slowlye may come unto
the brymme of the stomach: for so hit shall best quench thyrste / and less
thereof shall be drunk / and than it shall not utterly destroy digestion.
Fyftelye / generally / hit is ill for hole folks to drink much cold water
/ for hit quenches natural heate / grieves the breast / mars the appetite
of the stomach / and is very hurtful to all the senowye mebres. Yet never the
less water temperatly cold some time per accidence / stereth one to have an
appetite / and makes the stomach strong / helping hit / opening and
clensynge the ways thereof.

Sunt nutratiue multum arnes vituline. Here the author saith that veale
nourishes very much. And this Auicen affirms / saying / that meat that
conserveth health must be such as the flesh is. For they are of like nature /
very apt to be converted in to blood: and specially kydde / yonge suckynge
calves / and yerelynge lammes. And this veale Galen.iii. alimentorum / The
best veale.
preysethe highly / saying / that veale of.vj. or.viij. weeks old roasted /
is more wholesome than mutton / hit is soon digested / and nourishes very much.
And of these fleshes we have spoken before.

Sunt bona gallina / capo / turtur / sturna columba
Quiscula vel merula phasianus / ethigoneta.
Perdix / frigellus / orex / tremulus / amarellus.
The best fowls to eat.
This text shows what wild foul are most wholesome to eat / to nouryshe
mans nature. The nombre of them is.xiiij. The first is an hen: the which is
very wholesome to eat. For Haly / Auenzoart / and Mesue say / that the best
flesh of pultry is an hen / that never laid / of a cock / yt never trad
hen. For they without superfluite are soon turned in to blood: their
proprete is to tempre mans complexion: and their broth is the best medicine
that can be for lepers. And Galen saith / Galen. ii. can. ca. de g^inis ^
gallo.
that flesh of yonge pullettes / augmeteth intellection / hit clereth the
voice / and encreaceth the sede of generation. The.ij. is a capon / whose
flesh consiliator / in his.lxviij. question / nombreth among the most
wholesome fleshes. And these fleshes / and like wise the other before said / the
stomach of hit proprete / doth digest. The.iij. is a turtyll / which also
nourishes well / and engenders good blud. Auicen.ii. can. ca. d^ cane.
The flesh whereof Auicen highly preysethe / saying: There is no fowls
flesh better tha a turtyls or a hens / nor subtiler. But yet they are not so
nouryshynge as the pertriche. The.iiij. after the opinio of some is a stare.
This bird shulde be eat yonge. Some other call this foul Starna: which
Rasis.iij. Alm preisethe above al other fowls / saying: A sterlyngis flesh
is lyghtest of all other fowls / wholesome for them that will keep a sklender
diet: and by this may be understand a greatter foul / as a grey goose / the
flesh whereof / is right commendable / specially yonge. And on this wise Almans.
understands / preferrynge this flesh before other. Orels by a stare may be
vnderstade / certain small {per}triches: whereof Moyses seems to understand /
saying to the Iewes: Like wise stares are vnholsome for our king / for they
costreyne and indurate the bealye. And this proprete some ascribe unto
pertriches. For their flesh bind the bealy / as witnessethe Rasis.iij. Alm.
The.v. is a dove / whose flesh is colerike. Which / as Rasis saith / is
excedynge hot: the which engedreth blud fervently hot / and lightly
engedreth the ague. And therefore pigeons be better baked with sower grapis /
than roasted. For by the sower grapes / the heate engendered in the blood is
alayde. And the best to eat be yonge pigeons / ready to fly / for such be of
light digestion / and of better humour. For young pigeons / not able to flee /
are superfluously hot moist: whereby they engedre gross humours / as Auicen
saith the.ij. canon / chap. of pigeons. But old pigeons and their flesh / for
their over great heate / drought / and difficult of digestion / are to be
eschewed. And like wise old turtyls. The.vj. is a quail. Some doctors say
that a quail is of light substance / and engenders good blood: and is very
wholesome for hole folks. But after the mind of Isaac / quayles are worse than
any other wild foul: nor they for nourishement nor digestion ought to be
praised. For through eating of their flesh the cramp is to be feared. As
Auicen saith.ii. can. cap. de cotur. And he says the reason is in the
substance of their flesh / that they engendre the cramp. And for this reason
french me bake eat quayles with soft buttry chese. Yet by the quail may be
vnderstade an other bird a little more than the foresaid {per}triche / of the
same colour / with red feet and bylle / of a delicious savour. And on this
wise Rasis.iij. Alm takes a quail / when he prefers ye flesh thereof above
the flesh of a stare / and all other fowls. The.vij. is an osell: which like
wise shulde be eaten yonge. The.viij. is a phesande: which of all physicians
is nobred for one of the best fleshes. For the flesh of that foul is most
wholesome for mans nature: and it is meat for princis great estates. Consiliator
saith / that the wild fesante is best / both for health and strength. And also
perauenture universally / saying yt they are ne'er like unto henes / and welnere
of the same shappe. And they be drier of air and of fedynge / and larger of
exercise. The.ix. is a wodcocke / the flesh of this bird is specially
wholesome. The.x. is a pertriche: whose flesh as Auicen saith / is subtle /
Auicen.ii. can. ca. de cubigine. Gale.iii. alimetoru. cap. xvii. et.xviii. de
iugenio cap. ii.
a great fatter / hit scours away the dropsye / comfort the stomach / and
augments carnal lust. Yet never the less it is a bynder. And this flesh
Galen prefers above all other. And hit is said that customable eating of
this flesh / comfort the memory. The.xj. is a ruddocke / called robyn red
breast / she eatethe grapis / and fleethe sweftly as a stare doth / but hit
nourishethe better than a stare doth: and they haute much about the vines /
they be drunk by eating of grapes / and they be best in season to eat about
al Halomas. The.xij. is orex / which as some say is a fesant hen / and as
some say a more hen: whether hit be a pheasant hen or a more hen / the
flesh is of good norishemet. The.xiij. is a bird called tremulus: which
bird commonly abides ne'er the see cost / less in quantite than a hen / in
colour russet / hit criethe loud and fleethe sweftelye / and when his plumeth
upon the earth / the tail waggeth styll / and therefore hit is called tremulus
/ and upon the heed thereof grows loge feathers. Hit is not that bird / ye
phesitions call a wag tail. The.xiiij. last / is amarellus: which also is a
water foul / like unto a duck / but hit is less. And to speak generally /
amoge fowls to eat / they be best praised / that be swyfter in flight. And as
the flesh of the forsaide fowls are of a comedable norishemet / and of easy
digestion: so like wise the flesh of some fowls is of a discomendable
nourishement / harde to digest / and of vnegall coplection / as the flesh of
geese / pecockes / and malardes / and universally of al fowls / that have
lunge necks / loge bills / and live upon water. And the flesh of sparrows /
which are excedinge hot / vnteperate / sterynge to bodily lust. But
touching election of fowls flesh / ye shall understand / that their
natural norishynge must be considered / that is whether they be restorative /
light of digestion / light of substance / or of subtle operation: and so after
their diverse propretes to preyse them. Wherefore Galen beholdynge the easy
alteration subtlety of pertriches flesh / prefers them. But Rasis with
Isaac / cosiderynge the subtlety and lightness of the stare / preysethe that
best. Isaac also after the diverse intetions of wild fowls flesh / praises
diverse. Auicen commendethe turtyls flesh above other: either having respect
to the proprete / whereby it strengtheth and comfort mas understanding:
orels yt in the country of Araby / where Auicen was borne / turtyls are better
than in other countries. Farther wittethe well / that flesh of fowls is more
wholesome / than of.iiij. legged beastis / for them that forsake labour / give
them to study and cotemplation / for hit is sooner digested: as Galen.iij.
alimentoru saith: yet this flesh of fowls is sooner digested than of beastis /
specially of {per}triches / which engenders clean and pure blood: disposed
to augmet to sharpe the operations of the brain / that is mas understanding /
cogitation / and memory.

Si pisces molles sunt / magno corpore toll
Si pisces duri parui sunt plus valituri.
This text openethe.ij. knowleges in choice of fyshe. For either fysshe is
harde or soft: if hit be soft / the elder the better. The reason is / for
softenes comethe of humidite: which in yonge fyshe is vndigested / and in old
is more digested: and so when such fyshes be young / they engendre fleme / but
when they be old they do nothing so much. And so appears / that an old yele
is holsomer tha a yonge / as some say. But if such fish be harde / than it is
holsomer yonge / that is / sooner digested / as pikes perches be. For the
hardness resistethe digestion. This is the opinion of Auicen.ii. ca. de piscibus
/ saying: Of harde fyshes take the smallest: and of soft fyshes / chose the
greatest.

Lucius et parca / saxaulus / albica / teuca.
Gurnus / plagicia / cum carpa / galbio / truca.
Here are rehearsed.x. sortis of fishes very wholesome for mans body. The first
is a pike / called the tyranne of fishes: For he not only devours fishes of
other kind / but also of his own. On whom these verses were made: Lucius est
piscis rex tyrannus aquarum.
A quo non differt Lucius iste parum.


The fish of a pike is harde / and swyfte in swymmyge. The.ij. is a perch /
diriuied of this verb parco / parcis to forbear or spare / by a clean contrary
sense / for a perch spares no fyshe / but wondethe other fyshes with his
fynnes on his back: nor a pike dare not venture upon a perch: but as Albertus
saith / in his book of beastis nature / there is a natural amite between the
perch the pike. For the pike hurt of an other fish / is healed with great
difficult. But when he is hurt / he gothe unto the perch / which saying him
hurt / touchethe and sokethe the wound / and so the pike is healed. And the
perch is like wise an harde fish. The.iij. is a see fyshe called a sole /
which is a special good fyshe. The.iiij. is a whytyng. The.v. is a tenche /
Which is a fresh water fyshe / whose skin is slyppery slymely / some what
black: the meat thereof is harde. When so ever we will dress a pike / a
perch / or a tenche / we must take the skyn away. The.vj. is gurnus / which
is a see fyshe. This fyshe is as great in quantite / as half a mans myddel
finger / the which is eaten with the heed and fynnes. The.vij. is a playce.
The.viij. is a carpe / a fresh water fyshe / which is much slyme: but
great estates have them soddde in wine / so the slymynes is done away.
The.ix. is a rochette / a see fish / and is a fish of harde meat wholesome.
Some other textis have gouio / yt is a goien / which is very wholesome fyshe.
The.x. is a troute / which in eating is like samo / and yet it is no samon /
it is lunge / and not gross: it is taken in great ryuers / and will suffer it
self to be rubbed and clawed / being in the water / so it is taken / thereof
pastis be made with spicis / and hit is a right deynte fyshe. Touching the
choice of fyshe / ye shall first understand / that fyshe / compared with
flesh / is less nourishynge / lighter of digestion / and the nourishement
thereof is full of fleumatike superfluites / cold / moist: and they be hardly
digested / and abide lunge in the stomach. And by reason the stomach laboreth
in digestynge of them / and other while they be corrupted in the stomach / they
receive a certain putrified qualite / and engendre thyrstynes. And surely the
norishemet of laudable flesh is better than of fyshe. Secondly / witteth well
/ ye see fyshe is better in regiment of helthe / than other of the same sort
take in fresh water. For their noryshemet is not so superfluous / and is more
ne'er to the nature of flesh. But because see fyshe are harder than other of
the sort taken in fresh water: therefore they be of more difficult in
digestion / of more and pure nourishement. Yet not withstanding / fresh water
fyshe is holsomer for sick folks / by reason of their feeble digestion.
Thyrdelye note / Conditions of good fyshe.
that fyshe / as well of salt water as fresh / shulde be chosen / the which
dressed are white / not clamy / but brittyll / not very gross / but subtle /
not of harde savour but soute / that doth not soon putrefy / of good colour /
not bred in lakes or pondis / nor in fylthy placis / nor in water wherein
grows ill wedes. And they ought not to be to old nor to young / that be
swyfte of mouynge / of small clamyshenes. And if it be see fyshe / we must chose
such as is taken in ryuers a good way from the see / and having the other
forsayde conditions: And the more skaly that fish is the better hit is: and
hit is like wise understand by the fynnes. For many fynnes and skales / betoke
the purenes of the fyshes substance. Also among see fyshe / ye best be they
that breed in the dippest water / that ebbs and flows. And therefore / the
fyshe that is taken in the north see / that is more surgynge / and more
tempestuous / more swyfte in ebbynge and flowynge / are better than the fyshe
taken in the deed or the southe see. And ye shall like wise understand of
fresh water fyshe: For fyshe bred in deep water / is better tha other of the
sort bred in shalowe vnnotable waters. And here by may be sufficiently known /
which fyshe shulde be chosen / and which not. For bestial fyshe / as the
see swyne / dog fyshe / and dolphin / are vnholsome in the regiment of health.
For they be harde of digestion / and of su{per}fluous humours. Nor in the meat
of the forsayde fish / the above nombred conditions appear not / as whiteness
/ subtilite and such other. And if those fyshes such like chase to be eaten /
they shulde not be sod as soon as they be taken / but shulde be kept a few
days after: till time the meat of them mollify / and wax tender / without
corruptynge of their substance. And also the forsayde fyshes be better a little
corned with salt than fresh / or utterly salt. And among all see fyshe /
the forsayde conditions considered / the rochet and gurnat seem to be most
wholesome. For their meat and substance is most pure / and than next a playce
and a sole. But the meat of those is more clamy / less frangible / less
white / more gross / less subtle: nor the savour or smell of them is not so
delicious / and per chance the whitynge is more commendable tha the rochet. For
hit is not so gross and clamy / as a playce and a sole / and hit substance is
frangible enough / but the releshe / smell / colour / purenes / of substance /
and mobilite considered / hit is not so good as the rochet and gurnade: And like
wise ye shall vnderstade of herrynge. And the fyshe called morua / being yonge
enough / draws ne'er the forsayde fyshes in goodness / so that hit have the
above said conditions: yet hit is grosser and more clamy / than the forsayde
fyshes. But salmon / turbot / and mackerel / be not so good: for they be much
grosser / more clamy / harder of digestion / and fuller of superfluite.
Therefore they be only wholesome / for laborers / and yonge folks of strong
complexion: their clamynes / grossenes / and coldness / may be taken away with
certain sauces. Among fresh water fyshe / the forsayde conditions considered
/ the perch and pike are the best / so they be fat: and next are the
vendosies / and than lopsters. And though the perch be more skaly than these
before said / yet the meat thereof is so white / fragible / and subtle / as
the pike and carpe: and hit is oft found in ponds. And universally / the
best fresh water fyshe of the same sort / is hit that is taken in water
stony in the bottum / runnynge north ward / deep / and labourynge much /
where into ronneth no vrdeurs of cites: and wherein no wedes grow. Creueces
both of the see and ryuers / are much nutratiue / and corrupt not lightly in
the stomach: but they be harde of digestion. Farther more note / that fresh
fyshe moyste the body / and encreace milk and sede of generation: is very
wholesome for colerike folks. Eating of fyshe good bad.
And after great travail or big labour / we shulde not eat fish / for than
hit soon corrupts in the stomach. And they that have a weak stomach / or
full of ill humours / ought to beware of eating fyshe. More over / gross
fyshe / corned with a little salt / is better than fresh fyshe. And fyshe of
lunge time saltynge is vnholsome. Also fyshe flesh to gether shulde not be
eaten: nor fyshe and white meates: nor fyshe shulde not be eaten after other
meates. Also fyshe a little salted / and in small quantite taken is wholesome:
hit stereth up the appetite / and fortifies hit / if one have an appetite
thereto.

Vocibus anguilie praue sunt si comedantur.
Qui phisicam non ignorant hec testificantur.
Caseus anguilla nimis obsunt si comedantur.
Nitu sepe bibas. et rebibendo bibas.
The auctor saith here / that the yele is an vnholsome fyshe / and specially
hurtethe the voice. And this he proves by the saying of physicians / and
studentis of natural philosophe. The reason is / an yele is a slymye fyshe /
clamy / and specially a stopper: and wantethe much of the conditions of good
fyshe before spoken. And this that is said by an yele / may be understand of
lampreys: all though lampreys be a little holsomer tha yeles / and less
ieoperdus / saying they be not so clamye and gross as yeles. And though these
fyshes be delicious in taste / yet they be very perilous: for their
generation in the water / is like generation of serpetes on the earth. Wherefore
it is to be doubted lest they be venomous: and therefore ye heeds and tails /
in which the venom is wont to be / like wise the string within / shulde in
no wise be eaten. Also hit is good to plunge them alive in good wine / to take
away their clamynes / and let them lye styll therein till they be deed / and
than let them be dyght with galentyne made of the best spicis / as great
estates cokes are wont to do. Yet hit is good to parboyle them twyse before in
wine and water: and that broth done away / to since them through / and to
make galantyne for them / or else to bake them / or fry them in grene sauce
with strong spicis / a little good wine in winter: in summer to dress them
with a little wine / vergis vinegar: but he that can foreare these.ij. fyshes
doth best. Farther the text says / that chese and yeles hurt much if
they be eaten: and this is to be understand if ye eat great quantite thereof.
The cause of chese / is before showed at Persica poma c. And of yeles here now
before. Hit folowtth in the text / that if those things be taken with oft
drinking of wine / their hurtfulnes is amended: this shulde not be vnderstade
of subtle and percyng wine: nor of wine that is given in way of drink
coductiue: for such wine shulde not be given upon meat / that engedrethe ill
humours / when hit is eaten: nor before / nor after hit is digested: Auic.
iii.i. ca. de regi^ne aque ^ viiii.
as Auicen saith: For such wine induces great hurt: for hit causes i'll
humours / engedred of that drink / to entre in to the extreme partis of the
body: which perauenture were not able to entre without help leadyge of the
wine. But this is to be understand of strong wine / not greatly percynge /
oft and in small quatite given / to thentet to myxe ye meat to gether: For
such wine doth allay the malice of ye meat / coforteth digestion / and
directs the fleumatike cold humours: wherefore hit helps the digestio of
chese and yeles / that are of ill digestion.

Inter prandendum sit sepe parum{que} bibendum.
Si sumas ouum / molle sit at{que} nouum.
Here the auctor touches.ij. things. The first is / that one at dinner and
soupper shulde eat well and drink oft and a little at ones. And not to do
as a brute beast doth / that eats his fill of meat and drinks after ward:
For the better ye drink is mingled with the meat / the sooner the meat is
mollified / and the more capace of digestion. And here is to be noted / that
there is.iij. manner of drynkynges. The first is that mynglethe the meat to
gether: the.ij. that delateth hit: the.iij. that quenches thyrst. The first
that we spake of is to be understand of drink mingled with our meat /
though we be not thyrstye. Thus we ought to drink even as we have eaten a
little. For outcepte a better reason / I say we may not abide till the meals
end / nor till we be a thyrste. And this manner drinking is specially good /
for them that fed on meat actuallye dry: as apperethe by sick folks / that
eat dry breadde. But drinking to quench thyrste / for such as be in good
tempre / shulde be forborne till the meals end: for than comethe the true
thyrste / through the heate of the meat hot and dry. Hit is not very
reasonable that thyrste and hunger shulde assail us both to gether: for they
are of contrary appetite. and this drink shulde be given after as the thyrst is
more or less. Drinking delatiue is most convenient after the first digestion
regularlye / and a little before we take other meat. And this manner of
drinking is wholesome / when the meates before taken were gross in substance:
nor thus to drink / we may not tarry till we be thyrsty. For this drinking
prepares ye stomach to receive other meat: and causes the meat digested to
descend from the stomach to the liver: nor this drinking shulde not be in
great quatite: to the end hit may soon be digested. For before hit be digested /
hit goth not to the liver. And this is of truth / outcepte such drink
delatiue were water / in which one must not tarry till digestion before hit
come to the liver. But regularly convenient drink delatiue or {per}mixtiue /
ought not to be water / but wine / orels ale / bear / cider / {per}tey / or
such like / than all which wine is better. Secondly wittethe well / that the
grosser / dryer / and colder that meat is / the bigger the drink parmyxtiue
and delatiue shulde be. And contrary wise / the hotter / subtiler / and
moyster that meat is / the weak the dryke {per}mixtiue delatiue should be. And
the more subtle / hot / and digestible the meat is / the weaker the drink
or wine ought to be. Wherefore stroger wine shulde be drunk with befe / than
with chekyns / we shulde drink stroger wine with fyshe than with flesh.
The.ij. doctrine is / that if we will eat an egg / hit must be rear rostedde
and new: the cause thereof is before showed.

Pisa{que} laudare decreuimus ac reprobare.
Pellibus ablatis sunt bona pisa satis.
Sunt inflatiua cum pellibus at{que} nociua.
Of peas.
This text rehearses a notable thing of peasen. That is yt they some way are
preised / some way dispreysed. They be lauded when they be eaten / the husks
taken away / and discomended / when they be eaten with the husks: for than
they enstate. And therefore it is not artificial to eat them in the husks /
for the nature of that within the husks / disagree. The one labourethe to be
losed and to go out: the other withstadeth / binds / as Isaac says in
dictis vniuersalibus. Wherefore a hurlynge mouynge is caused in the body /
inducynge gnawynge and inflasion in the bealye. And peasen do not this all
only / but also all pulse / as beans / chiches / chestons / and such like.
And specially such as have much husk / as beans and black rice. Also the
husk of them all norysheth worse than the pith within. And here is to be
noted / that there is a manner of white round peasen: whereof the cod is very
small thynne: one may eat these peasen with the husk more surely than other
/ all though hit were better to hulle them. And albe it that the reason before
said is true touchyge al pulse / yet ye shall vnderstade / that the hulles of
grene pulse is less / and less diuersite is between the husks the pith
within / and more easy to digest: And therefore some say they be more wholesome
for folks in helthe: but hit is not so: For grene pulse is of right great
superfluite and corruptible substance / wherefore they be less holsomer for
hole folks. And note this for a treuthe / that dry pulse / the utter husk
taken away / are more wholesome than grene: but grene are better than dry
vnhulled. Farther ye shall vnderstance / that the substance of all pulse / is
inflatiue and harde of digestion: and their ill nourishemet is vnholsome in the
regiment of helthe: but the broth of them is wholesome: For the broth of them
makes the bealy laxative / and makes one peace / and vnstoppeth the veins.
Wherefore hit is wholesome at such times as folks use gross and opilatiue
meatis / as on fasting days. For in this broth or pottage conveniently made
/ are not the hurts that be in the substance: therein is no inflasion / nor
difficult of nourishement and digestion / nor the malice of norishemet. This
broth is made on this wise. The rice or peasen / must be laid in sythynge
water: and therein a good while to be all to robbed with ones hands: and after
in the forsayde water shulde be tempered all the night: and therein the next
night following to be boiled twyse or thryse / and than dyghte / and so
reserved: And when the hour of dinner drawethe ne'er / to dress it with cynomum
and saffron / and a little curtsy wine put thereto: and than boyle hit ones /
and so eat hit at beginning of our refectio. And the broth or pottage of rice
and of round white peason is better / and more wholesome friendly to mans nature:
and like wise their substance.

Lac ethicis sanum. caprinum post cametinum.
Ac nutritiuum / plus omnibus est asininum.
Plus nutritiuum. vaccinum sit et ouinum.
Si febriat caput et doleat / non est been sanum.
To chose milk.
Here the auctor teachethe us certain lessons to chose milk. The first is /
that goottis milk is wholesome for them that be in a consumption / or be lean /
Auicenna ii. can. ca. de lacie. et i.iiii. tract. iii. ca. de remor. medic
humect. echicos.
or that have a consuming ague. And Auicen saith / that goottis milk and assis
milk are good for them that be in a cosumption. The reason is / for that
gootis milk is temperate / and of much nourishemet. And next to this is
camels milk. For that is subtle / and of much aquosite humidite: whereby hit
may moist them. Yet for truth this milk / through hit over much humidite /
nourishethe little: wherefore hit is not so wholesome for them as goottis milk:
yet this camels milk / newly after folynge / is wholesome for them that have
the dropsye / and for them that have disease in the liver: for it revives the
liver / as Auicen says. Secondly he says / Auicen. ii. can. ca. de lacte.
that assis milk is holsomer than other / for dry folks in a consumption.
This is of truth / comparynge assis milk / with milk of other brute
beastis: for hit enclinethe to coldness and humidite / and is subtle and sooner
enters: and more slowelye conieyleth / than the milk of any other brute beast
/ as Galen saith. The same saith Auicen / Gale. vi. de ingenio cap. vii. Auicen
de lacte.
and that after womans milk / there is none to assis milk. And he saith if any
help the fever ethicke / hit is assis milk. Yet to compare assis milk with
woman's milk / hit is not so wholesome. For woman's milk taken by suckynge is
most wholesome / as Auicen saith. The reason is: Auicen.i. quarti loco
preallex.
for woman's milk is cold / moyste / more like to mans nature / swiftlier
entered / quickelier digested / more norishyng. And this milk to be given to
them that be in a cosumptio / shulde be mylked as ne'er the pacietis beddis side
as is possible / forth with to ministre hit unto him / lest the air corrupt
hit. And here is to be noted / that in some cases / sower or butter milk is
better for folks in a consumption / than woman's milk or assis. First is when
by this fever ethike / they be caste in a laske. The.ij. is / when they
suspect coagulation of the milk in ye stomach / either by vehement heate of
the fever: orels by cause the stomach of hit self is colerike / the milk
shulde turn to coler. The.iij. is when the ethike / is coupled with a
putrified fever: specially when there be not many opilations in the interior
partis. For sower milk restreineth the bealy / and turns not lightly in to
coler: for the buttrines of it is gone: whereby the milk lightly enflames: nor
in a putrified fever / it is not soon putrified. The.iiij. is / if the stomach
be foul / for tha the milk corrupts lightly therein. The.v. case is / when
he that hath the ethike disease / abhorrethe doulce clean milk / but not the
sower or butter milk. The.iij. lesso is / that cow milk and ship milk are
more nutratiue / for they be fatter and grosser than other / Aui. ii. ca. ca.
de lacte
for so saith Auicen: And that all beastis milk / that in bringing forth
yonge / continues longer than a woman / is vnholsome: but the milk of those /
that bear egallye with woman / is most wholesome / as cow milk. Rasis.iii.
Alm. cap. de lacte.
But Rasis saith: that cow milk is the most grosest milk that any beast
gyuethe: and therefore hit is holsomer than other / for them that desire to be
fat. The.iiij. lesson is / that milk hurts them that have ye ague / or the
heed ache / The cause why is before showed at Persica poma c.

Lenit et humectat. soluit sine febre butirum. Three propretes of butter.
Here the auctor shows.iiij. {pro}pretes of butter. The first is butter
mollifies the bealy / and makes it slyppery / through it oylyues. The.ij. is
/ that butter is moyste / for hit is made of the beast partis of the milk /
wherefore hit must needs be moyste / saying that the milk is moist / whereof it
is made. The.iij. is / that hit leuseth the bealye / and that is by the
slypperynes that hit causes in the guttis. These.iij. propretes Auicen
rehearses ii. can. cap. de butyro. And these.iij. propretes butter induces in
a body / not sick of a fever: for it hurts them that have an ague / for
butter with hit vnctuosite augmentethe the heate of the fever. Here is to be
noted / that though butter cause the forsaide propretes: Yet by reason of it
over much humidite and vnctuosite / it is vnholsome in way of meat:
specially to eat much thereof. For if one use to eat much thereof / hit
engenders lothsomnes / and makes the meat to swyme about the brymme of the
stomach: and laxeth the bealy out of measure / causes vomit. Therefore butter
shulde in no wise be eaten as meat in great quantite / and specially hit
shulde not be eaten after other meat: but to use hit with other meat / hit is
very wholesome.

Incidit at{que} lauat / penetrat / mundat quo{que} serum. This text
opens.iiij. {pro}pretes of whey. The propretes of whey.
The first is / hit is incisiue or subtle. The.ij. hit is washing or
scouring. The.iij. hit is persynge / which proprete proceeds of the first.
The.iiij. is / hit cleanses or purges. Auicen resitynge these propretes
says: that whey is subtiliatiue / Auicen.ii. can. cap. de lacte. Rasis.iii.
Almasoris.
wasshyng / leusynge: and therein is no mordication. Rasis says / that whey
doth expelle ruddy coler / skabbes / and pushes: and also pympuls in the
face: and also it is wholesome for them that have the ianders: and for them that
be distempered by to much drinking of wine.

Caseus est frigidus / stipans / grossus quo{que} durus.
Caseus et panis bonus est cibus hic been sanis.
Si non sunt sani / tunc hunc non ^ungito pani.
Two things are here touched. First he puttethe.iiij. propretes of chese.
Four propretes of chese.
The first is / that chese is of a cold nature. And this is to be understand
of grene chese / which is cold and moist: and not of old chese / which is
hot and dry / as Auicen saith: Auicen.ii. can. cap. de ^aseo.
Orels hit may be understand by chese / that cruddeth only of the milk /
without mynglyng of any other thing. For there is some chese of hot nature /
that heatethe the stomach bites the tongue / by mynglynge of other things
there with: as some chese grene in colour: of which if one eat much in
quantite / doth heate and inflame the body. The.ij. proprete is / that chese
makes one costife: this is of truth / specially if hit be harde / and made
with much renles. The.iij. is / that chese engedreth gross humours: this is
truth of all chese: for all chese is made of the grosser and more erthye
part of the milk. The.iiij. {pro}prete is / yt milk binds the womb / and
this and the.ij. is all one. Farther the text saith / that though chese eat
alone be vnholsome / whereby comes ill digestion / yet if one eat a little
curtsye with breadde / hit shall digest with the bread / and not other wise:
this is troth / if hole folks and not sick eat hit. We spake before of
chese at Nutrit et impinguat c.

Ignari medici me dicunt esse nociuum.
Sed tamen ignorant cur nocumenta feram.
Languenti stomacho caseus addit opem.
Si post sumatur terminat ille dapes.
Qui phisicam non ignorant hec testificantur.
Here the auctour blames them that absolutely reprove the use of chese. And
he declares.ij. vtilites thereof. First chese coforteth a sick stomach. And
here is to be noted / that al chese doth not ease every diseased stomach. But
in other cases all chese hurts the stomach of selde knyttyng / and every
stomach weaked by lunge syckenes. But new grene chese of small clamynes /
cofortethe a hot stomach / for as Rasis saith: hit repressethe his brounes
and heate. And eke hit comfort a dry stomach / through it humidite. And
old chese or very tart / or much cruddye / hurtethe much such stomachs.
But old chese / or very cruddye chese / comfortethe a stomach / where about
hangs much fleme: for such chese with his tartenes / cuttethe and scourethe
away the fleme. But new soft chese hurts such a stomach right much. And
thus hit appears / that in some case these hurts always / and not in some.
And that new chese is some time good / some time old. The.ij. vtilite is / ye
chese eaten after other meat / makes hit to discende down in to the place of
digestion: that is the bottum of the stomach. All this they know / that have
the very science of physic. And of tart chese Rasis says: Never the less
a little curtsye thereof eaten after meat / fortifies the mouth of the
stomach: and takes away the over much satiete loathing of meat / that are
wot to be engedred of sweet vnctuous meatis / about the stomachs mouth.

Inter prandendum sit sepe parum{que} bibendum.
Vt minus egrotes / non inter fercula potes.
Here be.ij. lessons. The first is / that a man at his meat shulde drink
little and oft. But this thing is al ready declared. The.ij. lesson / is that
between meals / we must forbear drink: specially if the meat that we did
eat be vndigested in the stomach / except great necessite constrain us: for
drinking than lets and breakethe digestion of the meat first taken. For
hit causes the meat to discende from ye stomach vndigested: puts away the
appetite: grieves the body / and engenders the fevers and other diseases.

Vt vites penam / de potibus incipe cenam. Here the auctour saith / that one
ought to begin his soupper with drink. Some expound this verse thus: If thou
will eschew sickness / dryke at soupper or thou begin to eat. But this
exposition is reproved. For after physicians / a man shulde begin his soupper
with meat / and not with dryke. And all though this book was made for english
men / yet they keep not this rule: For at what hour of the day so ever they
drink / they eat a morsel breadde first. Therefore this verse may be
expound other wise: Hippoc. ii. partic. aphonsm.
taking drink for meat moyste and easy of digestion / as Hippocrates takes
drink when he saith: Hit is easier to fylle one with drink tha with meat. So
that the sentence of this verse shulde be thus: It is better to begin our
soupper with drink / that is with meat moyste / and easy of digestion / than
with gross / harde / and ill of digestion. The reason is / if we eat meat
moist easy of digestion / after gross harde of digestion / it would through
the digestiue heate of the night / be sooner digested lunge before the gross
meates. And when it can not have issue for the gross meat vndigested: hit
burns over much: or if hit issue / hit pluckethe part of the gross meat
vndigested with hit. Therefore it is best to begin with meat moist and easy
of digestion: that when hit is digested / hit may without let issue out.

Singula post oua pocula sum nova
Post pisces nux sit / post carnes caseus assit.
Vnica nux prodest / nocet altera / tertia mors est.
Here be certain lessons. The first is / after the eating of every new laid
egg rear roasted / we must drink / and specially a draught of wine. The
reason may be / by cause a new laid egg rear roasted / is of right great
nourishement / and easily digested: and it is of that sort that in small
quantite nourishes much: and principally the yolke / as is before said at
oua ^centia. So that the wine / which is frendlye to nature / causes that
the egg is more desirously drawn of the norishynge members / and helpethe hit
to entre. An other cause may be. An egg descends but slowlye: and drink
helpethe hit to discende. The.ii. doctrine is / to eat nattis after fyshe / in
stead of ^hese: For nuttis through their drines / hyndreth thingendryng of
fl^me / that is wont to be engedred of fish. And for this cause nuttis are
the last service in lent. The.iij. lesson is / that after flesh we must eat
chese and not nuttis: for nuttis dry over much / and so doth not chese: but
it causes the meat to discende to ye buttum of the stomach / where the
virtue of digestion is. And this is certain / if the chese be neither to old
nor to new. Farther the text hath in ye last verse / A nut megge.
that a nut megge / is wholesome for the body: hit makethe the mouth to savour
well / hit comfort the sight / and like wise the liver / spleen / and
specially the mouth of the stomach / as Auicen saith. But the other comune
nuts / Auicen.ii. can. ca. de ^uce mus^ata.
called a walnut / is hurtful. This walnut / as Auicen says / doth inflate /
ingendre ventosite in the womb / hit is harde of digestion / and stereth one
to vomit / that by reason of hit calidite. But the.iij. nut / that is the
nut of the cross bow / is death / for the cross bow sleethe men. Orels we
may understand the nut methel: which as Auicen says / is venomous /
wherefore hit sleeth.

Add potum piro / nux est medicina veneno.
Fert pira nostra pirus / sine vino sunt pira virus.
Si pira sunt virus / sit meledicta pirus.
Si coquas antidotum pira sunt / sed cruda venenum.
Cruda grauant stomachum / eleuant pira cocta grauatu.
Post pira da potum / post pomum vade fecatum.
In the first verse here / he lerneth us to drink wine after peers. For peers
(as is before sufficiently declared) engendre ventosite: and of their proprete
cause the colyke / and engendre blud fulle of aquosite: and therefore with them
one shulde drink strong wine: which consumethe ventosites and aquosites
engedred of peers. Secondly the text saith / that nuttis is a remedy against
venom: as hath been showed at Allea nux c. Farther in the.ij. and.iij. verse
he shewethe / that peers eat without wine are venomous / that is / hurtful to
mans nature / the cause is showed in ye first verse. Yet for al that peers be
not venomous simply / for if they were / they slay / and peers so doing are
accursed. In the.iiij. verse he shewethe / that raw peers are venomous / that
is: hurtful: for they make the humours to boyle / and cause ye colike / sleme /
skabbe. Yet if they be sod / they be medicinable / in manner as is before said
/ that is to say with wine: and specially eaten after other meat: for so they
expulce the dregs. In the.v. verse he saith / that raw peers grieve ye
stomach: for they let his digestion / and inflate: but sod peers releue the
stomach grieved: and dispose hit naturally. In the last verse are.ij. things.
The first is after peers we must drink / for the cause before said. The.ij.
is / that after eating of appuls / we must go to siege: for Auicen says:
Auicen.ii. can. ca. de pontis.
If sweet or sower appuls find any gross humours in the stomach / they force
them to discende from thence to the guttis: for appuls are much inflatiue and
engendre ventosites: which nature expels to the inferior partis.

Cerusa si comedas tibi con^ett grandia dona.
Expurgans stomachum / nucleus lapidem tibi tollit.
Et de carne sua sanguis erit{que} bonus.
Eating of cherries.
Here are declared.iij. commodites / that come of cheris eating. The first is
/ that cheris purge the stomach. This some say is truth / when the stones be
broken and eaten with al: for these.ij. to gether / of their proprete scour
and cleanse. The.ij. is / that the kyrnell of the cherie stone / by his virtue /
breaks the stone in ones raynes or bladder: is eaten dry or made in milk.
The.iij. is / that the substance or meat of cherries / engedreth very good
blood / comfort / and fattethe the body. And this is proved by experience:
for we se that sparrows / which are great eaters of cherries / that in cherie
time their livers be far greatter tha in other seasons: whereby appears that
cherries encreace and coforte the liver. Yet here is to be noted / that there
be.ij. sorts of cheris / gross / small. And eke of the gross are.ij. sorts
/ some are sweet / and some sower. All doulce and small cheris are vnholsome:
for they lightly corrupt / and breed vermyn. The gross and sower cherries are
called cina: and of these are.ij. sorts: Some be ruddy and soft of
substance: and such must be eaten fresh and new gethered / and at beginning
of dinner: their nature is to scour the stomach / and to provoke the appetite.
The other are black / gross / and harde of substance / and specially the
sower. And these shulde be eaten at ye beginning of dinner or soupper. The
cause is / for by their sowernes they close the mouth of the stomach / whereby
better spedier digestio follows.

Infrigidant / laxant / multum prosunt tibi prima. Here he puts.ij. vtilites
coming by eating of prunes. First / prunes cool the body: And therefore
Portuguese / that dwell in a hot coutre / always with their meat since
prunes. The.ij. prunes cause one to laske / by reason of their humidite
clamines: as Gal. saith. Galen.ii. alimetoru. Auicen.ii. can. ca. de prunis.
This is of troth if they be ripe: for prunes yt be not ripe / be stypticall
norishe little as Auicen saith. And though damask prunes have the forsayde
vtilites / yet proprelye they be ascriued to prunes of Armeny. For prunes of
the country of Armeny / are better than any other: And they vnbynde the womb
more vehemently than other / as Auicen says. For a more declaration / ye
shall understand / that ripe prunes are used / not vnrype. The best prunes.
And prunes most wholesome for mans nature be the lunge ones / that have little
substance about the stone / small / harde / in manner dry / and the utter skyn
thynne: they shulde not be sweet in taste / but some what sower / and of this
sort are Damask prunes: and such refresh and cool the body / as said is.
There be many other sorts of prunes / whose use is not accepted. There be also
prunes / called wild prunes / which grow in ye woods: these be not
laxative: of them water is distilled to bide the womb. Prunes that are taken
to make one to laske / must first be laid in cold water: for than they
cool and moist more perfectly: and by slipperynes they leuse the coler that
they come to: and so the stomach is better disposed to receive food. And here
is to be noted / that moist prunes and new are more alteratiue / though they
be of worse norishement / and of more superfluite: but dry prunes coforte more
/ and better nouryshe the body. And as hit is said by prunes / so after the
manner is understand of cheris. Yet not withandynge the humidite of cheris is
subtiler and less clamy / whereby they norishe less than prunes.

Persica cum musto vobis datur ordine iusto.
Sumere sic est mos / nucibus sociando racemos.
Passula non spleni tussi valet / est bona reni.
Here be.iij. doctrines. The first is / that with peches we shulde drink must
/ for.ij. causes: the first is / for must is hot / boils in our body:
which boylynge and heate the peche with it coldness fordoth. The.ij. cause is /
for peches be right cold / and cool the body very much: Therefore that wine
shulde be drunk upon them / which heats more than other. But that is must
/ that is known by experience. The manner howe we shulde eat peches and other
frutis / is declared at Persica poma c. The.ij. doctrine is / that with old
dry nuttis we must eat resyns. For new gethered nuttis are by them self
wholesome: but old dry nuttis are great driers: through their vnctuosite they
lyghtelye inflame the body: wherefore with them resyns must be eat / which
restrain inflammation drynes / by reason they moist. And of nuttis is spoken
more largely at Allea nux c. The.iij. doctrine is / that resyns of corans hurt
ye spleen / for it causes opilation thereof: yet they are wholesome for the
raynes: for by their provoking of urine they purge the raynes.

Scrofa / tumor / glandes / ficus cataplasmate cedit
Iunge papaner ei confracta foris tenet ossa.
Here be declared.ij. wholesome things / that come by players made of figs.
First / figs sod in water / moyste laid to any of these.iij. diseases
cures hit / that is swynes yuell / kyrnels / and swellynges. By swynes yuell
is understand inflasion under the chynne about the throat. And it is called
scrofula a scrofa / that is to say a sow or a swyne: either because this
disease chances many times to swyne through their gulosite: orels by cause ye
shappe of this disease is likened to swyne / as Auicen saith. Auicen.iii.iiii.
tract. ii. cap. de stropulis.
By kyrnels are vnderstade impostumes / which commonly chance under ye arm
pittis / and in the groynes. And by swelling may be understand inflasions in
any part of ye body. Wherefore to heal these impostumes / and specially to ripe
them / figs shulde de sod with water: A plaster made of figs.
and with the water shulde be mixed a little curtsy of vinegar: which shulde
help the virtue of the figs to entre. And when it is sod / the figs must
be beat in a mortar: and tha mingled with a curtsy of the water that they were
sod in: and so make a plaster. A plaster is proprely a medicine made of
some herb / or flower / and the joyce thereof: as this verse saith: Tunc
cataplasma facis / cum succum ponis et herbam. The.ij. vtilite is / that a
plaster made of figs and popie sede joins or sets broken bones to
gether again. A plaster of figs popie sede.
And they must be sod to gether in water without vinegar: and than stamp hit
in a mortar / and put thereto a little of the water that it was sod in: and
so lay hit to the sore. The reason hereof may be: because popie sede both takes
away the sensiblenes of the mebres / whereby the ache / that is wont to chase
in breaking of bones / is done away / and provokes to sleep. Fyggis eke draw
the humidites of the body to the utter partis: which humidites brought to
the bones / may draw / retain / or hold them to gether / but never
perfectely knit them. And witteth well / that there be.iij. kinds of popis /
white / red / and black. The red is venomous / and growethe among corn.
Yonge schole^s are wont to stamp the flowers thereof / to make them red
ink.

Pediculos / la{que} facit / sed cuilibet obstat. Eating of figs.
Here be declared.ij. operations of fyggis. The first. Much eatyge of fyggis
makes one lousy: and this is for certain / if the figs be dry / as Auicen
saith. Auicen.ii. can. ca. de ficubus.
And he saith yt the cause is through the maliciousnes and corruption of the
humour of them engendered. And eke an other cause may be / for that figs
stere one to sweet much / whereof lice are engendered. The.ij. operation is /
figs stere one to carnal lust: and like wise they have many superfluites /
and augment the sede of generation.

Multiplicant mictum. ventrem dant escula strictum.
Escula bona dura / sed mollia sunt meliora.
Here are declared.ij. vtilites of medlars. The first is / that they enc^eace
urine: that is by reason they make the dregs harde / and so the wtattrynes
turns in to much urine. The.ij. vtilite is / medlars make one costife
through their sowernes and stipticalnes / and therefore the text saith / harde
medlars be good to stop the laske. But yet the soft medlars be better than
the harde: for they noryshe more and bind less. And here is to be noted /
that medlars noryshe less than appuls / peers / peches / figs / and such
like: which thing apperethe plainly by their egernes of relish or taste /
hardness of their substance after they be ryped on the tree / and therefore we
shulde eat few medlars / and rather in way of medicine than meat. And
because they be very stipticall / they be wholesome for ye laske. And because
medlars ripe not on the tree soft enough to eat / they must be laid till
they be soft: and than they be more delectable and less stipticall.

Prouocat vrinam mustum / cito soluit / inflat. Three {pro}pretes of must be
here touched. First / must provokes one to pysse / for in must are the
erthy {per}tis scouryngly bytynge the bladder / when they come thereto: by
reason whereof the bladder is constrained to avoid the urine. And this proprete
is vnderstade of mustis / that have bytynge lies / as much reinnishe must.
For mustis that have gross lies are not nyppyge / but rather stoppynge and
lettynge of urine / as is before said at Impedit vrinam c. The.ij. proprete /
must makes one lightly laske / through the same cause showed in the first
proprete. Thyrdly / must is inflatiue: for the boylynge that hit makes in the
body / reyseth up ventosites. The causes of these.ij. propretes are showed
before at / Impedit vrinam.

Grossos humores nutrit seruisia vires.
Prestat / augmentat carnem / generat{que} cruorem.
Prouocat vrinam / ventrem quo{que} mollit inflat.
Infrigidat modicum / sed plus desiccat acetum.
Infrigidat / macerat melanc dat / sperma minorat.
Siccos infestat neruos / pinguia siccat.
Here the auctour touches.ij. things. First he puts.viij. propretes of ale
or bear. First / ale engenders in mans body gross humours / which is of
troth in regard of wine. And after the diuersite of the corn or gross
substance the ale is made of / the grosser humours are engendered. Secondly /
ale augmentethe the strengthes: and this doth ale made of the best grain well
sod: for by reason hit nourysheth much hit encreaceth strength. Thyrdly /
it encreateth flesh: by reason hit nourysheth much: and for the same cause
hit encreaceth the blood. And these.iij. last propropretes is in stale ale /
well sod / and made of the best grain. Fyftely / hit stereth one to pysse.
Syxtly / hit makes one to laske. And these.ij. {pro}pretes is in clear bear /
yt hath much of ye hop / as bear of Amburgens / which by reason of the
hoppes bryngethe one in a laske. And hit is not good for them that have a weak
brain. For this bear / by reason of hoppis doth lightly overcome the brain.
Seuently / hit enflateth the bealye: this is of truth if hit be ill sod: as
Holande bear doth: which enflateth most / and stops / and therefore fats
right much. The.viij. is / that a little curtsye ale colethe. So doth bear
of Hollande / Brabande / Heynault / and Flanders. And this is hit that we use
daily. And this proprete is for certain in respect of wine. Here is to be
noted / that ale may be made of ootis / barley / wheat. And as the grain is
altered / so is the coplexion of the ale. Hit that is made of barley / inclines
more to cold / for barlye is cold. Hit that is made of barley and ootis /
stoppethe less / and less engenders ventosites / and less nourishes. And
ale made of wheat malt / inclines more to hete / nouryshethe more / and
stoppethe more. And the grosser the ale is / the worse hit is / the subtiler
the better. Farther / ale made of things / that makes one drunk is worst /
as of darnel. For this grain specially engenders heed ache / and hurts the
senowes. Farther in the text are.v. propretes of vinegar. The first is hit
driethe. For Auicen saith / hit is a strong drier. Auicen.ii. can. ca. de
aceto. Auic. iii.i. in ca. vnico. doct. v.
And therefore physicians bid in time of pestilence to use hit with meat and
drink. For Auicen saith / he that uses vinegar in his meat and drink in
pestilece time / needs not to dread the sickness. The.ij. is / that vinegar of
it own {pro}prete coleth. Thyrdly / hit makes one lean / by reason that hit
driethe. And this is for a very troth if one take it fastyg / as Auicen saith.
Yet never the less / Auic. iii.i. doct. iiii. cap. v.
continual use of vinegar / specially fasting / causes many incouenieces: it
febleth the sight / hurts the breast / causes the cough / hit hurtethe the
stomach and liver / and vehemently oppresses the senowes / and joints: them
vexynge with arteticall grefes / trembling and shaking. Fourthly / vinegar
engenders melancholy / by reason it cools dries. Fyftely / vinegar
diminishes ye sede of generatio / for that hit coolethe driethe / and makethe
lean. These {pro}pretes Rasis puts / saying / Vinegar is cold and dry /
which makes lean / distroieth the strengthes / diminishes the sede of
generatio / enforces black coler / weaketh ruddy sanguine coler / and
makethe the meat subtle / that hit is mingled with. In the last verse the
auctour puts.iij. things. First / that vinegar hurtethe lean folks / by
reason hit dries / and hit tartnes makes hit dry the more. For like joined
to like / makes ye one more furious. And eke every decaide complexion is help
by the contrary / and by the like / is brought in worse case. Secondly /
vinegar hurts the senowes / thirdly hit makes lean / as is before fayde.

Rapa la stomachum / nouit producere ventum.
Prouocat vrinam / faciet quo{que} dent ruinam.
Si male cocta datur / hinc tortio tunc generatur.
Here are declared.iij. vtilites of rapes teperately sod / and one
incovenience of the same. First / rapis comfort the stomach: for the stomach
digests them well / and is not grieved there with. Secondly / rapes break
wind / as apperethe by experience. Thyrdly / rapes provokes the urine. Yet
besides these propretes / Auerrois saith / rapes greatly coforte the syghte.
The hurt of rapes is / the continual eating of them hurtethe the teeth. In
the last verse he saith / rapis cause throws or gnawyng in the bealy / by
reason they multiply ventosites / as saith this verse: Ventum sepe rapis / si
tu vis viuere rapis. The tails of rapis leusethe the bealye. Farther more note
/ that of all rootis / rapis do best norishe mans body / as appears by the
sweetness found in their savour. For all sweet meates nouryshe more the body
than sower / bitter / or terte. Therefore by cause rapes be sweteste of all
roots / less sharpe / they be most wholesome in way of meat: but yet they
engendre gross melancholy blood / if they be not well digested. And hit is
good to purify them from the first water / and in no wise to eat them raw.
They stere one to bodily lust / and cleanse the ways that the urine ronneth.

Egeritur tarde cor digeritur quo{que} dure.
Similiter stomachus melior sit in extremitates.
Reddit lingua bonum nutrimentum medicine.
Digeritur facile pulmo / cito labitur ipse.
E^t melius cerebrum gallinarum reliquorum.
In this passage are noted.v. things. The first is / that the har^e of beastis
is slowelye digested: by reason the heart flesh is melacolious / which is
hardly digested / and slowly descends / and as Auicen saith / is vnholsome
flesh / Auicen.ii. can. ca. d^ nuce.
and as Rasis says / hit nourishes little. The.ij. is / that the maw like
wise is ill of digestion / and slow of discendynge: by reason hit is a senowye
membre and gristly: wherefore it digests ill / engedreth ill blud. Farther the
text saith / that the extreme partis of the maw / as the bottum and brymme
are better digested: by reason that those {per}tis are more fleshie and fat.
The third is / that ye toge is of good nouryshement / and that is touching
the rote / (...). can. (...) cap. de (...)*
as Auicen saith / by reason hit is fleshie / and of easy digestion. And
among all other / a roasted pygges tongue / ye skin scraped of / is like
braun: as princis karuers know. A netis toge by reason of hit moystnes / is
not very wholesome. But for al this / these delicate fellows / or they roast a
netis tongue / they stop hit with cloves / where by the moystnes is diminished
/ and the meat is apter to eat. The.iiij. is / that the lyghtis are easy of
digestion / and easy to be voided out / and this is by reason of their
natural softenes. Yet their norishemet is vnholsome for mans nature: for hit
is little and flematike / as Auicen says. And here is to be noted / Auic.
can. (...) cap. de pu^mone.
that though the lyghtis of a tuppe be vnholsome to eat / yet hit is
medicinable for a kybed or a sore heal / if it be laid hot there unto / as
Auicen says. The.v. is / that a hens brain is best: Auicenna (...) anon.
which (as Auicen saith) stancheth bledynge at the nose. Hit must be eaten
either with salt or spices: for of hit self hit {pro}uoketh one to vomit.
And physicians say / that chickyns brains augment ye memory. The brain of a
hog is vnholsome for man: but the brain of a sheep / of a hare / or a cony /
may be eaten with salt or spices. And of the brain we have more largely
spoken before at / Nutrit impinguat c.

Semen feniculi fugat / spiraculi culi. Here is declared one doctrine of fenell
sede called maratrum / which breaks wind: Eating of fenel sede.
by reason hit is hot and dry. And here is to be noted / that by eating of
fenell sede / as physicians say / are engedred.iiij. comodites. First / hit is
wholesome for the ague. Secondly hit avoids poison. Thyrdly / hit cleanses the
stomach. Fourthly / hit sharpethe the syghte. These four vtilites are rehearsed
in these.ij. verses.

Bis duo dat maratrum / febres fugat / at{que} venenum.
Et purgat stomachum / lumen quo{que} reddit acutum.
And eke Auicen rehersethe these.iiij. propretes. Auicen.ii. can. ca. de
feniculo.
And as touching the last of the.iiij. he says as folowethe: Democritus
deemed / that venomous worms desire new fenell sede / to coforte sharpe their
sight: and serpentis after winter / issuynge out of their caves / do rub
their eyes against fenell / to clear their sight. Farther note / that fenell
digests slowly / and nourishes ill and little: and therefore hit is used as a
medicine / and not as meat. Wherefore hit ought not to be used in the regiment
of helthe / but to expelle the vnholsomenes of other meates: As we use some
time to eat persly with lettis / to resist the coldness and humidite of the
lettis: so like wise fenell may be sod with gourdes and rapis / to withstand
the vnholsomenes of them.

Emendat visum / stomachum confortat anisum.
Copia dulcoris anisi sit melioris.
Here thauctour openethe.ij. vtilites of dyll. First / dyll comfort the
syghte / and secondly the stomach: by reason yt hit mundifieth the stomach /
and heteth hit: and eke for the same reason hit comfort the syghte: Most
hurfull for the syghte.
for nothing hurtethe the sight more / than vnclenes of the stomach. For from
the unclean stomach ascend unclean vapours / that hurt the eyes in
troublyge the sighty spiritis. These are the.ij. {pro}pretes of doulce dylle.
And beside these / Auicen.ii. can. ca. de aniso.
Auicen rehersethe many other profits of dylle / saying that hit aswagethe
dolours / breaks wind / quenches thyrst / caused of salt moystnes / hit
openethe opilations of the liver and spleen / engendered of humidites: and like
wise of the raynes / bladder / and matrice: hit provokes urine / and
menstruous flixe: hit cleanses the matrice from white humidites: stereth to
carnal lust.

Si cruor emanat spodium sumptum cito sanat. Here thauctour puttethe one
comodite of spodiu: and that is that spodium taken heals the blodye flixe: by
reason that of hit own virtue hit cofortethe the liver: and so the liver
fortified (which is the original fountain of blood) the blud is there
better retained. Auicen.ii. can. ca. de spodio.
And Auicen says / that spodium is the roots of reds burned. And hit is
said / that these rotes / moved by the wind / and rubbyge them self to
gether / burn one a another. Yet Symon the Ianway saith / that spodium is a
thing whose beginning is unknown unto us: hit seems to be a thing brent /
and divisions of reds burned. And hit doth not only help the bluddye flyxe
/ but also the laske and spuynge / as Rasis says. Hit helps also a sharpe
ague / and is comfortable against the shaking thereof / and for over much
avoiding of coler hit helps the stomach / as Auicen saith. And as spodium
doth help and coforte the liver: so there be other medicines / that have like
aspect and like proprete to comfort other special members: as mace the
heart: musk the brain: lykeres the lights / caper the spleen / and galyngale
the stomach / as appears by these verses.

Gaudet eparspodio / mace cor / cerebrum quo{que} musco.
Pulmoliquiricia / splen / epar / stomachus{que} galanda.
Was condimenti preponi debet edenti.
Sal virtus refugat / non spacium{que} saporat.
Nam sapit esca male / que datur abs{que} sale.
Vrunt persalsa visum / sperma{que} minorant.
Et generant scabiem / prur^tum / sieve vigorem.
This text opens.iij. things. First he puttethe a general doctrine
observed every where: that before all other things salt must be set upon
the table / as the vulgar verses teach us: Sal primo poni debet primo{que}
reponi.
Omni^ mensa male {per}onitur abs{que} sale.


Secondly he touchethe.ij. wholesome things of salt. First / that salt
resists venom for.ij. causes. First for that salt is a drier: and so with
hit drines / dries up the humidites yt would corrupt. An other cause is / that
salt dries and supresseth the humidites / drawing them out of the body / and
so shutteth the poores / and consequently stops the entrance of venom /
which is wont to entre by the poores. The.ij. wholesome thing is / salt
makes mans meat savoury. For comonlye we se no meatis savoury without salt /
as says the third verse. Thyrdly ye auctour opens.iiij. incoveniences of
salt or meates to much salted. First / very salt meates mar the sight /
for.ij. causes. The first is / that salt things dry over much / which is
contrary to the eyes / the instrumentis of syghte / for the eyes are of the
nature of water / (...) in de sensu se^.
as the philosopher saith. The.ij. cause is / for that meates very salt
engendre ytche nyppynge / in manner as is before said. Of mordicatiue meatis
being in the stomach / fumes mordicatiue are lifted up / which by their
nyppynge hurt the eyes / and make them very red. And therefore we se that
they that make salt / have comoly red eyes. The.ij. hurt is / that very
salt meates diminish ye sede of generation: by reason that very salt meatis
dry right much all the humidites of the body: wherbye also the sede of
generation is dried / and so lessed. The.iij. hurt is / it engenders the
scabbe: by reason that salt engedreth a sharpe bytynge humour adu^t / which
causes ye scabbe. The.iiij. hurt is / hit augments ytche: by reason hit
engendrethe a mordicatiue ytchynge humour. And these.iiij. hurtis Rasis
remembers speakyge of salt / thus: Farther hit burns their blud that take
great quantite thereof: hit febleth their sight / minisheth the sede of
generation: and engedreth ytche scabbe* and besides these hurtis / very salt
meat engenders ring worms / dry scurfes / morphewe / lepre / in them that
be disposed there unto / sleathe the passage that the urine ronnethe / when
they are lunge continued: yet when hit is a little poudred hit takes away
lothynge / and makes one to have a good appetite.

Hi feruore vigent tres salsus / amarus / acutus.
Alget acetosus / sic stipans ponticus at{que}.
Vnctus et insipidus / dulcis dat temperamentum.
Here are put the qualites of all sauerines. First he says / that these.iij.
sauerinessis or relishes / salt / bitter / and sharpe / heate the body that
receives them. Secondly he says / that these.iij. sauerinessis / terte /
stipticall / and ponticke / cool. Thyrdly he saith / yt these.iij. relishes /
vnctuous / unsavoury / and sweet / are temperate / they make the body neither
hotter nor colder. Farther after Auice / there be.vii^. talages or sauerinesses
/ that follow vnsauerynes: and they be / sweet / bitter / Auicen.ii. can.
tract. i. cap. iii.
sharpe / terte / pontike / stiptike / vnctuous: and to nombre vnsauerynes for
sauerynes / as ye text doth / there be.ix. and than sauerynes is taken for
every thing judged by the taste. And amoge these talages there be.iij. hot /
as saith the text / salt / bitter and sharpe: and as Auicen saith / ye sharpe
is the hotter / and next is salt / and than bitter: for as much as sharpe is
stronger to resolve incidentis and scour / than bitter. And than salt is like
bitter / broken to gether with cold humidite. And of these talages.ii^. be
cold / eager / stiptike / pontike. But pontike is colder tha the other: and
next is stiptike / and than eager. And therefore all fruit / that come to any
sweetness / have first a talage pontike / of a vehement coldness: and after that
by digestiue heate of the son / the fruit be digested / there apperethe in
them stiptisite: and after they decline to sowernes / as grapes / than to
sweetness. And though terte be not so hot as stiptike / yet through hit
subtilite and persynge / is in many of more coldness. And after Auicen potike
and stiptike are in talage very like: but yet the stiptike causes the upper
part of the tongue to be sharpe and rough / and pontike causes the tongue to
be rough within. And.iij. of these talages are temperate / neither excedynge
hot nor cold / as sweet / vnctuous / unsavoury: for though sweet be hot /
yet therein apperethe no mighty heate / as Rasis saith. And every talage hath
hit own operations / as Auicen and Rasis say. The operations of sweet saith
Auicen / be digestion / sokynge / and encreasynge of norishement / nature
louynglye desires hit / and the virtue attractive draws hit. And after Rasis
/ sweet engendrethe much ruddy colour / and opilations of the liver and
spleen / specially if the said members be apt there unto. And thereof follows
ye flixe. Hit mollifies the stomach / and comfort the breast and lightis /
hit fats the body / and augments the sede of generation. The operations of
bitter / after Auicen / be sharpynge and washing away. And after Rasis /
bitter heats dries strongly / and lightly reduces the blood to adust
malice / and augmeteth ruddy colour in the blud. The operations of pontike
talage / after Auicen / is contraction / if the ponticite be feeble / orels
expression / if hit be strong. And after Rasis / pontike cools the body /
driethe the flesh / and diminishes the blood / if one use hit oft. Also hit
comfort the stomach / byndethe the womb / and engendrethe melancholy
blood. The operation of stiptike talage after Auicen / are contrary /
thyckyng / hardnynge / and holding. And after Rasis the operatios thereof are
like pontike / though they be weaker: for he seems to comprehend stiptike
talage under pontike: for of stiptike he says nothing expressly. The
operations of vnctuous talage / after Auicen / are sokynge / slipperines / and
small digestion. And after Rasis / hit mollifiethe the stomach / makes one
laskatyue / and fyllethe one or he hath taken any necessary quantite of meat:
and it heats / specially them that be vexed with a fever: and that have a
hot liver and stomach. Hit moysteth soketh the body: but hit augments fleme
and sleep. The operatios of sharpnes be resolution / incision / and
putrefaction after Auicen: And after Rasis encreaceth heate / lightly
enflames the body / and burns the blood / turnethe hit in to red coler /
and after in to black. The operations of salt talage / after Auicen / is to
scour / wash / dry / and let puttifaction. The operatios of sharpe talage /
after Auicen / is to cole and divide: and after Rasis / hit refrayneth coler
and blood / and restrayneth the bealye / if the stomach guttis be clean: but
if there in be much fleumatike matter / hit makes the bealye laske / cools
the body / and eke weaketh the virtue of digestion / proprely in the liver. It
hurts the senowes and senowye members / it dries the body: but hit stereth
up the appetite. But of vnsauerynes operations Rasis saith / that some unsavoury
thing nourishes well / that is such as is temperate. There is other some that
heats temperately / and an other that cools temperatly / and if moystnes be
joined there with / hit moystethe / and with a dry thing / hit dries.

Bis duo vipa facit / mundat dentes dat acutum
Visum / quod minus est implet / minuet quod abundat.
Here are declared.iiij. comodites of wine soppis. The first is / they purge
the teeth / by reason they stycke longer in the teeth / tha wine alone or bread
alone: therefore the fylthynes of the teeth is the better consumed / and the
teeth the better purged. The.ij. comodite is / that hit sharpeth the syghte:
for it lets the ill fumes to ascend to ye brain: which by their mynglynge
to gether / dark the syghte. And this is by reason hit digests all ill
matters being in the stomach. Thyrdly / hit digestethe perfectly meates not
well digested: for it closes the mouth of the stomach / and conforteth
digestion. Fourthly / hit reducethe su{per}fluous digestion to mean. All this
is of truth / so that the breadde sopped in wine / be first tosted / or
dried on imbers.

Omnibus assuetam iubeo seruare di^tam.
Approbo sic esse / ni sit mutare necesse.
Est hipocras testis / la sequitur mala pestis.
Fortior est metha medicine certa dieta.
Quam si non curas / fatue regis / et male curas.
Here are certain doctrines. The first is / that hit is good for all folks
to keep customable diet. To keep diet*
And by diet is understand the ministrynge of meat drink. The reason is
this. Breaking from customable use hurts grievously: for customance is an
other nature: Therefore / as hit behooves us to keep nature / so like wise hit
doth custom: and specially if the customable use be laudable. And as hit
behooves to keep the wont administration of meat and drink: even so hit
behouethe us to observe custom in other things not natural / for the self
reason. Wherefore if a ma wont to labour much / will for go this custom live
ydelly: or labour much less: or go in hade with other labour: or take an
other time / or a noway: vndouted it shall right much infeble him. So in like
manner it is in mans diet / in his sleep / in his watch / and such like
accidentis. For truly good custom in all thing must needs be observed / if hit
be laudable or indifferent in goodness or hurtfulnes / in respect of hit /
where the change is made. And wytteth well / that they that be accustomed to
labour / and exercise them self in any kind of labour / all be hit they be
feeble or old / hit grieves them less / and labour more strongly tha if they
were young fellows / unaccustomed / as Hippocrates saith.ii. aphorism. by reason
that these feeble or old persons have more inclination and custom to these
labours: For now the custom before taken is lighter / as is said in the
aforsayde aphorism. And this is the cause / why we se old feeble crafts men /
to do that stronger and younger than they can not do / and hit grieves them
less: as a feeble old milliner to lift a great weyghtye sack: A smythe to
away with greatter hammer labour / than a younger ma not thereto accustomed.
The.ij. doctrine is / that great harm folowethe change of diet / as
Hippocrates says: outcepte hit be needful to change hit. First hit is
needful to change it / when grievous diseases shulde grow thereby: as custom to
fed on ill meates / which at length of necessite will breed in us i'll
diseases. Such a custom and like must needs be amended and changed by
little and little / but not suddenly. For al sudden chages hurt vehemently /
specially from a thing customable / to vnaccustomable. Secondly / it is
needful to change / to thentent / it less grieve us / if we happen to change
our diet. For he yt uses him self to all manner diet / shall hurt him the
less. And this eke must be understand of other things not natural / for as
Hippocrates says.ii. aphoris. A thing lunge customed / though hit be worse
than these we have not used / hurts the body less. Therefore hit behouethe us
to use things unaccustomed. And here is to be noted / that every man shulde
take heed / howe he accustomethe him to one thing / be hit never so good /
which to observe were needful. Example. If a ma custom him to one manner
meat or drink / or to abstain holly fro them / or to sleep / or to know a
woman carnally / it were very dangerous for him / if he other while must
abstain from this custom. Therefore every body shulde be disposed / to endure
heate and cold / and to all mocions and norishemetis / so that the hours of
sleep and watshe / the house / bed / and garmentis / may be changed without
hurt: which thing may be done / if one be not to ne'er in observing custom.
Therefore other while hit behooves to change customable things / Thus saith
Rasis. The third doctrine is / that the stronger and ne'er way in healynge a
patient / Rasis.iii. Alm. ca. de conseruat. consuet.
is to ministre a certain diet: For which if the physician doth not care /
and will ministre an other undue diet / he foolishely governs his patient /
and healethe him ill. And note / that there be.iij. manner of dietes / gross /
which is hole folks diet / Three manner of dietes.
sklender diet / which is to give in manner nothing: The third is mean
diet / which absolutely is called sklender. And this diet is divided in to
sklender diet / declinynge to gross diet: as the broth of flesh / rear
roasted eggs / small chickyns: and declining to sklender diet / as mellicratum
/ wine of pom garnades: and mean diet / which is called certain diet / as
barley ieuse not bearen to gether. And this certain diet is wholesome in many
diseases / but not in all. Hit is not wholesome in lunge diseases: for in such
diseases / the might of ye patient / with such mean diet / can not endure to
consume the sickness / without great debilite: Therefore in such diseases / the
meat must be engrossed. Like wise it is vnholsome in sharpe diseases / as
these that end within.iij. days space or sooner: for in such most sklender
diet is best / as Hipp. says.i. aphoris. there: The most sovereign help
is to diet the paciet after his strength and corporal might.

Qual / quid / quando / quantum / quoties / vbi dando.
Ista notare cibo debet medicus dietanda.
This text rehearses.vj. things / to be considered of the physician in
ministering of diet. First / of what qualite the meat ought to be: for in
hot syckenes / we must diet the patient with cold meat: in moyste
sickness dry meat / and in dry sickness moist meat. Yet the natural
coplexion must be observed with diet like thereto: For Gal. says: Ga. ^. teg.
The hotter bodies need the hotter medicines: the colder bodies / the colder
medicines c. The.ij. thing is / of what substance the meat ought to be: For
they that be strong and lusty / and exercise great labour / must be dieted
with grosser meat: for in them the way of digestion is strong: so they ought
not to use sklender meates / as chyckyns / capons / veale / or kydde: For those
fleshes in them will burn / or be digested over soon: wherefore they must
needs eat oft. But noble men and such as live restfully / must use diet of
sklender substance: for in them ye virtue digestiue is weak / not able to
digest gross meates: as bacon / befe / and fish dried in ye son. Like wise
they that be sick of sharpe diseases / ought to use more sklender diet /
than they that be sick of lunge diseases / as a fever quartain. The.iij. is
what time diet ought to be given: for they yt be in helthe ought specially
to regard custom. Wherefore they that rise yearly in somer / and eat but.ij.
meles a day / ought to eat about the hour of.x. or a little before: and not
to abide till noone / because of the over great heate. Like wise they ought to
sup about the hour of.vj. or a little after. But in winter they ought to
dine at a.xj. of the clock / or at.xij. because of the loge slepynge: and than
to sup at.vij. a clock / or a little after. And specially custom shulde be
kept. Time also in dietynge of sick folks / must be considered. For they
that have an ague / when it begins to vex them / or a little before or
after / they shulde eat nothing: for if one eat a little before / or when
the fytte comes: thereby nature / that shulde entende to digest the meat / is
diverted an other way. If he shulde eat soon after the fytte is gone / hit
were vnholsome: for the virtue of digestion is very weak / by reason of the
fytte paste: Therefore he must eat so lunge before / as the meat may be
digested or ye fytte come. Orels so lunge after the fytte is gone / when nature
is come to due disposition. This is of truth / outcepte ye dread great
febleshynge of nature: for tha at al times he must eat. For when so ever mas
strength be feblished by any chances / he shulde eat forth with as saith
Galen / in the gloss of this aphoris. Conteplari aunt c. Fourthly / the
quantite of the meat must be considered: For as hit is before said / in somer
we must use a small quantite of meat / at every meal: for than the natural
heate is feeble through the over great resolutions. But in winter we may eat a
great del of meat at a meal. For tha the virtue digestiue is strong / when
the natural heate is vnied / through circustant cold as we said at
Temporibus veris c. The.v. is / howe oft we shulde eat in a day: For in somer
we must eat oftener than in winter: in autumpne and ver a little at each
meal / as is before said. Like wise / if the virtue digestiue be weak / we
must eat little and oft: but if the virtue digestiue be strong / we may
eat much / make few meals. Syxtlye / the eating place must be considered:
which shulde not be to hot nor to cold / but temperate.

Ius ca^lis soluit / cuius substantia restringit.
Vtra{que} quando datur / venture laxa^e paratur.
This text declares.iij. things. The first is / that the broth of
colewortis / and specially the first broth if they be sod / leuseth the
bealy: by reason that in the leaves and utter partis of colewortis / is a sopy
scouring virtue / weakly cleuynge / and lightly separable by small decoction
or boylynge: which spread abroad by the same water is made laxative. And this
is ye skele that the first water colewortis be sod in / laxe rather than the
second. The.ij. is / that the substance of colewortes / after they are boiled
/ restrayneth the bealy: by reason that all their virtue laxative is taken away
by the decoction: and the erthye dry substance remains / which binds ye
womb. The.iij. is / that both taken to gether / the broth and substance of
colewortis / leuse the bealye: by reason the scouring sopy virtue remains in
ye water / which leuseth all. And note that colewortis engendre melancholy
humours / ill dreams / they hurt the stomach / norishe little / dusk the
sight / cause one to dream / they provoke menstruosite and urine / as Auicen
and Rasis say. Farther more note / that colewortis / the decoction or sede
thereof / keep one from dronkennes / as writes Aristottell.iii. partic.
problem. asking for what skele colewortis keep one from dronkennes. And this
thing is affirmed of Auicen and Rasis. The reason / as some think / is the
gross fumes / Auicen.ii. canone. Rasis.iii. Almansol.
that by eating of colewortis are lifted up to the brain / engrossynge the
fumosites of the wine / which engrossynge let them to entre to ye brain.
Aristotell in the foresaid place saith / that al thyge that draws to hit the
moystnes of the wine / expellethe hit from the body / and that coleth the body
/ kepeth hit from dronkennes: cole wortes are of such nature / ergo c. And
that colewortis are of this nature / he prouethe thus: By the ieuse of
colewortis / the vndigested humidites of ye wine / are drawn from all the
body in to the bladder: and through it coldness left in the stomach / which
coleth all the body / the persynge thereof is fordone. And so by this mean it
kepethe a ma sobre. For the subtle superfluites that naturally could not
discende / by reason the heate of the wine stereth them to ascend upward
toward ye brain: are repressed down / and by virtue of this ieuse drawn to
the bladder.

Dedixerunt maluam veteres / quia molliat aluum.
Malue radices rade dedere feces.
Vulue nocuerunt / et fluxum sepe dederunt.
^e^.
Here are put.iij. {pro}pretes or effectis of malowes. First / malowes mollify
the bealy. For hit is one of them that mollie. There be.iiij. that mollify:
malowes double malowes / branca / vrsina / and mercury / of which most comoly
clisters be made / to mollify al indurate and harde mattier in man. There
be.ij. sortis of mallowes: the one bearethe a blood red flower / the other a
white flower: and this of hit proprete doth mollify more than ye first.
The.ij. effect of mallowes is / yt malowe rootis shaved / and suppositories
made of them / such as phisitias are wont to make of mercury / draw out of
ma the indurate matter dregs / The.iij. effect is / malowes cause the
mestruous flixe in women / and that through the great moystynge and slipperines
thereof: whereby ye veins about the matrice soon pour out / as Platearius saith
/ and as appears by experience.

Mentitur menta / si sit depellere lenta.
Ventris lumbricos / stomachi vermes{que} nociuos.
Here the auctour saith / that a mynte shulde not be called a mynte / outcepte
it have might to kylle worms in the bealy stomach. A mynte hath a great
strong savour / and is right bitter: and therefore as worm wodde kills
worms so doth the mynte. And ye ieuse thereof / as of wormewod / must be
drunk and not the substance. Yet note / because hit is hot and dry /
burning the blud / hit is vnholsome in way of meat in the regiment of helthe.
But yet in medicines / it is wholesome / for hit comfort the stomach / and
heats hit / and stynteth yexynge and digests / and prohibitethe vomit
flematike and sanguine: and through inflation stereth to bodily lust / and
prohibiteth spittynge of blood: hit is very wholesome against bytynge of a mad
dog: and if ye crymble mynt in to milk / hit will never turn to make a
chese / as Auicen saith.ii. can. cap. de menta.

Cur moritur homo / cui saluia crescit in horto?
Contra vim mortis non est medicamen in hortis.
Saluia confortat neru^s / manum{que} tremorem
Tollit / et eius open febris acuta fugit
Saluia / castoreum lauendula / premula veris
Nastur athanasia sanant paralitica membra.
Saluia saluatrix natura consiliatrix.
In this text ye author touches principally.iiij. things. First he shows
the great vtilite of sage / asking as though he doubted: The bout of sage.
wherefore man diethe / that hath sage growing in his gardeyne. He answers in
the.ij. verse / that no medicine growing in the gardeyn can withstand death al
though in the gardeyne grow medicines that keep the body from putrefaction /
and defend that natural humidite be not lightly consumed away / as teaches
Auicen / Auic. iii.i. ^p. sing.
saying: The sciece of physic doth not make a man immortal / nor hit doth
not surely defend our bodies from outward hurt full thingis: nor can not
assure every man to live to the last term and day of his life: but of.ij.
things hit makethe us sure / that is from putrefaction and corruption: and
defends that natural moisture be not lightly disolued consumed. Secondly /
he puttethe.iij. effectis of sage. The first is / The ver^ue of sage
that sage comfort the senowes: for it driethe the humidites / by which the
senowes be let and leused. The.ij. is / hit takes away the shaking of the
hands: by reason that it comfort the senowes / as is said / now all
thing cofortynge the senowes / removes trembling / for trembling comethe of
feblenes of the senowes. And therefore some old men and women specially put
sage leaves in their meat drink. Thirdly sage lets the sharpe ague to
assail us: by reason that hit driethe humours / hit lets them to putrefy /
whereby a sharpe fever might be engendered. Farther note / that sage is hot and
dry / therefore hit is not very wholesome alone in way of meat. Yet because
sage comfort the senowes greatly / folks in health use hit much.ij. manner
of ways. Sage. Wine.
First they make sage wine: which they drink specially at begynnyge of dinner
or supper. This wine is wholesome for them yt have the palsy or falling
sickness / moderately taken / and after the purgation of the accident mattiers.
Secondly they use sage in sauces: for it ste^ethe up a mas appetite / and
specially when the stomach is full of ill humours / raw and vndigested. There
is.ij. kinds of sage. One yt hath great broad leaves. Two kindis of sage
An other commonly called noble sage / whose leaves be more narowe and less:
phisitios cal it silifagus. Thyrdly thautour rehearses.vj. medicines good for
the palley. Hit is said / that sage / castorie / that is a castors stones /
lavender / primrose / wattercresse / and tansey / cure and heal members
enfect with palsy. Why sage doth help it we have showed / for hit coforteth
ye senowes / which by palsy be weaked. And eke because sage is hot dry /
it consumes the flematike matter remaining in the senowes / whereof ye palsy
grows. And that castorie is wholesome for the palsy appears by that hit is
most comfortable / heatynge and dryenge of the senowes: For Auicen saith
thereof / Auicen.ii. can. ca. de castoreo.
that hit is subtiler and stronger than any other that heats and dries. And
after he saith / that hit comfort and heats the senowes / the shaking /
the moist cramp / and benomed members caused of the palsy. And eke he saith:
there is nothing better for ventosite in the ear / tha to take as much as a
peas / and tempre it with oil of spike / so let it drop in to the ear.
Castorie hath many other virtues which Auice rehearses. Castoriu is the stones
of a see beast called castor. The oil also of Castorie is as specially good
for the palsy / as castorie after voidynge of the matter: for than hit
consumes the resydue of the mattier that remains / comfort the senowes.
Of laueder apereth: For with hit sweet savour / it comfort the senowes / and
with hit heate doth consume the palsy mattier. And also of the primrose eke
appears / for with hit sweet savour and heate / hit comfortethe the senowes.
This flower is called premula veris / because hit is the first sweet flower
that spryngeth in ver. The.v. is a watter cress / for hit is hot / dry /
subtle / incisiue / and resolutiue: whereby it takes away ye mattier of palsy
/ And Auicen saith / hit comfort all mollification of the senowes / for hit
heats / and drawethe out fleme / and cleanses the senowes from fleme: and
physicians cousaile us to eat water cressis in lent because lenten meat is
flematike. Watercresse is a como herb growing in cold / stony / watrishe
places / where as be many well springes. The.vj. is tansey: The virtue of this
herb is to purge fleme / and with it heate dries the senowes. Also hit
purgethe a man of worms / and the mattier whereof they be engendered. And
therefore french men use commonly to fry eggs therewith in ye ester weke / to
purge away the fleme / engedred of fyshe in the lent: whereof worms are soon
engendered in them thereto disposed. In the end of the text the auctour says
/ that sage is called the saver and keeper of nature.

Nobilis est ruta / quia lumina reddit acuta.
Auyilio rute vir quip videbis acute.
Ruta viris coitum minuet / mulieribus auget.
Ruta facit castum / dat lumen / et ingerit estum.
Cocta facit ruta de pulicibus loca tuta.

Auicen.ii. can. ca. de ruta.
First hit sharpeth the sight / proprely the ieuse thereof / as Auicen saith:
and as is before said at Allea nux ruta. The.ij. is / few diminishethe ye
desire of carnal lust in men / but in women few augments hit: by reason
that rue by hit heatynge dryenge diminishes the sede of me / which is subtle
and of the nature of the air / but in women rue makes subtle and heatethe
the sede: for in them hit is wattrishe and cold: and therefore hit sterethe
them more to carnal lust. The.iij. is / few makes a man quick / subtle /
and inuentife: by reason that by heatynge and dryenge / hit makes a mans
spiritis subtle / and so clerethe the wit. The.iiij. is / that the water
that rue is sod in / To kylle flees.
cast and sprinkeled about the house / riddeth away flees / and as physicians
say / it kills them. And after Auicen: when the house is sprinkeled with the
water of wild gourdes / the flees leap flee away: And like wise doth the water
that black thorne is sod in. And after Auicen says / Auice.vi.iiii. tract.
iii. cap. de effug. pulicum.
that some have said / if goottis blood be put in a pyt in the house / the
flees will gether there unto and dye. And like wise if a log be anointed
with the grease of an yrchyn / ye flees will gether thereto and dye. Flees can
not abide the savour of colewortis / nor leaves of Oleandre. Some say / that
nothing is better to avoid flees than things of strong savour: therefore
few / myntis / horse myntis / and hoppis be good / and above all thyngis horse
dounge orels horse stale is the chief. Also the house spryncled with ye
decoction of rape sede kills flees. And the parfumyng of ye house with a
bulls horne / driuethe away flees. Yet to take flees / nothing is better /
than to lay blankettis on the bed / for therein they gether them self.

De cepis medici non consentire videtur.
Colericis non esse bonas dicit Galienus.
Flegmaticis vero multum docet esse salubres.
(...)
Presertim stomacho. pull chrumque creare colorem.
Contritis cepis loca denudata capillis.
Sepe fricans poteris capitis reparare decorem.
(...)
Here the auctour speaks of oynions / and declares.v. things. First /
touching their operation physicians agree not: For some say they be good for
flematike folks: and some say nay / as Rasis / which saith / that they
engedre superfluous and flematyke humours in the stomach. Secondly / Galen
says / they be right hurtful for colerike folks: because as Auice saith /
oynios be hot in the third degree: and therefore they hurt hot folks / as
colerike be. Thirdly oynios be wholesome for flematike folks: For they be hot /
persynge / subtle / scouring / and opening / wherefore they digest / cut /
make subtle / and wipe away fleumatike and clamy humours / grown in the
fleumatike folks. Fourthly / oynions be wholesome for the stomach / for they
mundifie hit from fleme / and heate hit. And therefore Auicen saith / that hit
/ that is eat of the oynion / through the heate thereof comfortethe a weak
stomach. And eke therefore they make a man well colered: For it is impossible
for one to have a lyuelye coler / if his stomach be very fleumatike / or
filled with ill / raw / flematike humours. The.v. is / oynions sod and
stamped / restore hears again / if the place where ye hears were / be rubbed
therewith. This is of truth / when the hear gothe away through stoppynge of
the pores / and corruption of the mattier under the skin. For the oynions
open the pores / resolve the ill mattier under ye skin / draw good mattier
to he same place. And therefore / as Auicen saith / oft rubbing with oynions is
very wholesome for bald men. Auicen.ii. can. ca. de preal. Et vii.iii. ca. de
curatioe alo perie.
Wherefore the text concludethe / that this rubbing with oynions prepares ye
beauty of the heed: for hears are ye beauty of the heed. For a farther
knowledge of oynious operation / witteth / that they stere to carnal lust /
{pro}uoke the appetite / bring colour in the face / mingled with honey they
destroy wartes / they engendre thyrste / they hurt the vnderstadynge (for they
engedre an ill gross humour) they encreace spittell / the ieuse of them is
good for wattrynge eyes / and doth clarify the syghte / as Auicen saith.
Farther note / that oynions / honey / and vinegar stamped to gether / is good
for bytynge of a mad dog. And therefore some add these.ij. verses unto the
forsayde text. Appositas perhibent morsus curare caninos.
Si trite cum melleprins fuerint et aceto.
But of this is spoken before at Allea nux. c.

Et modicum granum / siccum / calidum{que} sinapis.
Dat lachrymas / purgatque caput / tol^t{que} venenu^.
Here the auctour touchethe.ij. things. First he puts the coplexio of
mustard sede / of mustard sede.
saying / that mustard sede is a little grain hot and dry: which is
true: for it is hot and dry unto the.iiij. degree after Auicen.ii. canone.
cap. de sinapi. Secondly / he puts.iij. propretes or effects of mustard
sede. The first is / it makes ones eyes to water: For with hit great heate
/ hit makes subtle and leusethe the humidites of the brain: whereof than by
their flowynge to the eyes / the tears come. The.ij. effect is / hit purgethe
the brain / mundifienge and clensynge away the flematike humidites of the
heed. Also hit purgethe the heed / put in to the nose thyrllis / by hit
mordication provoking one to nese. And therefore hit is put in their nostrils /
yt have apoplexy / for by reason of nesynge the brain is pourged. And like
wise mustard sede / through it great heate / doth dissolve and leuse such
flemes as stop the cundites of ye brain: of which follows apoplexy: And
thus hit apperethe / that mustard sede is a great leuser / consumer / and
clenser of flematike humidites. The.iij. effect is / hit withstandethe poison:
Auice. loco prealleg.
For Auicen says / that venomous worms can not abide the smoke of mustard
sede.

Crapula discutitur / capitis dolor / at{que} grauedo.
Purpuream dicunt violam curare caducos.
The prophets of (...).
Here are put.iij. {pro}pretes or effectis of violettis. First / violettis delay
dronkennes: by reason that violettis / have a temperate sweet savour / which
greatly coforteth the brain: For a strong brain is not lightly over come with
drink / but a weak is. Also a violet is cold / wherefore hit colethe the
brain: and so makes hit unable to receive any fume. The.ij. is / violettis
slakes heed ache and grefe / that is caused of heate / as Auicen / Rasis Alma.
and Mesue say: by reason that violettis be cold / they withstand hot
causes. The.iij. is / violettis help them yt have the falling syckenes. Though
some say thus / yet this effect is not commonly ascribed unto violettis. And
therefore if violettis have this proprete / hit is but by reason of their sweet
smell / that coforteth the brain: which strengthed / is not hurt by small
geefes: and consequently falls not in to epilencie (which is called the
little apoplexy / chaunsynge by stoppynge of the sensible senowes.

Egris dat somnum / vomitum quo{que} tollit ad vsum.
Compescit tussim veterem / colicis{que} medetur.
Pellit pulmonis frigus / ventris{que} tumorem.
Omnibus morbis subueniet articulorum.
This text openethe.vij. propretes of nettyls. First nettyls cause a sick
body to sleep. For hit is subtiliatiue / cuttynge / and scouring of fleme and
gross humours / greuynge nature lettynge sleep. Secondly it doth away vomit /
custom thereof: by reason that vomit and parbrakyng is caused of a clamy
humour / which the nettel cutteth. Thyrdly / the nettell fordothe old cough:
and specially honey / wherein nettell sede is tempered. For the nettell auoydethe
clamye fleme out of the breast / as Rasis saith. Auic. ii. ca. cap. de vt.
And Auicen says of the nettell: that when hit is drunk / with water is is /
ther^yll drunk with wine / healethe the bealy ache: For hit asswageth
inflasion caused of gross ventosite / whereof the ache comes / for hit leuseth
ventosite of the stomach and all other guttis / and opens stoppynge / and
there unto the wine helps. Thyrdely / cherfyil cessethe vometynge and the
laske: by reason hit is hot in the.iij. degree / and dry in the.ij. it
digests / and dries that mattier whereof vomit comes. And this is very
truth / when vomit or the laske come of cold flematike mattier. And besides
these effectis / hit provokes urine and the menstruosite / and swageth ache of
the sides and raynes / and specially taken with mellicratum. Enula campana
reddit precordia sana.
Cum succo rute / si succus sumitur huius.
Asfirmat ruptis nil esse salubrius istis.
Here the text opens.ij. effectis of enula capana. Elf doc^e ^worte or horse
^ele.
First / hit comfort the heart string / that is / the brymme of the
stomach is proprely called the heart stringis / orels the vital members / that
is / the wyndye members / which be ne'er the heart / and specially the heart
rote. That hit comfort the brymme of the stomach appears / in that the
sweet smelling rote of enula coforteth the senowy mebres. The bryme of the
stomach is a senowye membre. That hit comfort breathy members appears. For
wine made of enula / called vinum enulatum / Auicen.ii. can. ca. de enula.
cleanses the breast / and lyghtis / or lunges / as Auice saith. Also enula
swalowed down with honey / helps a man to spit: and it is one of those
herbs / that rejoice and coforte the hart. The.ij. effect is / the ieuse of
this herb / with the ieuse of rue / is very wholesome for them yt be burst /
and that is specially when the burstennes comes by ventosite: for these.ij.
ieuses dissolve that. And besidis these effectis / enula is good for a stomach
/ filled with i'll humours: and it opens opilatios of the liver and spleen / as
Rasis says. And hit comfort all hurtis / cold grefes / and motions of
ventosites / and inflasions / as Auicen saith.

Cum vino coleram nigram potata repellit.
Sic dicunt veterem sumptum curare podagram.
Here are put.ij. effectis of hill wort. A remedy for coler.
First hill wort / principally the water thereof taken with wine / purges
black coler. Secondly / hilwort / heleth an old gout. For the {pro}prete of
this herb is to melt and dissolve fleme: whereof / very oft / the gout is
wont to be engedred. And note / that after Platearius / hill wort is hot and
dry in the third degree. The substance thereof is subtle / the virtue
comfortable / through the sweet smell / of hit substance hit openethe / and of
hit qualites draws: of hit fury substance or nature / hit consumes / by
burning and drienge.

Illius succo crines retinere fluentes
Alitus asseritur / dentisque curare dolorem.
Et squamas succus sanat cum mell perunc^us.
Here he puttethe.iij. effectis of water crosses. water crosses.
First / watercresses reteyne hears / falling away / if the heed be
anointed with the iewse thereof / orels if the ieuse or water thereof be drunk.
This effect Auicen touches saying: Aui. ii. ca. cap. de (...).
The drynkyke or annoyntyng with watercressis cure tothe ache: specially if the
ache come by cold: for it persethe / resoluethe / and heatethe / as apperethe
at Cur moriatur homo. Thyrdly / ye ieuse of water cress take with honey / or
the place anointed therewith / doth away skales that cleave to ones skin: by
reason yt such skales be engedred of salt fleme. Watercresse as is said /
purges all fleme: therefore if hit be drunk / hit resists the cause of
skales: and the place anointed therewith avoids the skales / and specially
mingled with honey: for that is a cleser / and so helps the cressis to purge.
Beside these effectis / cressis dry up the corruption of the bealy / cleanses
the lyghtis / heats the stomach and liver / and is wholesome against the
grosnes of the spleen: proprely when thereof and honey / a plaster is made / it
causes one to caste up coler / hit augments carnal lust: and by
dissoluynge avoids out worms / and provokes menstruosite / as saith Auicen.

Cecatis pullis / ac lumina matter hyrundo /
Plinius vt scribit / quamuis sunt eruta / reddit.
of celendine.
Here is put one notable thing of Celendine. When yonge swalowes be blind /
the dame brings celendine / and rubbeth their eyes / makes them to see:
whereby the auctour shewethe / hit is wholesome for the sight. And this appears
plainly / since hit is commonly put in medicines against feblenes of syghte.
Celendine hath ieuse is well known. And why swalowes know it better tha other
birds may be / by cause their yonge be oftner blind: swalowes donge doth make
blind: and so the dame dogeth some time in the yonges eyes / and makes them
blind. And after Platearie / celendine is hot and dry in the.iij. degree.
And of it qualites and substance / hit hath virtue to dissolve / consume / and
draw. And the rootis thereof stamped sod in wine / are good to purge the heed
/ and woman's priuite from broken moist humours / if the paciet receives the
smoke thereof at the mouth / after gargyse wine in ye throat.

Auribus infusus vermes succus necat vsus.
Cortex vertucas in aceto cocta resoluit.
Pomorum succus flos partus destru^t eius.
Here thauctour rehearses.iij. thyges of wylowe. To kylle vvormes in ones
ears. Auicen.ii. can. ca. de salice.
First / the ieuse of wylowe poured in to ones ear / kills worms: by reason
of the stiptisite dryenge thereof. And after Auicen nothing is better to heal
matterynge at the ears / than the ieuse of wylowe leaves. Secondly / the rynde
of wylowes / sod in vinegar / doth away wartes. And Auicen says / wylowe
ashes with vinegar / To void wartes.
draws up wartis by the rotis: by reason of ye ashes vehement drienge. Yet to
destroy wartis / nothyg is better / tha to rub them with purslane. This
purslane doth of hit {pro}prete and not qualite / after Auicen. Thyrdlye /
Auicen.ii. can. ca. de portulaca.
wylowe flowers and ieuse of it fruit / lets the birth of a child: for
through hit stiptisite and drought / hit causes the child to be borne with
great payne.

Confortare crocus dicatur letificando.
of saffro.
Membra{que} defecta confortat epar reparando.
Here are put certain wholesome thyges of saffro. First / saffron coforteth
mans body / in gladding it. And wytteth well / that saffron hath such proprete
/ that if one take more thereof than he ought / hit will kylle him in reioysynge
or laughing. Auicen says / (...). ii. ca. (...) de ^reco
that to take a drame and a half / will kylle one in reioysynge. Secondly /
saffron comfortethe defective members / and principally the heart. Hit
comfort eke the stomach / by hit stiptisite and heate: and for the same
cause restores the liver / and specially through hit stiptisite / which will
not suffer the liver to be disolued. Yet to use hit over much / induseth
parbrakynge / and mars the appetite. Of this Auicen warnethe us / saying:
Hit causes parbrakynge mars the appetite / because it is contrary to the
sharpness in the stomach / which is cause of appetite. Besides these
{pro}pretes / faffron makes one sleep / and dullethe the wits / and when hit
is drunk with wine / hit makes one drunk / it cleanses the eyes / and
lettethe humours to flow to them / hit makes one to breath well / it stereth
to carnal lust / and makes one to pysse.

Flegma vires modicas tribuit / latos{que} breuesque.
Flegma facit pingues / sanguis reddit mediocres.
Sensus hebes / tardus motus / pigritia somnus.
Hic somnus lentus / piger / in hac sputamine mul^us.
Et qui sensus habes pingues / facit color albus.
This text shows certain propretes of the coplexio of fleme. First /
flematike folks be weak / by reason that their natural heate / which is
beginner of all strength and operation / is but feeble. Secondly / flematike
folks be short and thycke: for their natural heate is not strong enough to
length the body: and therefore hit is thycke and short. Thirdly / flematike
folks be fat / because of their great humidite. Therefore Auicen saith / that
superfluous grese signifies cold and moistnes: For the blood and the
vnctious mattier of grese / persynge through the veins in to the cold members
(through coldness of the members) do conieile to gether / and so engendre in
man much grese / as Galen saith in his.ij. book of operation. He says after
/ that sanguine men are myddell bare between the lunge and the short. Fourthly
/ flematike folks are more inclined to ydelnes and study than folks of other
coplexion: by reason of their coldness / that makethe them sleep. Fyftlye / they
sleep lodger / by reason of their great coldness / that provokes them to sleep.
Syxtelye / they be dull of wit and understanding: for as temperate heate is
cause of good wit and quick under stadyng: so cold is cause of blut wit
dull vnderstadyng. Seuethly / they be slothful / that is by cold: for as heate
makes a ma light quick in moving: so cold makes a man heavy slothful.
The.viij. is / they be lumpyshe and sleep lunge.

Reddit fecundas permansum sepe puellas.
Isto stillantem poteris retinere cruorem.
This text opens.i^. comodites of lekes. First oft eating of lekes make
yonge women frutfull: Of lekes.
by reason as Auicen says / Auicen.ii. can. ca. de porro.
lekes delat the matrice / and takes away the hardness thereof: which lets
the conception. Secondly lekes stynce bledynge at the nose / as Auicen says.
Many other effectis of lekes are rehearsed at Allea nux ruta.

Quod piper est nigrum non est dissoluere pigrum.
Flegmata purgabit / digestiuam{que} iuuabit.
Lencopiper stomacho prodest / tussis{que} dolori.
Vtile preueniet motum febris{que} rigorem.
Pepper.
This text declares many comodites of pepper: and first.iij. of black pepper.
First / black pepper / through hit heate drines / leuseth quickly: for it is
hot and dry in the.iij. degree. Secodly / hit purges fleme: for it draws
fleme from the inner part of the body / and consumes hit. Like wise hit
auoydethe fleme out that cleuethe in the breast and stomach / heatynge /
subtilynge dissoluynge hit. Thyrdly / hit helpethe digestion. And this appears
by Auice / Auic. ii. ca. cap. de pi^.
saying: that pepper is digestiue causynge appetite. And this specially is to
be understand by lunge pepper: which is more wholesome to digest raw humours
tha either white or black / Gal. iii. de reg. sanitatis. ca. vii.
as witnesses Galen. Secodly / he declares.v. wholesome things of white
pepper. First / white pepper comfortethe the stomach. And this appears by
Galens words / saying: that hit coforteth ye stomach more than ye other.ij.
To this agrees Auicen / Auic. loco preal^eg.
saying: white pepper is more wholesome for the stomach: and more vehemently
doth comfort. The.ij. is / pepper is wholesome for the cough / specially
caused of cold fleumatike mattier / for hit heatethe / dissoluethe / and
cutteth hit. To this Auicen assenteth / saying: When pepper is ministered in
lectuaries / it is wholesome for the cough / and aches of the breast. Thyrdely
/ white pepper is wholesome for ache / and that is to wit of the breast / and
vetous payne. And for that all pepper is good: for all pepper is a dimynysher
and a voyder of wind. And Auicen says: that white pepper and lunge is
wholesome for prickynge ache of the bealye / Against belyache.
if hit be drunk with honey fresh bay leaves. Fourthly / pepper withstands
the causes of a cold fever / for it digests and heats the mattier. Fyftly
/ white pepper is wholesome for a shaking fever / by reason that pepper with it
heate comfort ye senowes / and consumes the mattier spread on them. And
Auicen saith in rubbing it is made an oyntmet (with vnguentum) wholesome against
shaking. These.v. {pro}pretes are ascriued to ye other kydes of pepper / as
Auice saith. And beside these effectis / pepper heteth the senowes and braunes
of mans body: it mundifieth the lightis / and a little thereof {pro}uoketh the
urine / but much leuseth ye bealy / as says Auicen. There be.iij. sortis of
pepper / white pepper / called lencopiper / lunge pepper / called macropiper /
black pepper / called melancopiper. Hit is called white pepper that is very
grene and moist: and when it is a little dried / and not perfectly ripe / hit
is called lunge pepper. But when hit is perfectly ripe / hit is called black
pepper.

Et mox post escam dormire / nimis{que} moueri.
Ista grauare solent auditus ebrietas{que}.
Hurtful to the hearing.
Here are touched.iij. things that grieve the hearing. The first is / immediate
sleep after meat / and that is if one eat his fill. For the immediate sleep
will not suffer the meat to digest: and of meat vndigested are engedred
gross vndigested fumes: which with their grossenes stop the cundites of
hearing: eke they engross trouble the spiritis of hearing. The.ij. is to much
mouynge after meat: for that also lets digestion / and the due shutting of
the stomachs mouth: by reason that than the stomachs mouth closes not so
easily / as by a little walking / whereby the meat discendethe to the bottum
of the stomach. For when the stomach is not shut / many fumes ascend to the
heed / that grieve the hearing. The third is dronkennes / whereof many fumes and
vapours are engedred / which ascede to the heed / organ of hearing / troublyng
the spirit thereof / and greuynge the hearing. And drokennes doth not only
hurt the hearing / but also the syghte / and all the sensis / for the same
cause / as is before said. Auice.iiii.^ii. cap. ii. de conseruat. sanit.
auris.
There be.iij. things / as Auicen says / that hurt the ear and other
senses / lothynge / repletion / and sleep after repletion. And some text hath
this verse: Balnea / sol / vomitus / offer repletio clamour. Which things
grieve the hearing / but specially great noise. For Auicen saith / if we will
here well and naturally / we must eschew the son / laborious baynynge /
vomit / great noise / and repletion.

Metus / longa / fames / vomitus / percussio / casus.
Ebrietas / frigus / tinnitum causat in aure.
Here are touched.vij. things / which cause a hummynge a noise in ones ear.
The first is / fear / and after some / motion. The cause is / for in fear /
the spiritis and humours crepe inward toward the heart sodaynlye: by which
motion ventosite is lightly engendered / which entering to the organ of the
hearing causes tyngynge or ryngynge in the ear. By corporal mouynge also
humours and spiritis are moved / of which motion ventosite is lightly
engendered / which coming to the ears causes ryngynge. For ryngynge is
caused through some mouynge of a vapour or ventosite about the organ of the
hearing / mouynge the natural air of those pipes contrary to their course.
The.ij. is great hunger: Auice.iiii.iii. cap. ix.
Auicen shows the reason saying: that this thing chacethe through humours
spread and resting in mans body. For when nature finds no meat / she is
converted unto them / and resoluethe moves them. The.iij. is vometynge: For in
vometynge / which is a laborious motion / humours are specially moved to the
heed. In token whereof we se the eyes and face come red / and the syghte
hurt. And thus also by vometyng / vapours and ventosites are soon moved to
thorgan of the hearing. The.iiij. is oft beatynge about the heed / specially
the ear. For thereby chances vehement motion of the natural air / being in
the organ of the hearing. For when any membre is hurt / nature is hurt.
The.iiij. is the wind / and specially the southe. Hippoc. apho. illo. ^as^rini
flatus c.
Whereof Hippocrates says: the southe wind is mystye / and duskethe the eyes:
for that wind fyllethe the heed with humidites / which dull the wyttis and
dark the syghte. The.v. is pepper / which through ye sharpness thereof /
engendrethe fumes that byte the eyes. The.vj. is garlyke / which also hurts
the eyes / through it sharpness and vaporosite / as is said at Allea nux.
The.vij. is smoke / which hurtethe the eyes / through hit mordication and
drienge. The.viij. is lekes: For by eating of them / gross melancholy fumes
are engendered: whereby the syghte is shadowed / as is before said / at Allea
nux ruta. c. The.ix. is oynions / the eating of which hurtethe the eyes /
through their sharpness. The.x. is lens / the much eating whereof / as Auicen
saith / dusketh the syghte / through the vehement dryenge thereof. The.xj. is to
much weeping: which weakethe the eyes / for hit causes debilite retentive of
the eyes. The.xij. is beans: the use whereof engenders a gross melancholy fume
/ darkynge the visible spiritis / as lekes do. And therefore the eating of
beans / inducethe dredefulle dreams. The.xiij. is mustard / the use whereof
febleth the sight through hit tartnes. The.xiiij. is to loke against the son:
and that is through the vehement splendour and bryghtenes thereof: whereby the
syghte is destroyed: as apperethe by experience. For the vehement sensiblenes of
a thyg / not proporcioned to mans sense / as the son beams / corrupt mans
sense. The.xv. is to much carnal copulation / and specially after great
fedynge or repletion / or after great voidyg or emptines: but this is all ready
declared. The.xvj. is fire / the beholdynge whereof / causes vehement drines
in the eyes / and so hurts the syghte: and eke the bryghtnes thereof hurtethe
the eyes. And therefore we se comonlye / that smythes and such as work before
the fire / be red eyed and feeble sighted. The.xvij. is to great labour / for
that eke dries vehemently. The.xviij. is smiting upon the eyes / which
hurts the eyes and sight / for it makes them blood shot / troubles ye
visible spirit: other while engendrethe impostumes. The.xix. is to much use
of te^t or sharpe thyges / as sauces: and that is through the tertnes of fumes
of them engendered. The.xx. is dust / or walking in dusty places: in which
dust flees light lyin to the eyes / duskethe the syghte. The.xxj. and above
other hurtful to the eyes and sight / is to much watch: For to much watch
inducethe to much drynes in the eyes. And generally all repletions hurt the
eyes: and all that driethe up nature: and all that trouble the blood / by
reason of saltnes or sharpness. All dronkennes hurts the eyes: but vometynge
coforteth the sight / in that hit purges the stomach: and hurts hit / in
that hit moves the mattiers of the brain / dryuynge them to the eyes. And
therefore if hit be needful to spue / hit must be done after meat without
constraynynge. Also to much sleep incontinent after meat / and much blood
lettynge / and proprelye with ventosites / hurtethe the syghte as Auicen
saith.iii. tract. iiii. ca. iiii. where he expresses many of the forsayde
causes.

Feniculus / verbena / rosa / celidonia / ruta /
Ex istis fit aqua / que lumina reddit acuta.
This text recitethe.v. herbs / whose water is very wholesome for the syghte.
To clarify the eyes.
The first is fenell / whose ieuse put in to the eye / sharpeth the syghte /
after Rasis.iij. Alm. The.ij. is verueyn / whereof the water is of many
physicians put in resceytes wholesome against feblenes of syghte. The third is a
rose / whose water doth comfort the lyuelye spirit and syghte. The.iiij. is
celendine / whose ieuse is citrine / hit is called celidonia / that is /
gyuynge celestial gifts. The.v. is few: ye water of those.ij. herbs is
wholesome for the syghte / as physicians commonly say.

Sic dentes serua / porrorum collige grana.
No careas jure cum iusquiamo simul ur.
Sic{que} per embotum fumum{que} cape dent remotum.
Here the auctour recites certain medicines for tothe ache. For tothe ache.
He says / Likes sede henbane burned to gether / is good for the tothe ache.
They must be ministered on this wise: The ieuse of hebane with the like sede
must be burned to gether: and the smoke must be resceiued through a fonell / on
the side that the ache is. The virtue of the hebane takes away the feeling of
the payne. And the virtue of ye like sedes fume kills worms: which other
while lyenge in the concauites of ye teeth / cause intolerable payne / as
Auicen says / ii. canone cap. de porro.

Nux oleum / frigus capitis / anguilla{que} potus.
Ac pomum crudum faciunt hominem fore raucum.
This text declares.vj. causes of horsenes. The first is eating of nuttis:
for nuttis dry much: and therefore they asperate the voice / and make it like
a cranes voice. The.ij. is oil / the use whereof may engendre horsenes: for
some clamy partis thereof cleue fast to the pipe of the lyghtis / causyg
horsnes. Secondly / hit may make colerike folks hoorse for that in them ye
oil is lightly inflamed / and so that inflammation causes exasperation and
horesnes: but the first cause seems better. The third is cold of the heed:
For cold of the heed doth press to gether the brain: whereby the humours
discende toward the throat / and the pipe of the lyghtis: enducynge horsenes /
through to much moystnes of the pipe. The.iiij. is eating of yeles: for the
eating of them multiplies clamy fleme: which coming to the lyghtis / stycke
there styll / and cause horsnes. The.v. is over much drinking / specially
toward bed. Now the vehement wetynge of the pipe of the lightis / doth
chieflye cause horesnes of the voice / as all physicians say. The.vj. is raw
apuls / for in that they be raw they encreace fleme: and if they be not ripe /
but sharpe and sower / they make the throat rough.

Ieiuna / vigila / caleas dape / valde labora.
Inspira calidum / modicum ^ibe / comprime flatum.
Hec been tu serna si vis de pellere reuma.
Si f^nat ad pectus / dicatur reuma catarrus.
Ad fauces branchus / ad nares esto corisa.
Here are touched.vij. thyges that cure ye reume. The first is abstinence from
meat / ^or the ^.
or fasting / for thereby the mattier of reume is dimynyshed: for abstinence
dries / and the mattier is better ryped and consumed: For when nature fyndethe
no matter of food / whereon she may work: she works upon reumatike mattier
and consumes hit: and so the heed is less filled therewith. Wherefore Auicen
says: that a man having the catar or the pose / shulde take heed he fylle
not him self with meates. The.ij. is watch: for watch dries the brain /
and withstands that ye vapours ascend not to the heed. The.iij. is hot
meatis and drynkes: for through their heate the cold mattier of the reume is
digested. The.iiij. is to labour much: for thereby the mattier reumatike is
consumed: by reason that much labour dries up ye su{per}fluites of the body.
And in stead of val^e some textis have vest: and than the sentence is / that
warm garmetis is wholesome for the reume / specially when hit comes by cold
mattier. The v. is inspirynge of hot aier / and specially if the catarre
proceed of cold matter: for by breathing of warm aier / the mattier is warmed
and riped. The.vj. is to drink little and endure thyrst: for thereby the
reumatike mattier is consumed. And eke by little drinking the heed is not
filled as with much drinking. The.vij. is to hold ones breath: for that is
specially good in a catarre / caused of a cold mattier: by reason that this
holdyg of the breathe heatethe the partis of the breast: and so the cold
fleumatike mattier / causynge the catarre / is better digested. These things
and many other Auicen touches / saying: Auice. loc^ prealleg.
Hit behouethe to keep the heed warm continually. And also hit must be kept
from the north wind / and proprely after the southe. For the southe wind /
repleteth and makethe rare. The north wind / constrains. Also he must
drink no cold water: nor sleep on the day time: He must endure thyrst / huger
/ and watch: as much as he can: for these things in this sickness are the
beginning of health. Rasis.ix. Almauso^.
Farther more Rasis bids him yt hath ye reume / to beware of lyenge up
right. For by lyenge up right the reumatike matter flows to the hinder
partis of man / where as be no manifest issues / whereby the mattier may void
out: Therefore hit is to be feared lest hit flow to the senowes / and cause the
cramp or palsy. And like wise he ought utterly to forbear wine: for wine is
vaporous: and in that hit is very hot / it dissolveth the mattier / and
augments the reume: And like wise he must not stand in the son nor by the
fire: for the son and fire leuse the mattier and augments the reume. In the
last.ij. verses thauctour puttethe difference between these.iij. names /
catarrus / branchus / and corisa. And the difference stands in ye mattier
flowing to one part or an other of the body: When the mattier ronethe to the
breast partis / hit is called catarrus: when hit ronneth by the nose / it is
called corisa: when hit ronnethe to the neck / hit is called branchus. But
this word reume doth note signify generally all manner of mattier flowing
from one membre to an other.

Auripigmentum sulphur miscere memento.
His decet apponi calcem commisce saponi.
Quattuor hec misce. commixtis quatuor istis.
Fistula curatur / quater ex his si repleatur.
Here the auctour puts a curable medicine for the fistule / For the fistule.
saying: that a plaster made of auripigmentum / brymstone / white lyme / soap
mingled to gether heals the fistule. For these thyngis have virtue to dry
and mundifie: which ententions are requisite in healynge a fistule. Platearie
saith / auripigmentum is hot and dry in the.iiij. degree: it dissolveth and
drawethe / consumethe / and mundifieth. Brymstone and soap as he saith / are
hot dry: but brymstone is more vehement: for hit is hot and dry in
the.iiij. degree / but soap is not. Auicen says / that lyme washed / dries
without mordicatio / and makethe steddye. The fistule is a rounnynge sore /
which avoids mattier more or less / after the diuersite and course of the
moon. Auripigmetum is that ye grauers fast bras other metals with to stones.

Here thauctour nombreth the bones / teeth / and veins in mans body. First /
of bones.
he says there be CCxix. bones. Yet after the doctors of phisike / as
Hippocrates / Galen / Rasis / Auerroys / and Auice / the bones in ma
be.CCxlviij. And though herin be variance / yet there is a master of physic
that says:

Ossa ducenta sunt / at{que} quater duodena. Secondly thauctour saith / that a
man most commonly shulde have.xxxij. teeth. The nobre of teeth.
But yet hit chances that some men lack.iiij. the last teeth: which be
behind them that we call the grynders: these have but.xxviij. teeth. Some
lack these iiij. last teeth in child hod only: some other lack them till
they be very old: and some all their life. Aui. i. doct v. cap. de anoth.
dedenttum.
Here is to be noted / yt after Auicen / the.ij. foremost teeth be called
duales: and.ij. on either side of these twain / are called quadrupli. There
be.ij. in the upper jaw / and.ij. in the nether: al these teeth were ordained
to cut: and therefore some cal them cutters / and specially the duales. Next
unto those quadruples / are.ij. teeth above / and.ij. benethe. called canini /
whose office is to break harde thingis. After those be.iiij. other on either
side called grynders.iiij. above and.iiij. beneth. After those some have a
tothe called sensus / on either side / and as well above as benethe. These also
are ordained to grynde mans meat. And so the hole nombre of ye teeth
is.xxxij. orels.xxviij. in them that have not ye teeth called sensus. There is
than.iiij. duales iiii. quadruples.iiij. dog teeth.xvj. grinders /.iiij.
sensus. Thyrdly the text saith / that there is in ma CCClxv. veins / as
appears in the anothamie.

Quatuor hu^ores in humano corpore constant.
Sanguis cum colera / flegma / melancolia.
Terra melan. aqua / fleg. et aer / sanguis coler ignis.
Here the auctour declarethe the.iiij. humours in man / as blood / fleme /
coler / and melancholy. And showing the nature and complexion of them / he
compares each to one of the.iiij. elements. Melancholy is cold and dry so
compared to the earth / which is of like nature: Fleme is cold moist / and so
compared to water. Blood is hot moist / and so compared to the aier. Coler is
hot dry / and so compared to fire. These things are declared in these
verses.

Humidus est sanguis / calet / est yis aeris illi.
Alget / humet / flegma / sic illi yis sit aquosa.
Sicca calet colera / sic igni fit similata.
Melancolia friget / siccat quasi terra.
Aui. i. doct iiii. cap. i.
For a farther knowledge wittethe well / that after Auice / there be.iiij.
humours in mas body / blud / fleme / coler and melancholy / as is said. The
best of them is blud / first by reason hit is the mattier of mans spiritis: in
whom consistethe mans life and operations. Secondly because hit is comfortable
to the principles of life / hit is temperatlye hot and moyste. Thyrdly /
because hit restores and nourishes the body more than the other humours: and
it is called the treasure of nature: for if hit be lost death follows forth
with. Next to blood in goodness is fleme: First by reason that if need be /
hit is apt to be turned in to blood. Secondly / because hit is very ne'er
like humidite / which is as fudatio of life. After fleme in goodness is coler:
which is partner with natural hete so lunge / as it kepeth convenient measure.
Than follows melancholy / as dregs and durte removed apart from the
principles of life / ennemy to joy and liberalite / and of ne'er kynred to age
and death. Secondly note / that in the division of humours / there is.ij.
kinds of blud / that is to say / natural unnatural. Natural blud is ruddy:
that is to say / vein blood ruddy and obscure: and artery blood ruddy
and clear: without ill savour: and in comparison of other humours / is very
sweet. Unnatural is double: the one is unnatural in qualite / that is to say
/ which is changed from good coplexion in it self: orels by mynglyge of an
other humour. There is an other unnatural blood / which through mynglynge
of other humours / is ill both in qualite / substance / quantite / and in
proportion of the one to ye other. And this is double: for the one is not
natural / by mynglyng of an ill humour / that comes to him from without. The
other is unnatural by mynglynge of an ill humour / engendered in the self
blud: as when part of the blud is putrified / and the subtle part thereof is
turned in to coler / and the gross part in to melancholy: orels that coler /
or that melacoly / orels both remains in the blud. And this unnatural blood
/ by mynglynge of an ill humour / varies from natural blood many ways.
First / in substance: for hit is grosser and fouler: since melacoly is mingled
therewith: orels hit is more subtle / when wattrishenes or citrine coler is
mingled therewith. Secondly in colour: for some time / when fleme is mingled
therewith / hit enclineth to whiteness / or through melancholy to blackenes.
Thirdly in savour: for by mynglyg of putrified humours hit is more stynkynge:
orels by mynglynge of raw humours hit hath no savour. Fourthly in talage: for
by mynglyng of coler / hit enclineth to bitterness / and by melancholy to
sowernes / or by fleme to vnsauerynes. Also of fleme there be.ij. kinds /
natural unnatural. Natural is that / which within a certain space will be
blood: for fleme is vndigested blood. There is an other spice of fleme /
which is sweet and some what warm / if hit be compared to the bodily hete:
But comparynge hit to ruddy blud and coler / hit is cold. Fleme is naturally
white: and this is called sweet fleme / extendynge this name sweet to all the
talages delitynge the taste: for other wise this natural fleme is not sweet:
but unsavoury and watrishe / and very ne'er the talage of water. And to this
fleme / nature hath not given a {pro}pre mansion / as she hath done to coler
and melancholy: but nature makes it run with the blood: for it hath a very
ne'er similitude to blood. And of this fleme there be.ij. necessites and one
vtilite. The first necessite is / that hit be ne'er the members / so that their
virtue may digest and turn hit in to blood: and that the members by hit
may be nourished / when they have lost their natural food / that is for to
say / good blood / through restrynte of material blood / which restreynt
is caused of the stomach liver / through some causes accidental. The.ij.
necessite is / that hit myngle with the blood / and make hit apt to nourish
the mebres of flematike complexion / as the brain and nuche: for that that
must noryshe these mebres / must be well mingled with fleme. The vtilite of
fleme is that hit moist the joints and members / that move much / lest they
wax dry through the heate that comes of their mouynge and rubbing.
Unnatural fleme may be divided. First in hit substance: so some thereof is
muscillaginosu: and that is fleme / to ones semynge / diverse: for in some
part it is subtle and thynne / and in some other gross and thycke: it is
called muscilaginosu / because hit is like muscilages / draw out of sedes.
There is an other fleme that appears eagle in substance / that is in subtilite
grossenes to ones demynge: but for a troth hit is diverse in every part: this
is named raw fleme. And this encreasethe in ye stomach and entrails. And to
avoid hit out of the stomach / Hippocrates byddethe us spue twyse a month:
and to void hit out of the guttis / nature hath ordained coler to run from
the chest of the gall to the entrayle ieiuniu / so forth to the other lower
guttis / to scour away that fleme from the brymmes of the entrails / and to
cause hit to discende down with the other dregs and fylthe. Some time this
fleme is increased in the veins / specially of old folks / by minishyng of
their digestio: and there remaining / is by little little augmented and
engrossed / hurtynge nature / which can not by the veins / thereto ordained /
void hit out / yet it doth that is possible to keep it from the heart / and
other inward members: and drives it to the outward members / and specially
to the legs: for by hit heuynes hit naturally draws to the lower partis of
man: And this is the cause why old folks legs are swollen / that if one
press down his finger therein / there taryethe a hole: specially toward night
/ and in fat folks / such as were wont to be nourished with moist meates.
There is an other spice of fleme / very subtle / wattrishe / like unto water
/ some what thick: This fleme is very often mingled with their spittyll /
that have ill digestion / and of those that be great drinkers: it runs from
ye brain to the nose / as hit is wont in the beginning of the pose: and when
by decoction and boylynge in man / hit comes gross / hit is turned in to
fleme / gross / white / and muscillage. There is an other fleme gross and
white / called gipseum: the subtle partis of this fleme is dissolved / through
it lunge bydynge in the iointis: and the grossenes thereof / remains in ye
ioyntis as harde as stones. This fleme engedrethe a gout uncurable. There is
an other fleme thycke and gross / like to molt glass / in colour / clamynes
and weight. Secondly unnatural fleme differethe in talage: for there is
certain fleme / yt is sweet / which is by mynglynge of blood with fleme. And
under this is contained the vnctuous fleme: which is engendered by mynglynge of
vnctuous blood and fleme. There is an other manner of vnsauerye fleme / caused
of rawnes: as certain glassy fleme. There is an other salt fleme / caused by
mynglynge of coler. And this is more bytynge / drier / and lighter / tha any
other fleme / through the coler / mingled therewith / which is dry light / and
sharpe. And this fleme is oft found in their stomachs / that be flematike /
that drink much strong wine / and that use salt and sharpe meates / and
cleuynge to the stomachs / causes other while thyrst intolerable: and running
by the guttis / hit some time flees them: and causes the bluddy mensyn: in
the fundemet oft times induces strong ^o stiuenes. There is an other fleme
that is sharpe by mynglynge of sharpe melancholy therewith: and some time /
through boylynge of fleme: as hit chances in the sweet ieuses of fruit: that
first boyle / and after wax ripe: And this fleme appears oftner in their
stomachs that digest ill / than in other partis. For naturally coler flows to
the mouth of the stomach / to stere up thappetite: which descedyng downward
/ some time mingled with fleme / makes it sower: and this is {per}ceyued by
sower belchynges. And other while this fleme is engendered in the stomach by
boylyg with a weak heate. There is an other fleme called pontike / which is
some time caused by mynglyng of potike melancholy. But this is seldom / by
reason that pontike melancholy is very scarce. Hit is some time caused through
vehement coldness thereof: whereby the moystnes thereof is coieyled / and some what
altered to erthynes: and thereupon comes no weak heate / which causynge it to
boyle / shulde convert it in to sharpness: nor no strong heate / which
digestyng hit / shulde turn it in to blud. There be.ij. kinds of coler /
natural and unnatural. Unnatural coler is the some of blud / whose coler is
ruddy clear / that is / citrine / in the last degree of citrines: as saffron
heeds: and hit is lyghte and sharpe: and the hotter the more red it is. And
after this coler is engedred in the heed / hit divides in two partis / one
part gothe with the blood in to the veins / the other gothe in to the purse
of the gall. The part that gothe with the blood / enters therewith both for
necessite and profit. Hit is needful that hit myngle with the blood / to
nourish ye colerike mebres. Hit is behoueful / that hit make the blood subtle
/ and cause hit to entre in to the veins. The part that gothe to the purse of
the gall / gothe eke thither for necessite and profit. The necessite is
double. The one is needful for all the body / to mundifie hit from colerike
superfluites. The other necessite is in respect of the galls purse. The
profit also is double. The one is to wash ye entrails from dregs / and
clamy fleme / cleuynge to them. The other is to prick ye guttis musculs / that
they may feel the thing that hurts them / and void all other fylthynes. The
proof of this is / that colike chances oftetymes by stoppynge of the hole that
comethe from the purse of ye gall to the guttis. Unnatural coler is double.
For one is unnatural through outward cause mingled there with. The other is
unnatural through a cause in it self: for the substance thereof is not
natural. Coler unnatural through an outward cause / is an other known and
famous: And hit is that that fleme is mingled with. And it is called famous or
notable: by reason hit is oft engedred. And of this kind of coler comes ye
third / well known. There is an other yt is less famous / and that is hit /
wherewith melancholy is mingled Famous coler is either citrine / and engendered by
mynglynge of subtle fleme with natural coler / orels hit is yolkye / like to
yolks of eggs / and is engedred by mynglynge of gross fleme with natural
coler. Coler of less fame is caused.ij. ways. One is when the coler is burned
in hit self / and turned to ashes / from which the subtle part of the coler
is not separated / but mingled therewith. And this coler is the worst. An other
is / when melancholy comes from without / and mynglethe hit with the coler. And
this coler is better than other / and is ruddy in colour: hit is not clear nor
flowynge / but more like to vein blood. This unnatural coler / having his
own propre substance / without mynglynge of any other humour / is oft
engendered in the liver: by reason that the subtilnes of the blood burns hit
self / and turns in to coler / and grossely in to melancholy. An other coler
there is / engendered in the stomach of ill meatis not digested but corrupted:
orels it is engendered in the veins by other humours. And of this coler be.ij.
kinds. For one is called coler prassiue / like the colour of ye herb called
prassion: which is engendered of the yolkynes when hit is burned: for ye burnyg
causes a yolky blackenes i ye coler / which mingled with coler citrine /
engedreth a grene coler. The other is called rusty coler / like to rusty iron:
it is engendered of passive: when prassiue is burned only till the humidite there
of be dried away: and through hit drines begins to wax white. And these.ij.
last colers be ill and venomous / and yet rusty is the worse. Like wise there
be.ij. kinds of melancholy / natural and unnatural. The natural is the
dreggis and su{per}fluite of good blood / whose talage is between sweet and
pontike. And this melancholy / when hit is engendered in the liver / is parted
in.ij. partis. Of which one enters with the blood / and there with remains
in the veins. The other is conueyed to the spleen. The first part enters
with the blood for necessite and profit. Hit is needful that it myngle with
the blood / to norishe the melancholy / cold / and dry members / as the bones.
The vtilite is to make thycke the thynne blood / to stint the su{per}fluous
runnynge thereof / to make it strong / and to strength these members in to
which hit must be converted. The other part / that needs no blood / gothe
to the spleen both for necessite and profit. The necessite is double / one
universal through out the body / to purge hit of melacolious superfluite.
The other is but {per}ticular / only to govern the spleen. This melacoly is
also profitable for mans body / for hit runnethe to the mouth of the stomach /
straynynge out the humidites / that hit finds there / as a woman straynynge a
cowes dugs / drawethe out the milk. This vtilite is double. First hit
constrains / thycketh / and comfort the stomach. Secondly / by reason it
moves the mouth of the stomach / through hit egernes / hit makes one have an
appetite and lust to meat. Unnatural melacoly is as a thing burned or ashes
in respect of other humours. Of this there are.iiij. famous kinds / though
there be many not famous. The first is ashes of coler: and this is bitter.
The.ij. is ashes of fleme: and if the fleme that is burned were very subtle
and wattrishe: than the melancholy thereof engendered will be salt in talage. But
if the fleme be gross yt is burned: than the ashes thereof / or the melancholy
of hit engendered / enclyneth to sowernes or ponti^ite. The.iij. is ashes of
blood / and this melancholy is last / a little drawing to sweetness.
The.iiij. is ashes of natural melacoly. And if natural melancholy / whereof so
it be / be subtle: tha it will be very sower. And when hit is caste out upon
the ground / hit boils and savours of the air / and causes both flies
and beastis to void the place. But if the natural melancholy be gross / the
unnatural thereof ingedred / shall not be so sower.

Sanguine folks.
This text teaches us to know sanguine folks. First / a sanguine person is
naturally fat. But we may not understand / that sanguine folks be proprely
fat: for that is a token of a cold complexion / Auice.ii.i. doct. iii. cap.
iii.
as says Auicen: But they be fat and fleshye with all: for fat in
sanguine persons is taken for fleshye. Auicen says: that abundance of ruddy
flesh and styffe / signifies a hot and a moist coplexio / as a sanguine
{per}son is. For thabudance of ruddy flesh / wytnesseth fortitude of virtue
assimilatiue / and multitude of blood / ye work and wax by heate and moisture
/ as witnessethe Galen / saying: Thabundance of flesh is engedred by
abundance of blood. For heate perfectly digestynge / and the like virtue to
flesh makethe the flesh fast styffe. Also Auicen says: every fleshye body
without abundance of fat greece / is sanguine. Galen. ii. ^egni.
Where Galen asseteth. Secondly / the sanguine person is merry and jocund /
that is to say / with merry words he moves other to laugh: orels he is glad /
through benignite of the sanguine humour / {pro}uokynge a man to gladness and
iocudite / through clear perfect spirits engedred of blood. Thyrdly he gladly
hears fables merry sportis / for the same cause. Fourthlye he is inclined to
lechery / through heate and moystnes / provoking to carnal copulation.
Fyftly / he gladly drinks good wine. Sixtlye / he delyteth to fed on good
meat: by reason the sanguine {per}soon desyrethe the most like to his
complexion / that is good wynes and good meates. Seuenthlye / he laughs
lightly / for blood {pro}uoketh to laughyg. The.viij. is / the sanguine person
/ hath a gladsome an amiable countenance / through lyuelynes of colour / and
fairness of coplexion. The.ix. is / he speaks sweetly / through amiablenes
of sanguine nature. The.x. is / he is apt to learn any manner of science /
through lyuelynes and perspicuite of his wit. The.xj. is / he is not
lightly angry: and this comes through moystnes abatynge the fervor of coler
provoking to anger. The last.ij. verses recite some of the forsayde tokens /
and also some other. First / a sanguine {per}soon is free / not covetous but
liberal. Secondly he is amorous. Thyrdly / he hath a merry countenance.
Fourthly / he is most part smiling: of which all the benignite of the blood
is cause and provoker. Fyftlye / he hath a ruddy colour. For Auicen says /
that ruddy colour of the skin / signifies abundance of blood: And this must
be understand of bright ruddy colour not dark: such as is wont to be in
their facis that drink strong wynes abundantlye / and that use sauces and
sharpe spices: for such colour signifies lepre to come. Syxtly / he gladly
singethe and herethe syng^ge / by reason of his merry mind. Seuethlye / he is
fleshye / through the cause before said. The.viij. is / he is hardy / through
the hete of the blood / which is cause of boldness. The.ix. is / the sanguine
person is benign and gentle / through the bounte of the sanguine humour.

Est humour colere / qui competit impetuosis.
Hoc genus est hominum / cupiens precellere cunctos.
Hi leuiter discunt multum comedunt / cito crescunt.
Inde magnanimi / sunt largi summa petentes.
Hirsutus / fallax / irascens / prodigus / audax.
Astutus / gracilis siccus / grocei{que} coloris.
Here the auctour teaches us to know a person of colerike complexion. First
/ he is hasty / by reason of superfluous heate / that mouethe him to hastynes.
Auice.ii.i. doct. iii. cap. iii.
And therefore Auicen saith / that deeds of excessive motion / signify heate.
Secondly / the colerike person is desirous of honour / and covets to be
uppermost / and to excelle all other: by reason that su{per}fluous heate
makes mas mind prone to arrogace and fool hardiness. Thyrdly / they learn
lightly / by reason of the subtilnes of the colerike humour. And therefore
Auicen saith / that the understanding / promptness and quick agilite to
intelligence / betokenethe heate of complexion. Fourthlye they eat much: for
in them the heate digestiue is stronger / more resolutiue than in other bodies.
Fyftly / they encresse soon / through strength of natural heate in them /
which is cause of augmentation. The.vj. is / they be stout stomaked / that is
they can suffer no injuries / by reason of the heate in them. And therefore
Auicen saith secunda.i. doctrina.iii. cap. tertio: that to take every thing
impa^iently / signifies heate. The.vij. is / they be liberal to those that
honour them. The.viij. is / they desire high dignites / officis. The.ix. is /
a colerike person is hearye / by heate opening the pores / moving the mattier
of hears to the skin. And therefore hit is a common saying / the colerike man
is as heary as a got. The.x. is / he is disceyuable. The.xj. is / he is soon
angry / through his hot nature. And therefore Auicen saith: oft angry / and
for a smal^ cause / betoketh heate / through easy motion of coler and boylynge
of the blood about the heart. The.xij. is / he is a waster / in spending
largely to optayne honours. The.xiij. is / he is bold: for boldness comes of
great heate specially about the heart. The.xiiij. is / he is wylye. The.xv. is
/ he is skleder membred / and not fleshie. The.xvj. is / he is lean and dry.
The.xvij. is / he is saff^on coloured. And therefore Auicen says: that coler
signifiethe dominion.

Restat et adhuc tristis colere substancie nigre.
Qui reddit prauos / per tristes pa^a loquentes.
Hi vigilant studiis / nec men's est dedita somno.
Servant propositum sibi / nit reputant fore tutunt.
Inuidus et tristis / cupidus / dextre{que} tenacis.
Non ex per^ fraudis / timidus lutei{que} coloris.
Here he declares some tokens of a melancholy {per}soon. First / melacoly
makes folks shrewd and ill manered: as they that kill them self. The.ij. is
great heuines: for melancholy folks are most part sad / through their
melancholy spiritis / troublous dark: like as clear spiritis make folks
glad. The.iij. is / they talk little / by reason of their coldness.
The.iiij. is / they be studious / for they covet always to be alone. The.v. is /
they are no slepers / nor sleep not well / by reason of the over much drines
of the brain: and through melancholy fumes / they have horrible dreams / yt
wake them out of their sleep. The.vj. is / they be stedfaste in their purpose /
and of good memory / and harde to please: and this comethe through their
drines. The.vij. is / they think nothing sure / they always dread / through
darkness of their spiritis. In the.ij. last verses he recitethe some of ye
forsayde signs and other. First / the melancholy person is envious. The.ij.
he is sad. The.iij. he is covetous. Fourthly / he holds fast / and is an
ill payer. Fyftly he is simple / yet disceitfull: and therefore melancholy folks
are devout / great reders / fasters / and keepers of abstinence. Syxtlye / he
is fearful. Seventhly / he hath an earth ye browne colour: which colour if hit
be any thing grene / signifiethe the dominion of melancholy / as Rasis
saith.ij. Alman.

Hi sunt humores / qui prestat cui{que} colores.
Omnibus in rebus / ex flegmate fit color albus.
Sanguine fit rubeus / colera / ^ubea qu^{que} ruffus.
Si peccet sanguis / facies ^ubet / extat acellus.
Inflantur gene / corpus nimium{que} grauatur.
Est plusquam frequens plenus / mollis / dolor ingens
Maxim fit stontis / et constipatio ventris.
B^ca{que} lingua sitis / et somnia plena rubo^.
Dustior adest sp^ti / sunt act^a duicta que{que}.
Here the auctour puttethe ye colours that follow the complexions. A flematike
person is whitely coloured: the colerike is browne and tawnye: the sanguine is
ruddy: the melancholy is pale / colered like earth. Afterward the text
declares.xij. colours / signifienge superfluite of blood. The first is when
the face is red / by ascendyng of blood / to the heed and face. The second is
/ when the eyes bolle out farther than they were wont. The.iij. is / when the
eyes are swollen. The.iiij. is / when the body is all heavy: for nature can
not sustain nor govern so great quatite of blood. The.v. is / when the pulse
beats thycke. The.vj. is / when the pulse is full by reason of the multitude of
hot and moist vapours. The.vij. is / when the pulse is soft / through to
much humidite / mollifienge the mattier. The.viij. is ache of the forheed. The
ix. is when the bealy is costife / through great hete that dries up the fylthy
mattier. The.x. is when the tongue is dry and rough for like cause. The.xj. is
great thyrste / through drines of the stomachs mouth engedred of great hete.
The.xij. is when one dreams of red things. Auice.ii.i. doct. iii. cap.
vii.
This Auicen affirms saying / Sleep that signifies abundance of blood / is
when a man dreams he sees red things: orels yt he shedeth much of his
blood* orels / that he swymmeth in blood and such like. The.xiij. is / the
sweetness of spyttell / through sweetness of blood. Here is to be noted / that
like as there be tokens of abundance of blood / so there be signs of the
abundance of other humours / as in these verses following:

Accusat coleram dextre dolor asper alingua.
Tinnitus / vomitus{que} frequens / vigilantia multa.
Multasitis / pingr^s / egestio / torsioventris.
Naul^ a fit morsus cordis / languescit ore^is.
Pulsus (...) est grocilis / d^us / velo^{que} calescens.
Aret / amarescit / incendi asomni^ fingit.
The tokens of abundance of fleme are coteyned in these verses following.

Flegma supergrediens proprias in corpore leges.
Os facit incipidum / fastidia cerebra / ^il^as.
Costarum stomachi / simul occipitis{que} dolores.
Pulsus adestrarus / ettardus / mol^s / inanis.
Precedit fallax / fantas^ata / somnus aquosa.
The signs of abundance of melancholy are contained in these verses following.

Humorum pleno dum fex in corpore regnat.
Nigra cutis / durus / pulsus / tenuis et ^rina.
Solicitudo timor / et tristicia / somnia tempus.
Accrescet rugitus sapor / et sputaminis idem.
Leu^{que} precipue tinnit et sibilat auris.
Denus septenus vix fleubothomia^ petil annus.
Spiritus vbe^ior erit per fleubothomiam.
Spiritus ex potu vini mox multiplicatur.
Humorum{que} cibo damnum lent reparatur.
Lumina clarificat / sincerat fleubothomia.
Mentes / et cerebrum / calidas facit esse medullas.
Viscera purgabit / stomachum / ventrem{que} ^oerce^.
Puros dat sensus / dat somnum / tedia tollit.
Auditus / vocem / vires producit et auget.
Here thauctour speaks of blood letting. First he shows what age is
required to be blood let / saying: At.xvij. year of age one may be let
blood: And touching this Galen says: Gale.xl. ^e iugenio
that children shulde not be let blood / oneles they be.xiiij. year old at
lest: because children bodies be soon resolved from outward heate: and therefore
by voydynge of blood they shulde be greatly weaked. Also for that they need to
nouryshe their bodies and augment them / they shulde not diminish their blud.
And eke for that they be soon dissolved from outward heate / hit suffices /
wherefore they need not to be let blood. And wittethe well / that as blood
lettynge is not convenient for children / so it is vnholsome for old folks /
as Galen says: Gal. lx. tegni.
For the good blood is little and the ill much: and blood letting draws
away the good blood / leaves the ill / as Auicen says: and therefore blood
lettynge is vncouenient for such persons. Aui. iiii.i. cap. x.
Secodlye / he puttethe the hurt of blood lettynge. Of necessite with voidynge
of blood / done by blood lettynge / mans spiritis being in the blood / do
grealye avoid. Thyrdlye / he shows howe the spiritis shulde be cherished and
restored: and that is by drinking of wine after the blood letting: For of all
thing to norishe quickly / wine is best as is before said. The spiritis also
be cherished and restored by meatis / but that is not so quickly as by wine.
And the meat after blood lettynge / must be light of digestion / and a great
engendrer of blood / as rear eggs / and such like. And all though meat
restore the spiritis after blood lettynge / yet let ye patients beware of
much meat the first and.ij. day. For Isaac says in dietis: that they must
drink more than eat: and yet they must drink less than they did before
blood lettynge: for digestion is weaker. Fourthlye / the auctour puts.xj.
conveniences of blood lettyge duly done. First / temperate blood lettynge
comfort the syghte: for diminishynge of humours doth eke diminish fumynge
to the heed / and the repletion thereof / darkynge the sight. Secondelye / hit
clerethe and makes pure the mind and brain / through the same cause. Thyrdly
/ it heats the mary: for it minishethe the superfluites / that thereto come
and cole it. Fourthly / it purges the entrails: for nature uncharged of blood
/ digests better raw humours that be left. Fyftly / blood lettynge
restreyneth vometyng and the laske: for hit diverts the humours from the
interior partis to the outward: specially lettyge blood of the arms / as
Auicen saith: For letting blood of the feet stops not so well: yet
{per}chance the blood lettynge shall augment the laske / and that.ij. ways.
First / by blood lettynge nature is discharged of her burden: and tha
comforted / hit provokes other vacuations. Secondly / if the laske be caused
by great weakness of virtue contentiue: For than / for that by blood lettynge
virtue is weaked / the laske is augmented. The.vj. is that blud letting clereth
the wyttis: For it minisheth vaporation that gothe to the heed troublethe the
wyttis. The.vij. is hit helpethe one to sleep / for thereby many humours be
voided / by which sharpe vapours and diverse are lifted up / lettynge one to
sleep. The.viij. is / hit takethe away tediousness and over great grefe: for
thereby virtue is vnlode of grefe: and eke with the blood melacoly / the dregs
of blood / which induces tediousness and grefe / is drawn out. The.ix. is /
hit coforteth the hearing: for thereby the vapours and humours ascendinge to the
heed / and lettyge the hearing / are diminished. The.x. is / hit comfort the
voice: for thereby the superfluites and humidites / that may come to the breast
or pipe of the lyghtis / and let the voice / are diminished. The.xj. is / hit
augmentethe the strengthes: for thereby the body is unloaded of hit grefe /
wherefore virtue is augmented.

Tres insunt istis Maius / september / aprilis.
Et sunt lunares / sunt velut ydra dies.
Prima dies primi / postrema{que} posteriorum.
Nec sanguis minui / nec carnibus anseris vti.
In scene vel iuuene / si vene sanguine plene.
Omni mense been / confert incisio vene.
Hi sunt tres menses / Maius / september / aprilis.
In quibus eminuas / vt longo tempore viuas.
Here thauctour saith / that these.iij. May / september / aprile / are the
months of the moon: and in them are days forbidden to let blood / that is
the first of May / and last of september and aprile. Though this be a common
rule / yet hit is false. For the forsayde days may be as good and worthy to
be chose as the other / after the diuersite of constellation in them. Farther /
the auctour saith / yt in those days none should eat goose flesh: which also
is false erroneous / and very witchecraft. I think thauctour had this saying
of the iewes / which observe such manner. Secodly he saith / yt men of myddell
age yonge folks / whose veins be full of blood / may be let blood every
month: for those may well resist resolution: in them is great quatite of good
blood. Thyrdly he saith: that blud letting for mans health / must be done in one
of these.iij. months / may / septeber / aprile. but yet with difference. for
in aprile may the liver vein must be let blood / because than in vere time
the blood increases: and in septeber in the spleen vein / because of
melancholy / which than in autumpne increases.

Frigida natura frigens / regio / dolor ingens.
Post lauachrum / coitum / minor etas / at{que} seniles.
Morb^s prolixus / repletio potus et esce.
Si fragi^is vel subtilis sensus stomachi sit.
Et fastiditi tibi sunt fleubothomandi.
Here thauctor puts.xij. things that let blud letting. The first is coldness
of complexion. for as Galen saith: blood letting cools augments coldness:
because / as Isaac saith / blood is the foudacion of natural hete: and in that
blood letting voydeth blood / hit voydeth hete / so consequetly cools.
The.ij. is a fervent cold country / under which a cold season shulde be
copreheded / which also lets blood letting: for in a country season very
cold / the blud is closed in the depest partis of the body: and the blood that
tarries in the utter partis / the cold makes thycke / which to void is no
wisdom. The.iij. is feruet ache: under which eke may be comprehended great
inflammation of the body: for if one in such accidetis be let blood / there
follows motion agitatiue / contrary to nature / and greatter inflammation /
which weaketh nature more. The cause of this motion agitatiue is attractio to
diverse partis: for by blood letting attraction is caused to the place yt is let
blud: by great ache / attractio is caused to the place of ache. The cause of
greatter inflamacio is / yt by blud letting ye humours be moved / whereby they be
more inflamed. And this is truth when blud letting is little artificial. Yet
if it be done till one swoud hit is wholesome in the forsaide cases: for this
blood letting / when it ouercometh the attraction of the ache: it causes not
motion agitatiue. like wise it takes away inflammation / when there be no
humours / that should move hete / and cause more inflamacion. This is Galens
mind / saying: Gal. in come. illius apho. que egerunt.
there is no better medicine for an ipostume of feruet inflammation / fevers / a
great ache / than blud letting. The.iiij. is baynyng / specially resolutiue:
for that lets blood letting: for that were vacuatio upon vacuatio / which
nature can not esily bear. The v. is carnal copulation: for immediately there
after one should not be let blood / because of double weakyng of nature.
The.vi. is to old or to yonge / as it is before touched. Of this Auicen saith:
Take heed howe thou let one blood in any of the forsaid cases: outcept thou
trust in the figure / in solidite of the musculs / largeness of the veins / ye
fulness of them / and ruddy colour. The.vii. is lunge sickness: for by such
lettyg of blud / nature is doubly febled / both by the loge sickness
diminishio. This is of truth saith Auicen / outcept there be corrupt blood /
for than blood letting is wholesome. The.viij. is great replecion of drink.
The.ix. is to eat to much meat: and under this is coprised meat vndigested.
The cause hereof (as Auicen saith) is this: there be.iij. things that draw to
them / that is voydnes / hete / and secrete virtue or proprete. Than if the
veins be empty through voydyng of blood / they draw to them fro the stomach
or liver / vndigested or su{per}fluous meat or drink: which vndigested meat
come to ye mebres / can not be amended / that is / digested: for ye third
digestion can not amend the fault of the.ij. nor the second of the first: if
the fault be so great yt hit can not convert into the mebres: hit there
remaynyg may cause some disease. The.x. is feblenes. Gal ii. ^.
for blood letting is a strong voyder / as Galen saith: therefore a feeble
person may not endure great diminishyng of blud. The.xi. is subtle
sensiblenes of the stomachs mouth: which is called the hart string: for of
such blood letting swou^yng follows easily. And under this / weakness of the
stomach is eke coprised / and easy flowynge of coler to ye mouth thereof /
endusyng vometyng. Wherefore they yt have the forsaid accidents should not be
let blood: for by blood letting the humours moved be induced to the stomachs
mouth / as to a place accustomed: and because hit is a weak an impotent
membre to resist that flixe: therefore by such lettynge of blood many
inconveniences chase. This is one cause why many swoud / when they be let blood:
by reason the coler flows to ye stomach: which bytynge the stomach / pyneth
ye hart stomach so / that hit causes one to swoude. The.xij. is loathing: for
if in this lothynge one be let blood / when the veins be empty / they draw to
them ill mattier causing lothesomnes. Auicen touches many of these.vi. last
accidentis. And besides the forsaid accidentis there be other that let blood
letting. First voydyng of menstruous flixe or the emeraudes: for one diseased
with either of these shulde not be let blood: yet it may be done to divert the
flixe or matter. The.ii. is rareness of composition: for in rare bodies is much
dissolucion: therefore this resolution suffices them without evacuation / as
Galen saith.ix. teigni. The.iii. is rawnes and clamynes of humours: for than
beware of blood letting / because it increases rawenes of humours: and
therefore in loge sickness ye should not let blood: for rawnes of humours
encreseth / strength febleth / and the sickness prologeth. And therefore Auicen
saith / that in lunge sickness before one is let bloub / he should take a
laxative / although he need both. Rawnes of humours is caused.ii. ways. One is
through abundance of humours chokyng natural hete: which chokynge bredeth
raw humours / and than blood lettynge is wholesome. Wherefore Alexander saith:
Letting of blood in ye beginning of the dropsy is wholesome: Alex. ii.ii. ca. de
hydroppist.
when it comes by abundance of mestruous blud / that through some cause is
prohibited to issue: or by abundance of the emeraudis: For like as a little fire
is queched under a great heap of wodde: like wise natural hete is suffocate
with abundance of humours. The.ij. cause of raw humours / is feblenes of natural
hete / as in folks of feeble coplexion / or that have ben lunge sick / or be
very aged: for than ye said blud letting is vnholsome: because hit augments
rawenes: for the blud that obserueth hete / is drawn out / and so the body is
made cold and the humours more raw: Therefore the blood must be left to digest
these raw humours. The.iiij. is undue disposition of the air / either to
hot or to cold: for much hete causes strong resolution: and great cold
makes ye blud thick and vnapte to issue or avoid.

Quid debes facere / quando vis fleubothomar^.
Vel quando minuis / fueris vel quando minutus.
Vnctio sine potus / lauachrum / vel fascia motus.
Debent non fragili tibi singula mente teneri.
v. things in blood letting.
This text declares.v. things that ought to be done about blood letting: some
before / some at the time / some after. The first is anoyntyng / which other
while is used in the blood letting / as to anoynte the place or vein yt is
opened: to aswage the peyne: sometime hit is used after blud letting to keep the
gash that it close not up to soon / that the humours left in the veins may
have some respiracion / and some ill fumes void out. The.ij. is to dryke / and
specially wine / which is good in blud letting / if one hap to swoude: and
also hit is very wholesome after blud letting / to revive the spirits engendre
new blud / which thing in practyse all physicians observe. The.iij. is
baynyng / which is wholesome.iij. days before and.iij. days after blud letting
/ not the same day. Hit is good before / if one think he have gross humours
within him: for baynyng leuseth moves humours: for the said cause / hit is
wholesome to take a sharpe syrope before / to move / dissolve / and make subtle
the humours. And therefore / when ye will let one blud / ye must rub the arm
/ that the humours in the veins about may be made subtle prepared to issue
out more esily. Hit is holsom after blud lettynge / that the residue of humours
vapours left behind / may be leused. Hit is not wholesome the same day / for
baynyng makes ye skyn lynnowe / which made lynnowe / will not abide ye stroke
given in blud letting / that is dagerous. The.iiij. is byndynge with lynnen
clothes / which is very wholesome to stop the blud after evacuation thereof:
before bledyng / to draw the humours to the veins / and to cause them to swell
/ better to appear. The.v. is moderate walking before blud letting to dissolve
make subtle the humours: afterward to leuse the residue of the humours left
behind. Here note / that some use to be let blud fasting: but some other say /
hit were better to eat a rererosted egg first / and thereto drink a draught
of wine / about the hour of.ix. or.x. before dinner / and forth with to be let
blud. The cause is / when ye stomach is empty / nature reteyneth still ye blud
more strogly / lest she should lack norishement: but when one hath eat a
little norishyng meat / as wine eggs is / than nature suffers ye blud better
to issue.

Exhi^ara^ tristes. iratos placat amantes.
No sint amentes fleubothomia facit.
^
Here be declared.iii. effectis of blud letting. First it makes a sad {per}soon
merry. Secondly it appeseth angry folks. The reason is this: much melacoly
mingled with the blud / causes heuynes / and much coler causes ager:
which.ij. humours / as they be mingled with the blud / are draw out by blud
letting. Thirdly hit kepeth lovers from furious rauyng / for it removes the
blud fro ye heed avoiding it by the other exterior partis. Farther note / that
there be.v. causes of blud letting. The first is / that the abundance / whether
it be in qualite / or quantite / or both / should be voided. For as Auicen
saith / two manner folks must be let blud. One is they that be disposed to be
sick / that have abundance of blud in quantite. The other is they yt are sick
already / through the malice of humours or blud. But there is difference in
these.ii. blud lettynges. For blud letting for the abundance of blud ought to be
much: but when it is done to avoid ill blud / it must be moderate / as Galen
says.ix. metategni. And therefore they do very ill yt let them self blede
till they {per}ceyue the good blud issue / for {per}adventure all their blud
shall rune out / er they se any good blud appear. Therefore they should void a
little at ones: and after the mind of Galen / in this case: before they let
one blud / they should give him good meates / to engeder good blud / to fulfil
the place of the i'll blud avoided: and after within a little space / to let him
blud a little and a little. This is called direct lettyg of blud: for it is
done to avoid abundance of blud / and of such humours as shulde be avoided. The
first indirecte cause is the greatness of ye disease / and greatness of the
apparent vehement inflamacion: for as Gale saith / there is no better medicine
for an ipostume of vehement inflamacion / fevers / great ache / Gal. in come.
illiu^ apho. qu^ egerunt.
tha blud letting. The.ii. indirect cause is / that the mattier which must be
avoided / be drawn to y^ place fro whens it must be avoided. And therefore in
retencion of ye menstruous flixe emeraudis / the great vein in the ^ote called
sophena / must be opend / as Galen saith / to draw down the mattier of ye
blud. The.iij. indirect cause is / to draw ye humours to the place contrary to
that place that they flow to / to divert the mattier fro yt place. Therefore /
for to much abundance of mestruosite / the vein basilica must be let blud / to
turn the mattier to ye contrary part / and so to void hit fro hit propre
course. And therefore he yt hath a pluresie on his lift side / must be let blud
on the right side / to divert draw the mattier to the place contrary to yt
place that it inclines to. And like wise if it be on ye right side / to let
blud on the lift. The.iiij. indirect cause is / that bi letting of blud one
portion of the mattier may be avoided / that nature may be the stronger upon ye
residue: and so letting of blud is wholesome / when ye body is full / lest
impostumes grow: for ye regimet of nature is feeble / i regard of these humours:
wherefore a portion of ye mattier is voided / lest through vnablenes of nature
in governing the mattier / ye mattier should flow to some weak place and breed
an impostume.

Fa^ plagam largam mediocriter. vt cito fumus
Ex^at vberius / liberius{que} cruo^.
Here thauctor saith / yt the gash made in letting o^ blud / ought to be of a
mean largeness / that the same gross blud may esily issue out: for when ye
gash is strait / the pure blud only goth out / and the gross abith still in.
And note / yt sometime the gash must be great sometime small. The gash must be
great for.iii. causes. First / because the humours be gross / and gross blud
must be voided: as in them yt be melacoly. Secondly / in winter ye gash must
be great / for cold engrosseth the humours. Thyrdly / for thabudace of humours
/ for they avoid better by a great gash than a small. But the gash must be
small / when the {per}soon is of weak strength / that the spiritis natural
hete avoid not to much: and like wise in a hot season / and when the blud
is pure.

Sanguine subtracto sex horis est vigilandum.
No somni fumus ledat sensibile corpus.
No neruum ledat non sit tibi plaga profunda.
Sanguine purgatus non carpas protinus escas.
Three things must be consydred when one is let blud. First / yt he sleep not
within.vi. hours after ^est ye fumes engedred by sleep ascede to the heed hurt
ye brain. There be other causes. First / lest he in sleep turn him on the
arm that is let blud and thereby hurt him. The.ii. is / lest ye humours by
sleep flow to ye peynful mebre / by reason of the incision / so breed an
impostume. For Gale saith / that if impostumes breed in ye body / or in a mebre
hurt: the humours flow thereunto. But Auicen assigns an other cause / that by
such sleep may chance cofraction of the mebres: The cause may be as Galen
saith / that sleep is vnholsome in the ague fit: for natural hete goth inward /
Gal. ii. apho. su{per} illo. In quo c.
and ye out ward {per}tis wax cold / ye fumes remain unconsumed: whereby the
rigour is augmented / and ye fever fit {pro}longed. Also by moving of ye
humours i lettyg of blud / fumes are reised up to ye senowes and braunes of ye
arms: which remaining unconsumed / wax cold in sleep / and engross in the
utter parts. And therefore if one sleep immediately after letting of blud / they
cause confraction of the senowes and braunes of tharmes. Secondly / he saith /
that one in letting blud must beware / yt he make not ye gash to deep / lest
he hurt a senowe or an artery string under ye vein: for hurting of a senowe
causes a mortal cramp / or loss of a mebre / as an arm or a finger: and
hurt of an arteri string / causes bledyng uncurable. The.iiij. is / one ought
not to eat immediately aft he is let blud / but he must tarry till ye humours in
him be in qete / lest ye meat er hit be digested be drawn together with the
blud / to succour the hurt membre.

Omnia de lacte vitabis rite minute.
Et vitet potum fleubothomatus homo.
Frigida vitabit. quia sunt inimica minutis.
Interdictus erit minutis nubilus aer.
Spiritus exultat minutis luce per auras.
(...) subtle / to rune through out al the body / outcept the matter be
furious. The.ii. is abundance of the matt^er: for Gale saith on ye aphorism:
Inchoantilus morbis. c. yt it is than behoueful to be let blud / or take a
medicine laxative / to alleuiate nature loded with abundance of mattier.
The.iii. is greatness sharpness of the sickness / as when there is a great an
acheful impostume / though the mattier be little. Gal. xiii. ^
For Gale saith: if the impostume be great / ye must let blud at the beginning
though there be but little mattier: lest it break or open er it be ripe:
therefore to eschew many incouenieces blud letting must be done. (...) is so ^
either to (...) or death (...)
The.ii. rule is / yt blud lettyg may not be done on the day of motion of the
sickness as in crisis) nor no other vacuacion nor diuertyng of mattier fro the
place that nature sends it to. Nor like wise in the ague fit. For Galen
saith.i. aph. that when the sickness is in hit estate neither blud letting nor
laxative shulde be done: for than the matter rypeth / which rypeth better by
quietness tha^ ^rryng. The.iii. rule is / yt letting of blud should not be done
in begynyng of the sickness / when crisis is removed: for Isaac saith in his
book of urines / that though the hart be the engedrer of the blud spiritis / yet
the blud is fundacio of natural hete / susteyneth hit: for hete is naturally
thereof engendered: and therefore one voydyng blud voydeth hete: which shulde
digest the mattier of the sickness: and so consequently the sickness is prolonged
/ strength weaked. And therefore hit is to dread / lest through lengthynge of
the sickness / and weakyng of ye stregthe / nature should fail. The.iiii. rule
is / that ye body having dregs or filth i the guttis / should not be let blud.
The cause is: there be.iii. thyges yt draw to them / hete emptynes / all the
shap: now the veins epted by letting of blud / dawe to them fro the next
mebres / as the guttis stomach / whereby yt bealy is indurated / the mattier in
the veins more infected: the miseraike draws the humidites of the ordeurs /
the ordeurs are dried the more: therefore ye must first mollify the bealy with
clisters or suppositories / except it wax laxative alone. The.v. rule is /
That letting of blud shulde not be much used: for by oft using thereof / one
waxyng old / falls in to divers diseases / as epilencie / apoplexy / and
palsy: for by remouyng of ye blud hete / many flematike su{per}fluites are
engendered / that cause these diseases. The.vi. rule is / that a woman mestruate
/ or with child should not be let blud. A woman with child should not / for
thereby the hete that digests meat is dimin^ and the food of yt that she
goth with / taken away: specially when it that she goth with waxes great / for
tha it needs more food. This saith Hippocrates.v. aph. when the menstruosite
kepeth due curse voydeth naturally enough / lettyg of blud should not be done /
but when it voydeth to much / than to divert the mattier it must be done: for
nature would not be let of her operation. The.vii. rule is / that after the
colerike passion one should not be let blud: for bi reason that letting of blud
sturreth up the humours / a colerike on the right side of the body stadeth ye
mebre that engenders blud / that is the liver: and the receptacle of coler /
the gall. Autune engedreth melancholy / which is gethered to gether / not
resolved by wenter: therefore in ver and winter / those veins should be let blud
/ in which melacoly hath dominion / which be the lift side veins: for ye
splen is on the lift side of the body / which is the receptacle of melacoly.
Secondly he saith yt these.iiii. mebres / the heed / the hart / the foot / and
the liver after the.iiii. seasons of the year / must be empted: the hart in ver
/ the liver in somer / the heed i winter / and the foot in autumn.

Dat saluatella tibi plurima dona minuta.
Purgat epar / splenem / pectus / precordia / vocem.
Innaturalem tollit de corde dolorem.
Here he touches.vi. comodites that come by letting blud of the vey^e called
saluatella. hit is the vein on the back of ye hade / between ye myddyll
finger ring finger. First / it purges ye liver / Secodly it cleset^ ^ene.
Thyrdly it mudifieth the breast. Fourthly hit preserves the stomachs mouth
fro hurt. Fyftly hit doth away hurt of ye voice. Sixtly / hit doth away
unnatural ache of the hart. The reason of all these comodites is / because the
foresaid vein avoids blud fro al these places / as after it shall appear. For
a more ample declaration hit is to wit / that in letting of blud / other
while the veins be opend / and sometime ye arteries. The openyg of the artery
is dagerous: the chief cause hereof is the ouermoche bledyng: which is
caused.ii. ways. One is through feruet hete of the artery blud. for a hot
thing is soon movable / delateth opens ye artery: and therefore hit helps
much / to void ye blud in letting blud the artery. The.ii. cause is mobilite
of ye artery: and therefore the woude or gash in it is slowlier healed: for
woudes without rest can not heal. Yet this lettyg of blud is wholesome.iii.
manner wise. First / when there is abudace of subtle blud i the body. Secodly
when ye blud is vaporous. Thirdly when it is hot. For subtle blud / of
which natural blud spiritis be engedred / rests in the artery: but gross
blud that nourishes the mebres / rests in the veins. Like wise vaporous blud
is coteyned in the artery / sanguine blud in the veins. Also the hottest blud
/ which of the heart the hottest mebre is engedred digested / is coteyned in
ye artery / the other b^d i the veins. Secodly note / ye veins are opend in
many mebres / sometime in ye arm / or in the great hade or small / sometime i
the foot / somtym^ ^ nose / in the forheed / in the lyppes / sometime under the
tongue or i the ruff of the mouth / sometime in the corners of the eyes toward
the forheed. Fro the arm pyt to the elbow are.v. veins to be opend / as
Rasis Auicen say: One is called cephalica / which is the heed vein: the.ii.
is called basilica / which is the liver vein. The.iii. is mediana or cardiana
or nigra after Auicen / or matrix after Rasis. The.iiii. is assellaris. The.v.
is funis brachii. In the less hade is saluatella: so that in the arm / in
that it coteyneth the more and less hade / are.vi. veins to be oped.
Cephalica empteth the partis above the neck: and therefore to open hit is good
for diseasis of ye heed / ye megrym other hot grefes / or caused of hot
mattier. This vein begins at the shoulder / goth forth toward the lift side
of the arm. Basilica empteth the parts under the neck / as fro ye breast
liver: and therefore letting blud of this vein is wholesome for diseases of the
breast liver / and right good in a pleurisy. This vein begins at the arm
hole / and goth aloge to the bowing of the arm. Mediana is between these.ii.
said veins / is compact of them both: for it is ye brache of each. And it is
eke median in vacuation: for it voydeth fro al about / under / fro / above ye
neck. Wherefore it is the universal vein to all the body in voydyng: not
universal (as some say) because it begins at ye (...)* but because it is ye
brache of cephalica and basilica. Therefore if ye wold let cephalica blud / and
it appears not: ye should rather take mediana tha^ ^ica. And like wise if ye
wold let basilica blud / it appears not / ye shulde rather minishe mediana
than cephalica: for it agrees better to both / than one of them with the
other. Saluatella is the vein between ye myddell and ring finger / more
declynyng to ye myddell finger. Hit begins of basilica. This vein is opend
in the right hade for opilacion of the liver / and in ye lift hade for opilacio
of the spleen. There is no reason why it should be so as Auicen saith / but
experience: which Galen food by a dream as he saith: He had one in cure /
whose liver spleen were stopte / and he dreamed to let him blud of this vein /
so he did / and cured the patient. This vein is let blud / putting ye hade in
warm water / to engros and dilate it / because it is subtle: and yt the gash
shulde not close to soon / and to make ye gross blud thynne. Assellaris is
under basilica / and appears i byndyng the arm: and like iugemet is of it as
of basilica. Funis brachii is over cephalica / orels the hyndermost bone: and
is of one iugemet with cephalica. Therefore as Auice Galen say / though in
opening of veins / be universal vacuacion of all the body: yet not fro al
veins egally: nor like ieo{per}die is not in all. For Rasis saith cephalica is
ye surer / basilica more to be feared: and cardiaca is to fear / but not so
much as basilica. Cephalica is surest: for there is neither senow ^ above nor
dnder hit: but under cardiaca is a ^owe: and upper above it is a subtle
senowe: therefore hit is to fear lest it should be cut. Basilica is (...)
ieo{per}dous: for under it is an artery / ne'er (...) ^now a muscul. Saluatella
is not ieo{per}dous: and therefore ye bett to open it / it wold be put in warm
water. In ye foot be.iii. veins / sciatica / sophena / the home vein. These
be opend when we woll draw the blud to ye lower {per}tis / as in provoking
mestruosite: and the home vein is better than sophena or sciatica / for it is
nearer the matrice. Sophena draws blud fro ye yard / coddis / matrice: and
sciatica fro the ankles raynes / and other mebres toward mans lift side.
sophena fro the matrice mebres there about / tho they be branches of one vein.
In the myddis of the forheed is a vein / which is opend for old diseasis of
the face / as morpheu / dry scurfe scabbe. for disesis of the eyes: but first
cephalica must be minished. There is like wise a vein in the nose / in opening
of each the neck must be boude / one opend after an other: by byndyng the
neck they will better appear. There be veins in the lips which be opend for
ipostumes i the mouth or gomes: but cephalica is first minished. The.4. veins
i the ruff of the mouth oped / avail against reumes flowing to the teeth /
causing them to ache. These veins apere plainly / must be oped when the mattier
is digested. There be veins i the corners of the eyes / toward the forhed /
they be oped for disesis of the eyes / cephalica first minished. Also there be
veins under ^he tongue / which are let blud for the swynal^ ^ephalica first
minished. The veins in the timpu^s be let blud for the megrym and for great
(...) heed ache. And those be the veins / yt Hippo^ Galen call iuueniles: the
incision of which makes a ma unable to get children. Also i the neck be
veins / called guides: which must be opend in the beginning of lepre: and
specially for stoppyng of the wynd pipes / in the swynacy / which lets one
to draw his breath.

Here thauctor notes.ii. things. First / A medicine for the heedach caused by
drikyng
if heedache come by to much drykyng specially of wine / or of any other dryke
/ yt makes folks broke: one must drink cold wat upon it: which with it
coldness ingrosseth the fumes lifted up / lets them to hurt the brain.
The.ii. is / that if the top of the heed or forheed be grieved with to much
hete: than the tympuls shulde be moderately chafed / after washed with warm
water that moderwort is sod in: for motherworte is cold and cools.

Here thauctor notes divers things. First / yt much fasting in summer
dries the body: for in that that somer of hit nature is hot and dry / it
^esolueth the humours: the which also be resolved by oft sweatyg in somer: so
fasting thervpo dries ye body much more: for when the humidite of meat is
gone / ye hete of ye body works on hit own humidites / drieng them up.
Wherefore Hippocrates saith: Huger is expediet for those / yt are very moist:
for huger dries the body. The.ii. is: that vometyng ones a month is holsom:
for thereby hurtful humours / contained in all the circute of the stomach are
voided. To this agrees Auice / Hip. ^. {per}t. (...).
saying: Hippocrates byddeth one vomete each month twyse.ii. days one after
an other / that ye ii. day may avoid it that the first day could not: this
conserveth health / scouring the stomach from fleme coler. The stomach hath
nothyg to purge it / as the guttis have red coler. Auicen puts other
profits of vometyng well done. First hit is good for heed ache / caused by
moist vaporo{us} mattier ascendyng fro the stomach to the heed: but if heed
ache come of hit own hurt of ye brain / tha vometyng doth (...) hurt tha
{pro}fit. Secodly it clereth the sight ^rke^ by vaporous mattier of the
stamake / orels not. The.iii. is / hit doth away wamblyng cau^ (...) ^make / in
avoiding the humour that ^. The.iiii. is / hit comfort the stomach / in to
the which coler is descended / ye which corrupts the meat. The.v. is / hit
doth away loathing or aborryng of meat. The.vi. is / hit doth away the cause /
that makes one have a lust to sharpe / ponticke / and sower things: the
which cause of these disposicions removed / puts away the effect thereof.
The.vii. is / vometynge is wholesome for the laske that comes before the dropsy:
for hit avoids the mattier of ye said laske / and purges the stomach.
The.viii. is / hit is wholesome for the grefes in the raynes and bladder: for the
mattier flowynge to these parts / hit diverts an other way. The.ix. is / if
vometyng be done by constraynt of elborie / hit avoids the mattier / whereof
lepre grows: hit amends the first digestion / that the other digestions may
the better be done. The.x. is / hit makes one to have a good colour. The.xi.
is / hit purges ye stomach of a humour / that causes epilencie. The.xii. is /
by strong constraynt hit removes a stoppynge mattier / ye which causes
ictericie: And like wise hit avoids a flematike mattier / which commonly is
cause of this stoppyng. The.xiii. is / hit avoids the mattier that causes
asma: the which is a disese causyg one to draw his breath peynfully: and eke
hit comfort the spiritall members / by whose hete / the superflu^ causynge
asma / are consumed. The.xiiii. is / hit (...) ^lsome against shaking and
palsy: for hit auoy^h the mattier that is cause thereof. The.xv is ^s holsom
for one that hath great black sore^ his lower parts: for hit turns the
humours away fro thence. Al though vometyng duly well done be cause of these
comodites: yet when it is vnduely done / hit induces many hurts: for it
febleth the stomach and makes it apt for mattiers to flow into / hit hurts
the breast / the sight / the teeth / old heed ache. c. as Auicen saith.iiii.i.
cap. xiiii. The.iii. thing that is noted in the text is / that there be four
seasons of the year / ver / somer / autumpne / winter. Ver in respect of other
seasons / is hot and moyste / though hit be temperate in it self / as Galen
saith in his book of complexions: whereof hit follows / yt this season is more
apt to let blud in than the other: for hit doth more encreace humours. And
therefore in this season moderate use of carnal copulation / teperate motion /
laske / flixe / and sweat / is convenient: and like wise teperate bathing to
diminish replecio. This season is eke good to take purgacios in. The.iiii. is
/ somer heteth and dries: and therefore hit increases red coler / hot and
dry. And for this cause in somer we must fed on cold moist meates / to
diminish the feruentnes of hete and drought: and than we must absteyn ^ from
carnal copulation / which also dries: and fro oft bathing / and be let blud
seldom / for like cause. We must use quietness and little motion: for (...) ^s
doth moyste / and much motion dries (...) ^is season in special we must use
moderate ^ (...) drink: for su{per}fluous drinking of cold^ ^nke / by reason
that the pores be open / doth ma^ ^e body suddenly a cold / or causes the
palsy / or laxite of the members / orels sudden death: From the which he
defend us / that lives and reigns eternally. Amen.
