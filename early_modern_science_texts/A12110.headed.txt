HERE BEGINS THE CALENDAR OF Shepardes Newly Augmented and Corrected.




Here begins the Prologue.
This book (gentle reader) was first corruptly printed in France and after
that at the cost and charges of Rycharde Pynson, newly translated and
reprinted, although not so faithfully as the origynal copy required. Wherefore
it is once again overseen and perused, that the same may be at length
correspondent to the actors mind and very profitable for the reader, because
this book doth tech mani things that we be bound to learn and know one
peyne of everlasting death. As the laws of God shows how we may know to
keep his commandments and to know the remedies to withstand deadely sin,
there be many men and women thinks them self wise, and knows and learns
many things, but that they be bound to learn and know, that they know not.
As first the x. commandments of God, and the v. commandments of the
Church, that every creature that purpose to be saved should learn and know and
have them as perfytely as their Pater noster, you people, howe will you confess
you, and if ye break any of the x. commandments, and you know not them.
Truly there is but few that knows them, there fore ye that do not know them
to your deligence to learn them, for ye be bound to learn them, as well as to
learn your Pater noster. For howe can you keep our Lords commandments and
ye know them not. And ye be bound to break not one of them on peyne of
dampnation, for and if thou break one thou brekest all. Offend the law in
one point, and offend in all. For and thou break one thou doest not Gods
bidding, for he byddeth thee break none. And all that ye do in this world here,
but if it be of God, or in God, or for God all is in vain, you should not
occupy your self in vain matters, but in redinge of good books, for vanity
engenders vain thoughts, and destroys deuo^ion to man. What need it you to
study on a thing that is nought: study on your sin, and what grace by God
in you is wrought. Also in this book is many mo matters, loke in the Table here
folowinge.

example right fertile, and profytable unto all manner of people, and easy to be
understand by mans wit, with diverse addicions newly adiusted there to, as
hereafter follows.

A great question asked between the Shepardes touching the sterres, and an
answer made to the same.


THe Shepardes in a morning before thee day being in the fields, beheld the
firmament that was fixed full of sterres, one among the other said to his
fellow. I demand of thee howe many sterres be on the twelve parties of the
zodyake, that is under one sign only. The other Shepharde answered and said.
Let be found a piece of land in a plain country, as upon the plain of
Salysbury, that the said piece of land be xl. mile lunge and xxiiii. mile
broad. After that let take great long nails with great broad heads, as the
nails bin that be made for carte wheles, as many as shall suf^fyse for the
said piece of land. And let the said nails be strycken unto the heads in
the said piece at land, four fyngers broad one from the other, till that the
piece of land be covered over from one side to the other. I say that there be
as many sterres contained onder one sign only, as there shulde b^ nails
stycke in the forsayde piece of land, and there is as many under ech^ of the
other, to the equypolent by the other places of the firmament. Th^ first
Sheparde demanded how wilt thou proof it. The second aunswe^red and said that
no man is bounden no holden to prove things vnpossible^ that it ought to
suffice for Shepardes and touching this matter to beleu^ simply without to
enquire over much, of that their predecessors Shepardes have said before.



Thus ends the Astrol^gy of Shepardes, with th^ knowledge that they have o^
the sterres, plants, and mouynges of the skies.

And here after follows the saying of the Shepa^de to the plowman.

Howe plowman shulde do.
PErs go thou to plow, and take with the thy wife
Delve and draw, sow barley whet and rye,
Of one make x. this is perfyte life.
As saith Aristotle, in his philosophy
Thou need not study to know Astrology
For if the whether be not to thy pleasance
Thank ever God, of his divine ordinance.
Thus ends the Ploweman.
The auctoure.

In the end of this book
Who so list for to loke
Therein shall he se
A ballade that saith this.
He that many books reds
Cunning shall he be
Wisdom is soon caught
In many leues it is sought
And some doth it find
But sloth that no book bought
For reason takes no tought
His thryfte coms behind
And many one doth say

That clerks no tell may
What shall befall
They that this do report
Be of the pyuyshe sort
That little good can at all
They know that drink doth slake the thirst
And when their eyes is full of dust
Yet may they sit and sheale peason
For and clerks show them books of cunning
They bid them lay them up a sonnynge
Unto other season.

And if we speak of Astronomy
They will say it is a great lye
For they can no other reason
But all that knows good and better
As gentlemen that loves sweet and swetter
Wisdom with them is not geason.
The prologue of the auctoure that put this book in wrytinge.


AS here before time there was a Sheparde keeping sheep in the fields, which
was no clerk, no had no understanding of the letterall sense, nor of no
manner of scripture nor wrytinge, but of his natural wit and understanding
said. Howe be it that living and dying be all at the pleasure of almighty
God, yet man may live by the course of nature lxxii. years or more: this was
his reason. And he saith as much time as a man hath to grow in beauty,
length, bredthe, and strength. So much time hath he to wax old, and feeble to
his end: But the term to grow in beauty, height, and strength, is xxxvi.
year and the term to wax old, feeble and weke, and turn to ye erthward,
which is in all to gether lxxii. year, that he ought to live by course of
nature. And they that dye before this time, often it is by violence and outrage
done to their complexion nature. But they that live above this term is by
good regyment ensygnements, after the which a man hath governed him self. To
his purpose of living and dyeng, the said Shepard saith that the thing that we
desire most in this world is to live lunge, and the thing that we most fear
is to dye soon, thus he travailed his understanding, and made great diligence
to know and to do things possible and requisyce for to live lunge, hole, and
joyously, which this present composte calendar of Shepardes showing and
techynge, Wherefore we will show you of the bodies celestial, and of their
nature and mouynges, and this present book is named the compost, for it
comprehends sully all the compost, more for the days hours and momentes,
and the new moons, and the eclyps of the son the moon, and the signs that
the moon is in every day, and this book was made for them that be no clerks
to bring them to great understanding. He said also that the desire to live
lunge was in his soul, the which always lasts, wherefore he would that his
desire were accomplished after his death as a fore. He said sith the soul
dies not, in her is the desire to live long it shulde be an infallible peine,
not to live after death as before, for he that lives not after his corporal
death shall not have that, that he hath desired: yt is to wit to live lunge,
and shulde abide in eternal peine if his desire were not accomplished. So
concluded the said Sheparde necessary things for him and other to know and
do that which apperteyned to live after death as before. And truth it is that
he the which lives but the life of this world only, though he lived an
hundred year, he lived not properly lunge, but he ^huld live lunge, that the
end of this present life shulde begin the life eternal, that is to say the
life everlasting in heaven. So a man ought te per^ourme his life in this
world corporally, that they may live spiritually with out end. For as he
said one shall live everlasting without dyenge, and when he hath the
perdurable life and shall be perfyte. And also by this point and none otherwise
shall be accomplished the desire of lunge living ^n this world. The forsayde
Sheparde also knowledged, that the life of ^his world was soon past and gone:
wherefore this Sheparde thought that xxii. years here in this vale of wretched
mysery is but a little a small term (...) life, to the everlasting, the which
never shall have ending. And there^ore he saith, he that offreth him self, here
to live virtuously in this world. After this life he shall receive the sweet
life that is sure lasts ever without end. For though a man lined here a C.
years and more, it is but a little term to the life to come. Therefore saith
this Sheparde. I will live soberly with these small temporal goods that Iesu
hath lent me, ever to exile the desire of worledly riches and worldley
worship. For they that labours for it, and have love to their goods, vain
worshyppes, Oft it departs ma fro the heavenly treasure. It sh^tteth mans
hart that God may not entre and byldeth man a place of no rest in the lowe
land of darkness.

Here after follows an other Prologue of the master Shepharde, that shows
proves the auctours prologue true that is before rehearsed, so the Shepardes
dispute one with another, but this that follows the master Sheparde saith to
the other of the deuysion of this calendar. Capitulo ii.
Here begins the master Sheparde.


IT is to be understand, that there be in the year four quarters that is
called Uere, Hymns, Estas, and autumnus. Thief be the iiii. seasons in the
year. as Prymetyme is the spring of the year, as Feu^ryere, Marche, and
april. These three months.

Then comes Summer, as May, June, and July: and those three months, every
herb, grain and tree is in his kind, and in his most strength fayrnesse even
at the highest.

Theu comes Automne, as August, September, and October, that all these
fruits waxes ripe, and be gathered and howsed.

Then comes November, December, and Ianyuere, and these three months be in
this winter, The time of little profit. We Shephardes say that the age of a
man is.lxxii. yere^ and that we lyken but to one hole year, for ever more we
take vi. year for every month, as Ianyuere, or Feuerycre, and so forth, for
as the year chaugeth by the xii. months, into xii. sundry manners so doth a
man channge him self twelve times in his life, by twelve ages, every age
lasts vi. year, if so be that he live to lxxii. for three times six makes
eightene, and six times six makes xxxvi. And then is man at the best and
also at the highest, and twelve times six makes.lxxii. and that is the age of
a man.

Thus must ye reken for every month six year, or else it may be
understand, by the four quarters and seasons of the year. So is divided man
in to four parties, as to youth, strength, wisdom, and age: He to be xviii.
year yonge xviii. year strong xviii. year in wisdom, and the fourth xviii.
year to go to the full of the age of lxxii.

And now to show howe man changes.xii. times even as the xii. months do.
TAke the first vi. year for Ianyuere, the which is of no virtue nor strength
in that s^ason nothing on the earth grows. So man after he is borne till he
be six year of age is without wit strength or cunning, may do nothing that
profyteth.

Then comes Feueryere, then the days begenneth to wax in length, and the
son more hotter, then the fields begins to wax green: So the other six
years till he come to twelve, the child begins to grow bigger and serve and
learn such as is taught him.

Then comes Marche, in the which the labourer sows the earth plants trees,
edifyeth houses, the child in these vi. years, waxes big to lern doctriue
and science, to be fair and honest, for then he is.xviii. years of age.

After that comes April that the earth and the threes is covered in grene and
flowers, and in every party goods increases habundauntly, then comes the
child to gather the sweet flowers of hardiness, but then beware yt the cold
wyndes and storms of vices beat not down the flowers of good manners, that he
should bring man to honour, for then he is xxiiii. years old

Then comes May, that is both fair and pleasant, for then birds syngeth
in woods end forestes night and day, the son shines hot, and as then is
man most joyful and pleasant, and of deliver strength, and seeks plays,
sports, and lusty pastime, for then is he full xxx. year.

Then comes June, and then is the Son highest in his meridiornall, he may
ascend no hyer in his station, his glemeringe golden beams ripeth the corn,
and when man is xxxvi. year, he may ascend no more, for then hath nature given
him beauty and strength at the full, and rypeth the sedes of parfyte
understanding.

Then comes July, that our fruits bin set a sonninge, and our corn a
hardenynge, but then the son begynnethe a little for to dyscende downewarde^
so man then goth fro youth toward age, begins for to aquaynt him with
sadness, for then he is xlii. year.

After that then comes August: then we gather in our corn, and also the
fruits of the earth. And then doth man his diligence to gather for to find
him self withal, in the time that he may another get nor wyn, and the after
that vi. years is he.xlviii. year old.

Then comes September: that wynes be made, and the fruits of trees be
gathered. And then therewithal he doth freshly begin to garnyshe his house,
and make prouysion of needful things, for to live in winter which draws
very ne'er, and then is man in his most joyful and courageous estate prosperous
in wisdom, purposynge to gather and keep as much as shulde be sufficient for
him in his old age, when he may gather no more, and these vi. years makes
him liiii. years.

And then comes Octobre: that all is into the forsayde house gathered but
corn, and also other manner fruits. And also the labourers sows new sedes
in the earth, for the year to come. And then he that sows nought, shall nought
gather. And then in there other vi. years a man shall take him self unto God
for to do penance and good works, and then the benefytes the year after his
death, he may gather and have spiritual profit, and then is man full in the
term of lx. years.

Then comes November: that the days be very short, and the son in manner
gives little heate, and the trees leases their leues. The fields that were
grene loke whore and gray. Then al manner of herbs be hid in the ground and then
appears no flowers. And then winter is come that the man hath vn^derstandinge
of age, and hath lost his kyndely heate and strength: His teeche begin to
rot and also to chattre: and then hath ho no more hope of lunge life, but
desires to come to the life everlasting, and these.vi. for this mouth makes
him.lxvi. years.

Then comes Decembre: full of cold with frost and snow, with great wyndes
and stormy wethere, that a man may not labour nor nought do: the son is the
at the lowest that it may descede, the the trees the earth is hi^ in snow, the
it is good to hold them ny the fyre^ to spend the goods that they gathered
in summer. For then begins mas hear to wax white and gray, and his body
crooked feeble, then he leases his perfyte understanding and that vi. years
makes him full lxxii. years, and if he live any more it is by his good gydynge
and dyetynge in his youth. Howe be if, it is possible that a man may live till
he be an hundred year of age. But there is but few that comes thereto.

Wherefore I Sheparde said moreover, that of living or dying the heavenly
bodies may s^ere a man both to good and evil without dout of assuce^ie. But
yet may man withstand it by his one freewyll, to do what he will him self
good or bad evermore. Above the which inclinacyon is the might and will of
God, that longs the life of man by his goodness, or to take it short by his
justice.

Wherefore we will show you of the bodies celestial, and of their nature and
mouynges, and this present book is named the composte, for it comprehends
fully all the compost and more for the days, hours, and momentes and the new
moons, and the clippes of the sun and the moon, and of the signs that the
moon is in every day, and this book was made for them that be no clerks, to
bring them to great understanding.

And this kale^der is divided in v. parts.

The first of our signs of the compost and the calendar.

The second is the tree of vices with the peynes of hell.

The third is the way of health of man: the tree of virtues.

The fourth is physycke and governance of health.

The fyfte is Astrologye and physiognomy, for to understand many disceauynges,
and which they be. By lykelyhod, the which by nature are inclined and can do
them as ye shall rede or ye come to the end.

For to have the Shepardes understanding of their calendar, ye should
understand that the year is the measure of the time that the Son passes the
xii. signs, retournynge to his first point, and is divided in the xii.
Months.

As Ianyuere, Feueryere, Marche, and so forth to December.

So the son in these xii. months passes by xii. signs one time.

The days of his entering into the signs in the calendar, and the days, also
when he parts the year, as the xii. months into lii. weeks.CCC.lxv. days,
and when by sext is, it is three score and vi. one day and xxiiii. hours,
every hour lx. mynnets. After these deuysyons, ye must understand for every
year three things.

The first speaks of golden nombre.

The second of the letter domynicall.

And the chyrde is the letter tabuler, in the which lies all the chief
knoweledge of this calendar, For the which letter and number to understand al
that they would, whether it be past or to come, ye shall put three figures
after the calendar, of the which: the first shall show the valor and
declaracyon of the two other, and it is to be understand that in four years,
there is one by ^exte, the which hath one day more then other, and also has
two letters Dominicals sygned in one of the forsayde figures, and changes the
late day of saint Mathewe, the which is vygyl, and is put with the day upon on
letter by him self.

Also the letters Feryals of this Calendar, is to be understand as they (...)
the other calendars, before the which are the nombres, and the other three
o^ter the letters ferials. First for because the letters dyscendeth lowe, is
th^ golden nombre above the day of the new moon. And the which to be th^
hour momentes of the said month, which when they are in service b^fore
noone of the day above there. And when they are black service for afte^noone
of the same day in the places of the nombre, betokenethe that nomb^ where it
is. The natural day is to be understand fro midnyghte to my night xiiii.
hours, and shall serve the said nombres for the letters Fer^als.xix. year
complete from the year that this kaleder was made.M.CCC^ xcvii. unto the
year.M.cccc. and xvi. In the which year shall begin (...) to serve this
golden nombre, and the other nombres after the letters Feryal^ all in the manner
as they be before for the other xix. years.

And all the remenaunt of the compost, and of the calendar is perpetua^ For the
golden nombre, so shall they be.xxxviii. year, of the which years. M
CCCC.xcvii. is the first. The feasts of the calendar are in their days of
the which the solenuel are in rede and storyed in the vnyte, ny the which
vnytye in the end of the bodies above every day is one letter of the A.b. for
understand in what signs is the moon that day. And yet t^ said letters and
the rybryshe, for the which shall be one figure before t^ calendar, which
shall be show how they shulde understand it. This ye^ of this present calendar,
which began to have course the first day of Ian^uere.M.CCC.xcvii. In the
which raygneth for the golden nombre xv^ The letter domycall A. The letter
tabuler f. and b. In the first lives a^ their figures nearest the golden nombre
xvi. the year of this calendar.

An ingenious practise or Compost of Shepardes.
Newly and subtelly Shepardes have found a short practike, for to know the
golden number, the letter dominicall, and the Tabuler letters as ensues, the
which for subtility is difficile to be understanded, if first it be not showed
by such as understand it well, but as to this it behooves not to tarry and
travail for cause of the figures that ensigneth and shows how to find know
the said practike.

Finis canos agur eius bona fructus
Dicens anni et bellica griffo dant amara
El cambet gaudit dat alit fiet color
Genitrix danos boabel flores cadat gelica
Edens busti.
Four secretes of the Compost of Shepardes.
Mobilis alta dies t, currens aurens octo
Sexdeno cum d, non erit inferior
B, veneris sancta, sed quin{que} tredambo maria
Nec erit in tolo dicens similis simul octo.
The manner to know the feastfull days on the hand and on what days they
ben.
WHo so will know on his hand when the holy days falls, take heed of the
same letters. A.b.c.d.e.f.g. The days of the week bin.vii. One for sunday,
and for the other days.vi. Put them in the joints of the left hand on.iiii.
fyngers, and with the right hand they ought to be marked for the more
certainty. A.b.c. on the back of the hand, and g. above d.e.f. within the
hand. Then ye ought to know in what place every month should be. A little
after dam of g.b. E g.c. bin on the month on the little finger. F.a. on the
leche finger. February and March on the leche finger together. April on g. May
on b. June on the middle finger above e. July upon g, and Auguste upon c.
September upon f. October on a. of the fourth finger. Then November above d,

How every month praises it self of some good property.
January.

I Make me to be called Ianyuere
In my time is great storms of coldenes
For unto me no month of the year
May compare if I advance me doubtless
For in my time was, as clerks do express
Circumcised the Lord omnipotent
And adoured by kings of the Orient.
February.
I am February the most hardy
In my season the pure mother virginall
Offered her son in the temple truly
Making to God a present special
Of Iesu Christ the king of kings all
Between the arms of the bishop Symon
To whom pray we to have his remission.
March.
March am I called in noblesse florishinge
Whiih among months, am of great noblesse
For in my time all the fruit do bud and spring
To the service of man in great largess
And leuf is in, the time of holiness
That every man ought to have repentance
Of his sins done, by lunge continuance.
Apryll.
Among all months, I am lusty April
Fresh and wholesome, unto each creature
And in my time the dulcet drops distill
Called crystal as poets put in scripture
Causing all stones the longer to endure
In my time was the resurrection
Of God and man by diui^e election.
May.
Of all the months in the year I am king
Flourishing in beauty excellently
For in my time, in virtue is all thing
Fields and meads sprede most beauteou^y
And birds singe with right sweet armony
Rejoicing lovers with hot love all endowed
With fragrant flowers, all about renewed.
June.

Who of my season takes right good heed
Ought not at all, my name to adnull
For in my time, for all the commons wed
From sheep is shorn, all the flesh and will
And had in marchaundyse, by great ships full
Over the sea, wherefore we ought to pray
Unto our Lord, and thank him night and day.
July.
If that my time were praised all a right
Among all months I am one of the chief
For I enripe thorough my great force and might
Fruits of the earth, to man and beasts relief
Feeding horses, kine, muttons, and strong beef
With other properties that I could tell
But I must pass I may no longer dwell.
August.
I am named the hot month of August
For redolent heate of Phebus brightness
In my time each man ought for to have lust
To labour in harvest, with great busynes
To repe and sheffe, eschewing ydlenes
And rise early with perfyte diligence
Thanking our Lord of his great providence.
September.
Who can my name perfitely remember
With the commodities of my season
Ought of right to call me September
Plenteous of goods by all manner reason
As wheat, rye, o^es, beans, ^ytches, and peason
Of which fruit every man ought to have in store
To live directly, and thank our Lord therefore.
October.
Among the other October I hight
Friend unto vinteners naturally
And in my time Bacchus is ready dight
All manner wine to press and clarify
Of which is sacred as we see daily
The blessed body of Christ in flesh and blode
Which is our hope, refection and fode.

I November will not abide behind
To show my kindly worthiness and ur
For in my time the blasts of the wind
Abates leaves and stedeth their verdure
Wherefore every prudent creature
Ought for to live right as they would dye
For all thing takes end naturally.
December every man doth me call
In whose time the mother inviolate
Delivered was in an old ox stall
Of Iesu Christ Gods own son incarnate
Wherefore I think me the most fortunate
Of all the other, to whom pray we then
That we may come unto his bliss. Amen.
The first Primetime that thus doth begin
From mid February unto mid May
And from mid May, Summer is entered in
To mid August, and then is harvest day
And from that time, Winter enters always
On saint Clementes day, who so takes heed
And mid February it fails in dede.
Thus ends the praise of the twelve months, with the beginniuges and ends
of the four quarters. And after follows the figure for to know in what sign
the Moon is every day.
^ and the declaration is of the letters of the sign of the ka^

By this figure here above, a man may know in what s^gne the Moon is every
day, and the declaration is of the (...) letters that ben in the calendar at
the ends of the lines, and be named the letters of the signs, wherefore mark
well first the letter of the calendar on the day that we wold have, then loke
out the said letter in the figure here above in the lyne discendinge under the
golden number that runs.

Then loke at the headde of the lines, where as is written the names of the
signs, and it that beholds directly ouertwharte the figure to the said
letters is it that the Moon is in that day. And like as one golden number for
a year, so the said lyne under the golden number serves alone for the same
year as in the year of his calendar we have.xvi. for the golden number, the
line under.xvi. serves all the said year, and when we have.xvii. the lyne
under.xvii. shall serve to the year that.xvii. is for the golden number, and
so forth of the other.

VT celum signis presurgens est duodenis
Sichominis corpus assimulatur eis
Nam caput et facies. Aries sibi gaudit habere
Gutturus et coll^ius tibi. Taure detur
Brachia cum manibus. Geminis sunt apta decentur
Naturam Canc^i pectoris aula gerit
At Leo vult stomacum renis sibi vendicat idem
Sed in testinis Uirgo preesse petit
Ambas Libra nates, ambes sibi vendicat hancas
Scorpio vult anum vult{que} pudanda sibi
Inde Sagittarius is coxis vult dommari
Amborum genum vim Capricornus habet
Regnat in aquario crurtum vis apta decentur
Piscibus et demum congrua planta pedum.
Saturnus niger. Iupiter ^iridis. Mars rebeus est. Sol croteus. Uenus albus.
Marcurius et Luna varti sunt dum quisquis regnat nascitur, puer sic coloratus.

The declaration of the latin here above.
THat is to say, that the.xii. signs hath domination over the body of man
divided by the parts, as the signs divides the firmament, and every sign
beholds and governs the parts of the body, so as it is said above, and
afterward shall be showed by figures, and is declared more plainly and
faithfully. Such like of planets is said of their colours, but of their
natures and properties of the parts of the bodies the which governs and
beholds, more at full shall ye hear at length.

Also of the.xii. months natures, March, April, and May, are very hot and
moist, that signifyeth blud and air. June, July, and August, is summer and
signifyeth hot and dry choler, manhood, and fear. September, October, and
November, is harvest, and betokens cold and dry, and age, melancholy and
earth. December, January, and February, is winter, and betokens cold and
moist, childehode, fleume, and water.


CAlled I am Iauyuere the cold
In Christmas season good fire I love
Yonge Iesu, that sometime Iudas sold
In me was circumcised for mans behove
Three kings sought the son of God above
They kneeled down and hyd him homage with love
To God their Lord that is mans own brother.
Hereafter follows a calendar with the figures of every saint that is halowed
in the year, in the which is the figures, the hours, the momentes, and the
new Moons. Capitulo.iii.

then we see it, for the Eclipse of the Sun may well be by night, and the
Eclipse of the Moon may be by day. But such Eclipse appears not to us
Shepardes.

NO marvel that mans mind is mutable
And will you know wherefore and why
For he is made of things varyable
As of hot, cold, moyste, and dry
The wit is light, it passes lightly
And sith we be made of four changeable
Howe should man be steadfast and stable.
An eclipse shall be marvelous to behold
Through which many shall be the worse
For many shall find neither silver no gold^
It shall be so dark within their purse.

Here after follows the second part of the compost and calendar, which
shows of the trees of vices, of the pains of hell. Cap. vii.


IN the name of the father, the son, and the holy Ghost. Amen. We purpose to
show the trees of vices, for sinners to take example by, for to understand
their sins. The which is divided in.yii. principal parts after the.vii.
deadly sins, and each deadly sin is likened to a tree, and every tree
having.vii. small branches, and all these.vii trees comes out of one tree by
it self that is evil, and comes of one beginning, and that is the devil,
and it bids an end, that is everlasting damnation, which is ordained for all
them that seek not remedy betimes by penance and repentance of their life in
time.

And after these trees of vices follows the pains of hell, to show the lay
people what punyshmente is ordained for every deadely sin, and that the
people may the better show their sins in confession, and make clean their
conscience, that they may be the house of God, so that virtues may grow and
fructify to the profit of their souls. The first great branch of the tree
of vices is Pride, and he hath.xvii branches growing out of him. As of vain
glory of him self. Uayne glory of the world. Praising him self in evil.
Bostinge of sin. Inobedyence. Disdain. To tempte God. Excess. Dispraysinge.
False goodness. Hardynesse. Presumption. Rebellion. Obstinacion. Sin
wittingly. Communynge of the Sacrament. Shame to do good. Out of every of the
which branches spryngeth three branches, and out of every of the said three
branches grows three small branches, to the number of seven score and
thyrtene, and in so many manners and ways ye may sin in the sin of Pride,
the which is the root and beginning of all the seven deadly sins. And
therefore it shall be showed first of Pride, and after the other six sins
as they follow in order.

The first branch of pride. Vain glory of himself.

righteousness of God Or else they love not God with their hart
To have no shame of evil doing.
For they know not which is virtue no vice Nor to amend themselves be not
willing For to be scene gladly when he doth evil.

The fourth branch of pride. Bosting of sin.

may be known Hiding their sins that they apere not great

The.v. branch of pride. Inobedience.

Explicit.
Here ends the branches of all the.vii. deadly sins, as they be before
rehearsed, with all the small branches. Also showing howe that three comes of
the great branches each by him self. And out of them three grows.ix. and so
every branch hath small sprays springing out of them. So there is no man no
woman living, but he synneth venially as it is written. Sepcie^ in die cadet
iustus. Lo if the righteous man do sin.vii. times a day by venial sins,
then we wretched sinners howe oft do we sin in a day. God wot full oft. But
yet for venial sin is many remedies. Also for deadly sin is few remedies,
and but four specially, as Confession, Contricion, Satisfaction, and penance.
But the first is, thou must be sorry for thy sins. Secondly to make a meke
confession. Thirdly, do satisfaction. And fourthly perform thy penance
adjoined by the confessor, for penance is debt that we must pay to God for
our sin committed, and therefore never loke to have forgeuenes of thy sins
without repentance. Also sin is perilous before our Lord Iesu Christ for.iii.
manner of reasons. The first he gives no warning when he smites thee. The
second, for as he finds thee, so will he judge thee. The third when thou
art dead remedy is past and gone.

Here follows the pains of hell comminatories of sins, to punish the
sinners, as Lazarus recounted after that he was risen, as he had seen in the
parties infernals, as it appears by these figures ensuing one after an other.
Capitulo.viii.


OUr Saviour and redemer Iesu Christ, a little before his blessed Passion,
being in Bethanye, entered into the house of a man named Symon, for to take his
corporal refection. And as he was sytting at the table with his Apostles and
Disciples, there being Lazarus brother to Mary Magdalene and Martha, the which
our Lord had raised from death to life. The which thing Symon doubted, and
prayed our Lord for to command Lazarus to show before the assistentes what
he had scene in the other world. And our lord gave him leave to speak. And then
the said Lazarus recounted how that he had scene in the parties infernalles of
hell many great and intolerable pains, where as sinful men and women were
pained. First of Pride, and consequently of all the.vii. deadly sins, each
payne by him self.

First said Lazarus I have seen in hell wheles right hie, set on an hill, the
which was to look on in manner of mylles, incessantly turning about by great
impetuosity, roaring and whirling as it were thunder. And the wheles were fixed
full of hooks and crampions of Iron and steel, and on them were hanged and
turned the proud men and women for their Pride, with their prince, captain
and master Lucifer.



Pride among all other sins is a king, a captain, and master. And as a
king hath a great company of people, in the same manner hath pride a great
company of vices And as a king kepeth that which is his, in likewise doth pride
keep the proud folk that be in his jurisdiction. Great sign of reprobacion
it is for to persevere lunge in pride Pride then is a sin that displeases God
above all other sins, as much as humility pleases him among virtues. And
there is no sin that makes a man more semblable to the devil then pride
doth. For the proud man will not be as the other men, but he must be as the
Pharisien with the devil. And for that the proud man will enhance him self
above other men, the devil doth with him as the crow having a harde nut in
his byl, the which he may not crack, she bears it up a hye in the air, and
then lets it fall upon a stone whereon it breaks, and then she descends
and eats it. In likewyse the devil reyseth the proud man and woman for to
let them fall in the harde pains of hell. As much difference is between pride
and humility, as the chafe and the corn, for the chafe is light and
mounts hye, the wind carries it about and so it is lost, and the corn which
is heavy abides lowe on the ground, and is gathered up and put in garners of
the fermour, and is kept for the common profit, and the chafe is brent,
lost, and de^oured of beasts. And in this wise are the proud people raised
and enhaunsed through the entisement of the fiende of hell, then fall down by
the moist rain of death, which makes them heavy, and causes them to tomble
by the strength of their superbious blasts into the forneyse everlasting, and
there to be brent and devoured with the horrible beasts of hell.



Secondly said Lazarus I have seen in hell a fiudde frozen as ise, wherein the
envious men and women were plunged unto the nauill, then suddenly came over
them a right cold and a great wind, that grieved and pained them right sore,
when they would euite and eschew the wonderful blasts of the wind, they
plunged into the water with great shouts cries lamentable to hear.

These be the Envious people.


Envy is dolor and sorrow of the heart, of the felicity and prosperytie of
other, the which sin is sovereignly cursed, for that it is contrary to
Charity, that is soueraygne head of all virtues, whereby it is great sign of
reprobacyon, for by it the fiends know them that shall be dampned, as
Charity is sign of salvation, and whereby God knows who shall be saved.
Enuyous people ben fellows unto the devil. For if so be that an Enuyous man
do win, then is he very glad, and if he leese he is full angry with them.
Enuyous folk ben so infette and corrupt that good odours to them stynketh,
and sweet things unto them seems sower, in likewise is the good name and
prosperity of other But stinking things and sower to them be sweet, the which
ben vices, reproaches, adversities, and evil fortunes that they know or hear
said of other. The Envious folk seek their wealth in the adversity of other,
as when of the harm of other they seek the good in rejoicing them, but with
this they be not yet satisfied, but of a new they be tormented, for they have
not such joy without displeasance and affliction at their hart, whereby they be
tormented. For he that seeks his wealth in the adversity of an other, is like
to him that seeks the fire in the bottom of a water, or that looks for woll
on an urchins back, the which things be but all follies and abusions. Envy is
but the goods and felicities of this world, for the cursed sin of envy may
not ascend into heaven. It is a sin difficile to heal, for it takes toote
and is fixed in the hart secretly, wherefore it is harde and unpossible for to
be done away by medicine, wherefore with great pains is any made hole that is
infected with it. The envious men's tongues be likened unto a three edged sword
that hurts and cutteth three manner of ways. The first he hurts and
wounds his own soul. The second him that he tells his tale unto. And
thirdly he sleyeth him by whom he felleth his cursed tale.

Thus ends Envy, and follows the history of Wrath.
Wrath.


Thirdly said Lazarus I have seen in hell a great cave tenebrous and obscute,
full of tables like Bochers stalls, or a great bochery, where as Ireful men
and women were thorough pierced with trenchynge knyues and sharpe glayues, with
long spears pierced their bodies, wherewith the most horrible and fearful
bochers of hell hewed and detrenched them with their glayues and knyues
impiteously without ceasing.



SO as peace makes the conscience of a man to be the dwelling place of God,
so cursed wrath makes it the habitation of the devil. Wrath efisketh and
leases the eye of reason, for in a wrathful man reason is banished, there is
nothing that kepeth so much the image of God in man, as sweetness, peace, and
love, for almighty God will be there as peace and concord is, but wrath chase
the fro man, so that our lord may have no abiding. The wrathful man is like to
a Demoniacle, the which hath the devil within him, causing him to torment and
strive with himself, foaming at the mouth, and gnasshing with his teeth, for
the intolerable payne the which the enemy doth to him. In likewise the
wrathful man is tormented by wrath, and doth oftentimes worse then the
Demoniacle, for without patience they beat the one with the other, saying
injuries, reproaches, vyllanies, give them selves to the devil body and soul,
and say and do many unlawful and domageable things. By wrath sometime the
devil gets an hole generation or all a coun^rey. When wrath is set, then
comes noise, then vengeance that destroys and leases all, the which
happens sometime through one wrathful man, as an yreful dog the which mo^ed
and put strife among other. The fysher troubles the water that the fysh may
not see his net, to the end that they may go therein and be taken. In
likewise the devil troubles the man by wra^h, to the end that he know not
the harm that he commised by his wrathful hart and courage.

Fourthly said Lazarus, I have scene in hell an horrible hall dark and
tenebrous, wherein was a great multitude of serpents big and small, where as
slothful men and women were tormented with bytings and stingings of venomous
worms, the which pierced them through in diverse parts of their bodies, wounding
them to the hart with inextinguible payne.



Of slothful people.
Sloth is tristesse of spiritual goods, that should be ordained to God,
wherfeore they love to serve God as they ought to do, with hart and mouth, and
by good operacyons, who that will love God ought to know him redemptour and
Saviour of all goodness that we have had and received every day, knowledging
our selfs sinners. Great folly it is when by sloth in the time of this breniate
life, we gather not goods for the life eternal. But in these days many one
be slothful to do well, and diligent to do evil, so that if they were
diligent to do well, as they be to do evil, they were right happy. Also sloth
is the beginner of sin, and a great enemy to God, for he lets men and
women to serve God, and to know their maker and redeemer, and sender of all
goodness that they have here, they be great fools that be so slothful here
in this little time of this short life, that will gather no goods to bring
the soul to everlasting life. But now a days people be slothful in doing
of good, and full diligent to evil, and if they were as diligent to do good as
evil, they were full of grace. Now he that will think as after his death is
not wise, for then he shall have but the good d^edes that he hath done in his
life before, then shall he sorrow and plain of the time that he hath lost by
sloth, and shall sorrow that he did no good deeds when he had time space here
in this world.

Here ends the.v. payne of hell. And follows the.vi. pain of hell.
Couetise.


Fyfthly said Lazarus, I have seen in the infernal parties a great number of
wide cauderons and kettels full of boylynge lead and Oil with other hot
metalles molten, in the which were plunged and dypped the Couetyse men and
women, for to fulfil and replenish them of their insaciate couetise.

The covetous men and women.
COuetyse is a great sin and a wicked in the sight of God. For the covetous
man imagines more to get a penny, then the love of God. And had lever less God
then one half penny. For often times for a little thing he lyethe and
forswereth him self and sins deadly. The faith, hope the charity that
would be in God the covetous man puts in his rychesse. First faith, for he
believes to ^aue such things, the which be necessary for him, sooner for his
goods then (...) the gyfte of God, as if that God might not help him, or as
if God had ^o solicitude of his servants.

Also the covetous man hath hope to have the more joy and consolations by his
riches, then God may give him. And also the covetous man sets al his heart on
his goods not on God, thus the covetous man woman hath their charity in their
rich chests, confers, bags. The couetousman hath his heart on his goods
more the one God. There as is the hart, there is the love, and love is
charytie, and so covetous men hath their hertes on their goods. The covetous
man synneth gatherynge his good, and in vsynge it evil, and in loving it over
much, and sometimes better then he doth God, the covetous man is taken in the
net of the devil, by the which he leases everlasting life, for small temporal
goods, as the bird doth go into a pytfall for a worm leases his life, and as
the mouse is taken in a fall or trappe, and leases his life for a little bacon.
The covetous men and women bin like cures or dogs, the which that kepeth
carren, and when their bellies be full they lye down by it, and kepeth away
the birds that they may not eat, but dies for hunger for fault of that the
cures hath to much. In likewise the covetous men withholds the goods that
pore men may get none, lets them dye for hunger, and holds them in their
subjection, and the devil holds the rich men in his subjection that doth
the pore men wrong.

Thus ends the peyne for the covetous men.
And here follows the vi. peyne of hell.
Lazarus.


The vi. peyne said Lazarus Gluttony.
that I have scene in a vale a flodde soul and flynkynge at thee brymme, in the
which was a table with towels right dyshonestly, where as Gluttons bin fed
with Toads and other venomous beasts, and had to drink of the water of the
same said fludde.



THe throat is the gate of the body of ma, so when enemies will take the castle,
if they may win the gate, they will lightly have all the Castle. So when the
devil may wyn the throat of a man by Glottony, easily he will have the
remenant and entre into the ^ody accompanied of sins. For the Glottons
consents unto all vices. ^nd for this cause it were of necessity to have a
good guard at the gate, that ^he devil entre not. For when one holds the
horse by a bridle, he may led ^ym where he will, so doth the devil the
glottonous man where him list. The seruaunt that is over easily nourished
rebelleth oft against his master. The belly over filled with drink and
meat, is rebel to the soul, so that it ^oyl do no good operatyons. By
glottony many bin dead which might have ^ued longer, and so they have bin
homicide of the self, for excess of to much (...) and drynkinge corrupts
the bodies and engendrethe sycknesses, the which often a brydgeth and shorteth
the lives. And they that noryshethe well the flesh prepares meat for worms,
so the gloto is coke of worms A ma^ of worship wold be ashamed for to be coke
of a great Lord. More ashamed shulde he be, to be a coke for worms. They that
live after the desire of flesh, lives after the rule of the swyne in eating
without measure like an unreasonable beast. This is the hog as it were an
abbot over glotonous people, of whom they hold their order and regule, whereby
they bin constrained to keep them in their cloister, that is in the tavern and
ale houses. And likewise as the hog their Abbot lyethe in a rotten dungehill
or in the miry puddle, so do they always lye in the stynkyng infection of
Glottony, till they be drunken and without wit.

The vii. payne said Lazarus, I have scene a field full of deep wells
replenyshed with fire and s^lphre, wherout issued smoke thycke cotagious wherein
all lecherous persons were tourmented incessantly with devils.



OF all the vii. deadly sins. Lecherye pleases most unto the devil. For it
fyleth and corrupts both the body the soul together, and by Lechery the
devil wynneth two sowles at once. And many lecherous persons will avaunt
them self, and say that they may not have their full desire and lust of
that sin. Lecherous men and women be more disfourmed and ugly then the
devil, in the superhabundaunce of that sin. He is a foolish merchant that
makes a bargeyne, of the which he knows well that he shall less thereby, and
repent him of his bargain making. In like manner of wise, each Lecherous man
hath great peyne, and spends his goods and his understanding to fulfil and
accomplish his lusts and delytes, and after repents him of his expense, and
yet the worst is, he is in danger of his foul till he be repentant, do
sufficient penance. The Lecherous men and women living bin tourmented with
three infernal peynes, as heate, slynke, and remors of their conscience. For
they be hot by concupiscence. They be stynkynge for their immundicitie. For
such sin is all stynkynge maculeth the body and soul, which all other sines
fyleth but the soul.

Also they be not without remors of conscience for the offence that they have
done to God. Lecherye is the pit of the devil, wherein he makes sinners to
fall. To the which many helps the devil to caste them self in it, when
wyllinglye they go to the brymme knowing that the devil will caste them in.
Good it is not to herken women, better it is not to beholden them, much better
it is not to touch them. To this sin^e belongs foul words, bylayne songs,
dyshoneste touchynges, the which abhors not bawds, hatlottes, hores, and
such as frequents and perseveres in the same.

Thus ends the vii. deadly sins, figured each by him self like as Lazarus
had scene in the parts Infernalles.
Here after follows the third part of the Calendar and composte of
Shephardes. Salutary science, and gardyn of virtues. Capitulo ix.


VUho that will have on a piece of earth great habundaunce (...) fruit,
first they ought to take away all things that bin no^ some, and after
labour it well, and then sow good sedes. I^ likewise a man should labour
and cleanse his conscience of (...) his sins, labour by holy meditations and
sow virtues an^ good operations, for to gether fruit of everlasting life.

Then since that here before has bin spoken of vices rudely and lyght^ now it
behooves hereafter to speak of virtues in the third part of this pr^sente
book, the which shall be as a little garden pleasant, full of trees an^
flowers. In the which the conteplatyue person may sport and play, by goo^
ensignementes gather sundry virtues, and edifye him self in good exercise
wherewith his soul shall be enorned and ordained before his spouse Iesu Chri^ when
he shall come to vysyte and dwell with him. In the beginning of th^ which
party shall be the Orayson domynicall of our Lord, with the declar^tyon the
better to understand it, and the said party shall conteyne vi. pa^ties. The
first party shall be the declaration of the said prayer. The second of the
salutation Angelyke that Gabriell made to Mary when she conceaue^ her child
Iesus. The iii. shall be of the xii. articles of our faith. The iiii. shall be of
the x. commandments of the law. The fifth shall be of the Field of virtues:
For the first ye ought to know that by the oraison of our lord, that is the
Pater noster, when we say it we demand of God suffysaunce of all things
necessary for to salute help of our souls of our bodies, not only for us, but
for all other. And for all this cause we ought to have the said orayson in
great coteplacion, say it with great devotio unto God. And unto yonge people it
should betaught said to them, for though they understand it not, yet it
profyteth the to have the kyngedome of heaven. And they say it in perfyte love
charity, In the Pater noster, we ask vii. petitions. By each petition we may
understand vii. other things. As the vii, Sacramentes of holy Church. The
vii. gifts of the holy ghost. The vii. armures of justice spiritual. The
vii. virtues princypall that we should exercise. The seven works of mercy
bodily. The vii. works of mercy ghostly. The vii. deadly sins that we
shulde dread. The declaration is this, Our father that art in heaven thy name
be made holy. In his petition, we ask of god our father to be his sons, for
otherwise we can not be called his sons, nor be our father, that his name may
be made by us more holyer then any other thing, wherefore we receive the
sacrament of baptism, without that, ma may not be made the son of God, to
receive the virtue of meknesse against pride, and the to clothe the naked,
help the nedy both bodily ghostly. The ii. is, thy kingdom come to us is this
petition. In so much thy name of God may not be perfitely halowed of us in this
world we ask his realm. In the which perfitely we shall halowe it, for to
that kingdom we be very heirs. This petition is the sacrament of priesthod, by
the which we are taught to good works, the gift of the holy-ghost is the gift
of understanding, for to understand desire the kingdom of heaven, and we arm
us with the helm of largeness against coueteous. The iii. petition is thy will
be done in the earth as it is in heaven. For it is the faithful will of God
that his will shulde be fulfilled that is his comaundemet, by this petition we
make obeysauce to God in our hertes, when we desire to do his will. By this is
understand the sacrament of Marriage, by the which we avoid fornication, and
the gift af counsel of the holy ghost for to order our obeisance veritably.
And so we arm us with the armour of salvation against envy. The fourth
petition is, our dayely bread give us this day. Here we ask of God to be
sustained with material bread for our bodies, and spiritual bread for our
souls, that is the bread of life, the body of Iesu Christ, the which we
receive by faith, in mind of his passion. The ghyft of the holy ghost is
strength to be faithful in our belief, take we the sword of patience
against the sin of ire, and vysyte the sick men bodily, and use virtue of
temperance against wrath. the fyfte pety^ion is, forgive us our sins as we
forgive all men, for trust well, he that will not forgive for the love of
God, God will never forgive him his sins. And these.iii. petitions folowinge
we ask of God to be delivered from al evil, as of the sin that we have done
deadely, by these we ask of God to be assoyled and to give us pardon by his
mercy, by the which we understand the sacrament of penance forgyuenisse of
sin the holy ghosts gift is science for to understand the works of mercy
and to escaped sin. And so clothe us with lightness against couetyse, and
comfort pore prisoners and give good council to them that ask and need it,
and take the virtue of faith against couetyse. The vi. petition is suffer us
not to be overcome in temptation by the second evil that is not done, but it
may happen we fall by the way of temptation. Here we ask of God to be
stedfaste in the faith, that we may gladly do good works in the virtue of hope
and strength to do good deeds, withstand temptation to the which profyteth to
us the sacrament of confirmation which gives to us the knowledge of God by
the virtue of verity. The gift of the holy ghost, and so take we the sphere of
sobernesse against glotony, and comfort pilgrims by virtue of hope. The vii.
petition is to deliver us frome all evil. Amen. The third evil, is evil of
peyne that sinners may have if they serve not God, by this petition we ask
that we may be delivered from all peynes, and saved in Paradyce, unto this say
we all. Amen. By these we ask, so it be done as we desire. By the which we
receive the sacrament of the later anoyntynge, that gives us the sure way of
salvation, the gift of the holy ghost is dread of judgements of God, and
gyrde us with the girdle of chastity against lechery, and bury we them that
be dead bodily, and pray for our enemies ghostly, get we in us the virtue of
charity, and eschew the sin of lechery.

Thus ends the Salutary science and garden of virtues.
And hereafter follows an other declaration of the Pater noster. Capitulo.x.


OUr Father right marvelous in his creation sweet and loving rich of al
goods that bin in heaven, mirror of trinity, crown of iocunditie, and
tresure of felicity. Holy be thy name sweet as honey in our mouth, thou art
the melodyous harp that causes devotion to sownde in our ears, and to have
it continually by the desire of our hearts. Thy realm come to us. In the
which we shall be ever in joy and rest, without trouble, and sure never to less
it^ Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. As to love al that thou
loueste, and to hate al that thou heat, and that we keep evermore thy
commandments. Our daily bread give us to day, that is to say bread of
doctrine, bread of penance, and bread for our bodily sustentacion. And
forgive us al our sins, that we have done, against thee, against our
neighbours, a^d against our self. Semblably as we forgive other that have
offended to us, by words, on our bodies, or our goods, And suffer not that we
be overcome in temptacio, that is to say, as by the devil, the world, and the
flesh. But deliver us from all evil works ready done, and also them for to
come, Amen.

Here follows the story of the Pater noster.
OUR Father which art in Heaven, halowed be thy name. Let thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done, as well in earth, as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive our trespacers. And
lead us not into temptation: but deliver us from evil. For thine is the
kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.


IN the storye here before, shows to simple people how this holy prayer the
Pater noster: should be said to God the father, to god the son, ye god to holy
ghost. And to none other. The which prayer conteyneth and takes all that be
rightfully asked of God, and our lord Iesu Christ made it there to the intent
that we shulde ^, and devotion, and he made it on a time when he taught his
apostles, specyally to make orayson. And then the disciples said Lord and
master learn us to pray, then our lord opened his holy mouth and said to
his apostles when ye will make any prayers, after this manner as here follows,
shall you begin saying thus.

Our father which art in heaven halowed be thy name. Thy kyngedome come. Thy
will be done in yearthe as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread. And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against
us, and let us not be let into temptation. But deliver us from evil. Amen.

Here after follows the salutation that the Angel Gabriell made to the
glorious virgin Mary, with the greeting of the holy woman S. Elisabeth.

Hayle Mary full grace, our lord is with thee.

Blessed be thou of all women, and blessed be the fruit of thy womb Iesus.



Secondely in the book of Iesus, the salutation in such.
Hayle Mary full of grace our lord is with thee. Blessed be thou among all
woman, and blessed be the fruit of thy womb Iesus Christ. Amen.

The salutation of the Angel Gabriell.


IN this salutation is three mysteries. The first is the salutacio that the
Angel Gabriel made. The second is the loving commendacio that S. Elisabeth
made, mother to S. Iohn Baptist. The iii. is the supplication yt our mother
holy Church makes And they be ye most fairest words that we can say to our
Lady: that is the Aue Maria, wherein we salve her, praise her, pray her, speak
to her. And therefore it is only said to her, and not to saint Kathrine, nor to
saint Margarete nor to none other saint. And if thou demand how thou may
then pray to other sayntes I say to the thou must pray as our mother holy
Church prays in saying to S. Peter Holy S. Peter pray for us. S. Thomas
pray for us. That they may pray to God to give us grace, and that he forgive
us our sins. And that he give us grace to do his will penance, keep his
commandments, and so we shall pray to the saints in heaven after the
necessity that we have.

S. Peter, S. Andrewe, S. Iames the great, saint Iohn, S. Thomas, S. Iames the
less, S. Philyp, S. Bartylmewe, S. Mathewe, S. Symon, S. Iude, and S. Mathias.

Thyrdly in the book of Iesus is salutary science, and is the Credo which we
ought to believe on peyne of dampnation. Capitulo x.


I believe in God the father almighty, maker of heaven earth, and in Iesu Christ
his only son our Lord which was conceived of the Holy ghost, and suffered
passion under Ponce Pilate, crucified, buried, went into hell, the iii. day
rose from death. Ascended into heaven sits on the right hand of the father.



And after shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the holy
ghost, the Holy Catholyke church, the communion of saints, and remission of
sins. The rysynge of the flesh. The everlasting life, Amen.

Saint Peter put the first article and said. I believe in God the Father
almighty creator of heaven and of earth. Saint Andrewe put to the ii. and
said. I beliue in Iesu Christ his only son our lord. Saint Iames the
great put to the iii saying, I believe that he was conceived of the holy
ghost, borne of the virgin Mary. Saint Iohn put to the iiii. saying. I believe
that he suffered passion under Ponce Pylate, was crusifyed, dead, and buried.
Saint Thomas put to the v. saying. I believe that he descend into hell, and
the third day arose from death to life. Saint Iames the less put to the vi.
saying. I believe that he ascended into heaven and sytteth on the right hand
of God the father omnipotent. Saint Phylip put to the vii. saying I believe
that after he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. Saint Bartylemewe
put to the.viii. saying. I believe in the holy ghost. Saint Mathewe put too
the ix. saying I believe in the holy Church Catholyke. Saint Symon put to the
x. saying, I believe the communion of sayntes and remission of sins. Saint
Iude put to the.xi. saying. I believe the resurrec^ion of the flesh. Saint
Mathias put to the xii. saying. I believe the life eternal. Amen.

Here follows the Cred as it ought to be said.
I Believe in God the father almighty creator of heaven of earth, And in Iesu
Christ his only son our Lord. That was conceived of the holy ghost, borne
of the virgin Mary. Suffered passion under Ponce Pylate, crucified, dead and
buried. Descended into hell, and the third day arose from death. Ascended into
heaven, and sytteth on the right hand of God the father omnipotent. And after
shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the holy ghost. The
holy church Catholic. The communion of sayntes, remission of sins.
Resurrection of the flesh and the life eternal. Amen.

This Cred was made composed by the xii. Apostels of our lord, of ye which
every Apostle hath put to his article, as is here above showed in the said
Cred, as much as one of one part as of the other, our faith catholic is
contained in the said xii. articles, yt is the beginning of our health, without
the which none may be sa^ed, no do nothing that is agreeable unto God, and
faith ought to be at the ^arte by knowledge of God. In the mouth by confession
praysinges to him (...) work by exerceysinge of his commaundemetes and good
works, and the which shows them that so doth to have true faith life, that
is to say to ^aue them. And how well that faith in heart be good, that in the
mouth also, ^euerthelesse the best is that which lies in good works that one
doth, is ^he same faith that lies in the hart and mouth, for there is but one
faith, ^ne God. And this same Cred ought to be had and known of every man ^nd
woman having age competent and understanding of reason, ought for ^o say it
both in the morning in the evening every day devoutly, for it is of ^ght great
devotion. Therefore a good Christen ma as soon as he rises from his bed, and is
arayde clothed, kneleth beside his bed or other where, and first blesses him
with the sign of the cross, then saith. Credo in deum, Or I believe in God the
father almighty, as is above said. Then after the Pater noster to God. And to
our Lady the Aue Maria: afterward recomaunde him to his good Angel in making
prayer to him saying My good Angel I require thee to keep me and govern me.
In likewise when he goes to rest at night. And so at the least twyse in the
day, at the morrow and in the evening.

Fourthly in the book of Iesu is the x. commandments of the law, that God
gave to Moyses on the mount of Sinay, for to preche and teach to the people.
Capitulo. xii.


One God only thou shalt love worship perfytely.

God in vain thou shalt not swear nor by yt he made truly

The sondayes thou shalt keep. in seruinge God devoutly.

Father mother thou shalt honour end shalt live longely.

Mans^eer thou shalt not be, in dede, no wyllyngely.

Lecherous thou shalt not be, of thy body no consentyngely.

No mans goods thou shalt not steal nor witholde falsely.

False wytnesse thou shalt not ^ere, in any wise lyingely.

The work of the flesh desire not, but in marriage only.

The goods of other covet not, to have them unjustly.



FOurhly the said commaundemets ought to be observed accom^plyshed upon peyne
of everlasting dampnacion of body and sowl of the yt have the usage of reason,
for without the knowledge o^ them conuenablye we may not eschew ^ie the
sins, nor have knowledge of the, nor confess us verytably of our sins,
whe^fore the ignorance of the come by desire affection, or other malice,
excuset^ not the that know the not, but accuses condempneth them, therefore ou^
lord comaundeth the to be had in meditation in their houses without, in
sl^pynge in waking, in al works And thus we beholden bound to kep^ the, so
that he which never harde speak of the, thinks not to do evil, if h^ trespass
in one only willingely, dies soon after, he should be dampned perdu^rably. By
this it appears that ignorauce of the comaundementes bin peri^lous, wherefore
each man woman study for to know the, learn the such as thou must give a
reckoning for, as your children, servants, and other.

The v. Commandments of the Church.
i
ii
x^


FIfthly in the book of Iesus bin the v. commandments of Holy Church,
which ought to be kept all them that hath usage of reason, after as they be
of power.

And it is said after that they be of power, for that if the man or woman that
may not confess them, or receive at easter, or keep the holy day commanded.

Or the fast of obligation when they have will to do them, bin lawfully let,
sin not. But every man and woman keep them that Avarice, sloth, or desire
to se manipleasures, as dances, plays, or iuggelers, or despraysynge of our
mother Holy Church, be not cause that they trespass the commandment, to the
end that they run not in dampnacion, from the which keep us the mercy of
God. Amen. Here is to be noted that the transgression of the commandments of
holy Church oblygeth deadly sin, and by continuance eternal dampnacyon. as
doth the oblygacyon of the commandments of the law, of whom is spoken
before. For they that hears the priests redinge the commandments ^n the
Church on the Sondayes in the parochial seruis time, and accomplysheth the
said commandments, hears God and doth his will, but all ^hat misprayseth
the priest and doth not their comaundementes after the ordinance of the
Church, misprayseth God and sins mortally.

Thus ends the v. commandments of our mother holy Church.
Here after follows of the man in the Ship, that shows the vnstablenesse
of the world. Capitulo.xiii.
Qui finem attendit felix qui been viuit. Ergo quisquis ades precor hic, sta,
perlege pensa. Mortem premetuens, veniam, pete, cortere plara: De reliquis
cautus benefacte crimine serua. Viue mori presto munda sub mente quietis.
Semita non virtus deus optimus anchora portus. Felix qui potuit tam tutum
tangere portum. Sed miser est quicunque sub peste gehenne.


GOd guide me right, that I once might
Come to the port of peace
Mine exchange make, and return take
That mine enemies me to cease
One me followed, would me have shalowed
In the goulfe dangerous.
With wordely gloss, he doth me toss.
Among the waives perilous
On rases hollow, some do me follow
Enemies me to take
A great number, do smite me under
I doubt I shall not escape.
The fiend with wo, the world also
My flesh doth me trouble
In wake and sleep, to me they crepe
Thus increases my sorrow double.
They bid me not spare, but bye their ware
As all worldly vanity.
They say hope among, for to live lunge
Thus do they combre me.
The world doth smile, me to beguile
And so doth the other two,
Now must I seek, some me to keep
To save me fro my fo.
I have found one, even God alone
I need none other aid
That by his right, put them to flight
And made them all afraid.
He spake to me, full curteisly
And proffered me full fair
If I do well, with him to dwell
In heaven to be his heir.
Uersus.

NOs sumus in hoc mundo, sicut nauis super mare,
Semper est in periculo, semper timet accubare
Preuiliganti, nos oportet remigare:
No vibamus de poculo dire mortis, et amare:
Esto homo res fragilis curis oppressa labore
Mortis iudicii baratri perplexa timore
Si virtus sola tutam dat ducere vitam:
Uirtus sola potest eternam condere famam
Felicem merita faciunt non copia ream
Grandia no ditant: dicat been grandibus vti.
Discite nunc mortales, quam sint mortalia vana:
Precessere patres matres magnique parents.
Nos sequimur paribus ad mortem passibus imus:
Unde superbimus in terram, terra redimus.
Super non fueram, nec ero post tempore pauco
Milia nunc putrium quorum jam multa voluptas
Perdita fama silent, anima anxia forsitan ardet.
THe mortal man living in this world, is well compared to a ship on the sea,
or on a perilous river, bearing rich merchandise, which if it come to the port
where the merchant desires, he shall be happy and rich. The ship as soon as it
is entered into the sea, unto the end of her viage, night and day is in peril
to be drowned or taken with enemies, for in the sea be perils without number.
Such is the body of man living in the world, the merchandise that he bears is
his soul, his virtues and good works, the port or haven is death, and
Paradise for the good, to the which who that goes thither is sovereignly
rich, the sea is the world full of linnes. For who that assays for to pass
it, is in peril to leese body and soul, and all his goods, and to be drowned
in the sea of hell, from the which God keep us. Amen.

Here follows the field of virtues. Cap. xiiii.
IN walking farthermore in the field of virtues, and in the way of Health,
for to come to the tower of Sapience, necessarily behooves to love God, for
without the love of God none may be saved, and who that will love him ought
first to know him, for of his knoweledge one comes to his love: that is
Charity the Sovereign of all virtues. They knowledge God love him that keep
his comaundements, they misknow him that do not so, to whom in the great
necessity of their disceassing: at the day of judgment shall misknow them say
to them. I know ye not nor wot not what ye be, go ye cursed out of my copany.
Knowledge wethen God and love him, and if we will do thus, know we first our
self, and by the knowledge of our self, we shall come to the knowledge love
of God, and the more that we know our self, the better we shall know God, if
we be ignorant of our self, we shall have no knowledge of God. To this purpose
we must note one thing and know.vii. The thing that we must note is this. Who
that knows himself knows God, shall not be dampned, who that knows him
not, knows not God, and shall not be saved: understand of them that hath wit
and discretion with lawful age, of the which knowledge none is excused after
he hath sinned deadly, for to say that he was ignorant. By this appears the
ignorance of him self, and of God right perilous. Deadly sin is beginning
of all evil, and contrarily knowledge of God and of him self is sovereign
science and virtue, beginning of all goodness. The seven things that we ought
to have, ben the.xii. articles of the faith, that we ought to believe
steadfastly. Also the petitions contained in the Pater noster, by the which we
demand all things necessary for our health, that we ought to hope in him,
also the commandments of the law, and of the holy Church, which ensygneth
us what we should do, and what we should not do, and all things belonging to
the same. Also if we be in the grace of our Lord or not. And howe be if that
we may not know it certainly, nevertheless we may have some conjectures,
which be good to know, and knoweledge of God. Also knoweledge of him self,
by the which things we may come to the true love and charity of God, to
accomplish his commandments and meryte in the realm of heaven, wherein we
shall live perdurably. Of the three first is enough said, that is to know,
the.xii. articles of the faith, in the which lies our faith and belief, and
the things that we ought to demand of God, be conteyued in the Pater
noster, wherein our hope lies. Also the ten commandments of the law, and
of holy Church, where as Charity is showed in such as keep them, by
probacyon of the love of God, and do his commandments and good works. Now
will we speak of the other.iiii. And first of the vocation in the which we
be, which is the fourth thing that each man ought to know. Each man ought
to know his vocation, and the things belonging to the same be just and
honest for his health and rest of his conscience. A good Shepeherde ought to
know the art of sheep keeping, and to govern sheep, and lead them into
pastures, and to heal them when they be sick, and shere them in season, to
the intent that through his defaute no damage come to his master. In likewise
he that labours the corn, to know what ground were good for every manner
of grain, and ought to till the earth, and when time is to sow, weed, repe,
and thresh, so that his master may have no damage by him. Semblably a
Surgyon ought to know howe to comfort and heal such folks, that he hath
charge of, without bydinge of his art or Surgery. Consequently a merchant
ought to know the utterance of his marchaundyse to other, with no more fraud
then he would him self should have. Also an Advocate or a Proctor ought to
know the ryghtes and customs of places, that by their fault Justice be not
perverted. A Judge also ought to know (both the parties heard) who hath
right and who hath wrong, and judge egally after true Justice. Also a Priest
or a relygious man ought to know their orders and keep them, and above all
thing ought to know that law of God, and teach them unto the ignorant. And
thus of all other vocations. For all them that know not their vocation be not
worthy to be, and live in peril of their sowles for their ignorance The fifth
that all men ought to know, is it he have discretion and understanding, to
know if he be in the grace of God or not. And howe be it right difficile, for
God only knows it, nevertheless we may have conjectures that shows it,
and sufficient for Shepherds and lay people to know, if they be in the love of
the Lord, and if they have conjecture to be in it, therefore there ought none to
repute themselves just, but ought t^ humble them selves, and ask him mercy that
makes sinners become just and none other. Principally we ought to know this
science when we will receive the body of Iesu Christ. For who that receives
his grace and goodness receaueth his salvation, and who that receaueth him
otherwise, receaueth everlasting dampnation, of the which thing every man
is judge in him self of his own conscience, and none other. The conjectures
whereby we may know if that we be in the grace of God or not. The first
conjecture is when we do travel for to cleanse our conscience of our souls by
penance as much as if we laboured to get some great good, that we be not
culpable of any deadly sin done, or in will to do, nor in any sentence, then
it is good coniecturinge to be in the grace of God. The second conjecture that
shows in likewise to be in the grace of God, is when we be more prompt and
ready to good, obseruinge and keeping the commandments of God, and do all
good works that we should have accustomed. The third conjecture is when we
hear gladly the word of God, as sermons and good counsaylers for our
salvation. The fourth, when we be sorry and contrite at our hart to have
commysed and done any sin. The fifth is when with good purpose and will of
our selves we persevere to keep us from sin in time to come. These conjectures
be they whereby Shepherds and lay people know if they be in his grace or not, as
much as in them is possible to know. The.vi. thing that every man ought to
know is God, for all men ought to know God, for to accomplish his will and
commandment, by the which he would be loved with all thy heart, with all thy
soul, and with all the force that we have, which we may not do, if we know
him not, then who that would love God, ought to know him, and the more that
they know him, the more they love him, wherefore hereafter shall be said howe
Shepherds and simple people doth know him. Shepherds and simple people for to
have knowledge of God of their possibility consyderinge three things. The
first is, that they consider the right great riches of God, his puissance,
his soueraygne dignity, his soueraygne noblesse, his soueraygne joy and
bliss. The second is for they consider the right noble, right gre^t and
marvelous operations and works of our Lord God. And the third consideration
is, for they consider the innumerable benefits that they have received of God,
and that continually every day they receive of him, and by these considerations
they come to his cognysance and knowledge. First to know God, Shepherds and
lay people consydereth his great riches, plenteous habundaunce of the goodness
that he hath, for all the treasures and rychesse of heaven and of the earth be
his, and all goodness he hath made, of the which he is fountain, creator,
and master, and distributes them largely unto every creature, and he hath no
need of any other. Wherefore it behooves to say that he is right rich.
Secondly he is right puissant, for by his great puissance he hath made
heaven, earth, and the sea, with all things containing unto them, and might
undo them if that it were his will, unto the which puissance all other be
subject, and trembles before him for his great excellency. And who that would
consider every work of God should find enough to marvel on. By the first of
these considerations God is known to be right rich, by gifts that he gives
to his friends, and by the second he is known right puissant for to avenge
him on his enemies. Thirdly he is sovereignly worthy, for all the things of
heaven and of earth owes him honour and reverence, as to their Creator and
him that made them, as we se children honour father and mother of whom they be
descend by a generation, and all things be descend of God by a creation,
to whom ought to be given great reverence, and he is so worthy. Fourthly he is
sovereignly noble, for who that is sovereignly rich, puissant, and worthy,
him behooves to be sovereignly noble, but none other but God hath riches,
puissance, and dignity, as he hath, wherefore of such nobles ought to be
said that he is right noble. Fifthly he hath sovereign joy, for he that is
rich, puissant, worthy and right noble, is not without sovereign joy, and
this joy is full of all goodness, and ought to be our felicity, to the which
we hope to come. That is to know and see God in his sovereign joy and
gladness, for to have with him eternal joy that ever shall dure. And this is the
first consideration of God that Shepherds and other simple people ought to
have. Secondly for to know God considering his great noblesse and marvelous
works the bounty and the beauty of the things that he hath made, for it is
commonly said. One may know the workman by his work. Knowledge we then the
work of God, and knowledge we that his beauty and bounty shines in the
operations that he hath made, which if they be fair and good, the workman that
hath made them must needs be fair and good without comparison more then any
thing that he hath made. Be it considered of the heavens and the things
therein set, what noble and marvelous work, howe may one consider their
excellence and bounty. Be it considered also as we may of the earth the right
noble and marvelous works of God, the gold, the silver, and all manner of
metalles, and precious stones in it, the fruits that it bears, the trees,
the beasts that it susteyneth, and of the bounty that it nourishes. Be it in
likewise considered of the Sea, the rivers, and the fish nourished in them.
The whether, the elements, the air, the winds, and the Birds that flies in
them, and all the usage and service of man. And consider the workman that of
his puissance hath all made, and by his sapience hath right well ordered his
works, and governs them by his great bounty, and by this manner we may know
God, as Shepeherdes and simple folks in considering his works. Thirdely for
to know God, consider the great benefits that we receive daily of him, which
may not be numbered for their great multitude, nor spoken of for their
nobleness and dignity. Al be it in their hearts be vi. principally noted. For
the which an other Shepeherde geniuge praising to God, said in this manner.
Lord God I know that thou haste endued me with thy infinite benefits by thy
great bounty. First the benefit of my creation, by the which thou made me a
reasonable man unto thy Image and similitude, geuynge me body and soul, and
raiment for to clothe me. Lord thou haste given me my wits of nature,
understanding for to govern my life, my health^ my beauty, my strength, and
my science for to get my living honestly, I yield to thee graces and great
thanks. Secondely Lord I know the goodness of my redemption, how by thy
misericordious pity, thou bought me dearly by the affection of thy most
precious blood, peynes, and torments, that for me thou hast suffered, and
finally endured death, thou hast given me thy body, thy soul, and thy life,
for to keep me from dampnation, wherefore humbly I yield to thee graces and
great thanks. Thirdely Lord I know the goodness of my vocation, how of thy
great grace thou hast called me again, for to enheryte thy eternal
benediction, and also thou haste given unto me faith and knowledge of thine
own self, as baptism, and all the other sacramentes, that none entendement
may comprise their noblesse, and dignity, and that so many times hath pardoned
me of my sins. Lord I know that this is to me a singular gift that thou
hast not given to them which have no knowledge of thee, whereof I am more
beholding and humbly bound, I yield thee graces and thanks. Fourthly Lord I
knowledge that thou hast given me this world and the things that be therein made
for my service and use, the office, the benefit, and the dignity in the which
I am, for sir I bear your similitude and Image which is reputed right worthy
and noble whereof humbly I yield to thee graces and thanks. Fyfthly Lord thou
hast given me the Sky and his fair ornaments, the Sun, the Moon, and the
Sterres, that the day and night serves me, geuinge brightness and light
without to be recompensed of me, whereof I yield to thee graces and thanks.
Syxtly Lord I knowledge that thou hast made Paradyse ready for to give me,
where I shall live with thee in joys without end, if I do thy will, and keep
thy commandments, and also I knowledge thy other infynite goodness each day
to me done by thy bounty, the which ensigneth me to know my God, my Saviour,
and Redemer, wherefore I humbly give thanks to thee. By these considerations
Shepherds and simple people contempleth the bounty of God, and the benefytes
that they receive of him. And know we him, and be we not in great knowledge of
his benefytes in yeldinge thanks and praysynges to him, and recompense of your
goods in geuinge to poor folks for his sake, for Ingratitude is a villain
sin that much displeases God. The.vii. and the last thing that each man
ought to know, that is to know him self, for it is the best mean for to
come unto the knoweledge of God, and for to make his salvation, so to know him
self first. Diverse folk know many things that know not them self, to whom
should profit more to know them self, then all things in the world. They that
know the things of the world loves them, seeks them, and kepeth them, and
k^owe not, no love not, no praise not, no kepeth not God in likewise, for they
know him not. What profits man to win al the world, leases himself for to
be damned? Better it were for him to leese all the world, if it were his, if
he knew him self to be saved. Shepeherdes say that the needful beginning of
his salvation is to know himself, and contrariwise ignorance of him self is
the beginning of dampnation, and of all evil that may befall unto him.

A question of a master Shepherd to a simple Shepherd to wet how he knew
him self and he said. Shepherd tell me howe thou know thy self what art
thou, answer to me? And he said, I know my self, for I am a Christian man
a Shepherd. What is to be a Shepherd. And he answered unto that, thou ask
what man is. I say that man is a substance composed of body and soul. The
body is mortal and made of earth as beasts be, but the soul is made of
spiritual matter as Angels be immortal. My body is come of abominable
sin, and as a sack full of durte and filth, and meat for worms, my
beginning was vile, my life is payne, labour, fear, and in subjection to
death, and my end shall be woeful, but my soul is created of god nobly and
worthily to his own Image and semblance after the Angels, the most fairest
and perfyte of all creatures, by baptism and by faith is made his daughter,
his spouse, his heir of his realm, that is Paradyse, for her nobleness and
dignity ought to be a Lady, and my body as servant ought to obey her, for
reason hath ordained and will that it be so: and who that doth otherwise, and
prefers his body before his soul, ^eseth the usage of reason: and makes
him self semblable unto beastes^ discendinge from noble dignity into
miserable servitude of sensuality, by the which it is governed, so that I
know my self man. As to the second, he demands what thing it is to be a
Christian man? I answer in mine understanding, that to be a Christian man,
is to be baptised or Christened, and follow Iesus Christ, of whom we be said
Christians, for to be baptised and not to follow him, or to follow him and not
to be baptised, saves not man, and therefore when we receive baptism, we
renounce the devil and all his pomps, and we make promise for to follow Iesu
Christ, when we say (we will be baptised.) And who that kepeth this promise
hath the very name of a Christian man. And who that kepeth it not, is a sinner
and a liar to God, and servant to the devil, and is no more Christen then a
dead man, or a payntynge on a wall, we say that is a man. Here demands the
master Shep^herde in howe many things the Christian man ought to follow
Iesus Christ, for to accomplish the promise of Baptism. The simple Shepherd
answers: I say in.vi. things. The first is cleanesse of conscience, for
there is no thing more pleasant to God then a clean conscience, and it will
be made clean in two manners, one is by baptism when we receive it, and the
other by patience, that is contricion of heart, confession of mouth,
satisfaction of work, and then when we be clean we be pleasant to Iesu
Christ, which with the water of his mercy cleanses the sinners that doth
penance, and makes them fair. The second thing in which we ought to
follow Iesu Christ, is humility, at the example of him. Lord of all the
world, which humbled him to take our humanity, and became mortal that was
immortal, live in poverty with us, ^eate oppropried pains, and finally
suffer to be crucified. Thus the Christian man ensuing him ought to meek him
self. The third thing is to hold and love truth, and specially three
truths. The first truth is to know our self, for we be mortal and
sinful, and who that dies in sin shall be damned, this truth witholdeth
sin, and exhorts the sinner to do penance and amend. The second truth
is of temporal goods, for they be transitory and must be left and this truth
disprayseth them to desire the heavenly goods that be eternal. The third
truth is of God, which is the joy that all Christian men ought to desire, and
this truth draws the Christian man to love and induseth him to do good works
for to meryte the joys of Paradyse. The fourth thing wherein every man ought
to follow Iesu Christ, is pacyence in adversity, and in the spirit of life
by penance, confirminge of our selfes in the state of Iesu Christ, of whom
the life was all in pain and poverty which he endured for us. The fifth is in
compassion of the poor, to the example of Iesu Christ, that by his mercy
healed the poor of all corporal infirmities, and the sinners of all ghostly
sickness, and we by compassion ought to give of our goods to poor folk, and
comfort them bodily and ghostly. The syxth thing wherein the Christian man
ought to follow Iesu Christ, is dolor, devotion, charity, in contemplation
of the mysteries of his nativity, of his death and passion, of his
resurrection, of his ascension, and of his aduaunsing to the judgement, that
often times ought to be at our heart by holy medytacions. And as to the last,
what thing a Shepherd is. I say that it is the knowledge of my vocation, as
each hath his, as before is said, and also to know the transgressions of all
these foresaid things, howe many times in each we have transgressed, for
many times we have offended God, and who that takes heed shall ^inde omissions
and offences without number, the which known, we ought to doubt and eschew,
and do penance. And thus it is as I know man is Christen and Shepherd.

The ballade of a wise man. Capitulo.xv.

I know that God hath turned me
And made me to his own likeness
I know that he hath given to me truly
Soul and body, wit and knowledge ywysse
I know that by ryghtwise true balance
After my deeds judged shall I be
I know much, but I wot not the variance
To understand whereof comes my folly.

I know full well that I shall dye
And yet my life amend not I
I know in what poverty
Borne a child this earth above
I know that God hath lent to me
Abundance of goods to my behove
I know that riches can me not save
And with me I shall bear none away
I know the more good that I ha^
The loather I shall be to dye
I know all this faithfully
And yet my life amend not I
I know that I have passed
Great part of my days with joy and pleasan^e
I know that I have gathered
Sins, and also do little penance
I know that by ignorance
To excuse me there is no art
I know that one shall be
When my soul shall depart
That I shall wish that I had mended me
I know there is no remedy
And therefore my ly^e amend will I.
Here follows the ballade of the woman Shepherd, the which ballade is very
necessary and profitable to loke upon. Capitulo.xvi.

IN considering my pore humanity
Above the earth borne with great weeping
I consider my fragility
My har^e is over pressed with sinning
I consider death will come verily
To take my life, but the hour wot not I
I consider the devil doth watch me
The world and the flesh on me watreth straightly
I consider that mine enemies they be three
That would deliver me from death to death
I consider the many tribulations
Of this world, whereof the life is not clean

I consider an hundred thousand passions
That we pore creatures daily fall in
I consider the longer I live the worse I am
Wherefore my conscience cries out on me
I consider for sin some be damned as the book saith
Which shall ever be delivered from death to death
I consider that worms shall eat me
My sorrowful body, this is credible
I consider that sinners shall be
At the judgment of God most dreadable:
O Iesu Christ above all thing most delectable
Have mercy on me at the dreadful day
That shall be so marvelous and doughtable
Which my poor soul greatly doth fray
In you that I put my trust and faith
To save me that I go not from death to death
The songe of death to all Christen people. Cap. xvii.

Take in worth, for surely in substance
The sight of it may to you be profitable
There is no way also more doughtable
Therefore learn, know your self and see
Loke how I am and thus shall you be
And take heed of thy self, in adventure rede I
For Adams apple we must all dye
Alas worldly people behold my manner
Sometime I lived with beauteous visage
Mine even be gone I have two holes here
I am meat for worms in this passage
Take heed of wealth while ye have the usage
For as I am thou shalt come to dust
Holed as a thimble, what shall thee advance
Nought but good deeds, thou may me trust
All with my likeness ye must all dance
The time that I was in this world living
I was honoured with lowe and hye
But I kept not my conscience clean from sinning
Therefore now I do it dear aby
Lo what avails couetise, pride and envy
They be the brands that doth brenne in hell
Trust not to your friends when ye be dead rede I
Nor your executors, for few doth well
But do for thy self or ever thou dye
And remember while thou art living
That God blessed all thing without nay
Except sin, as records writing
The devil can not claim thee but by sin I say
Amend therefore betyme, and go the right way
I would that I might have but one hour or two
To do penance in, or half a day
But while I lived I did none do
But now my dettes I do truly paye
Thou man I do give better counsel to thee
If that thou wilt do after it
Then ever any that was showed te me
Thou art half warned, think on thy pit
And chose of two ways which thou wilt flit
To joy or payne one of the two
In wealth or wo for ever to sit
Now at thine own choice thou may go
For God hath given thee free will
Now chose thee whether thou wilt do good or ill.
Here after follows the.x. commandments of the devil.

WHo so will do my commandments
And keep them well and sure
Shall have in hell great torments
That evermore shall endure.
Thou shalt not fear God nor think of his goodness
To dampne thy soul blaspheme God and his saints
Evermore thine own will be fast doing
Deceive men and women, and ever be swearing
Be drunken hardly upon the holy day
And cause other to sin if thou may
Father nor mother loke thou love nor dread
Nor help them never, though they have need
Hate thy neighbour, and hurt him by envy
Murder and shed mans blood hardly
Forgive no man but be all vengeable
Be lecherous in dede and in touching delectable
Break thy wedlock and spare not
And to deceive other by falsehode care not
The goods of other thou shalt hold fal^ly
And yield it no more though they speak curtesly
Company often with women, and tempte them to sin
Desire thy neighbours wife, and his goods to be thine
Do thus hardly and care not therefore
And thou shalt dwell with me in hell evermore
Thou shalt lye in frost and fire, with sickness and hunger
And in a thousand pieces thou shalt be torn a sunder
yet thou shalt dye ever and never be dead
Thy meat shall be toads, and thy drink boiling lead
Take no thought for the blud that God for thee shed
And to my kingdom thou shalt be straight led.

Here follows the reward of them that kepeth these commandments aforesaid.

IN hell is great mourning
Great trouble of crying
Or thunder and noises roaring
With great plenty of wild fire
Beating with great strokes like gunnes
With great frost and water running
And after that a bitter wind comes
Which goes through the souls with ire
There is both thirst and hunger
Fiends with hooks pulls their flesh
They fight and curse, and each other redemes
With the sight of the devils dreadable
There is shame and confusion
Rumour of conscience for evil living
They curse them selves with great crying
In stink and smoke evermore lying
With other great pains innumerable.
Man loke that thou beware.
I do smite all at vnware.
It is written in the Apocalips that Saint Iohn saw an horse of a pale
colour, on the which horse sat death, and a Hell folowinge the horse. The
horse sygnifieth the sinner that hath a pale colour, for the infirmity of
sin, and bears death, for sin is death to the soul, and hell follows
for to englut and swalowe him if he die impenitent. Capitulo.xix.
Above this horse black and hideous
Death I am that fircely doth sit
There is no fairness but sight tedious
All gay colours I do hit
My horse runs by dales and hills
And many he smyteth dead and kills

In my trap I take some by every way
By towns and castles I take my rent
I will not respite one an hour of a day
Before me they must needs be present
I ^lea all with my mortal knife
And of duty I take the life
Hell knows well my killing
I sleep never but wake and warke
It follows me ever running
With my dart I slay weak and stark
A great number it hath of me
Paradyse hath not the fourth part
Scant the tenth part wrong hath he
I cause many to sigh at the heart
Beware for I give no warning
Come at once when I do knock or cal
For if thy book be not sure of reconing
Thou shalt to hell body soul and all.
Hereafter follows how every estate should order them in their degree.

O ye Judges governing the law
Let not your hands be anointed with mede
Save all true men, rebels hang and draw
To avoid favour, let righteousness proceed
For a good name is better then riches in dede

And therefore love and charity is out of town.

Swear none oaths, people to beguile
All sleyght and usury from you exile.

O ye masters and householders all

Servants wages pay ye well and even
If ye do not, it cries vengeance to heaven
Of all women.
O ye women, of each manner degree
To your husbands, be never disobedient
Desire not above them the soueraignetie
For then ye do as Lucifer did incontinent
That would be above the hie God omnipotent
Shamefastness, dread, clennesse and chastity
Of very right all these in womanhed should be.
The generality.
Go home ye persons and couch not in court
Go teach Christ's servants keep thy own labour
Thou nigarde sow out thy horde
In household, and be none extorcioner
Monk pray, preach friar, merchant go ne'er far
Dread God, keep his law, and honour your king
And your reward shall ye have at your ending.

Howe Shepardes by calculation and speculation know the.xii. signs in their
course reygning and domining on the.xii. parts of mans body, and which be good
for letting of blud, and which be indifferent or evil for the same.
Capitulo.xxii.


SOme Shipardes say that a man is a little world by him self, for the
lykenesses and similytudes that he hath of the great world, which is the
aggregation of the nyne skies, four elements^ and all things in them
contained. First a man hath such a likeness in the first mobile, that is the
sovereign sky, and principal parts of the great world. For like as in his
first mobyle the zodiake is divided in.xii. parts by the.xii. signs, so man is
divided in.xii. parts holds of the signs, every part of his sign as this
figure shows. The signs be these. Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Uirgo,
Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces. Of the which,
three be of the nature of the fire, that is Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. And
three of the nature of the air. Gemini, Libra, and Aquari^s. And three of the

the knees to the heals and ankles. And Pisces hath the feet in his dominion.

A man ought not to make incision, no touch with iron the member governed of
any sign the day that the Moon is in it, for fear of the great effusion of
blud that might happen, no in likewyse also when the Sun is in it, for the
danger and peril that might ensue.

A picture of the Physiognomy of mans body, and shows in what parts the.vii.
planets hath domination in man. Cap. xxxiiii.
We may know by this figure the bones and joints of all the parties of the body
as well within as without, of the head neck, shoulders, arms, hands, sides,
breast, back, haunches, thighs, knees, legs, and of the feet. The which
bones shall be named and numbered hereafter, and it is called the figure Anothomy.



By this figure one may understand the parties of mans body, over the which the
planets hath might and domination. to keep them from touching any Iron, no to
make incision of blood in the veins that proceed in the time while that the
planet of the said party is conjoined with any other planet maneuolent
without having regard of some good planette, that might encombre and let his
evil course.

The names of the bones in a mans body, and the number of them, which is mall

FIrst on the sommet of the head is a bone that covers the brain, the which
Shepards call the capital bone. In the skull be two bones which be called
paryetailes, that holds the brain close and steadfast. Mo^e lower in the
brain is a done called the crown of the head, and on the one side and on the
other be two holes, within the which is the palys or ro^e bone. In the part
behind the head be four like bones, to the which the chyne of the neck
holds. The bones of the nose be two. The bones of the chaftes above be xi.
And of the nether iaw be two. Above the opposyte of the brain there is one
behind named collateral. The bones of the teeth be.xxx. Eight before, four
above and four vnderneth sharpe and trenching for to cut the morsels, and
there are four sharpe, two above and two vnderneth, and be called co^ynes, for
they resemble co^ies teeth. After that be.xvi. that be as they were hammers or
grinding teeth, for they chaw and grind the meat the which is eaten, and there
is on every side four above and four vnderneth, and then the four teeth of
sapyence on each side of the chaftes one above and one vnderneth. In the chyne
from the head downward be.xxx. bones called knots or joints. In the breast
before be seven bones, and on every side.xii. ribs. By the neck between the
head and the shoulders be two bones named the sheres. After be the two
shoulder blades. From the shoulders to the elbow in each arm is a bone called
the adiutor. Fro the elbow to the hand on each arm be two bones that be
called cannes. In each hand be.viii. bones, above the palm be four bones
which be called the comb of the hand. The bones in the fingers in each hand
be.xv. in every finger three. At the end of the ridge be the ho^le bones,
whereto be fastened the two bones of the thighs. In each knee is a bone called
the knee plate. From the knee to the foot in each leg be two bones, called
cannes or marow bones. In each foot is a bone called the ankle or pin^ of the
foot, behind that ankle is the heel bone in each foot, the which is the lowest
part of a man, and above each foot is a bone called the hollow bone. In the
plant of each foot be.iiii. bones. Then be the combs of the feet, in each of
which be.v. bones. The bones in the toes in each foot be the number of.xiiii.
Two bones be tofore the belly for to hold it steadfast with the two branches.
Two bones be in the head behind the ears called Oculares. We reckon not the
tender bones of the end of the shoulders, nor of the sides, nor diverse little
grystles and spelders of bones, for they be comprehended in the number
abouesayde.

Thus ends the Notomy, and follows the Flubotomy.
Hereafter follows the names of the veins, and where they rest, and how they
ought to be letten blood.


WE man understand by this figure the number of the veins and the places of a
mans ^ody where they ^en, and how they ought to be letten blud, and no where
else so that it be a nutural day for blud letting, that the Moan be not new, no
at the full, no in quarter, and that it be in any sign before named good for
bleeding, but if that such sign were it that domineth the member of the which
blud should be letten, for then it ought not for to be touched, no also that it
be the sign of the sun.

The names of the places where the veins be, are showed by the letters set in
the margent at the beginning of the matter after the form of the picture.
A The vein in the midst of the forehed would be letten blud for the ache and
peyne of the head, and for fevers lytargy, and for the megryme. B Above the two
ears behind is two veins, the which be letten blood for to give clear
understanding, and the virtue of light hearing, and for thick breath, and for
doubt of meselry. C In the temples bin two veins called the Artires, for that
they pant, the which ben letten blood for to diminyshe and take away the
great replection and habundaunce of blood that is in the brain, that might
noye the head and the even, and it is good against the gout, megryme, and
divers other accidents that may come to the head. D Under the tongue bin two
veins that ben letten blood for a syckenesse named the Sequamy, and against
the swelling and apostumes of the throat, and against the Equinauncy, by the
which a man might dye suddenly for defaute of such bleeding. E In the neck bin
two veins called Orygynalles, for that they have the course and habundaunce of
all the blud that governs the body of man, and principally the head, but they
ought not to be letten blud without the counsel of the surgyon, and this
bleedynge avails much to the syckenesse of Lepry, when it comes principally
of blood. F The vein of the hart taken in the arm, profits to take away
humours or ill blud that might hurt the chamber of the heart or the
appurtenance, and it is good for them that spits bind, and that be short
winded, by the which a man may die suddenly by defaute of such bleeding. G The
vein of the liver taken in the arm, takes deminys^eth the great heate of the
body of man, and holds the body in health, and this bleedinge is profitable
against the yelowe axes and apostume of the liver, and against the plurisy,
whereby a man may die by defaute of such bleeding. H Between the master finger
and the leche to let blud, helps the dolours that comes in the stomach and
sides, as botches and apostumes and diverse other accidents that may come in
those places by great habundance of blud and humours. I In the sides between
the womb and the branch be two veynes^ of the which that of the right side is
letten blud for dropsy, that of the left side for every sickness that comes
about the milte, and they should blede after that persons be fat or lean, take
good heed at four fyngers ny the incysyon, and also they not to make such
bleeding without counsel of the surgeon. K In every foot ben three veins, of
the which three veins, one is under the ankle of the foot named Sophane, the
which is letten blood for to deminish and put out diverse humours, as botches
and apostumes that comes about the grains, and it profyteth much to women
for to cause their menstruositie to dyscende, and to fyxe the emoroydes, that
comes in the secrete places, and such other like. L Between the wrest of the
foot and the great too is a vain, the which is letten blood for divers
syckenesses and inconuenyences, as the pestylence, that takes a person
suddenly by the great superhaboundance of humours, and this bleeding must be
made within a natural day, that is to wit, within xxiiii. hours after that the
sickness is taken of the patient, and before the Fever come on him, and this
bleding ought to be done after the corpolence of the patient. M In the angles
of the even be two veins, the which be let blood for the redness of the
even, or water that runs continually, and for divers other sicknesses that
may happen and come by over great habundance of humours and blood. N In the
vein of the end of the nose is made a bleding, the which is good for a red
pimpeled face, as be red drops, pustules, small skabbes, and other infections
of the hart that may come therein by the great replection and habundance of
blood and humours, and it avails against popeled noses and other semblable
sickness. O In the mouth in the gummes be four veins, that is to wit, two
above and two beneath, the which be let b^udde for the chafing and canker in
the mouth, and for tooth ache. P Between the lip and the chynne is a vein
that is letten blud to give amendment to them that have an evil breast. Q In
each arm be four veins, of the which the vein of the head is the highest,
the second next is from the hart, the third is of the liver, the fourth is
from the mylte, otherwise called the low liver vein. R The vein of the head
taken in the arm, ought to bleed for to take away the great replection and
habundance of blud that may annoy the head, the eien or the brain, and avails
greatly for transmutable heates, and swellings of the throat, and to them that
hath swollen faces and red, and to divers other sicknesses that may fall by to
great habundance of blud. S The vein of the mylte, otherwise called the lowe
vein, should bleed against all fever tercians, and quarteynes, and it ought
to be made a large and less deep wound then in any other vein, for fear of
wind that it may gather, and for more inconvenience, for fear of a synewe
that is under it, that is called the Lezarde. T In each hand be three veins
whereof that above the tomb ought to blede to take away the great heat of the
visage, and for the thick blud and humours that be in the head, this vein
euacueth more then that of the arm. U Between the little finger and the leche
finger is lettinge of blood that avails greatly against all fever tercians
quartaines, against flumes, and divers other lettings that comes to the
paps and to the mylte. x In each thigh is a vein, of the which the bleeding
avails against the dolours and swellings of the genitours, and for to avoid
and drive out of a mans body humours that be in the grains. y The vein that
is under the ankle of the foot without, named Sciat, of the which the bleeding
is much worth against the pains of the haunches, and for to make depart and
issue diverse humours, which would assemble in the said place^ and avails
greatly to women for to restrain their menstruosity when they have to great
habundance.
Thus ends the Anatomy and Flubothomy of the humayne bodies, and howe one
should understand them.
HEre before we have said of the regard of planets upon the parties of man,
and the division and number of the bones of man body, and now follows to
know when any man is hole or sick, or disposed in any wise to sickness.
Wherefore three things ben, by the which Shepardes know when a man is hole or
sick, or disposed to sickness. If he be hole to maintain and keep him, if he
be sick, to search remedy to heal him. If he be disposed to sickness to keep
him that he fall not therein. And for to know each of the said three things,
the Shepards put diverse signs. Health properly temperance, accorde, and
equality of the iiii. equalities of man, which be hot, cold, dry, and moyste.
The which when they be well tempered and equal, that one surmoun^e not the
other, then the body of man is hole. But when they be unequal and mistempred,
that one domineth over another, then a man is sick or disposed to sickness, and
they be the qualities that the bodies boldeth of the elements, that they be
made composed of, that is to wit of the fire heate, of the water cold, of the
air moist, and of the earth dry. The which qualities, when one is disordered
from the other, then the body is sick. And if that one destroy the other of
all, then the body dies, and the soul departs.

Signs by the which Shepards know a man hole and well disposed in his body.
Capitulo.xxv.
THe first sign whereby Shepardes know a man to be hole and well disposed in
his body, is when he eats and drinks well after the conuenaunce of the
hunger and thirst that he hath without making excess. Also when he digests
lightly, and when that that he hath eaten and drunken empesheth and grieves not
his stomach. Also when he feleth good savour and appetite in that he eats and
drinks. Also when he is hungry and thirsty at the hours that he ought to
eat and drink. Also when he rejoices him with merry folk. Also when they
play gladly any play of recreation with fellows of merry courage. Also when he
plays gladly in fields and woods to take the sweet air, and sporte in
meadows by water sides. Also when he eats gladly with good appetite, of
butter, cheese, flawnes, sheep mylte, without leaving any thing in his dyshe
to send to the alms house. And when he sleeps well without rauynge,
dreaming of his marchandyse. Also when he feleth him light, and that he walk
well. Also when he sweateth soon, and that neseth little or nothing. Also when
he is neither to fat no to lean. Also when he hath good colour in his face,
and that his wits ben all well disposed for to do their operation, as his
even for to see, his ears to hear, his nose to smell^ c. And thus we leave of
the conuenance of age, the disposition of the body, and also of the time. (...)
other signs I say nothing, but these be the most common, and that ought to
suffice for shepardes to know the signs of health.

Signs opposyte to the precedentes, by the which Shepardes know when they or
other ben sick.
FIrst when he may not well eat no drink, or that they have none appetite to
eat at dinner supper, or when he finds no savour in that he eats or
drinks, or that he is hungry and may not eat, when his digestion is not
good, or that it be to lunge. Also when h^ goes not to chamber moderately as
he ought to do. Also when he is heavy and sad in joyous companies, then
syckenesse constreyneth a man to be thoughtful. Semblably when he may not
sleep or take his rest aright and at due hour. Also when his members ben
heavy, as his head, his legs, and his arms. And also when he may not walk
easily and lightly, and that he shows not often, and his colour is pale or
yelowe, or when his wits, as his even, his ears, the other do not kindly
their operations. In likewise when he may not labour and travel. Also when he
forgets lightly that which of necessity ought to be kept in memory, and
when he spits often, or when his nostrils abounds in superfluous
humours. And when he is negligent in his works, and when his flesh is blown
or swollen in the visage, in his legs, or his sect, or when his even be
holowe in his head. These ben the signs that sygnifyeth a man being in
sickness, and who that hath most of the foresaid signs, most is sick.

Other manner of signs almost semblable to them above said, and shows the
replexion of evil humours for to be purged of them. Cap. xxvi.
REplection of euill^ humours and disposition of syckenesse, after the opinion
of Shepardes, the which replection is to know howe to pourge the said
humours that they engendre no sickness, bin broken by the signs that
follows. First when a man hath over great redness in the face, in the
hands, or in the nails, having also the veins full of blood, or blede to
much at the nose, or to often, or to have peyne in the forheade. Also when the
ears sounds, when the even waters or be full of gum, have the
understanding troubled, when the pou^ beats to fast when the belly i^ lunge
resolute and laxe, and when one hath the sight troubled, and eating also
without appetite. And all the other signs before said bin, by the which one
may know the body evil disposed and have in it corrupt humours, superflous
and evil.

Thus fynysheth of the signs, by the which Shepardes know when they bin whole
and well disposed, and other signs opposyts, by the which they know when
they bin sick or evil disposed.

A division and regyme of time, of the which Shepardes uses after that the
season time requires. Cap xxvii.
FOr to remedy the syckenesses and infirmities that a man hath, to keep him
from the that he doubts to come. Shepardes say that the time naturally
channgeth four times in a yer, so they deuyde the year in four quarters, that
is ver, summer, harvest, winter. And in each of these quarters they govern
them as the seasons requires to their minds, the better it is for them. And
as the ^eason changes, so change they their manner of living doyng, and say
that chaungynge of time without taking good heed, oft engenders infyrmities^
for that in one time behooves not to use some meates that bin good ^n an other
time, as that use in winter is not all good in summer, and so of the other
seasons And for to know the changynge of time after these said parties they
consider the course of the son die the xii. signs, and say that every of the
said.iiii^ quarters and seasons dureth three months, and that the son
passes by three signs. that is to wit, in primetyme by Pisces, Aries, and
Taurus, and these be the months, February, Marche, and April, that the earth
and trees rejoices and charge with grene leues and ^oures, that is a
pleasure to behold. In summer by Gemini, Cacer and Leo, and the months bin
May, June and July, that the fruits of the Earth ^oweth and rypeth. In Harvest
by Uirgo, Libra, and Scorpio, and the ^onethes bin August, September and
October, that the Earth and trees dyschargeth fruits and leaves, and that
time each felleth and gathers the ^ites. In winter by Sagittarius,
Capricornus, and Aquarius, and the mo^ethes bin November, December January,
that the earth and trees ben as dead and vnclo^hed of leues, fruits, and of
all grenesse. After the which ^ure^ seasons Shepardes devises the time that
man may live in four ages, as youth, strength, age, and decrypte, ben likened
to the four seasons of the year. That is to wit, youth to pryme time, that is
hot moist as th^ herbs trees of the earth grows, so doth man in youth unto
xxv. year grow^ of body, in strength, beauty, and vigour. Force is likened
unto summer ho^ and dry, and the body of man is in his force and vigour, and
entrypeth vnto^ xlv. year. Age is compared to the time of harvest, cold and
dry that man le^ueth of growing febleth, and thinks how together and spare
for fear o^ defaute and need whe^ he comes to stopwing age, and dureth
to.lvi. yere^ Decrepyte is likened to the season of winter, cold humyde by
habundanc^ of cold humours and defaute of natural heate, in the which time
man spen^deth that which he had gathered and kept in the time passed, and if he
hau^ spared nothing, he abides poor and naked as the earth and Trees and
du^reth unto.lxii. year or more. Primetyme is hot and moyste, nature of ayre^
and complexion of the sanguyne. Summer is hot and dry, nature of fire, and
complexion of coieryke. Harvest is cold and dry, nature of earth, and
com^plexion of the melancholy. Winter is cold and moyste, nature of water,
com^plexion of the flumatyke: when complexion is well proportioned it feels
i^ self better disposed in the time semblable to it then it doth in other
tymes^ But for that every man is not well complexioned, they ought to do as
Sh^pardes doth, that is to take regyment to keep them self after the seasons,
an^ governs them by their ensygnements and teachings, the which they vse^
every quarter of the year for to live the longer, wyselyer, and merely.

The regyment for primetyme, March, April, and May.
IN primetyme Shepardes keep them selves meetly well clothed, no^ over cold no
over hot, as with lynseywolsy, doublettes of fustian, an^ gowns of a meetely
length furred with lamb most commonly. I^ this time is good letting of blud to
avoid the evil humours that were ga^thered in the body the Winter time. If
syckeuesse happen in prymetyme it i^ not of his nature, but proceeds of the
humours gathered in the winter pas^sed. Prymetyme is a temperate time to take
medicines for them that b^ corporate and full of thycke humours, to purge them.
In this time the^ ought for to eat light meates that refreshes, as chekyns,
kyddes with ve^gyous, borage, beetes, yolks of eggs, eggs in moneshyne,
roches, perches^ pykerelles, and all scaled fysh. Drink temperate wine, bear
or ale, so that they be not to strong, no ouerswete. For in this time all
sweet things ought not to be used, and a man ought to sleep long in the
morning and not on the daye^ The Shepardes have a general regle or costume for
all seasons, that auai^leth much against all infirmities and sickenesses, that
is, not to less his ap^petite for eating, and never for to eat without hunger.
Also they say that al^ manner of flesh and fyshe is better roasted then sodden,
and if they ben soden t^ broil them on a gredyron, or on the coals, and they
bin the more holsommer.

The regement for the time of summer. June, July, and August.
THe Shepardes in somer bin clothed with lyghte gowns, single, their shyrtes
sheets that they lye in bin lynnen, for of al clothes it is the coldest, thy
have dowblettes of sylke, of sey, or of canvas mannerly made, and they eat
light meates, as chekyns with vergyous, yonge harts, rabette, lectuse,
purcelayne, melons, gourdes, cocumbres, peers, plommes, such fyshe as are
named before. And also they eat of meates that refreshes. Also they eat
little and often, they break their fast or dine in the morning or ever the
son arise, and go to supper or it discende, they eat often of the above
said meates and sourer for to give them an appetite. They eat but little
salt meates, and refrain them from scratching, they drink oft fresh water
sodden with sugercandy, and other refreshinge waters, and they do it always
when they bin thyrsly, save only at dinner and supper time, and then they
drink feeble grene ^yne, or single bear, or small ale. Also they keep them
from over great travel, or over forsing them solfe, for in this time is
nothing more grievous then chafynge. In this season they eschew the company of
women, and they bathe them oft in cold water to assuage the heate of their
bodies enforced by labours. Always they have with them sugerca^dy or other
sugar, and dredge, whereof they take little and often, and each day in the
morning they force them bi coughinge and spittinge, to void fleumes, and
void them above and below the best that they may, and wash their hands
with fresh water, their mouth and visage.

The regement for harvest, September, October, and November.
IN harvest Shepardes bin clothed after the manner of Prymetyme save their
clothes bin a little warmer. In this time they do dylygence to purge and cleanse
them, and lettinge them blud to tempre the humours of their bodies. For it is
the most contagyous time of the year, in the which perilous infirmities
happens and commethe, and therefore thee eat good and wholesome meates, as
Caponnes, Hens, yonge Pygeon that begin to fly, and drinks good wynes,
other good drynkes without making excess. In this time they keep them frome
eating of fruits for it is a dangerous season for agnes, they say that he had
never ague that never eat fruit. In this time they drink no water, and they
put no part of them in cold water, but their hands, their face. They keep
their heads fro cold in the night and morning, sleep not in the none time,
keep them from over great traueyle, endure not to much hunger no thyrft, but
eat when it is time, and not when their mawes be full.

The regyment for winter time, December, January, and February.
THe Shepardes in winter bin clothed in thycke gowns of rough clothe hye
shorn, well furred with fox. For it is the wariness furryng that is and
cattes, conyes, lambs, and divers other thycke furs that be good and
wholesome. In the time of winter Shepardes do eat befe, pork and brawn, of
hearts, hinds, and all manner of venyson, pertryches, fesauntes, hares, fowls
of the river, and other meates that they love best. For that is the season of
the year that nature suffers most great plenty of vyttayle for the
natural heate that is drawn within the body. An this time also they drink
oft strong wynes, after their coplexion. bastard wine, or Osey. Two or three
times in the weke they use good spices in their meates. For this is the most
wholesome time of all the year, in the which comes no syckenesse but by great
excess outrages done to nature, or by evil government. Shepardes say also
that prymetyme is hot moist of the nature of air complexion of the sanguine,
that in the same time nature rejoices, the pores opens, the blud spredeth
through the veins more then another time. Summer is hot and dry of the
nature of fire, and complexion of coleryke, in the which time one ought to keep
him from all things that moves to heate, al excess and hot meates. Harvest
is cold and dry of the nature of earth, and complexion of melancholy, in the
which time one ought to keep him from doing excess more then in other times,
for danger of sykenesses, to the which that time is dysposen. But winter is
cold and moist of the nature of water, and complexion of flumatyke, then a man
ought to keep him warm and myanely, for to live in health.

Here it ought to be noted that a man is made and formed of the four
elements, of the which one hath domination always above the other: that ma on
whom the fire domineth is said coleryke, that is to say hot and dry He on
whom the air hath domination is said sanguyne, that is to say hot, and
moist. He on whom the water hath domination is said cold moist, that is to
say flumatike. And he on whom the earth reygneth is said melancolyke, that is
to say, cold and dry. Of the which complexions shall be spoken in the
beginning of the Physonomy more largely.

A regement of Shepardes of certain things good for the body of man, and of
other divers things apposyte to the same Cap. xxviii.

Here after follows the iiii. elements, and the four complexions of man, and
howe and in what time they raygne in man, Cap. xxix.
Air, Fire, Earth and water. The xxiiii. hours of the day the night rules
Sanguine, Colerike, Melancolike, Flumatike. Six hours after midnight blood
hath the maistry, in the vi. hours aforenoone collar reigns, and vi. hours
afternoon reigns melancholy, and vi. hours before midnight reigns the
flumatike.

Thus ends the iiii, elements, and the four complexions of man,
Here follows the governance of health. Ca. xxx.

VUho will be hole keep himself fro sickness
And rysest the stroke of pestylence
Let him be glad, and void all heuynesse
Flee wicked airs, eschew the presence
Of infect places, causynge the violence
Drynkinge good wynes, of holso meatestake
Smell sweet things, and for thy defence
Walk in clean air, and eschew the mystys black.
With void stomacke^ outward the not dress
Rysynge up early, with fire have sustence
Delyte in gardbas, for the great sweetness
To be well clad, do thy deligence
Keep well thy self from inconvenience
In stews no bathes, no seiourne thou make
Opening of the pores, this doth great offence
Walk in clean air, and eschew the mists black.
Eat no raw flesh for no gredynes,
And from fruit keep thine abstynence
Pullettes and chyckyns for their tenderness
Eat thou with sauce, spare for none expense
Uergious, vinegar, and the influence
Of wholesome spicies, I dare undertake
The morrow flepe, called golden in sentence
Great helps against the mists black.
For health of body, cover fro cold they head
Eat no raw meates, take good heed her to.
Drink wholesome wine, fed thee on light bread
With an appetite rise from thy meat also
With women aged, fleshely have not to do
Upon thy sleep drink not of the cup
Glad toward bed, at morrow both two
And use never late for to sup.
And if it so be, that leches to thee fail,
Then take good heed, to use things thre^
Temporate dyete, temporate travail
Not malicyous, for none adversity
Meke in trouble glad in poverty
Rich with little, content with suffysaunce.

Curteyse of language, of fedynge mesurable
On sundry meat, not greedy at the table
In fedynge gentle, prudent in dalyaunce
Close of tongue, of word not deceyuable
To say the best, set always they pleasance.

Have despite of fok that make trouble
Of false rauenoures, and adulation
Within thy place suffer no deuysion
With thy household, it shall cause increase

With thy neighbours, live in rest and peace
Be clenly clad, after thy estaty
Pass not thy bonds, keep thy promise blyue
With three folk be not at debate
First with thy better, beware for to s^ryue
Against thy fellow, no querell to contryue
With thy subject to strive it were shame
Wherefore I council, pursure all thy life
To live in peace, and get thee a good name.

WHo that will as Shepardes that kepeth sheep in the fields without knowing
any letter, save only by some figures that they make in little tables of wodde
have knowledge of the mouynges and proprfeties of the heavens. And divers other
things contained in this present composte and calendar of Shepardes, the
which is extract and composed out of their calendars and put in letter, so
that each may compryse and know as they, the things above said. First one
ought to know what the figure is, the disposition of the world, the nombre
ordre of the elements, and the mouinges of the skies aperteyneth to be known
of every man of free condition and noble engine. For it is a fair thing,
delectable profitable and honest, and therewith it is necessary to have diverse
other knowleges, in especial for the Astrology of Shepardes, which shows
how the world is round as a ball. And after wise men say there is nothing so
round as it. For it is rounder then any thing artyfycyall. And more over in
this world we se nothing no never shall that is so ius^e egally round as it
self is, and is composed of the heaven and the four elements in v. principal
parties. After that a person ought to know that the earth is in the midst of
the world, for it is the heuyest element. Upon the earth is the water or the
sea, but it covers not al the earth, to the end that men and beasts may live
therein, the party that is uncovered is called the face of the earth, for it is
as the face of man always uncovered, and the part that is covered with water
is as the body of man that is clothed hid, On the water is the air that
encloses the earth and the water, and is divided in three regions, one is lowe
where as en habiteth beasts birds, an other mean where as bin the clouds,
the which make the impressions, as lightninghes, thonders, and other, is always
cold, the third is the hyeste, where as is neither wind no rain, nor
tempest, nor other impression, there be some mountains that atteyneth unto it,
as is olimpus that recheth the highest region of the air, and the element of
fire mounts unto the sky, the elements susteyneth the skies as the pyllers
or beams susteyneth a house Of such mountains is one in Affryke named Athlas.
After that is the element of fire that is neither ^ambe no coals, but is pure
invisible. for the great bryghtenes, for of so much as the water is more clear
light then the earth, the air, more clear light then the water, of so much
the fire is more clear, light and fairer then the air, and the skies in
equypo^ent bin clerer, lighter fairer then the fire, the which turns with
the mo^inges of the heavens and the next region of the air also, in the which
is engendered c^n^c^s that bin called sterres for that they bin shyninge moves
as the sterres. After the saying of some shephardes the fire is inuysible for
his subtility and not for his clerenes, for of as much as a thing is more cler
of ^o much it is the more vysible, for we se the skies well, but not the fire,
for it is over much more subtle then the air that is invisible, for the same
cause, the earth and the water bin thycke, and therefore they bin vysyble. The
skies bin neither properley heavy no light, harde no soft, clear no dark,
hot no cold sweet no sour, colour no sown, no such other qualities, save
that they bin hot in virtue, for they may cause heate here de^ethe by their
lights, mouynges and influeuces, bin improprely harde, for they may not be
denyded no broken. And also they bin improprely colours of lyghte in some
parties, and bin thycke, as bin the parties of the sterres. In the which there
may no star no other party be adusted and put to, nor none may be
demynyshed no taken away, and they may neither increase no ware less, or be of
other figure then round, no they may not change, enpayre no wax old, no be
corrumped, no altered, but in light only, as in time of the eclyps of the son
and moon, no they may not rest and stand styll, no turn any otherwise,
later no sooner, in party no in all, no behave them otherwise, then after
their common course^ but by miracle divine, and therefore the sterres and skies
bin of another nature then the elements and the things of them composed, the
which bin transmutable and corruptable. The elements and all things of them
composed bin enclosed within the first sky, as the yolke of an egg is
enclosed within the white, and the first sky is enclosed of the second, and
the second in the third, and the third in the fourth, so of the other. The
first sky next the elements is the sky of the moan next is the sky of
Mercury. And next it the sky of Uenus, then is the sky of the son, then it
of Mars, then that of Iupiter, and after it of Saturne. And thus bin the skies
of the plants after their order. The eight sky is of sterres fixed, and bin
called so for that they move more regulerly and after one guise then the
plants do. Then above that is the first mobyle, in the which noting
apperethe that Shepardes may se. Some Shepardes say that above this ix. skies
is one inmoble, for it turns not, and above that is one of Crystal, over
the which is the sky imperyal, in the which is the throne of God, of the
which sky Shepardes ought not to speak, but only of the first mobyle, and
that it conteyneth all together called the world. Of one thing they marueale
much, that is howe God hath distributed the sterres, that he hath put none in
the nynth sky, and hath put so many in the right sky, that they may not be
nombred, and in each of the other vii. but one only, in calling the son and
the moon sterres, as appears in the figure hereafter.

Here after the great master sheparde shows more plainly of the iiii.
elements, of the symylitude of the earth, and how that every planet is one
above another, and tells which of them bin masculine, as these five, Saturne,
Iupiter, Mars, Sol and Mercury. And of two femynyne, as Uenus and Luna: and
which of them is northly and southly: and which bin Oriental or occydentall.
Capitulo xxxii.
Of the mouynges of the skies and plants.


SOme mouinges bin of the skies and planets that excedeth the understanding of
Shepardes, as the mouynge of the firmamet in the which bin the sterres against
they first mobyle in an hundred year one degree, and the mouynge of the
planets in their episcycles, of the which how well ye Shepardes be not ignorant
of al, yet they make no mention here, so, it suffices them only of two whereof
the one is from. Orient into Occident above the earth, and from occident in
the Orient under it, that is called the dyurnall mouynge, that is to say, that
it makes from day to day, xxiiii. hours by the which mouynge the ix. sky
that is the first mobyle, draws after and makes the other skies to turn
that bin under it. The other mouynge is of the.vii. plants, and is from
Occident to Orient above the earth, and from Orient into the Occident under it,
and is contrary to the first, and bin the two mouynges that Shepardes
knowlegeth, and how well that they bin opposites, yet move they continually and
bin possible as it is showed by example. If a ship on the sea came from Orient
into Occident, and that he of his own moving wet in the ship softly toward
Orient, this man should move a double moving whereof one snuld be of the ship,
and of himself together, and the other should be of his own mouynge that he
makes softly toward Orient. Semblably ye plants bin transported with
their sky from Oryent into Occident by the dyurnall mouynge of the first
mobyle, but later and otherwise then the fixed sterres, by that, that each
planete hath his propre mouinge contrary to the mouynge of the sterrer, for the
moon makes a course less in a month about the earth then a sterre fixed,
and the son a course less in a year, the other plants in certain time
each after the quantity of his moving. Thus it appears that the plants
move two mouynges: some Shepardes say, pose by imagination that all the skies
seassed to move of the daily mouinge, the moon would make a course in going
from the Occidet into the Orient in as much time as lasts now.xxvii. days,
and viii. hours, and Mercury^ Uenus, and Sol would make in manner course in the
space of a year, and Mars in two year or there about, Saturne in xxx year or
there about. For now they make their ^ourse or reuolucions, accomplish their
propre mouynges in the time he^e named. The propre mouynges of Plants is not
straight from Occydence to Orient, but it is as sydewe, and Shepardes se them
sensyble for when they se the moan before a sterre one night, the second or
the third night it is behind not straight toward Orient, but shallbe
drawed one time toward Septemtrion, and another time toward Mydday, and this
is because of the latitude of the zodyake, in the which be the xii. signs
under whom the Plants raygneth.

Of the Equinoctial and zodyake that be in the.ix. skies that contains the
firmament under it Capitulo.xxxiii.
IN the concave of the first mobyle Shepardes imaigneth to be the two cyrcles,
they bin their royally, the on^ is as small as a thread, it is called
Equinoctial, and the other is large in manner of a girdle, or as a garland of
flowers, which they call the zodyake, and these two cyrcles divides the one
and the other egally, but not straight. For the zodyake crosses crokedly, the
places where it crosses bin said Equinoctialles. For to understand the
Equinoctial^ we se sensybly al the sky turn from Orient into Occident, it is
called the daily mouynge or diurnal, the ought one to imagine a straight like
that passes through the middle of the earth, coming from the one end of the
sky to the other, about the which lyne is made this mouynge, the two ends bin
two points in the sky that moves not, and bin called the poles of the
world, of the which one is over us, by the sterre of the north, that always
apereth to us, and is the pole Artike or Septemtrional, and the other is under
the earth, always hyd called the pole Antartike, or pole Austral, in the
midst of the which pole in the first mobile is the circle Equinoctial egally
before in the party, as in the other of the said poles, after this circle is
made and measured the daily moving of xxiiii. hours that is a natural day and
it is called Eqinoctial, for that when the son is in it, the day the night
bin equal through all the world. The large zodyake as said is in the first
mobyle, also it is as a girdle mannerly figured and set with Images of signs
entrayled subtly and well composed, and set with fixed sterres as shining
carbuncle or precious gems full of great virtue, set by maistrysse right
nobly adorned, in the which zodyake be four principal points, that divides
them equally in four parties. One is hye called the solstyce of somer. which
when the son is entered in Cancer, it is the longest day of Summer. Another is
lowe called the solstice of winter, which is when the son is entered in
Capricorne, then it is the shortest day of winter, and mene call it
equinoctial of harvest that the son enters in Libra in the month of
September. And the other is called Equinoctial of prymetime that the son
enters in Aries in the month of March. The which four parties divided each
in three equal parties makes twelve parties, that been called signs, named
Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Uirgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius,
Capricornus, Aquarius and Pisces. Aryes begins in the Equinoctial, and
crosses the zodyake, and when the son is, there it begins to decline,
that is to say, aprochyng Septemtrion, and toward us it extends to the
orient Then is Taurus second, Gemini the third, and so of other as the
figure, hereafter shows. Also every sign is divided in.xxx. degrees, and be
in the zodyake.ccc.lx. degrees, and every degree divided by.lx. mynutes every
mynute in.lx. secondes, every second in.lx. thyrdes, and this division
suffices for Shepardes.

Here follows the story of the twelve signs. Ca. xxxiii.


SHepardes knowelegeth a subtle variation in the sky: and is for three
sterres fy^d be not under the same degrees of the Zodyake that they were
created bi^ouse of the mouinge of the Firmament, the which ben against the
first mobyle in an hundred year of one degree, for the which mutation the son
may have other regard to a ste^re, and other signification then it had in
the time passed, and also when the books were made, for that the sterre hath
hanged his degree or Sign under which it was.

And this often times causes them that make Prognosticatyons and judgements
coming to fail.

All thee cyrcles of the sky bin narrow and small, except the zodyake, which
is large, and conteyneth in length three hundred and three score degrees, and
of largeness twelve, the which largeness is divided by the midst, six degrees
on the one sign and six on the other, and this deuysion is made by a lyne
named eclyptyke and is the way of the son, for the son never departs
under that lyne, thus it is always in the middle of the zodyake, but the other
planets been always on the one side, or of the other of the said lyne save
when they been the ^ade or in the tail of the Dragon, as the moon that
passes twyse in a month, and it happen when it renews it is Eclyps of the
son, and if it happen the full moon, and that it be right under the nadyr of
the son it is general Eclyps, and if it be but a party it is not scene: when
it is Eclyps of the son it is not general through all the clymates but only
in some, ^u when it is eclyps of the Moon it is general over all.

Of two great circles, that is to say one Meridien, and the other Oryson, that
intersequeth the one the other, and crosses dyrectly.
MEridien is a great circle imagined on the sky, which passes by the poles of
the world, and by the point of the sky right over our heads, the which is
called Zenych, and when the son is come over fro Orient unto that circle it
is midday, and therefore it is called Meridien, and the half of that circle is
over the earth and the other under it that passes by the point of midnight
directly opposite to Zenych, and when the son touches the part of the circle
it is midnight, and if a man go toward Orient or Occident he hath new Meridien,
and therefore it is sooner midday to them that be toward Orient then to other,
if a man stand styll his Meridien is one styll, or if he go toward mydday or
septemtrion, but if he stir he hath other Zenych, and these two cyrcles
crosses directly: oryzon is a great circle that divides the party of the
sky that we see from that we se not. And Shepardes say that if that a man were
in a plain country he should se justly half of the sky, the which they cal
their emyspery, that is to say half sphere orizon is joining nyghe to the earth,
of the which orizon the entre is the middle, and is the place in the which we
bin, thus each is always in the midst of his oryson, and zenich is the pole,
as a man transports him fro one place to another, he is in the other places
against the sky hath other zenych other ozyron, all oryson is right other
oblyke. They have right ozyron that habydeth under the Equinoctial, have their
zenych in the eqinoctial, ^or their ozyron intersequeth and deuydeth the
equinoctial even by the two poles of the world, in such wise that none of the
poles of the world is raised above their ozyron, no depriued ynder it, but they
that habiteth other where then under equinoctial have their ozyron oblyke, for
their ozyrn follows and deuydeth the equinoctial sydeway, and not right, and
there appears to the of all times one of the poles of the world raised above
their ozyron, and the other ben ever hyd, so that they se them not, more or
less after diverse habitations, after that they be of fernesse fro the
Equinoctial, the more that the one pole is raised the more is the ozyron
oblyke, and the other pole depryued and is to wet that there is as much
distance fro the ozyron to the pole, as is ^o the zenych to the Equinoctial,
and that zenych is the fourth part of meridien or the midst of the bow
dyurnall, of the which the two ends be on the ozyron. And also that of the
pole unto the equinoctial is the fourth party of all the roundness of the
skies, and also of the meridien circle sith it passes by the poles and
crosses the equinoctial directly. Example of the ozyron of Paris after the
opinion of Shepardes, over the which Ozyron they say that the pole is raised
xli^. degrees, wherefore they say also that fro the zenich of Paris unto the
equinoctial be.xlix. degrees, and that fro the Ozyron unto the Zenych is the
fourth party of the Meridien oyrcle be.lxxxx. degrees, and fro the pole to the
zenych be.xli. degrees, and fro the pole unto the solstyce of Summer be.lxii.
degrees, and fro the solstyce unto the equinoctial ben.xxxiii. degrees, there
be fro the pole unto the equinoctial.lxxxx. degrees, and is the fourth part of
the roundness of the sky, from the equinoctial unto the solstyce of Winter
be.xxxiii. degrees, and fro the solstice unto the ozyron.xviii. Thus shall the
equinoctial be raised over the ozyron.xli. degrees, and the solstyce of
summer.lxiiii. degrees, in the which solstyce is the son at the hour of noone
the longest day of summer, and then it enters into Cancer and is most nearest
to our habytable parties that may be. And when the son is in the solstyce of
Winter, the shortest day of the year at the hour of noone it enters into
Capricornus: and the said solstyce is not raised over the ozyron of Paris but
viii. degrees. The which eleuations and rysings a man may find plainly so
that he know one only, and in every region in likewise after the situation.

Of the two other great cyrcles of the sky, and four small.
TWo great circles ben on the Sky named colours, that divides th^ skies in
four eagle parties, crosses their self directly, the one pas^seth by the
poles of the world, by the two solstices, and the other (...) the poles also,
and by the two equinoctials. The first small circle is called th^ circle Artyke
because of the pole zodyake about the pole Artyke, and his lyk^ is to his
opposite, named the circle Antartyke. The other two be named Tro^pykes, the one
of summer, and the other of winter. The Tropyke of somme^ is cause of the
solstyce of summer, beginning of Cancer, the tropike of win^ter of the solstice
of winter beginning of Capricorne, ben egally distant on^ circle fro the other.
Here ought to be noted that the distaunces of the pole ar^tyke to the circle
artyke, and the distance of the tropike of summer to the E^quinoctiall, and
that of the equinoctial to the tropike of winter, and from th^ circle antartyke
to the pole antartyke are just egal each of.xxiii. degrees and a^ half or
there about, then the distance fro the equinoctial to the tropike o^ summer,
and fro the circle artyke to the pole make together.xlvii. degrees. The which
take away of the quarter between the pole and the equinoctial, wher^ as
ben.lxxxx. degrees, save that there abides.xliii. that ben the distance
be^twene the tropyke of winter and the circle antartyke, and these cyrcles bin
said little, for they be not so great as the other, nevertheless they be
divided each by.ccc.lx. degrees as the greatest.

Of the rising and resconsyng of the signs in the ozyron. Capitulo.xxxv.
Ozyron and emyspery differred, for ozyron is the circle that deuydeth the
party of the sky that we se from that under the earth that we se not. Also
Ozyron is a circle that moves not, but as we move fro one place to another,
but emyspery turns continually, for one party ry^eth and mounts over
Ozyron, and the other part resconseth and enters under it, thus Ozyron rises
no resconseth, but ye comes above rysethe, and that which goes under
resconseth, Merydien also rises not no resconseth. Equi noctiall is the
diurnell circle that rises and resconseth regulerly, as much in one hour as
in another, all in xxiiii. hours zodyake the large circle, oblyke whereon the
signs bin, rises and resconseth al on a day natural, but not regulerly, for
it rises more in one hour then in an other, for that is ever over our ozyron
is oblyke, and deuydeth the zodyake in two parts, whereof one is ever over our
ozyron, and the other vnderneth. Thus half of the signs rises over our
ozyron every day artificial be it short or lunge, and the other half by
night, wherefore it behooves that in the days that be shorter then the nyghtes
the signs rises sooner, and in lunge days more at leyser, and thus the
zodyake rises not regulerly in these parties as the Equinoctial, but there is
double variacio, for half of the zodyake that is from the beginning of Aries
unto the end of Uirgo al together takes as much time in rysynge as half of
the Equinoctial that is by it, and they begin to rise in a moment, and end in
a moment also. But this half of the zodyake rysethe sooner in the beginning,
and this half of the Equinoctial more at leyser, and this is called their
obliquement. Also the other half of the zodyake that is from the beginning of
Libra unto the end of Pisces, and half of the Equinoctial that is by it,
begins and leueth to rise together but the Equinoctial in that party in the
beginning rises sooner, and the zodyake more at leyser, and this is called
rising directely. And whether that rises sooner the Equinoctial or the
zodyake, yet always they end together. Example of the two mouynges
aforesaid, as if two men went from London to Uvyndsore and departed both
together and that at the begynninge the one go fast and the other softly, he
that goth ^as^ shulde be sooner in the midway the the other but if he that went
fast to the midway go softly, the other fast, they shall be both at once in
Wyndsore. Also the half of the zodyake from the begynninge of Cancer, unto the
end of Sagittary in rising ^ereth more then ^alfe the Equinoctial, so that
this half rises all right, and the other half of the zodyake rises
oblykely.

Of the deuysyons of the earth, and of the regyons. Capitulo.xxxvi.


FIrst or we speak of the sterres and knowledge that Shepardes have we will say
of the deuysion of th^ earth, and of his parties after thy^ opinion. Wherefore
it is to be note^ that the earth is round, and therefor^ as a man goes from
one counttrey t^ another, he hath other ozyron then h^ had, and there appears
other part^ of the sky, and if a man went from Septemtrion straight toward
Mid^day, the pole Artike to him shall be less^ raised, that is to say, more nigh
ap^proching to the earth, and if he wen^ contrariwise it should be more reised
that is to say, apperyng higher, an^ therefore if he went toward mydday under a
meridien whele that the pol^ Artyke were less raised over his ozyron by the
xxx. part of one of the vi. part of the arc Meridien, he should pass the xxx.
part of the vi. parties of half the circute of the earth, and to him the pole
should be less raised by one degre^ or to the contrary till it were more raised
of one degree, then he should pass^ one degree of the circuit of the Earth,
of the which all the degrees toge^ther ben.ccc.lx. And one degree of the earth
conteyneth.xiii. leges, and a half or there about, and every leg is two mile:
And as the sphere of the sky is de^uided by the four less circles five
parties called Zones, so the earth is deu^ded into five regions, whereof the
first is between the pole artyke and the ci^cle artyke. The second between is
the circle artyke and the tropike of somme^ The third is between the tropike of
summer and the tropike of winter. Th^ fourth is between the tropike of winter
and the circle Antartike. The fyft b^twene the circle antartyke and the pole
Antartyke. Of the which parties (...) the earth some Shepards say that the
first and the fifth bin inhabitable, (...) their over great coldness, for they
ben to far from the son. The third th^ is in the middle is to ne'er under
the way of the soune, and is inhabitable (...) the great heate. The other two
parties, the second and the fourth be not (...) ne'er no to far fro the son,
but be moderate in heate and cold, and therefor^ they ben habitable if there
be none other letting, and pose that it be true, (...) it is not possible to
pass over thwart the region under the way of the som^ called zone, turned to
go fro the second to the fourth. For some shepards wo^ have passed that wold
have showed of it, wherefore they say that there is (...) region habyted, but
the second wherein we and all other ben.

Of the variation that is for diverse habitations and regions of the earth. Cap.
xxxvii.
SHepeherdes say that if it were possible that the earth were inhabyted all
about, and pose the case that it were so, first they that inhabit under the
Equinoctial have always the days and the nyghts equal, and have the.ii.
poles of the world at the two corners of their orizon, and may see al the
sterres when they see the two poles, and the sun passes twyse in a year over
them, that is when it passes by the Equinoctials. Thus the sun is to them
the one half of the year toward the pole Artike, and the other half toward
the other pole, and therefore they have two winters in a year without great
cold, one is when we have winter, and the other when we have summer. Semblably
they have two summers, one is in March when we have prime time, and the other
in September when we have harvest, and by this they have four solstices, two
hie when the sun passes by their zenich, and two lowe when it declines one
way or other, and thus they have four vmbres or shadows in a year, for when
the sun is in the equinocces twice in a year, in the morning their shadows
be in the Occident, and at night in the Orient, and then at noone they have
no shadows, but when the sun is in the signs septentrionals their shadows
be toward the parties of the signs meridionals, and so againeward. Secondly
they that inhabit between the Equinoctial and the Tropike of summer, have in
likewise two summers and two winters, and four shadows in a year, and they
have no difference of the first, save that they have longer days in summer,
and shorter in winter, for as the Equinoctial lengeth, in likewise doth the
days in summer, and in that part of the earth is the first climate and almost
half of the second, and is named Araby wherein is Ethiopia. Thirdly they that
inhabit under the Tropike of summer have the sun over their heads, and at
the day of the solstice of summer at noone, they have their shadows smaller
then we have, and there is a part of Ethiopic. Fourthly they that be between
the Tropike of summer and the circle Artike have longer days in summer then
the abouesayde, in as much as they be farther from the Equinoctial, and
shorter in winter, and they have the sun over their heads, no toward
septentrion, and that part of the earth we inhabit. Fifthly they that inhabit
under the circle Artike have the ecliptike of the zodiake to their orizon, and
when the sun is in the solstice of summer, it resconseth not, thus they have
no night, but natural days of.xxiiii. hours. Semblably when the sun is in
the solstice of winter it is natural day when they have continual night, and
that the sun rises not to them. Sixthly they that be between the circle
Artike and the pole Artike, have in summer divers natural days, that be to
them one day artificial without any night. And also in winter be many natural
days, which are to them always night, and the more that it approaches the
pole, the more is the artificial day of summer lunge, and dureth in some place
a weke, in other a month, in other two, in other three, in other more, and
proporcionally the night is greater, for some of the signs be ever on their
Oryzon, and some always under, and as lunge as the Sun is in the signs
above it is day, and while it is in the signs vnderneth it is night. Seventhly
they that inhabit right under the pole have the sun half of the year on
their Orizon, and have continual day, and the other half of the year
continual night, and the Equinoctial is in their orizon that divides the
signs, six above and six beneath, wherefore when the sun is in the signs
that be hye, and toward them they have continual day: and when it is in the
signs toward midday, they have continual night, and thus in a year they have
but one day and one night. And as it is said of that part of the earth toward
the pole Artyke, a man may understand of the other half, and of the
habitations towards the pole Antartike.

The division of the earth, and only of the part inhabited
Shepherds and other as they divide the earth inhabitable in.vii. parts that
they call climates. The first Diamerous. The second climate Diaciens. The.iii.
Dalixandry. The.iiii. Diarhodes. The v. climate Dia^omes. The.vi. Daboristines.
The.vii. Diatipheos. Of the which each hath his longitude determined, and the
latitude also, and the nearer they be to the Equinoctial the longer they be,
and larger, proceed in longitude from Orient to Occident, and in latytude from
midday to septentrion. The first climate after some Shepherds conteyneth in
length half of the circuit of the earth, that is two hundred thousand.iiii.
hundred mile, it hath an hundred thousand two hundred mile of length. The
second, and so of the other, for the lessing of the earth coming toward
Septentrion. To understand what a climate is after the saying of Shepardes. A
climate is a space of earth equally large, whereof the length is from Orient to
Occident, the breadth is coming fro midday, and fro the earth in habitable
toward the Equinoctial drawing to septentrion, as much as an ^rolege or clock
changes not. For in earth habitable the clocks change.vii. times in the
breadth of the climates. It is of necessity to say that they be.vii. where the
variation of horologes is, there is the dyuersitie of clymates, howe be it that
such variation properly ought to be taken in the midst of the clymates, and
not in the beginning or end, for the proximitie and couenaunce the one of the
other. Also one climate hath always a day artificial of somer shorter or
longer then another climate, this day shows the difference in the midst of
every climate better then in the beginning or end, the which thing we may
sensibly know at eye, and thereby judge the difference of the clymates. And it
is to be noted that under the Equinoctial the days and the nyghtes in all
times are equal, each of twelve hours, but coming toward Septentrion the
days of summer longs, the winter days shorteth, and the more that one
approaches septentrio the more waxes the days in such wise, that at the fine
of the last climate the days in summer be longer by three hours and an half,
then they be at the beginning of the first, and the pole is more raised
by.xxxviii. degrees. At the beginning of the first climate, the longest day of
summer hath xii. hours and xlv. minutes, in the pole is raised on the oziron
xii. degrees and xlv. mynutes, and the midst of the climate the longest day
hath.xiii. hours, and the pole raised.xvi. degrees, and the latytude dureth
unto the longest day of summer, that is.xiii. hours and.xv. minutes, and the
pole raised.xx. degrees and an half, the which largeness is.ccc.xl. mile of
earth. The second climate begins at the end of the first, and the midst
is there as the day hath.xiii. hours an half, and the pole is raised over the
ozyron.xxiiii. degrees and.xv. mynutes. And the latytude dureth unto there as
the longest day hath.xiii. hours and.xlv. mynutes, and the pole is
raised.xxvii. degrees and an half, and this largeness conteyneth of earth,
cccc. mile just. The third climate begins at the end of the second, and
the midst is there as the day hath.xiii. hours, the pole is raised xxx.
degrees and.xlv, minutes, and the latytude extends unto there as the logest
day hath.xiiii. hours and.xv. mynutes, and the pole is raised.xxiii. degrees,
and.xl. mynutes. The fourth climate at the end of the third, and the midst is
there as the longest day hath.xiiii. hours and an half, and the pole is
raised.xxvi. degrees and.xx. mynutes, the latytude dureth unto there as the
longest day hath.xiii. hours and xlv. mynutes, and the pole is raised.xxx.
degrees, and the largeness conteyneth of earth.ccc mile. The fifth climate
begins at the end of the fourth, a^d the midst is there as the longest day
hath, xv. hours, and the pole is raised.xli. degrees and.xx. mynutes, and the
latytude dureth unto there as the longest day hath xv. hours and xv. mynutes,
and the pole is raised xliii. degrees and an half, and the largeness conteyneth
of earth cclii. mile. The vi. climate begins at the end of the fifth, and
the midst is there as the longest day hath xv. hours and an half and the
pole is raised over the ozyron xlv. degrees and xxiii. mynutes, of the which
the largeness dureth unto there as the longest day hath xv. hours xlv. mynutes,
the which largeness conteyneth of earth cc.xii. mile. The vii. climate begins
at the end of the syxt, and the midst is there as the longest day hath xvi.
hours, and the pole is raised xlviii. degrees and xl. mynutes, the latytude
extends unto there as the longest day hath xvi hours and xv. minutes, and
the pole is raised fifty degres and an half, and the largeness of the earth
conteyneth clxxxvi. mile.

A marvelous consyderation of the great understanding of Shepeherdes.
IF case were after the length of the climates one might go about the earth fro
Orient to Occident to his first place, some Shepards say that this compass may
almost be made. Saying that if a man went this compass in.xii. natural days
going regulerly toward Occident and began now at midday, he should pass every
day natural the.xii. part of the circuit of the earth, and be.xxx. degrees
whereof behooves that the son make a course about the earth, and.xxx. degrees
ferther or he be returned on the morrow at the merydien of the said man, and
so the said man should have his day night of.xxvi. hours, and should be
farther by the.xii. part of a natural day then if he rested him, wherefore it
follows of necessity, that in xii. natural days the said man should only
have but xi. days and.xi. nights somewhat less, that the sun should light
him but.xi. times, resconse.xi times, for.xi. days and.xi. nights, every day
and night of.xxvi. hours makes.xii. natural days, each day of.xxiiii.
hours. By semblable consideration behooves that an other man that should make
this course going toward Orient have his day and night shorter then a natural
day by.ii. hours, then his day and night should be but of.xii. hours. Then if
be made this course in like space, that is to say in.xii. days and somewhat
more. Thus if Iohn made the course toward Occident, and Peter toward Orient,
and that Robert abode them at the place fro whence they departed the one as
soon as the other, and that they meet at Robert both together. Peter would say
that he had two days and two nights more then Iohn, Robert that had rested a
day less then Peter, and a day more then Iohn, howe well that they have made
this course in.xii. natural days, or an hundred, or in ten year, all is one.
This is a pleasant consideration among shepardes, how Iohn and Peter arrives
one self day, put case it were on sunday. Iohn wold say it is saturday, Peter
wold say it is monday, and Robert would say it is sunday.

Of the Pommel of the skies a sterre named the sterre of the North, near to
pole Artike called Septentrionall. Cap. xxxviii.
AFter the abouesaid things here will we speak of some sterres in particular.
And first of them that Shepards cal the pommel of the skies, or sterre of the
north, wherefore we ought to know that we see sensibly the sky turn from
Orient to Occident by the diurnal moving that is of the first mobile, which is
made on two points opposites that be the poles of the sky, of the which one we
see, and it is the pole Artike, and the other we see not, that is the pole
Antartike or of midday, which is always hyd under the earth. By the pole Artike
that we see is the sterre most approached that shepards call the pommel of the
sky, the which they say is the highest and most steadfast from us, by the which
they have the knowledge that they have of the other sterres and parts of the
sky. The sterres that be by the said pommel go never under the earth, of the
which be the sterres that make the chariot, diverse other, but they that be far
from it, go sometime under the earth, as the sun, the moon, other planets.
Under this pommel directly is the angle of the earth, in the place where against
the sun is at the hour of midnight.

Of Andromeda a sterre fixed.
Aries is a sign hot and dry, that governs the head of man and the face, and
the regions, Babylon, Percy, and Araby. And sygnifieth small trees, and under
him at the.xvi. degree rises a sterre fixed named Andromeda, that Shepardes
figureth a maid in her hair upon the brink of the sea, set to be devoured of
the monsters of the sea, but Perseus son of Iupiter fought with his sword
against the said monster and slew it, and then the said Andromeda was
delivered. They that be borne under her constellation be in danger of prison,
or to dye in prison, but if a good planet take regard, then escape not death
and prison. Aries is the exaltacion of the sun at the.xix. degree, and Aries
is the house of Mars with Scorpio where he is most.

Of Perseus a sterre fixed lord of the sphere.
Taurus hath the trees, plants, and ympes, and governs of man the neck and
the throat bol, the regions, Ethiopy, Egipt, and the country about, and under
the.xxii. degree rises a sterre fixed of the first magnitude, that shepardes
call Perseus son of Iupiter, that smote of the head of Meduse, who made all
them to dye that beheld ber, and by no manner they might eschew it. Shepardes
say that when Mars is conjoined with this sterre, they that be borne under the
constellation shall ha^e their heads smitten of, if God shape not remedy,
sometime they cal this sterre lord of the sword, and figure him a man naked
with a sword in one hand, in the other the head of Meduse and looks not on
it. And Taurus is the exaltacion of the Moan in the.iii. degree.

Of Ozyron a sterre fixed and his fellows.
Gemini signifies large, good courage, wit, beauty, clergy, and governs of
man the shoulders, arms, and hands, and the regions, Iugen, Armony, Cartage,
and hath the small trees. And under the.xviii. degree rises a sterre fixed,
named Oziron and with it.xxxvi. other sterres, and is figured, a man armed in
mayle, and a sword g^rde about him^ and signifyeth great captains. They that
be borne under the constellation be in danger to be slain by treason, if good
fortune be not with them. Gemini Uirgo be the houses of Mercury, but Uirgo is
it in which he joys most, and Gemini in the third degree is the exaltacion of
the dragons head.

Of Alhabor a sterre fixed.
Cancer domineth the long and equal trees, and of the body of man the breast,
the heart, the stomach, the side the lights, and the lunges, the regions,
Armony the little, the region of Orient. And there rises under it in the eight
degree a sterre fixed that Shepardes call Alhabor, that is to say the great
dog, and they say that they which be borne under the constellation, and that
be in the ascending or the midst of the sky it signifies good fortune, and
if the Moan be with it, and the party of fortune, he that in it shall be borne,
shall not be very rich, and Cancer is the house of the Moon, and is the
exaltacion of Iupiter in the.xv. degree.

Of a sterre fixed named the Lyons heart.
Leo hath the great trees, that is to say he signoureth over them, and
signifyeth on hasty man full of anger and of anguish, of the body of man it
beholds the heart properly, the back and the sides, of regions Artitry unto
the end of the earth habitable, and under the xxxiii. degree rises a sterre
fixed, named the Lions heart, they that be borne under the constellation as
Shepardes say, shall be mounted in his signouryes, or in great offyces, and
afterward shall be depriued or put down, be in danger of their lines, but if
some good planet behold the said sterre they may be saved. Leo is the house
of the sun, and Aries is the exaltacion of the sun as it is said.

Of the sterre fixed named Nebuluse, and of an other named the golden Cup.
Uirgo governs all that is sown on earth, and sygnifieth a man of good
courage, philosophie, largess, and of all manner of scyences, and kepeth of man
the belly and the entrails, and the regions Asgeramita, Assen, that is a regio
by Jerusalem, Eufrates, and the yle of S^ayne. Under the longitude or xv.
degree rises a ster fixed named Ne^luse or tail of the Lion, is in the
septentrional latitude of the said sign of virgo, under the which sign
rises an other fixed sterre which Shepards call the golden Cup, and is in
the xiii. degree of the said sign toward the party me^idionall. The which
sterre is of the nature of Uenus and of Mercury, and sygnifyeth that they which
be borne under the said constellation to know of things worthy and sacred.

Of the Pork espyke a sterre fixed.
Under the sign of Libra that domyneth the great trees, and sygnifyeth
Justice, and of a man it governs the reins, and the nether part of the
belly, and regions, the country of Romany, and of Greece. Under the xviii.
degree rises a sterre fixed that Shepherds call Pork espyke. They that ben
borne under the constellation ben well shapen, and ben honest, and do things
that folk marvel on, and rejoices, and sygnifyeth rychesse by honesty, and
precious marchaundyse, and bin commonly loved of Lords and Ladies, and Libra
is one of the houses of Uenus, and Taurus the other, in the which she rejoices
most, and is the exaltacion of Saturne, for the whether begins to wax cold
in this month of September, and Saturne is the planette and Lord of cold,
that exalts when he enters into the sign of Libra.

Of the Crown septentrionall a sterre fixed.
The Scorpion domineth the trees that ben of longitude and largeness,
signifyeth falseness, of the body of man governs the privy places, and the
regions of Heberget, and the field of Araby, in the second degree rises a
sterre that Shepardes call the Crown septentrionall, the which when it is in
the ascendynge in the midst of the sky, gives honour and exaltacion to them
that ben borne under the constellation, and specially when it is well beholden
of Sol, the Scorp^on is one of the houses of Mars, in the which he rejoices
most, and Aries is the other, and is the sign wherein Mars begins to fall
from his exaltation.

Of the Scorpions heart a sterre fixed.
The Sagittary sygnifyeth a man full of engyne and wise, and governs the
thyghes of man, and regions, Ethiopye, Maharobem, and Aenych. Under his first
degree rises a sterre fixed of the first magnitude, the which shepardes call
the Scorpyons heart, which when it is well beholden of Iupiter or Uenus, it
reyseth them that be borne under his constellation to great honour and riches,
but when it is evil beholden of Saturne o^ of Mars, it puts them that be
borne under it to pouertie^ The Scorpion is the house of Iupiter, in the which
he rejoices most, and Pisces is his other house, and so is the said Sagittary
the exaltation of the Dragons tail.

Of the flyeng Egle a sterre fixed.
Capricornus sygnifyeth a man of good life, wise, ireful, and of great
thought, and governs the knees of man, and the regyons, Ethyopye, Araby,
Gehamen, and to the two seas, and under his.xxviii. degree rises a sterre that
Shepherds call the flyenge Egle, that signifyeth the sovereign Emperors or
kings. They that be borne under his constellation when they be well beholden
of the sun and of Iupiter, mounts in great seignoryes, and ben loved of
kings and princes. Capricornus and Aquarius ben the houses of Saturne, but he
rejoices in Aquary most, and the said Capricornus is the exaltation of Mars.

Of the fysh meridionall a sterre fixed.
Under Aquarius that kepeth the legs of man to the ankles of the feet, and
the regions of Hazenoth, Alempha, and part of the land of Alphege, and a part
of Egipt. In the xxi. degree rises a sterre that shepards cal the fish
meridionall. They that be borne under his constellation be happy in fyshing in
the sea of Midday, and under the.ix. degree of the said sign rises the
Dolphin that sygnifieth lordship on the sea, ponds, and ryuers, and as it is
said Aquarius is the house of Saturne in which he rejoices.

Of Pegasus that signifyeth the horse of honour a sterre fixed.
Pisces governs of man the feet, and signifyeth a man subtyle, wise, and of
divers colours, and hath regyons, Tabrasen, Iurgen, and all the habitable part
that is Septentrion, and part of Romany, and under the.^v. degree of the said
sign, rises a sterre that Shepards call Pegasus, that is the horse of honour,
and the figure in form of a fair horse. They that be borne under his
constellation shall be honoured among great Capitayns and Lords. When Uenus is
with it, they be loved of great Ladies, if the said sterre be in the midst of
the sky in the descending, and Pisces is one of the houses of Iupiter, and
Sagittarius the other, in the which he rejoices most, and the said Pisces in
the.xxvii. degree is the exaltation of Uenus.

Of the division of the.xii. houses, as well in the earth as in the heavens.
Cap. xxxix.


THe heavens and the earth may be divided in four parts by two circles, which
crosses directly over the two poles, and crosses four times the Equinoctial
line. Each of the four parts divided into three equally, is in all.xii. equal
parts, as well in the sky as in the earth, which shepherds call houses, and be
twelve. Of the which six be always above the earth, and six under it, and
these houses moves not, but be always each in their place, and the signs and
planets passes by them always once in.xxiiii. hours. Three of these houses be
from Orient to midnight going under the earth, the first the second and the
third, whereof the fi^st under the earth, beginnineth at Orient named the house
of life. The second house of substance and riches. The third that finishes
at midnight is the house of fraternity. The fourth that begins at midnight
coming in Occident is named the house of partrimony. The fifth following is the
house of sons. The sixth finishes in Occident, under the earth is the house
of sickness. The seventh begins in Occident on the earth, and stretches
toward midday, is the house of marriage. The eight is the house of death. The
ninth finishing at midday is called the house of faith, of re^gion, and
pilgrimage. The tenth beginning at midday coming toward Orient is the house of
honour and of regality. The eleventh after, that is the house of true
friends. And the twelfth that fynisheth in orient on the earth is named the
house of charity, but this matter is diffycile, for Shepardes knowledging the
nature and property of every of the said twelve houses, and departs them
lightly and suffices of that is said with the figure present.

Thus ends of the twelve houses.

QUaliter p^er crescit in ventre matris sue. Primo mense crescit cerebrum
Secundo crescut vene. Tertio quarto habe^it omnia mebra sua, sed erit sine
anima. Qinto incipit venere mulum grauabit matrem suam. Sexto circundabitur
pelle, ossa crescent. Septimo vngues crescent. Octauo crescet cor omnia viscera
pretericour. Nono sciet matter si puer poterit been nascian non. Decimo crescit
i^cur in puero, de tunc been comparebit mulieri si been eueniet pu^ro, an non,
que in i^core irascat: quod quam cito habuit iecur tam cito nascetur vel
morietur.

IN quibus partibus corporis hominis sunt spiritus intellectus. Intellectus
la esse in front. Memoria in cerebro. Ira in fell, auaricia in iecore,
timor in corde, halitus in pulmone, cogitatio in venis: quia spleen ridemus,
sell irascimur, corde sapimus, iecore amamus: quibus quatuor elementis
constantibus integrum est animal.

Of the twelve signs, which be good or bad to take journeys by land or by
water. Cap. xxxix.

ARies is good, Tautus is not so
Gemini and Cancer, will make thee glad
But beware hardly of Leo and Uirgo
Libra for friendship, full harde is Scorpio
Sagittary good, Capricorne peryllous
Aquary by water good, clerks proves so
For best is Pisces, and most plenteous.
How the planets reign in every hour. Ca. xl.


HE that will wet howe Shepardes know which planete raygneth every hour of
the day and the night And which planet is good, which is bad, ought to know the
planette of the day seek therefore. The first temporal hour of the son
rysynge that day is for the said planet. The second hour is for the planet
ensuynhe, the third for the other as they bin here figured by ordre, and it
behooves to go from Sol to Uenus, Mercury Luna them come again to Saturne unto
xii. that is the hour before the son going down, and incontinent after the
son is down begins the first hour of the night that is for the.xiii.
planet, the second hour of the night for the xiiii. so unto xii. hours for
the night, that is the next hour before the son rysynge and come directly
falling upon the xxiiii. planet, that is next before that of the day following.
And thus the day hath xii. hours, and the night xii. also the which be
temporal hours, different to the hours of the clocks, the which be
artificials. Shepardes said that Saturne and Mars be evil plants. Iupiter
and Uenus good, Sol and Luna half good and half evil. The parey toward a
good planet is good and the party toward the evil planet is nought. Mercury
conjoined with a good planette is good, and with an evil planet he is nought
and they understand this as to ^he inflicences good or evil that bin of the
said planetes there following.

The hours of the planets ben different to them of clocks, for the hours of
clocks ben eagle at all times each of.lx. minutes, but they of the planets when
the days and the nights be eagle that the son is in one of the equinocces
they be egal, but as soon as the days lengtheneth or shortneth, so doth the
natural hours, by this it is convenient always for the day to have.^ii teporal
hours, the night also, and when the days be long, the hours lunge, and when
the days ben short and the hours short, in likewise is the night, and
nevertheless an hour of the day, and an hour of the night together have vi.
score minutes, as many as two hours artyficialles, for that the one leueth the
other takes. And take we our planets, fro the son rising, not before unto
the son going down, and all the remenaunt is night.

Example of that which is abouesayd.


IN Deceber the days have but.viii. hours artyficiall ^es of clocks, and
they been xii. teporals, let the viii. hours artificialles be divided in xii.
eagle parts, and it shall be xii. times, xl. minutes, and every party shall be a
temporal hour yt shall be of.xl. minutes and no mo. Thus in Decembre the
teporall hours of the day have but.xl minutes, but the hours of the night
have four score. For in that time the nights have xvi. hours artificialles,
the which divided in twelve parts ben four score minutes for every temporal
hour. Thus the hours of the nyghtes in Decembre have four score minutes xl.
for an hour of ye day. there ben six score minutes in two temporal hours,
as many as in two hours artyficialles that be each of xl. minutes. In June is
the contrary, in Mars, and in September, all hours ben eagle as the days ben
in other months by eagle portion. With every planet here before figured ben the
signs, which be the houses of the said planets, as it is aforesaid.
Capricornus and Aquarius ben the howses of Saturne.

Sagitarius, and Pisces, of Iupiter, Scorpius, and Aries, of Mars, Leo of Sol,
Taurus, and Libra, of Uenus, Gemini, of Mercury, Cancer, of Luna with other
significations that would be long to recount.

Here after follows the nature of the.vii. planets with the dispositions of
the said planets after the sayings of expert Shepardes.



xmi: xvn.

MY son thou shalt understand
That to avoid all Idleness
This matter oft thou take in hand
To rede of Shepardes business
And specially of the planets seven
Of Mars, and Saturne that is full hye.
Also of Sol, the middle heaven
And under him Uenus, Luna and Mercury
For to know their natures all
In soth it is a great cunning
And show what may befall
When every planet is raygning
By their worcking oft we bin moved
To love lust, and plays of Iolitie
And by sour of them as clarks have proved
They stir us to theft, murder and vilitie
Some be good, some be bad verily
Some be not comfortable to man no beast.

Some hot, some cold, some moist, some dry,
If three be good, four be worse at the least.
Saturne is highest and coldest, being full bad
And Mars with his bluddy sword, ever ready to kyl,
Iupiter very good, and Uenus makes lovers glad,
Sol and Luna, is half good and half ill,
Mercury is good, and evil verily
And hereafter shalt thou know
Which of the seven most worthy be
And who reigns hye, and who a lowe
Of every planets property
Which is the best among them all
That causes wealth, sorrow, or sin
Tarry and hear soon thou shalt
Speak soft, for now I begin.
Of Saturne.
Saturnus significat hominem nigrum croceu ambulando mergentem in terra qui
ponderosus est incessu, adiungens pedes macer recuruus, habens paruos occulos
siccam cutam: barbam raram labia spissa: calidus ingeniosus, seductor
interfector hominem{que} corpore pilosum iunctis supercilijs.


Here begins of Saturne the highest of the.vii. Planets.
SAturne is the highest planette of all the seven, he is mighty of him self,
he gives all the great coldes and waters, yet he is dry and cold of nature,
and he comes into Cancer, and his chief signs ben Aquarye and Capricorne,
and he compasses all the other Plants. For Saturne is next under the first
mobile, that is, under the Crystal sky, the which mobile moves
marvelously, for some Shepardes say that he causes by his mouinge all other
plants to move, and moves the mobile above.

Saturne is so hye that Shepardes can not well measure it. For so hye reason
hath ^ow^r and no farther, and therefore it is more then.xxx. year or he may
run his course. When he doth raygne thete is much these used, and little
charity, much lying, and much lawynge one against another, and great
prysonment, and much debate and great swearing. And much plenty of corn, and
also much plenty of hogs, and great travail on the earth, and old folk
shall be very sickly, and many diseases shall reign among the people, and
specially in the chief hours of Saturne, and therefore this planet is likened
to age, as harde, hungry, suspicious, and covetous, that seldom is content
with any thing. For Saturne is enemy to all things that grows and bears
life of nature, for the cold and stormy bitterness of his time.

Of his proprieties.
HE that is borne under Saturne shall be false, enuyous, and full of debate,
and full of law, and he shall be cunning in coryinge of leather, and a great
eater of bread and flesh, and he shall have a stinkynge breath, and he shall be

iangelers and chyders, black len in the face, thin bearded, evil
langnaged, they shall be full of law and vengeance, and will never forgive till
they be revenged of their quarrel, and like as the planet Saturne is cold, and
causer of great frosts and snowes, ensemblably, and he that is borne under him
shall be cold in charity, and not misericordious and merciful, but vengeable,
and will never be entreated. And also they shall be great cursers, and bear
malice lunge in their minds, and not forget it, and they loke to be obeyed and
to have great reverence, and commonly will praise them selfes, and talk to
them self, and laugh at their own conceit, and all evils shall grow in them,
and above all colours he shall love black colour best. The planet of Saturne
governs of man the ratell and above the ears as is aforesaid, and this
planet is cause of hasty death, for because that he is cold and dry of
nature, and therefore he is likened to melancholy. And the said Saturne reigns
in Aquary, Capricorne, and Cancer, but specially in Aquary and Capricorne.

NExt after the planet of cold Saturne is the noble planet of Iupiter, the

Pisces, and the other is Sagittary, signs of none evil, nor unhappiness, this

THe planette of Mars is called the God battle and of all war, and he is the
third planette, for he reygnes next under the gentle planette of Iupiter.
This planette Mars is the worst of all other, for he is hot and dry, and
stirs a man to be very wilful and hasty at once, and to unhappiness, one
of his signs is Aries, and the other is Scorpio, and most he is in those two
signs. He causes all wars and battles, this planet stirs men to bear
wepons as murders, daggers, swerdes, bills, or bows, or some other wepon of
death, and would ever here of fighting. Therefore let every man beware of the
days of Mars, and in his chief hours that no man fight, for without doubt
if God help him not he shall be marmed or slain. Also the hours of Mars is
perilous meeting with thieves for dread of sleying of true men. And Mars

thus he runs his course.

parum rubeos: occulos aliquantulum croceos, mixtam habet natura cum planeta qui
cum eo fuenit dum modo digniorem habeat locum eius insequitur naturam.


THe Sun is a planet of great renown, and king of al the planets, the sun
nourishes every age, and yet is he hot and dry of nature, and the planet
Saturne is to him full contrary, for he is ever cold, and the noble planet of
the sun is hot and gives all light, for when it is above the earth it is

capillorum, habentem paruam maxillam, pulchros occulos, pulchram facie, multos

NExt after the Sun, reigns the gentle planet Uenus, and it is a planet
feminine, and she is Lady over all lovers, this planet is moyste and cold of
nature, and her two signs is Taurus and Libra, and in them she hath all her
joy and pleasance, she causes joy, and specially among yonge folk, for
greatly she reigns on them, and on all men that be jealous, and on women also,
for ielousy is but a love inordinate, as when a man or woman loves more
fervently then they should, for such would never be from the sight of their
lovers, for if they be, anon they suspect them, and fear to be begyled. There
is no man that loves a woman by carnal affection, but it is by the influence
of Uenus, and but few men can escape out of her danger. This planet Uenus

frontem eleuatum, longam faciem, nasum longum, barbam in maxillis, oculos

NExt under Uenus is the fair planet Mercury, and it is masculine next above
the Moon, and there is no planet lower then Mercury, saving only the Moon.
This Mercury is very full and dry of nature, and his principal signs be
these. Gemini is the first that reigns in the arms and in the hands of man
or of woman, and the other sign is Uirgo that governs the nauyll and the
stomach of man. This planet is lord of speech, in likewise as the Sun is

habentem oculos non ex toto nigros, faciem rotundam, pulchram staturam, in

in plenitudine quod distru^ndu quia decrescit.


IT is to be understand and known that the lowest planet of the seven is
named Luna, the which we call the Moon, the which planet is called feminine or
female, and is called among the shepardes the Lady of the night, for the
chief light and cleerenesse that is by night is by the presence of the Moon,
for the Moon is much more nearer approached unto us then any sterre is, and
therefore she gives us much more light then the sterres do, and also the Moan
is Lady of moystu^e, and rules the sea by ebb and studde. The Moon doth take
her light of the son.xxii. times in a year. And also the Moon is cold and
moist of nature, and her colour is much fairer then sylue^, and her chief house
is Cancer, and there is none of the other planets that is so slow and goes so
little circuit as doth the Moon, and she descends into Scorpio and she goth
about the.xii. signs in.xxvii. days, and then changes, and is called new.

Of her proprieties.
SUch men and women as be borne under the Moon shall be wholly and serviceable,
and very gentle. And if it be a maid child she shall be very shamefasle and
womanly, and they shall be well fa^oured both man and woman, their faces shall be

governance of Luna.

Thus ends the.vii. planets with their proprieties.
Of the Phyzonomy of Shepardes.


PHyzonomy of the which ben spoken before, is a science that shepardes have to
know the natural inclination of man and woman, good or evil, by divers signs
on them in beholding them only. The which inclination we ought to follow if it be
good, but if it be evil by virtue and strength of understanding we ought to
eschew and avoid it, as to the effect, and to with stand the said evil
inclinations, Shepardes use this science none otherwise. The prudent virtuous
and wise man, may be of all other, as touching their manners, otherwise then
their signs demonstreth and shows in their reign. Thus the things
demonstred as to vice is not in a wise man though the sign be so, as an
alestake or a sign is sometime hanged before a house, in the which often times
is none ale. For howe be it that a man by his wisdom and understanding follow
not the evil influences of the celestial bodies that be upon him, yet he
corrupts not the signs and demonstracions of the said influences, but those
signs naturally have signory and domination on them, in the which they be, for
to have naturally that which they signify, though that a man have them or not,
wherefore Shepardes say that the most part of men and women follow their natural
inclinations to vice or virtue, for that the most part of them be not wise and
prudent as they ought to be, and they use no virtue of their own minds, but
ensues their sensuality, and by this the celestial influence of the which is
showed by signs exteriors, and of such signs is the said science of
Phyzonomy. For the which it behooves first to know that the time is divided
in four parts, as it hath ben said before, that is to wit, Primetime, Summer,
Harvest, and Winter, that he compared to the four elements. Prime time to the
air, Summer to the fire, Harvest to the earth, and Winter to the water. Of the
which four elements, every man and woman is formed and made, and without the
which none may live. The fire is hot and dry. The air is hot and moist. The
water is moyste and cold. The earth is cold and dry. Also they say that the
person on whom the fire domineth is colerike of complexion, that is to say hot
and dry. He on whom the air domineth is sanguine of complexion, that is to say
hot and moist. He on whom the water domineth is flumatike of complexion, that
is to say moist and cold. He on whom the earth domineth is melancolike of
complexion, that is to say cold and dry. The which complexions they knowledge
and discern the one fro the other by signs that be said hereafter.

Of the four complexions. Cap. xli.


THe Colerike hath nature of fire hot and dry, naturally is len and sclender,
covetous, ireful, hasty, brainless, foolish, malicious, deceitful, and subtle
where he applies his wit. He hath wine of the Lion, that is to say, when he
is drunken he chydeth, feighteth, and commonly he loves to be clad in
black, russet and gray.

The Sanguine hath nature of air, hot and moist, he is large, plenteous,
attempred, amiable, habundant in nature, merry, singing, laughing, liking,
ruddy, and gracious. He hath his wine of the ape, the more he drinks the
merier he is, and draws to women, and naturally loves hye coloured cloth.

The Flumatike hath nature of water cold and moyste, he is heavy, slow,
sleepy, ingenious, commonly he spits when he is moved, and hath his wine of
the sheep, for when he is drunken he accounts him self wisest, and he loves
most green colour.

The Melancholy hath nature of earth, cold and dry, he is heavy, covetous, a
backbyter, malicious, and slow. His wine is of the hog, for when he is drunken
he desires sleep, and to lye down, and he loves cloth of black colour.

The judgements of mans body. Cap. xlii.
TO come to out purpose of speaking of visyble signs, we will begin to speak
at the signs of the head. First we advertise that one ought to beware of all
persons that hath defaute of members naturally, as of sot, hand^ eye, or other
member, and though he be but a creple, and specially of a man that hath no
berde, for such be inclined to diverse byces and evils, one ought to eschew his
company as his mortal enemy. Also Shepards say that much and plain hair sign
^teth a person piteous and debonayre. They that have red hair, bin commonly
yreful and lack wit, and ben of little truth. Black hair, good visage, and
good colour sygnifyeth very love of Justice, Hard hair signifies that the
person loves peace and concord, and is of good and subtle wit. A man that
hath black hair and a red berde signifi^th to be lecherous, disloyall^ a
vaunter, and one ought not to trust in him. The yelowe hair and crisp
signifies man laughing, merry, lecherous, deceitful. Black hair and crisp
signifies melancholy, lechery, evil thought, very large. Hanging hair
signifies wit with malice. Great plenty of hair in a woman sygnifieth
boistousnes couetise. A person with great eyes is slothful, vnshame full,
inobedient, and weans to know more then he doth, but when the even be mean,
not to big nor to small, and that they be not to black nor to green, such a
man is of great understanding, curteyse, faithful trusty. A person that is
blere eyed, goggeled, and squint, signifies malice, vengeance, cautel, and

The even that ben ardaunt and sparkelynge, sygnifyeth strong heart, force, and
puissance. The even that ^en whytysh and fleshely, sygnifyeth a person
inclined to vice, lechery, and full of fraud. Shepardes say that when a
person beholds often as abashe^d, shamefaste, and fearful, and that in
beholding it seems that he sighet^h, and he hath small drops appearing in
his even, then it is for certain that such persons loves and desires the
wealth of them that they behold. But when any looks in casting his even
aside as by wantonness, such persons ^en disceytfull and purchases to grieve
him, and such persons will dyshonoure women, and they ought to be taken heed
of, for such looks ben false, lecherous, and deceauable. They that have small
grayeshe even and sharpe, signifyeth a person melancholious, hardy, an evil
speaker and cruel. And if a little vein appear between the even and the
nose of a wenche^ they say that it signifyeth virginity, and in a man
subtility of understanding, and if it appear great and black it signifyeth
corruption, heate and melancholy in woman, and in man rude^sse and defaute of
wit, but that vein appears not always. But the even that ben yelowe and
have no hair on the brows, sygnifyeth myselry and evil disposition of body.
Great hairs and lunge signifyeth rudeness, harde, engyne and lechery. The
beeteled brows signifyeth malice, cruelty, lechery, and envy. And when the
brows bin thin, it signifyeth subtle engine, wit, and fayth^ulnesse.

little short visage and a small neck, a little sclender nose signifyeth a
person of great heart hasty, and ireful. A lunge nose and hye, by nature
sygnyfyeth prowess and hardiness. A short raised nose signifies has^ynes,
lechery hardynesse, and an vndertaker. A hooked nose that bows to the upper

signifyeth folly, but it is a sign of good memory. Little ears signifyeth
lechery and theft. A person that hath a good voice well soundinge, is hardy,
wise, and well spoken. A mean voice that is not small no to great signifyeth
wit, purveyance, truth, and ryghtwysenesse. A man that speaks hastily is
of value. A great voice in a woman is an evil sign. A soft voice signifyeth
a person full of envy, of suspection, and leasi^ges. And ouersmall voice
sygnifyeth great heart and folly. Great voice signifyeth ^astynes and ire. A
man that styrteth always when he speaks and changes voice is enuyous, nice,
dronkelewe, and evil conditioned. A person that sp^th attemperately without
mouinge, is of perfyte understanding, of goo^ ^dycion, and of good counsel. A
man with a rouse visage, rennynge eye^ yelowe teeth, is of little truth, a
traitor, and hath astynkynge breath. A person with a lunge sclender neck is
cruel, without pity, hasty, and braynlesse. A person with a short neck is

Shepardes say, for that there bin divers signs in a man and woman, and that
they be sometime contrary one to the other, one ought to judge most commonly
after the signs in the visage. And first of the even for they be most true
and prouable. And they say that God no formed creature for to inhabit the
world, wiser then man, for there is no condition no manner in a beast, but that
it is found comprehended in man. Naturally a man is hardy as the Lyon, true
and worthy as the Ox, large and liberal as the Cock, avaricious as the Dog,
hard and aspre as the Hart, debonayre true as the Turtle, malycious as the
Leopard, privy and tame as the Dove, dolerous and guileful as the Fox,

Shepardes practyse their quadrant of the night as ye see by the figure
hereafter. Capitulo.xliii.


BY this fyguce hereafter, one may know the hours by night as follows. Let
be known the sterre that we ^al the Pommel of the sky, right under is the
summer at the hour of midnight, the place on the earth against the sterre that
we call the angle of the earth. When we will see it at eye we behold our
Pommel, as I behold under this corde, the nether end of my corde is the angle
of the earth, the son is right under it. The long lines that trauerseth the
ster of the figure that is the Pommel of the skies, serves for.ii. hours, the
small lines for one hour. But yet serve lines as the changing of the sterre
that signifyeth midnight, consequently the other hours, for the long hours
serves to a month, the small to.xv. days. Let the corde be stretched that it
be seen over the Pommel, note some sterre under the cord that may be always
known, that shall be it that always shall show us the hours of ye night After
imagine a circle about the pommel, distance of the sterre marked, in which
circle be imagined the lines or semblable distaunces as they be in the figure.
As many distances as the marked ster shall be before the corde, so many hours
shall there be before midnight, as many as shall be behind the corde, so many
hours be after midnight. It must be known that the sterre marked changed the
place in.xv. days by the distynctyon of an hour, in a month of twain.
Wherefore it behooves to take midnight in.xv. days farther by the distance of
an hour, and in a month of two, and in two months of four, and in three
months of.vi. so that in.vi. months the sterre marked that was right under
the Pommel shall be right over, and in other.vi. months it will come to the
point where as it was first marked, and this said marked ster one ought not to
change, but ought to chose it among many for the most knowledgeable and for the
most to be found among the other.

By this present figure Shepardes know by night in the fields all seasons what
time and hour it is, be it before midnight or after.


The.xxiiii. letters without the figure bin for the.xxiiii. hours of a
natural day, and the.xii. within bin for the.xii. months. The sterre in the
midst is the Pommel of the skies, with the which it behooves to know one that
is next it, which shall be a marked sterre, and it by the which one may know
the hours in the manner as before is said in taking midnight in.xv. days
furthermore by the distance of an hour.



FOr to know by night the place against mydday as that of mydnighte, the hye
Oryent, and the hye occident, the lowe Orient and the lowe occident, and the
place in the sky, over against which every sign rises. Shepardes uses this
practyse. They hang a corde that is made steadfast above and beneth, then
another with a plombe, that descends till it be time for to staye it that
they may be a little distance one from another, so that one may see the
flerre of the pommel right under the two cords at once, then they staye the
corde with the plombe above, or benethe. Now who that will see myddaye dyrectly
be it night or day, go on the other side of the cords, and thou shalt see
the place against middaye. Then come on the first side, and thou shalt se the
place against midnight though it be day. For the highest point of the Zodyake
in the longest day of Summer, let the son be seen under the two cords at
the hour of myddaye, and that he be so near that he toche the cords, and
mark in the corde toward the son the heyghte that he has s^ene it, then by
night, mark some sterres that one may always know one, in the same place is
the passage of the solstice of Summer. And when the days ben at the shortest,
the sterre that we see at midnight in the said point of mydday ben directly
they that ben next to the solstyce of summer, the which hath the sign next
toward orient is Cancer, and the sign next toward occident is Gemini. And it
is said from the height of the solstyce of summer, one may practyse the lowe
solstyce of winter, the which we see on the myddaye when the day is at the
shortest over the place against midnight, and his next sign toward orient is
Capricorne, and that toward occident is Sagitarius. One may mark the hye
orient or the low, but it behooves that it be when the days ben at the longest
or shortest, and the distance between the two orients divided in.vi. eagle
parties, by each rises two signs, by the nearest party of the hye orient
rises Gemini and Cancer, by the second Taurus and Leo, by the third Aries
Uirgo, by the fourth Pisces and Libra, by the.v. Aquarius and Scorpius, by
the.vi. more ne'er the occident Capricornus and Sagittarius, and divers other
things that may be practised on the sky.

Of divers impressions that Shepards se in the night in the air.
Capitulo.xliiii.
SHhepardes that lies by night in the fields sees many and diverse impressions
in the air and on the earth, which they that lies in their beds se not.
Sometime they have scene in the air a manner of Comet in form and fashion of a
Dragon casting fire by the throat. Another time hey have scene fire leaping in
manner of Gootes, that leaps without long during. And other times a white
impression, the which appears always by right and at all hours, the which
they call the hye way to saynct Iames in Galice.

The fleing Dragon, Gootes of fire leaping, the hye way to saint Iames in
Galyce.


OTher impressions there be, as flambes of fire that mounts. Other as flaming
of fire that goes sydeway. Other as styll Fire that bids long. Other there
is that makes great flames bids not long. Other also as candels, ^ometyme
great and sometime little, and this they se in the air and on the earth.
Another Comet they se falling as an ardaunt sphere.

Brenning candle. Sphere ardaunt, fire mounting, brenning sparkles,
firebrands, wild fire.


Moreover Shepardes see cometes in other manners, that is to wet in manner of a
pillar flaming, and dureth long. Another in manner of a flying sterre that
passes lightly. But the third is covered sterre that dureth longest of all.
They se other five sterres erratykes that goes not as the other, ben they
which they call planets, but they have form of the planetes, and ben Saturne,
Iupiter, Mars, Uenus, and Mercurie, and they see sterres of the which one is
called the bearded sterre, and the other heard sterre, and the other a tayled
sterre.

Sterres erratykes. Comettayled. Flying sterre. Pillar ardaunt. Sterre tayled,
Sterre heard, Sterre bearded.

How the year goth about by xii. months, and how a man waxes in xii. ages of

WE shulde believe that it is faithfully true, that the xii. months and seasons
changes xii. times the man, even as the xii. months changes them in the year
xii. times, as every one after the other by (...) course of nature, and so man^
life changes every vi. year and so ^ter that forth unto xii. ages, and every
age lasts vi. year, and so xii. times v^ makes lxxii. And so lunge every man
may preserve and keep his body wi^out sickness, if that they keep them self
well in their youth by good dy^tan^ good governance, for ye know well that many
men slays them self, and dies log or they shulde do, as by surfites, over
salt meates, over cold meates or to hot in operation, contrary to their
complexion, or by taking great heat, and after great cold, or by evil airs,
or by taking of thought, or by great weet going in the rain, or going
weet shod, or over much using the company of women, or by fighting in his
youth and leasing some of his blud or by great anger, or by falls, or burdes,
or by to great study over reching his mind. These with many such other men
may alter their complexion and short their lives, and all for lack of good
gouerninge in their youth. And they that live till.lxxii. is by their good
living and diet. And then they may live in decrypite till.lxxx. or an hundred
year. But f^we passes that. All is Gods ordinance, to length and short
their days at his pleasure.

Of an assault against a Snail,
The woman speaks with an hardy courage.

GO out of this place thou right ugly beast
Which of the vynes, the burgenings doth eat
And buds of trees both more and least
In dewy mornings, against the weate
Out of this place, or I shall the sore beat
With my distaff, between thy horns twain
That it shall sown into the Realm of Spain.
The men of arms with their fearse countenance
Horrible Snail lightly thy horns down lay
And from this place, out fast loke that thou ryn
Or with our sharpe wepons. we shall the fray
And take the castle that thou lie in
We shall the flay, out of thy foul skyn
And in a dyshe, with onyons and pepper
We shall the dress, and with strong vyneger.
There was never yet any Lumbarde
That did thee eat, in such manar of wise
And break we shall, thy house strong and harde
Wherefore get the hens, by our advise
Out of this place of so rich edyfice
We thee require, if it be thy will
And let us have this tower that we come till
The Snail speaks.
I am a beast of right great marvel
Upon my back, my house raised I bear
I am neither flesh, no bone to avail
As well as a great ox, two horns I were
If that these armed men, approach me ne'er
I shall them soon vanquish every chone
But they dare not, for fear of me alone.
Here folowethe the meditations of the passion of our Lord Iesu Christ, that
Shepardes and simple people ought to have in hearing the diuyne service.
Capitulo.xlviii.
IT behooves for to think before the beginning of Matins on the words that
Iesus said in the gardeyn, the night before that he toke his blessed passion.
Father if it be possible transport fro me this chalice. How be it my will be
not done, but thine, and that in so saying, he suffered so great peyne, that
he sweet drops of blood in such abundance that it ran down to the
ground.

And at Matis time it behooves to think how as the traitor Iudas approached
him to our Lord, in kissing him said. Aue rabi. I salute the master. And that
the meke and benign Iesus withdrew not his visage from the traitor, and
howe he suffered him self to be taken and bounden as a thief and cast to the
earth, defiled, spitten on, left of his disciples and servants.

At Laudes it behooves to think and Consider, Iesus being in the house of
Anna, and after in the house of Cayphas dispyteously beaten, blasphemed,
stretched, and bespitten in his most precious visage, his even bounden, and
after trodden under foot inhumaynely.

At pryme it behooves to think howe as Iesus was led from the house of Cayphas
to Pylate, and the beatinges that he had. And how Pylate examined him of that
they had wrongefully accused him of, and howe he was cruelly beaten at a pillar
before a great multitude of people, and crowned with thorns.

At Tyerce it behooves to think howe Iesus was presented before the people
with a crown of thornes^ clothed with a mantel of purple, and the cursed people
cried Crucifige Crucifige eum. And howe Pylate condemned him to the most
bytterful death, and how he bare the heavy cross upon his sacred shulders.

At noone it behooves too think howe Iesus was led to the mount of Caluari
shedinge his precious blood, and how he fell diverse times under his cross. And
howe he was nalled with great blunt nailes, and the dolor that he suffered when
it was let fall into the morteis. And think also of the douloures of his
sorowefull mother.

At hie Noone it behooves to think in what dolor he was when he said My God
mi God, wherefore hast thou left me. And when he said, I thurste, they gave to
him vinegar and gall meddled and how he abode the death, after sighs made, he
gave up the ghost to God his father. And howe his mother had great sorrow also,

At Euensonge it behooves to think howe Iesus had his side opened with a
sphere, and howe he hinge dead on the Cross full of wounds fro the top of
his head to the soles of his feet, and he taken down, and how his mother
laid him on her lap weeping.

At complyne, think how Iesus was wounded and laid in sepulture, and kept of
the Iewes to the end that he should not rise.

Clarks and lay people ought to think on these or they go to Matins.

The saying of a ded man. Capitulo.xlix.

Man look and see
Take heed of me
How thou shalt be

But bones all bare.

O Mortal creatures, sailing in the waives of mysery
Auale the sail of your conscience impure
Flee from the perils of this vnstedfaste whery
Drive to the hanen of charity most sure
And cast the anchor of true confession
Fastened with the great cable of contricion clean
Wind up the merchandise of whole satisfaction
Which of true customers, shall be over scene
And brought to the warehouse, of perfection
As periyte merchants, of God by election.

Prince of Astronomy Ptholomeus.


TO kn^w under what planet a man or a woman is borne, it is needful to wit that
there is vii. planets on the sky, that is to say, Sol, Uenus, Mars, Mercurius,
Iupiter, Luna, and Saturnus. Of the.vii. planets, is named the vii. days of
the weke, for every day has his name of the planet reigning in the beginning
of it. The ancient Philosophers saith that Sol domineth the Sunday, the cause
is (they say) for the son among other planets is most worthy, wherefore it
takes the worthyes^ day that is Sunday, Luna domineth the first hour of
Monday. Mars the first hour of Twesday. Mercurius of Wednesday. Iupiter for
Thursday^ Uenus for Friday, and Saturnus for Saturday. The day natural hath
xxiii^ hours, and every hour reigns a planet.

It is to be noted that when a man will begin to reken at Sunday, he mus^ reken
thus, Sol, Uenus, Mercurius, Luna, Saturnus, Iupiter, Mars.

And when the nombre is failed, he must begin at the hour that he wol^ know
what planet reigns. The Monday he ought to begin at Luna, th^ Tewesday at
Mars, the Wednesday at Mercurie, the Thursday at Iupiter, the Friday at Uenus,
the Saturday at Saturnus. And ever when the nom^bres of the planets is failed,
he must begin by order as it is aforesaid.

Also it is to be noted that the Greeks begins their day in the morning^
The Iewes at nonne. And the Christen men at midnight, and there we ough^ to
begin to reken. For at one of the clock one Sunday in the morning reig^neth
Sol, at two reigns Uenus, at three reygneth Mercurius, at four rei^neth
Luna, at five Saturnus, at six Iupiter, at seven Mars, and at eight b^gyn
again at Sol, at nynthe Uenus, at ten Mercurie, and consequently of th^ other
by order in order in every hour.

When a child is borne, it is to be known at what hour, and if it be in th^
beginning of the hour, in the midst, at the end. If it be in the beginnin^
he shall hold of the same planet and of the other before. If it be in the
midst it shall hold of that only. If it be borne in the end it shall hold
of the sam^ of that that comes next after, but nevertheless the planet that
it is bor^ under no shall not dominieth other, that of the day shall be above it,
which i^ the cause that a child holds of diverse planets, and hath diverse
condition^

He that is borne under Sol shall be prudent and wise, a great speaker, tha^
which he praises he holds virtuous in him self. Who that is borne (...)
Uenus is loved of every man, good to godwarde and reguler. Who that (...) borne
under Mercurie is well bearded, subtle, mild, veritable, is not most prudent.
Who that is borne under Luna hath an hye forehead, ruddy, mer^ visage,
shamefaste, and religious. Who that is borne under Saturne is ha^dy, curteyse
of living, and is not avaricious. Who that is borne under Iu^piter is hardy,
fair visage and ruddy, chaste, and vagabond.

Who that is borne under Mars is a great speaker, a liar, a thief, a deceyuer
big, and of red colour.

They that will know of this more evidently, let them turn to the proper^ties
of the seven planets before rehearsed.

A prologue of the author upon the twelve signs. Cap. liii.


I Considering the course of the celestial bodies, the puissance of the hya
God Omnipotente, the which has made the son to shyne upon the good and
evil, that governs all things conteyneth in the firmament on the earth,
have taken on me for to endite this little treatise for to instruct endoctrine
the people not lettred. First to know God their maker, secondly to govern
their bodies and eschew infirmities. And thirdly to know the course of the
firmament and of the celestial bodies contained in it, with the dysposycyon
of ye vii. planetets. But who yt will know his properties, ought first to know
ye month that he was borne in, ye sign that the son was in the same day I
will not say that such things shall be, but that the signs have such properties
and is the will of God. After poets Astronomers Aries is the first sign that
shows the fortunes of men and women, as say^h Ptholomeus.

The first sign of Aries.


I find that he which is borne in the sign of Aries, fro mydde Marche to
mydde Apryll shall be of good wit, and shall neither be rich no poore^ he
shall have damage by his neighbours, he shall have power over dead folks
goods, he shall be soon angry and soon appeased, he shall have divers fortunes
and discords, he will desire doctrine, and haunt eloquent people, and shall be
expert in many degrees, he shall be a liar and vnstedfast of courage, and will
take the vengeance on his enemies, and he shall be better disposed in youth in
all things the in age, unto.xxxiii. year he shall be a fornicatour, and shall be
wedded at xxv. year, if he be not he shall not be chaste, he shall be a
mediator for some of his friends, and will gladly be busy in the needs of
other, he shall be awaited too be domaged, he shall have a sign in the shoulder
in his head, and in his body, yet he shall be rich by the death of other, his
first son shall not live long, he shall be in danger of four footed beasts,
he shall have great syckenesse at xxiii. year, and of the escape he shall live.
lxxxv. year after nature.

The woman that is borne in this time shall be prefull, suffer great wroges from
day to day, she will gladly make leasinges, and shall less her husband recover
a better, she shall be sick at.v. year of age, and at xxv. she shall be in great
danger of death, and if she escape she shall be in doubt till.xliii. year, shall
suffer great peyne of the head. The days of Sol and of Mars to them shall be
right good, and the days of Iupiter shall be contrary to them, and as well the
man as the women shall be semblable to the sheep, that every year leases his
flesh of woll, and within short space recovers it again.

Of the sign of Taurus.


HE that is borne in the sign of Taurus, fro mydde Apryll to mydde May, shall be
strong hardy, and full of strife, delycyous, and shall possess goods given
to him by other men, that he wold have done shall be incontinent, and will
enforce to himself to fynyshe it. In his youth be will dyspyse every person,
and shall be ireful, he shall go pylgrymages and will leave his friends and live
among strangers, he shall be put in officies, and shall exercise them well,
and shall be rich by women, he shall be thankless, and come to good estate, he
will take vengeance on his enemies, he shall be bytten of a dog, and shall
experiment many pains by women, and shall be in peril at xxxiii. year, he
shall be in peril of water, and shall be grieved by syckenesse and venym at xxiii.
year, and at xxx. year he shall be habundaunt in rychesse, and shall rise to
great dignity, and shall live.lxxxv. year, and three months after nature, and
shall se his fortune sorowefull.

The women that is borne in this time shall be effectual, labouringe, and a
great liar, and shall suffer much shame, she shall rejoice the goods of her
friends, that which she conceaueth in her mind shall come to effect, shall
have the best party, he shall have many husbands and many children, she
shall be in her best estate at xvi. year, and she shall have a sign in the
midst of her body, she shall be syckely, and if she escape she shall live lxxvi.
year after nature. She ought be bear rings and precious stones upon her. The
days of Iupiter and of Luna bin right good for them, and the days of Mars
contrary. As well the man as woman may be likened to the bull that labours the
land, and when the sede is sown he hath but the straw for his part. They
shall keep well their own, and it shall not profit to them no to other, and
shall be reputed unkind.

Of the sign of Gemini.


THe man that is borne in the sign of Gemini from mydde May to mydde June,
shall have many wounds and he shall be fain and merciful, he shall lead an
open and a reasonable life, he shall receive much money, he will go in unknown
places, and do many pylgrimages, he will praise himself, and will not bide in
the place of his nativity, he shall be wise and negligent in his works, he
shall come to rychesse unto.xxvi. year, his first wife shall not live lunge, but
he shall marry strange women he shall be late married, he shall be bytten of a
dog, shall have a mark of Iron or of fire, he shall be turmented in water and
shall pass the sea, shall live and hundred year, and x. months after nature.

The woman then borne shall come to honour, and set forward with the goods
of other, and she shall be agreued of a false crime, she ought to be wedded at
xiiii. year if she shall be chaste and eshewe all peril, and shall live lxx.
year after nature, and shall honour God. The days of Mercury Soll to them bin
right good, the days of Luna and Uenus bin to them contrary and as well the man
as the woman shall augment and assemble the goods of their successors, but
skantly shall they use their own goods they shall be so avaricious.

Of the sign of Cancer.


Next after he, that is borne under the sign of Cacer fro mid June to mid
July, shall be very avaricious, and of eagle stature, he will love women, he
shall be merry, humble, good, wise, and well renomed, he shall have damage by
envy, he shall have the money of other in his gydynge, he shallbe a
conductoure^ of other folks thinks, he shall have strife and discord among
his neighbours, will avenge him on his enemy, by his errogas many shall mock
him, he shall have often great fear on the water, he will keep his courage
secretly in him self, shall suffer dolor of the womb, he shall find hidden
money, labour sore for his wife, he shall se his peril in a certain year,
the which shall be known of God, his hauoyre shall decrease, at.xxxiii. year,
he shall pass the sea, and shall live.lxx. year after nature, and fortune
shall be agreble to him.

The woman that shall be borne in this time shall be furious, incontinent angry and
soon appeased, she is nymble, seruysabye, wise, joyous, and shall suffry many

Thus ends the nativities of men and women after the xii. signs.
Here after follows the x. Christen nations. Capitulo liiii.


I Pretend in this little treatise to speak of diverse Christi nations, the
which bin divided in x. of the which I will declare as I have food written in
the latin tongue, will redyge it to our English maternal as Shepardes speakethe
in the fields, after the capacity of mine understanding. And if in so doing
I have erred, I require all other Shepardes for to excuse any youth and to
amend where as I have made defaute. And where as I have failed, I submytte me
unto amendment: for against amends no man may be.

The first nation is of Latynes.
IN the nation of Latynes, for the superioures is the Emperor, many kings.
That is to wit, the most Christen redoubted king of Englande and of France,
with many noble dukes, erles, vycountes, barons and knights, and is the nacyon
most resplendishinge of all other in honour, force and chyualry. In the
nation of Spain bin the Kings of Castyle, of Aragon, of Portugal, of
Navarre, and other Lords. In the nation of Italye is the king of Eycyle, the
king of Naples, and many other lords, as of Uenyce, Florence, and Geane. In
Almayne beside the Emperor is diverse kings, as of Scotlande, Hungry, Boheme,
Polaheye, Asye, Fryse, Suisse, Hornegy, Almacye and Croacy, and many other
Lordeshippes that bin under the obedience of the Catolycke Church.

The second nation is of Greeks.
HOrace complaynethe speaking oft his nation of Greece, for the vexation that it
hath had in tyme^ past. The Greekes have the Patriarch of Constantinople,
Archebishops ^ottes to the spiritualty, and to the temporaltie Emperors,
Dukes, and Erles. They be now but of small nombre, for Agar^e^s and Turks
have taken the greatest^ part of Greece, the which part obeys not the
catolycke Church for their troure. They bin condemned by the Church for
that they say. Spiritus Sanctus non procedit a filio.

The third nation is of Armenyens.
VUe rede yt the nation of Armenyens in nyghe Antyoche, they use al one
language in the deuyne service and in holy scripture, as who should singe
English in the Church, and both the me and women understand all. They have
their pryma^e, which they call Catholycke, to who they obey as to the king in
great devotion and reverence. They fast the Lenten and eat no fyshe, and
they drink no wine and eat f^eshe ^n the Saturday.

The fourth nation of Georgiens.
THis nation is called Georgies of S. George of whom they bear the Image in
battle, and he is their Patron. They bin in the parties Orential, bin strong
and delycyous, half Percyens half Assuriens, they speak foul folysh
language, and make their sacrametes as the Greeks, The pressed have their
crowns round reased on their heads, the clerks have them square. When they
go to the holy Sepulchre they paye no tribute to the Saracens they entre into
Ierusale their standerdes displayed, for the Saracens fears them, the women
use armures as the men, When they write to the Sowdan incontinent that which
they demand is granted them.

The fifth nacyon is of Assuriens.
I Find also by wrytinge, that the nation of Suriens hath take ye name of a
city named Sir, ye which is the most eminet, most uphold among al other
cities towns of the country of Surrey. These people for their vulgar common
speech speaks the language Sarazynoys. Their holy scriptures, deuinities,
officies of the seruis is in Greek. They have bishops, keep the costitucios of
the Greeks obey them in all things. They sacrifyce with raised bread, have
opynious of the Greeks as the Latynes. There be some Christen men in the holy
land that ensuethe them, and bin called Samarytans, which were converted in
the time of the Apostles, but they be not perfyte Christen men.

The syxte nation is of Mororabyens
SOmetime were wont to be a nation of people in the contre of Affryke Spain
called Mororabiens, but now they bin but few. They be called Mororabiens, for
that in may things they held the use in Christen men being in Araby, they use
the language of Latin in the divine officies sacred things, obei to the church
to the Prelates of the Latines. They confess them in the language Azymonien or
in latin. They bin differet to the latines, for that in their dyuyne offices
they have the hours to lunge. And for the day is divided in xxiiii. hours of
night and day, so many offyres, hours, Psalmes, and all other Orisons have
they along, the which they say not after the custom of the Latines, for that
that the Latynes say in the beginning, they say in the end, or in the
midst, Some deuydeth the holy sacramentes in vii. parts and other in.x. This
is a right devout nation, they conjoin no persons by marriage, but if they be
borne in their own country and land, the strangers be not received in
marriage. And when a manne lesethe his wife by death, he will never be wedded
again, but live in chastity. The cause of so great diversity among Christen
men, was for that in time past the Christen were let and not constrained to
celebrate council general. For this cause there arose divers heretykes in many
diverse parties. For there was none that might remedy it.

The seventh nation is of Prester Iohns land in Inde.


THen is the land of Iude wheerof Prester Iohn is For his might is so great
that it exceadeth all Christendom. This Prester Iohn hath under him.lxx.
kings, the which do to him obeisance and homage, And when he rides about
his country he makes to be borne before him a Cross of wodde, And when he will
go to battle he makes two to be borne before him, one of gold, and the other
of precious stones. And in that land is the body of saint Thomas the Apostle
buried in a tomb of stone, and one of his hands is out of the tomb, and that
hand every body may se that gothe thither.

The eight nation is of Iacobytes.
FOlowinge after the nation of Iacobytes, the which bin named so of Iames the
disciple of Alexandre the Patryarke, These Iacobites have taken and occupied a
great part of Asie, in the parties Octidentall, and the land of Mambre that
is in Egypt, and the Land of Ethyopyens unto Inde, with mo then xx. Realms.
The children of that country bin cirtumcysed and baptised with an horte iron,
for hey have printed the carrectere of the Cross on their forheades, and on
other parties of the body, as on the arms and the breast. They shryue them
only to God and not to the prestes. In this prouynce the Indyans, and
Agarenoriens say that Iesu Christ hath only but the nature divine Some among
them speaks the language of Caldes and Araby. And diverse other that speaks
other languages, after the diuersyties of nations. They were condemned at the
council of Calcedony.

The nynthe nation is of Nescoriens.
OF Nescorianus that was of Constantinople, hath he made this name Nescoreus.
These Nescoriens puts in Iesu Christ two persons, one deuyne, and another
humayne, and they renie our Lady to be the mother of God, but they say well
Iesu to be man, they speak the language of Caldee, sacrifyce the body of Iesu
Christ with reised bread. They enhabite in Tartary and in great Inde, they be
in great nombre, their country conteyneth almost as much as Almayne and Italy.

The tenth nation is of Moroniens.
RObuste is the nacyon of Moronyens, called of an heretyke of Morone They put
in Iesu Christ (one understanding and one will) they enhabyte in Lybye in the
prouynce of Fenyce, an be a great nombre, they use specyally bows and arrows,
and they have belles. Their Bishoppes have rings, myters, and Crosses as the
Latynes: they use the letter of Caldee in their deuyne scriptures, in their
vulgar speech they use the letter of Araby. They have bin under the obedience
and lordeshyp of the most holy and sacred Church Romayne: their Patriarch
was at the general council of saint Iohn the Latrau, celebrate at Rome under
pope Innocent the third but sythen then they be returned. They were first
condemned at the council of Constantinople, sythen bin returned to the
obedience of the Romain Church, and yet returned again to their false and
evil opynyon, wherein they persevere.

Here begins a few proverbs, Capitulo.lv.

THe proverbs be good to mark
The which follows in this book
Be thou never so great a clack
Disdain not ou them to loke.
The first is, man be content,
As God hath sent the in degree
Each man may not hade land and rent
It were not convenient so to be.
If thou have not worldely goods at will
Therefore care nothing, by the rede of me
Do well, and Gods cammaundement fulfil
For every man may not a godsmylth be.

He that hath not a penny in his purse
If he the right way of gods law hold
He shall come to heaven as soon I wusse
As a king, that wereth on a gown of gold.
Also there is of men, full many a score
And each of them doth keep well his wife
Which never had a noble in store
And yet they live a full merry life.
And also another, forget it not,
Keep your own home as doth a mouse
For I tell you, the devil is wyly cat
He will spy you in another mans house
And in especial God to please
Desire thou never, none other mans thing
Remember that many fingers is well at ease
That never ware on, no gay gold ringe.
And this I tell you, for good and all
Remember it you that be wise,
That man or woman hath a great fall,
The which slyde down, and do never rise
And one also forget not behind
That man or woman is likely good to be
That banishes malice out of their mind
And sleeps every night in charity.
I rede you work by good council
For that man, is worthy to have care
That hath twyse fall into a well
And yet the third time can not beware.
Say that a fryer told you this
He is wise that doth forsake sin
Then may we come to hennen bliss
God give us grace that place to win no.
FINIS.

Oy clerks famous and eloquent
Conninge is caught by reading and exercise
Of noble matters full excellent
And remember what Salomon saith the wise
That praises busynesse, and idleness doth dispryse
And saith, he that many books doth rede and se
It is full likely wisdom have shall he.
Remember clerks daily doth their deligence
Into our corrupt speech metters to translate
Yet between French and English is great difference
Their lauginge in redinge is dowse and delicate
In their mother tongue, they be so fortunate
They have the Bible and the apocalips of divinity
With other noble books that now in English be.
And remember reders, where ever ye go
That honey is sweet, but conninge is swetter
Caton the great clerk, sometime said so
How gold is good, and lerninge much better
Yet many full good be that never knew letter
And yet virtuous, non can by of living
But first of priests and clerks they must have lerninge.

Wherefore with patience I you all desire
Beware of the rising of false heresy
Let every perfect faith set your hearts a fire
And the chafe from the corn clean out to try.
They that belyueth a miss, be worthy to dye
And he is the greatest fool in this world ywys
That thinks no mans wit so good as his.
Thus ends the Shepehardes Kalendere,
Drawn into English to Gods reverence
And for profit and pleasure sshal clerks to chere,
Plainly showed to their intelligence,
Our is done, now reders do your deligence
And remember that the prynter says to you this
He that lives well may not dye amys.
Imprinted at London by Thomas Este for Iohn Wally.
