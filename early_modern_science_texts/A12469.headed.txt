Contents.

^tten by Captain IOHN SMITH, sometimes Governor of VIRGINIA, and Admiral of
NEVV-ENGLAND.

LONDON, Printed by IOHN HAVILAND, 1627.

TO ALL THE RIGHT HONOURABLE, AND most generous Lords in England, especially
those of his Majesties Privy Council, and Council of War.
Great LORDS,
IVlius Caesar wrote his own Commentaries, holding it no less honour to
write, than fight; much hath bin writ concerning the art of war by land, yet
nothing concerning the same at Sea. Many others might better than my self have
done this, but since I found none endeuourd it, I have adventured, encouraged
by the good ent^tainment of my late printed Accidence. This I suppose will be
much bettered by men in these things better experienced, others ignorance may
fault it: I have been a miserable Practitioner in this School of War by Sea
and Land more than thirty years, however chance or occasion have kept me from
your Lordships knowledge or employment. Yet I humbly entreat your Lordships to
accept and patronize this little Pamphlet, as the best testimony I can present
your Honours, of my true duty to my King and Country. Thus humbly craving your
Honours pardons, and favourable construction of my good intent, I remain

Your Honours in all duty to be commanded, IOHN SMITH.

TO THE READER AND ALL WORTHY Adventurers by Sea, and well wishers to
NAVIGATION.
Honest Readers,
IF my desire to do good hath transported me beyond my self, I entreat you
excuse me, and take for requital this rude bundle of many ages observations;
although they be not so punctually compiled as I could wish, and it may be you
expect; At this present I cannot much amend them; if any will bestow that
pains, I shall think him my friend, and honour his endeavours. In the interim
accept them as they are, and ponder errors in the balance of good will,

Your friend, IOHN SMITH.

TO HIS WELL deserving friend Captain IOHN SMITH.
REader within this little work thou hast
The view of things present, to come, and past,
Of consequence and benefit to such
As know but little, thinking they know much;
And in thy quiet chamber safely read,
Th'experience of the living and the dead,
Who with great pain and peril oft have tried
When they on angry Neptunes back did ride.
He having with his Trident struck the maine,
To hoise them up and throw them down again
Dear friend I'll cease and leave it to thy Book.
To praise thy labour. Reader ouer-looke.
Edw. Ingham.

To the much deserving Captain, Iohn Smith.
I Hate to flatter thee, but in my heart
I honour thy fair worth and high desert;
And thus much I must say, thy merits claim
Much praise honour, both from Truth Fame.
What Judge so ^'re thy Actions ouer-looke,
Thou need not fear a trial by thy Book.
Geor. Buck.

TO HIS WORTHILY deserving friend Captain IOHN SMITH.
THe Lighter Hippias of Troy disclosed,
Germans in India Cannowes now in trade,
The Barge by grave Amocles was composed,
The Argozees first the Illyrians made,
The Galley I^son built that Grecian spark,
The Cyprians first did cross the Seas with Bark.
The Keele by the Phaenician^ first was named,
The Tyrrhens first made anchors, Plateans oars;
The Rhodians for the Brigandine are famed,
Cyrenians found the Craer, and Creet adores
Daedal{us} for Masts, and Saile-yards; Typhis wise
(With triple honour) did the sterne devise.
The Tackle famous Anacharsis wrought,
Noble Pyseus did the Stem first frame,
To light the Copians first the Rudder brought,
Young Icarus for Sails acquired great fame,
Thou, with the best of these mai'st glory share,
That hast deuis'd, compiled a work so rare.
For what long travels observations true
On Seas, (where waives do seem to wash the skies)
Have made thee know, thou (willing) dost vnscrew
To those that want like knowledge; each man cries
Live worthy Smith; England for this endeavour
Will (if not stupid) give thee thanks for ever.
Nicolas Burley.

In laudem Nobilissimi viri Johannis Smith.
MOney, the worlds soul, that both forms and fames her,
Is her bad Genius to, it damnes, and shames her.
If merit and desert were truly weighed
In Justice Scales, not all by money swey'd;
Smith should not want reward, with many more,
Whom sad oblivion now doth ouer-flow.
For now no good things gotten without money,
Except tis got, as Bears from thorns like honey,
With danger to themselves. For poor men's words
Are wind, and air: Great men's are pickes, and swords*
Greatness more safe may act lust, theft, or treason;
Than poor Iohn Smith or I may steal two peason,
Or drink a harmless cup, to chase away
Sad cares and griefs that haunt us every day.
Who saw thy Virgin limbed by thee so truly,
Would swear thou had been one that saw her newly,
One of her latest lovers. But to tell
The truth, I think they know her not so well.
And this Sea Grammar learned long since by thee,
Thou now hast formed so artificially,
That many abeardlesse boy, and Artless fool,
Preferred before thee, may come to thy school.
Iohn Hagthorpe.

TO HIS FRIEND Captain Smith, on his GRAMMAR.
MV^h travelled Captain, I have heard thy worth
By Indians, in America set forth:
Me silence best seems to keep, and then
Thy better praise be sung by better men,
Who feel thy virtues worthiness: Who can
Derive thy words, is more Grammarian,
Than Camden, Clenard, Ramus, Lilly were;
Here's language would have non-plust Scaliger.
These and thy travels may in time be seen
By those which stand at Helm, and prime ones been.
Edw. Iorden.

THou which in Sea-learning would Clerk commence,
First learn to read, and after read to learn,
For words to sound, and not to know their sense,
Is for to sail a ship without a Sterne.
By this Sea Grammar thou may distinguish
And understand the Latin by the English.
Here may thou learn the names of all ships geere,
And with their names, their natures, and their use;
To hoise the Sails, and at the Helm to steer;
To know each Shroud, each Rope, each Knot, each Noose,
And by their names to call them every one,
'Tis such a Book as may be called Such none.
And yet a Smith thereof the Author is,
And from his Forge alone we have the same,
Who, for his skill in such a work as this,
Doth far excel all others of his name:
He's neither Lock-Smith, Gold-Smith, nor Black-Smith,
But (to give him his right name) he's Iack-Smith.

A Sea Grammar.
Chap. I. Of Docks, and their definitions.
A Dock is a great pit or pond, A dry Dock.
or creek by a harbour side, made convenient to work in, with two great
floud-gates built so strong and close, that the Dock may be dry till the ship
be built or repaired, and then being opened, let in the water to float and
launch her; and this is called a dry Dock. A wet Dock.
A wet Dock is any place, where you may hale in a ship into the oz out of the
tides way, where she may dock her self. A Cradle.
A cradel is a frame of timber, made along a ship, or the side of a gally by
her billidge, for the more ease and safety in launching, much used in Turkie,
Spain, and Italy. The stocks.
And the stocks are certain framed posts, much of the same nature upon the
shore to build a Pinnace, a Catch, a Frigate, or Boat, c. To those Docks for
building belongs their wood-yards, with saw-pits, and all sorts of timber; but
the masts and yards are chained together in some great water to keep them from
rotting, A Crab.
and in season; Also a crab is necessary, which is an engine of wood of three
claws, placed on the ground in the nature of a Capsterne, for the launching of
ships, or heaving them into the Dock.

CHAP. II. How to build a ship with the definitions of all the principal names
of every part of her principal timbers, also how they are fixed one to
another, and the reasons of their use.
THe first and lowest timber in a ship is the keele, The Keele.
to which is fastened all the rest; this is a great tree or more, hewn to the
proportion of her burden, laid by a right line in the bottom of the dock, or
stocks. At the one end is scarfed into it, The Stem.
the Stem, which is a great timber wrought compassing, and all the butt-ends of
the planks forwards are fixed to it. The Sterne.
The Sterne post is another great timber, which is let into the keele at the
other end somewhat sloping, The fashion pieces.
from it doth rise the two fashion pieces, like a pair of great horns, to
those are fastened all the planks that reach to the after end of the ship, but
before you use any planks, The Rungs.
they lay the Rungs, called floor timbers, or ground timbers, thwart the
keele; thorough those you cut your Limberholes to bring the water to the well for
the pump, The Limberholes
the use of them is when the ship is built to draw in them a long hair rope,
by pulling it from sterne to stem, to scour them, and keep them clean from
choking.

The Floor.
Those ground timbers do give the floor of the ship, being straight, saving at
the ends they begin to compass, and there they are called the Rungheads,
Rungheads.
and doth direct the Sweep or Mould of the Foot-hookes and Navel timbers,
Sweep. Mould. Skarfing.
for there doth begin the compass and bearing of the ship, those are scarfed
into the ground timbers, which is one piece of wood let into another, or so
much wood cut away from the one as from the other, for when any of those
timbers are not long enough of themselves, they are scarfed in this manner, to
make two or three as one: those next the keele are called the ground
Foot-hookes, Foot-hookes. Keeleson.
the other the upper Foot-hookes; but first lay your keeleson over your floor
timbers, which is another long tree like the keele, and this lying within as
the other without, must be fast bound together with strong iron bolts thorough
the timber^ and all, and on those are all the upper works raised, when the
Foot-hookes are scarfed, as is said, and well bolted, when they are planked up
to the Orlop they make the ships Howl, and those timbers in general are
called the ships ribs, Howl. Ribs. Sleepers.
because they represent the carcass of any thing hath ribs. The sleepers run
before and after on each side the keeleson, on the floor well bolted to the
Foot-hookes, which being thus bound do strengthen each other. Spurkits.
The Spurkits are the spaces betwixt the timbers along the ship side in all
parts, but them in Howl below the Sleepers, are broad boards, which they take
up to clear the Spurkits, if any thing get betwixt the timbers.

The Garbord is the first plank next the keele on the outside, The Garbord.
Garbord struck. Rising timbers.
the Garbord struck is the first seam next the keele, your rising timbers are
the hooks, or ground timbers and foot-hookes placed on the keele, and as they
rise by little and little, so doth the run of the ship from the floor, The
Run.
which is that part of the ship under water which comes narrower by degrees
from the floor timbers along to the sterne post, called the ships way aftward,
for according to her run she will steer well or ill, by reason of the
quickness or slowness of the water coming to the rudder: now all those
planks under water, Planks.
as they rise and are joined one end to another, the fore end is called the
Butt-end in all ships, Butt-ends.
b^t in great ships they are commonly most carefully bolted, for if one of
those ends should spring, or give way it would be a great troublesome danger to
stop such a leake, the other parts of those planks are made fast which good
Treenailes and Trunnions of well seasoned timber, Treenailes. Tiunnions.
thorough the timbers or ribs, but those planks that are fastened into the ships
stem are called whoodings. Whoodings.


The gathering of those works upon the ships quarter under water is called the
Tucke, The Tucke.
if it lie too low it makes her have a fat quarter, and hinders the quick
passage of the water to the rudder; if too high she must be laid out in that
part, else she will want bearing for her after works. The Transome is a timber
lies thwart the sterne, Transome.
betwixt the two fashion pieces, and doth lay out the breadth of the ship at
the buttocks, Buttocks.
which is her breadth from the Tucke upwards, and according there to her
breadth or narrowness, we say she hath a narrow or broad buttock, the fashion
pieces, before spoke of, are the two outmost timbers, on either side the
sterne, excepting the counters. Rake. The Hull.
The ships Rake is so much of her hull as hangs over both ends of the keele, so
much as is forward is said, she rakes so much forward, and so in like manner
aftward: by the hull is meant, the full bulk or body of a ship without masts
or any rigging from the stem to the sterne: The Rake forward is near half the
length of the keele, and for the Rake aftward about the fore-part of her Rake
forward, but the fore Rake is that which gives the ship good way, and makes her
keep a good wind, but if she have not a full Bow, it will make her pitch her
head much into the Sea, if but a small Rake forward, the sea will meet her so
fast upon the Bows, she will make small way, and if her sterne be upright as
it were, she is called Bluffe, Bluffe. Bluffeheaded. Billage.
or Bluffe-headed. A ships Billage is the breadth of the floor when she doth
lie aground, Billage water is that which cannot come to the pump, we say also
she is bilged, when she strikes on a rock, an anchors flooke or any thing that
breaks her planks or timbers, to spring a leake.

When you have berthed or brought her up to the planks, Planks.
which are those thick timbers which goes fore and aft on each side, whereon
doth lie the beams of the first Orlop, Beams. Orlop.
which is the first floor to support the planks doth cover the Howl, those
are great cross timbers, that keeps the ship sides asunder, the maine beam
is ever next the maine mast, where is the ships greatest breadth, the rest from
this is called the first, second, third, fourth, c. forward or aftward beams.
Great ships have a tier of beams under the Orlop whereon lies no deck, and
great posts and binders called Riders fro them to the keele in howl only to
strengthen all. Riders.
But the beams of the Orlop is to be bound at each end with sufficient Knees,
Knees.
which is a crooked piece of wood bowed like a knee, that binds the beams and
foot-hookes, being bolted together, some stand right up and down, some a long
the ship, and are used about all the decks, some sawed or hewed to that
proportion, but them which grow naturally to that fashion are the best.

Lay the Orlop with good plank according to her proportion* so level as may
be is the best in a man of War, Ports.
because all the Ports may be of such equal height, so that every piece may
serve any Port, Beds.
without making any beds or platformes to raise them, but first bring up your
work as before to the second deck or Orlop, and by the way you may cut your
number of port holes according to the greatness of your ship; Ringbolts.
by them fasten your Ringbolts for the tackles of your Ordnances, you use
Ringbolts also for bringing the planks and wail^s to the ship side, Set bolts.
and Set bolts for forcing the works and planks together, Clinch bolts.
Clinch bolts are clinched with a riueting hammer for drawing out. But Rag
bolts are so iaggered that they cannot be drawn out. Rag bolts.
Fore locke bolts hath an eye at the end, Fore locke bolts.
whereinto a fore locke of iron is driven to keep it from starting back. Fend
bolts.
Fend bolts are beat into the outside of a ship with the long head to save her
sides from galling against other ships, Drive bolts.
Drive bolts is a long piece of iron to drive out a treenaile, or any such
thing, besides diverse others so useful that without them and long iron spikes
and nailes, She was built of Cedar.
nothing can be well done; yet I have known a ship built, hath sailed to and
again over the maine Ocean, which had not so much as a nail of iron in her
but only one bolt in her keele.

Clamps.
Now your risings are above the first Orlop as the Clamps are under it, which is
long thick planks like them, fore and aft on both sides, under the ends of
the Beams and timbers of the second Deck or Orlop, or the third Deck or
Orlop, or the third Deck which is never called by the name of Orlop, Decks. A
half Deck. A quarter Deck. A Flush Deck.
and yet they are all but Decks; also the half Deck and quarter Deck,
whereon the beams, and timbers bear are called risings. A Flush Deck is when
from stem to sterne, it lies upon a right line fore and aft which is the best
for a man of War, both for the men to help and succour one another, as for
the using of their arms, or remounting any dismounted piece, because all the
Ports on that Deck are on equal height, which cannot be without beds and much
trouble, A cambered Deck. To sink a Deck. To raise a Deck.
where the Deck doth camber or lie compassing. To sink a Deck is to lay it
lower, to raise a Deck to put it higher, but have a care you so cut your Port
holes, one piece lie not right over another for the better bringing them to
your mark.

The half Deck is from the maine mast to the steareage, the quarter Deck
from that to the Masters Cabin called the round house, which is the utmost of
all, but you must understand all those works are brought up together, as near
equally as may be from bend to bend, Bend, or wail.
or wail to wail, which are the outmost timbers on the ship sides, and are
the chief strength of her sides, to which the foot-hookes, beams, Chain
wail.
knees, are bolted, and are called the first, second, and third Bend; but the
chain wail is a broad timber set out amongst them, a little above where the
chains and shrouds are fastened together to spread the shrouds the wider the
better to succour the masts. Thus the sides and Decks are wrought till you
come at the Gunwaile, Gun wail.
which is the vpmost wail goes about the vpmost struck or or seam of the
vpmost Deck about the ships waste, and the ships quarter is from the maine
mast aftward. The ships quarters. Culuertailed. Carlings.


Culuertailed is letting one timber into another in such sort that they cannot
slip out, as the Carling ends are fixed in the beams, and Carlings are
certain timbers lies along the ship from beam to beam, on those the ledges
doerest whereunto the planks of the Decks are fastened. Carling knees.
The Carling knees are also timbers comes thwart the ship from the sides of the
Hatches way, betwixt the two masts, and bears up the Deck on both sides, and
on their ends lies the comings of the hatches, Comings.
which are those timbers and planks which bears them up higher than the
Decks, to keep the water from running down at the hatches; also they fit
Loopholes in them for the close fights, Loopholes.
and they are likewise a great ease for men to stand upright if the Decks
below. Hatches way.
The Hatches way is when they are open where the goods are lowered that way
right down into the howl, and the hatches are like trap doors in the midst
of the Decks, before the maine mast, by certain rings, to take up or lay
down at your pleasure.

A scuttle-hatch is a little hatch doth cover a little square hole we call the
Scuttle, A Scuttle.
where but one man alone can go down into the ship, there are in diverse
places of the ship whereby men pass from Deck to Deck, and there is also
small Scuttles grated, to give light to them betwixt Decks, and for the smoke
of Ordnances to pass away by. The Ramshead is a great block wherein is three
shivers into which are passed the halyards, Ramshead.
and at the end of it in a hole is reued the ties, and this is only belonging
to the fore and and maine halyards; to this belong the fore Knight, The fore
Knight.
and the maine Knight, The main Knight
upon the second Deck fast bolted to the Beams. They are two short thick
pieces of wood, commonly carved with the head of a man upon them, in those are
four shivers apiece, three for the halyards and one for the top rope to run
in, and Kneuels are small pieces of wood nailed to the inside of the ship,
Kneuels.
to belay the sheats and rackes unto. Capstaine.


The Capstaine is a great piece of wood stands upright upon the Deck, abaft
the maine mast, the foot standing in a step upon the lower deck, and is in the
nature of a windis, to wind, or weigh up the anchors, sails, top masts,
ordnances, or any thing it is framed in diverse squares, with holes thorough them,
Capstaine bars.
thorough which you put your Capstaine bars, for as many men as can stand at
them to thrust it about, and is called manning the Capstaine. The maine body of
it is called the Spindle. The Spindle. Whelps.
The Whelps are short pieces of wood made fast to it, to keep the Cable from
coming too high in the turning about; Paul.
The Paul is a short piece of iron made fast to the Deck, resting upon the
whelps to keep the Capstaine from recoiling which is dangerous, but in great
ships they have two, the other standing in the same manner betwixt the fore
mast and the maine, to heave upon the Jear rope, Jear Capstaine.
and is called the Jear Capstaine, to strain any rope, or hold off by, when
we way Anchor, to heave a head, or upon the viol, which is when an Anchor is
in stiff ground we cannot weigh it, or the Sea goes so high the maine
Capstaine cannot purchase in the Cable, then we take a Hawser opening one end,
and so puts into it Nippers some seven or eight sadome distant from each other
wherewith we bind the Hawser to the Cable, and so brings it to the Jear
Capstaine to heave upon it, and this will purchase more than the maine
Capstaine can. The viol.
The viol is fastened together at both ends with an eye or two, with a wall
knot and seized together. A windas.
A windas is a square piece of timber, like a Role before the fore Castle in
small ships, and forced about with handspikes for the same use as is the
Capstaine.

The Pump.
What are the parts of a pump you may see in every place, The Brake.
the handle we call the brake, the pumps can, is a great can we power water
into pumps to make it pump. The Can. The Daile.
The daile is a trough wherein the water doth run over the Decks; Chained
Pumps.
But in great ships they use chained pumps which will go with more ease, and
deliver more water. A Bur Pump.
The Dutch men use a Bur pump by the ship side, wherein is only a long
staff with a Bur at the end, like a Gunners sponge, to pump up the Billage
water that by reason of the breadth of the ships floor cannot come to the well:
In pumping they use to take spells, that is, fresh men to relieve them, and
count how many strokes they pump each watch, whereby they know if the ship be
stanch, or thite, or how her leaks increase. The Pump sucks, The Pump sucks
is when the water being out, it draws up nothing but froth and wind. They
have also a little Pump made of a Cane, a little piece of hollow wood or
Latin like an Elder gun, A bear Pump.
to pump the Beer or Water out of the Cask, for at Sea we use no Taps, and
then staue the Cask to make more room, and packeth the Pipe-staues or boards
up as close as may be in other Cask till they use them.

The Skuppers are little holes close to all the Decks thorough the Ships sides,
The Skuppers.
whereat the water doth run out when you pump or wash the Decks;
Skupper-leathers.
the Skupper-leathers are nailed over those holes upon the lower Deck to keep
out the Sea from coming in, yet give they way for it to run out:
Skupper-nailes.
Skupper nailes are little short ones with broad heads, made purposely to nail
the Skupper-leathers, The Waist.
and the cotes of Masts and Pumps. The Waist is that part of the Ship betwixt
the maine Mast and the fore-castle, and the Waist boards are set up in the
Ships waist, Waist boards.
betwixt the Gun-waile and the waist trees, Waist trees.
but they are most used in Boats, set up along their sides to keep the Sea
from breaking in.

There are usually three Ladders in a Ship; The entering Ladder.
the entering Ladder is in the Waist, made formally of wood, and another out of
the Gallery made of Ropes to go into the boat by in foul weather, Gallery
Ladder.
and the third at the Beak-head, made fast over the Boulspret to get upon it,
Boultspret Ladder.
only used in great Ships.

It were not amiss now to remember the Fore-castle, The Fore-castle.
being as useful a place as the rest, this is the fore-part of the Ship above
the Decks over the Bow; Bow.
there is a broad Bow a narrow Bow, so called according to the broadnes or the
thinness: the Bow is the broadest part of the Ship before, compassing the Stem
to the Loufe, Loufe.
which reaches so far as the Bulk-head of the Fore-castle extends. Against
the Bow is the first breach of the Sea, if the Bow be too broad, she will
seldom carry a Bone in her mouth or cut a feather, Cut a feather.
that is, to make a some before her: where a well bowed Ship so swiftly
presses the water, as that it foameth, and in the dark night sparkleth like
fire. If the Bow be too narrow, as before is said, she pitches her head into
the Sea, so that the mean is the best if her after way be answerable. The
Hauses are those great round holes before, Hauses.
under the Beak-head, where commonly is used the Cables when you come to an
Anchor, the bold or high House is the best, for when they lie low in any great
sea, they will take in very much water, the which to keep out, they build a
circle of plank either abaft or before the maine Mast called the Manger:
Manger.
and a Hause-plug at Sea, now the Fore-castle doth cover all those being built
up like a half deck, to which is fixed the Beake-head, Prow.
and the Prow is the Deck abaft the Fore-castle, whereon lies the Prow
pieces.

The Beak-head.
The Beak-head is without the ship before the fore Castle, supported by the
maine knee, fastened into the stem, all painted and carved as the sterne, and
of great use, as well for the grace and countenance of the ship, as a place for
men to ease themselves in. To it is fastened the collar of the maine stay, and
the fore tacks there brought aboard; also the standing for rigging and trimming
the spretesaile gear, Comb.
under the midest of it is the Comb, which is a little piece of wood with two
holes in it to bring the fore tacks aboard. Bits.
The Bits are two great pieces of timber, and the Crospeece goes thorough them,
Crospeece.
they are ordinarily placed abaft the Manger in the ships loose, to belay the
Cable thereto when you ride at Anchor: Their lower parts are fastened to the
Riders, but the middle part in great ships are bolted to two great beams
cross to the Bows, and yet in extraordinary storms we are glad to make fast
the Cable to the maine M^st for strengthening of the Bits and safety of the
Bows, which have in great storms been torn from the ships. Dauid.
The Dauid is a short piece of timber, at the end whereof in a notch they hang
a block in a strap called the Fish-block, Fish-block.
by which they hale up the flook of the Anchor to the Ships bow, Cat.
it is put out betwixt the Cat and the Loufe, and to be removed when you
please. The Cat is also a short piece of timber aloft right over the Hawse; in
the end it hath two shivers in a bloc^e, wherein is reeued a Rope, to which is
fastened a great hooke of Iron, to trice up the Anchor from the Hawse to the top
of the fore-castle.

A Bulks head is like a seeling or a wall of boards thwart the Ship, as the
Gunroome, the great Cabin, the bread room, A Bulks head.
the quarter Deck, or any other such division: but them which doth make close
the fore-castle, and the half Deck, the Mariners call the Cubbridge heads,
Cubbridge head.
wherein are placed murderers, and abaft Falcons, Falconets, or Rabinits to
clear the Decks fore and aft so well as upon the ships sides, to defend the
ship and offend an enemy. Sockets.
Sockets are the holes wherein the pintels of the murderers or fowlers go
into. The hollow arching betwixt the lower part of the Gallery and the
Transome, is called the lower Counter; Low Counter. Upper Counter.
the upper Counter is from the Gallery to the arch of the round house,
Brackets.
and the Brackets are little carved knees to support the Galleries.

The Stearage room, is before the great Cabin, The Stearage. Great Cabin.
where he that steareth the Ship doth always stand, before him is a square box
nailed together with wooden pins, called a Bittacle, because iron nailes
would attract the Compass; Bittacle.
this is built so close, The Compass.
that the Lamp or Candle only shows light to the stearage, and in it always
stands the Compass, which every one knows is a round box, and in the midst of
the bottom a sharpe pin called a Center whereon the Fly doth play, which is a
round piece of pace-boord, with a small wire under it touched with the
Load-stone, in the midst of it is a little brass Cap that doth keep it level
upon the Center. On the upper part is painted 32. points of the Compass
covered with glass to keep it from dust, breaking, or the wind; this Box doth
hang in two or three brass circles, so fixed they give such way to the moving
of the Ship that still the Box will stand steady: there is also a dark
Compass, A dark Compass. A Compass for Variation.
and a Compass for the variation, yet they are but as the other, only the
dark Compass hath the points black and white, and the other only touched
for the true North and South. Upon the Bittacle is also the Trauas, The Trauas.
which is a little round board full of holes upon lines like the Compass, upon
which by the removing of a little stick they keep an account, how many
glasses (which are but half hours) they steer upon every point. The
Whip-staffe is that piece of wood like a strong staff the Stearsman or
Helmesman hath always in his hand, The Whip-staffe
going thorough the Roll, The Roll.
and then made fast to the Tiller with a Ring.

The Tiller.
The Tiller is a strong piece of wood made fast to the Rudder, Rudder.
which is a great timber somewhat like a Plank, made according to the burden
of the ship, and hung at the sterne upon hooks and hinges, Pintels. Gudgions
or Rudder-Irons. The Gun-roome.
they call Pintels and Gudgions, or Rudder-irons. The Tiller plays in the
Gun-roome over the Ordnances by the Whip-staffe; whereby the Rudder is so
turned to and fro as the Helmesman pleases, and the Cat holes are over the
Ports, Catholes.
right with the Capstaine as they can, to heave the Ship a sterne by a Cable or
a Hauser called a sterne-fast. On each side the Stearage room are diverse
Cabins, as also in the great Cabin, the quarter Deck, and the round house,
with many convenient seats or Lockers to put any thing in, Lockers.
as in little Cupberts.

The bread-roome.
The Bread-roome is commonly under the Gun-roome, well dried or plated. The
Cook-roome where they dress their victual may be placed in diverse places of
the Ship, Cooke-roome.
as sometimes in the Hold, but that oft spoils the victual by reason of the
heat, but commonly in Merchantmen it is in the Fore-castle, especially being
contrived in Fornaces; besides in a chase their Sterne is that part of the ship
they most use in fight, but in a man of war they fight most with their Prow,
and it is very troublesome to the use of his Ordnance, and very dangerous lying
over the Powder-roome, some do place it over the Hatches way, but that as the
Stewards room are ever to be contrived according to the Ships employment, c.
Calking.
Calking is beating Okum into every seam or betwixt plank and plank, Okum.
and Okum is old Ropes torn in pieces like Towze Match, or Hurds of Flax,
which being close beat into every seam with a calking Iron and a Maller,
Calking-Iron.
which is a hammer of wood and an iron chissell, Paying.

possible; by joining Plank to Plank. Graving is only under water, Graving.
a white mix ur of Tallow, Soap and Brimstone; or Trainoile, Rosin, and
Brimstone boiled together, is the best to preserve her calking and make her
glib or slippery to pass the water; and when it is decayed by weeds, or
Barnacles, Barnacles, or Worms.
which is a kind of fish like a long red worm, will eat thorough all the
Planks if she be not sheathed, which is as casing the Hull under water with
Tar, and Hair, close covered over with thin boards fast nailed to the Hull,

she cannot endure the Tar. Breaming her, is but washing or burning of all the
filth with reeds or broom, either in a dry dock or upon her Careene, which is,
Careene.
to make her so light as you may bring her to lye on the one side so much as
may be in the calmest water you can, but take head you ouerset her not; and
this is the best way to Breame Ships of great burden, or ^liose have but 4.
sharpe Flores for fear of bruising or ouersetting. Parsling.
Parsling is most used upon the Decks and half Decks; which is, to take a list
of Canvas so long as the seam is you would parsell, being first well calked,
then power hot pitch upon it, and it will keep out the water from passing the
seames. There remains nothing now as I can remember to the building the Hull
of a Ship, nor the definition of her most proper terms, but only s^eling the
Cabins and such other parts as you please, and to bind an end with all things
fitting for the Sea, as you may read in the Covenants betwixt the Carpenter
and the Owner, which are thus.

Notes for a Covenant between the Carpenter and the Owner.
If you would have a Ship built of 400. Tuns, she requires a plank of 4.
inches: if 300. Tuns, 3. inches: small Ships 2. inches, but none less. For
clamps, middle bands and sleepers, they be all of six inch plank for binding
within. The rest for the sparring up of the works of square three inch plank.
Lay the beams of the Orlope, if she be 400. Tuns at ten foot deep in howl,
and all the beams to be bound with two knees at each end, and a stardard knee
at every beams end upon the Orlope, all the Orlope to be laid with square
three inch plank, and all the planks to be treenailed to the beams.

Six foot would be between the beams of the Deck and Orlope, and ten ports on
each side upon the lower Orlope, all the binding between them should be with
three inch or two inch plank, and the upper Deck should be laid with so many
beams as are fitting with knees to bind them; laying that Deck with spruce
Deal of thirty foot long, the sap cut off, and two inches thick, for it is
better than any other.

Then for the Captains Cabben or great Cabben, the Stearage, the half Deck,
the Round house, the Fore-castle, and to bind an end with the Capsterne and
all things fitting for the Sea, the Smiths work, the carving, joining, and
painting excepted, are the principal things I remember to be observed, for a
Charter-party betwixt the Merchant, the Master, and the Owner, you have
Presidents of all sorts in most Scriveners shops.

CHAP. III. How to proportion the Masts and Yards for a Ship, by her Beam and
Keele.
WHen a ship is built, she should be masted, A Ship ouermasted.
wherein is a great deal of experience to be used so well as art; for if you
ouermast her, either in length or bigness, she will lie too much down by a
wind, and labour too much a hull, and that is called a Taunt-mast, but if
either too small or too short, Taunt-masted.
she is under masted or low masted, Vnder-masted.
and cannot bear so great a sail as should give her her true way. For a man
of war, a well ordered Taunt-mast is best, but for a long voyage, a short
Mast will bear more Canvas, and is less subject to bear by the board:
Their Rules are diverse, because no Artist can build a Ship so truly to
proportion, neither set her Masts, but by the trial of her condition, they may
be impaired or amended: suppose a Ship of 300. An example.
Tons be 29. foot at the Beam, if her maine Mast be 24. inches diameter, the
length of it must be 24. yards, for every inch in thickness is allowed a yard
in length, and the fore Mast 22. inches in thickness, must be 22. yards in
length; your Bowl spret both in length and thickness must be equal to the
^ore Mast, the Misen 17. yards in length, and 17. inches diameter.

But the Rule most used is to take the parts of the breadth of the Ship, and
multiply that by three, The rule most used.
will give you so many foot as your maine Mast should be in length, the
bigness or thickness will bear it also, allowing an inch for a yard; but if
it be a made Mast, A made Mast, or an arm Mast.
that is greater than one Tree, it must be more: for example, suppose the Ships
breadth 30. foot, four fifts of 30. foot are 24. foot, so you find the maine
Mast must be 24. yards long, for every yard is 3. foot and 24. inches thorough,
allowing an inch to every yard. The fore Mast is to be in length of the maine
Mast, which will be 20. yards wanting one part of a yard, and 20. inches
thorough. The Boulspret must ever be equal with the fore Mast. The misen Mast
half the length of the maine Mast, which will be 12. yards long, and 12.
inches diameter. Now as you take the proportion of the Masts from the Beam or
breadth of the Ships, so do you the length of the yards from the Keele.

The Steps.
These Masts have each their steps in the Ship, and their partners at every
Deck where thorough they pass to the Keele, Partners.
being strong timbers bolted to the Beams in circling the Masts, to keep them
steady in their steps fast wedged for rolling; yet some ships will not sail so
well as when it doth play a little, but that is very dangerous in foul weather.
Their Cotes are p^eces of torred Canvas, Cotes. Tarpawling.
or a Tarpawling put about them and the Rudder to keep the water out. At the
top of the fore Mast and maine Mast are spliced cheeks, Cheeks.
or thick clamps of wood, thorough which are in each two holes called the
Hounds, The Hounds.
wherein the Ties do run to hoise the yards, but the top Mast hath but one
hole or hound, The Cap.
and one tie. Every Mast also hath a Cap if a top; which is a piece of square
timber with a round hole in it to receive the top Masts or Flag-staffe, to
keep them steady and strong, left they be borne by the board in a stiff gale.
The Crosse-trees are also at the head of the Masts, Cross-trees.
one let into another cross, Tressel-trees.
and strongly bolted with the Tressell trees, to keep up the top Masts which
are fastened in them, and those are at the tops of each Mast; all the Masts
stand upright but the Boulspret which lies along over the Beak-head, and that
timber it rests on is called the Pillow. Pillow.


An example of the Yards by the Keele.
Now for the yards, suppose the ship be 76. foot at the Keele, her maine yard
must be 21. yards in length, and in thickness but 17. inches. The fore Yard
19. yards long, and 15. inches diameter or thick. The spret-saile Yard 16.
yards long, and but nine inches thick, and your Mizzen-yard so long as the
Mast, the top yards bears half proportion to the maine, and fore yard, and
the top gallants, the half to them, but this rule is not absolute; for if your
Masts be taunt, your yards must be the shorter; if a low Mast, the longer, but
this is supposed the best. To have the maine Yard ^ parts of her Keele in
length: the top Yard of the maine Yard, and the maine Yard for bigness parts
of an inch, for a yard in length. The length of the fore Yard ^ of the maine
Yard; the Crosse^acke Yard and Spretsaile Yard to be of a length; but you must
allow the Misen Yard and Spretsaile Yard inch of thickness to a yard in
length. But to give a true Arithmetical and Geometrical proportion for the
building of all sorts of Ships, were they all built after one mould, as also of
their Masts, Yards, Cables, Cordage, and Sails, were all the stuff of like
goodness, a methodical rule as you see might be proiected: but their
lengths, bredths, depths, rakes and burdens are so variable and different,
that nothing but experience can possibly teach it.

CHAP. IIII. The names of all the Masts, Tops, and Yards belonging to a Ship.
THe Boul-spret, the Spretsaile yard, the Spretsaile top-mast; the Spretsaile
top sail yard; the fore Mast, the fore yard, the fore top-mast, the fore
top-saile yard, the fore top gallant Mast, the fore top gallant sail yard,
Cores, Wouldings, Gromits, and, Staples for all yards. The maine Mast, the
maine Yard, the Maine Top. The maine top Mast; the maine top-saile Yard. The
top gallant Mast, the maine top gallant sail Yard. The Trucke is a square
piece of wood at the top wherein you put the Flag-staffe. The Misen, the Misen
Yard, the Misen top mast, the Misen top sail yard. The Cross Jack. In great
ships they have two Misens, the latter is called the Bonauenture Misen. A Jury
Mast, that is, when a Mast is borne by the board, with Yards, Roofs, Trees, or
what they can, spliced or fished together they make a Iury-mast, woulding or
binding them with ropes fast triced together with handspikes, as they use to
would or bind any Mast or Yard.

CHAP. V. How all the Tackling and Rigging of a Ship is made fast one to
another, with their names, and the reasons of their use.
Riggage or Cordage.
THe rigging a Ship, is all the Ropes or Cordage belonging to the Masts and
Yards; A Mast well rigged.

A Yard well rigged.


and it is proper to say, The Mast is well rigged, or the Yard is well rigged,
that is, when all the Ropes are well sised to a true proportion of her burden.
We say also, when they are too many or too great, Over rigged.
she is ouer-rigged, and doth much wrong a Ship in her sailing; for a small
weight aloft, is much more in that nature than a much greater below, and the
more upright any Ship goes, the better she saileth.

All Masts have stays except one.

A Collar. A Lannier.


All the Masts, Top-masts, and Flag-staues have stays, excepting the Spret
saile-top Mast, the Maine Masts stay is made fast by a Lannier to a Collar,
which is a great Rope that comes about the head and Boulspret, the other end to
the head of the maine Mast. The maine top-Masts stay is fastened to the head of
the fore Mast by a strop and a dead mans eye. Dead men's eyes.
The maine top-gallant Masts stay in like manner to the head of the fore
top-Mast. The fore Masts and stays belonging to them in like manner are
fastened to the Boulspret, and Spretsaile top-Mast, and those stays do help
to stay the Boulspret. The Misen stays do come to the maine Mast, and the
Misen top-Mast stays to the shrouds with Crowes-feet: Crowes-feet.
the use of those stays are to keep the Masts from falling aftwards, or too
much forwards. Those Lanniers are many small Ropes recued into the dead men's
eyes of all shrouds, either to slaken them or set them taught; also all the
stays have their blocks, and dead men's eyes have Lanniers. Dead men's eyes are
blocks, some small, some great, with many holes but no shivers, the Crowes-feet
re^ued ^horow them are a many of small lines, sometimes 6.8. or 10. but of
small use more than for fashion to make the Ship show full of small Ropes.
Blocks or Pullies are thick pieces of wood having shivers in them, Blocks or
Pullies. Shivers.
which is a little Wheel fixed in the midst with a Cock or Pin, A Cock.
some are Brass, but the most of Wood, whereon all the running Ropes do
run, some are little, some great, Running ropes.
with 3.4. or 5. shivers in them, and are called by the names of the Ropes
whereto they serve. There are also double blocks, Double blocks.
that where there is use of much strength will purchase with much ease, but not
so fast as the other, and when we hale any Tackle or Haleyard to which two
blocks do belong, when they meet, we call that block and block. Block and
block.


The Shrouds are great Ropes which go up either sides of all Masts. All Masts
have Shrouds, c.
The Misen maine Mast fore Mast shrouds have as their lower ends dead men's eyes
seized into them, and are set up taught by Lanniers to the chains; at the
other end, over the heads of those Masts are pendants, for Tackels and Swifters
under them. The top-Masts shrouds in like manner are fastened with Lanniers and
dead men's eyes to the Puttocks or plats of iron belonging to them, aloft over
the head of the Mast as the other: Chains.
and the Chains are strong plates of iron fast bolted into the Ships side by
the Chaine-waile. When the Shrouds are too stiff, we say, ease them, To Ease.
Taught.
when too slack, we say, set Taught the Shrouds, but the Boulspret hath no
Shrouds, and all those small ropes do cross the Shrouds like steps are called
Ratlings. Ratlings. Puttocks.
The Puttocks go from the Shrouds of the fore Mast, maine Mast or Misen, to
go off from the Shrouds into the Top, Cap, or Bowl, which is a round thing at
the head of either Mast for men to stand in, for when the Shrouds come near
the top of the Mast, they fall in so much, that without the Puttocks you could
not get into the Top, and in a manner they are a kind of a Shroud. Pendants.
A Pendant is a short rope made fast at one end to the head of the Mast or the
Yards arm, having at the other end a block with a shiver to reeue some
running rope in, as the Pendants of the back stays and Tackles hang a little
down on the inside of the Shrouds: all Yards-armes have them but the Misen,
into which the Braces are reeued, and also there are Pendants or Streamers hang
from the yards arms, made of Taffa^y, or coloured flanell cloth to beautify
the Ship only: Parrels.
Parrels are little round Balls called Trucks, and little pieces of wood called
ribs, Ribs.
and ropes which do incircle the Masts, and so made fast to the Yards, that
the Yards may slip up and down easily upon the Masts, and with the help of
the Brest-rope doth keep the Yard close to the Mast. Brest-ropes. Standing
ropes.
The standing ropes are the shrouds and stays, because they are not removed,
except it be to be eased or set taughter.

The Tackles or ropes run in three parts, The Tackles are of diverse sorts, c.
having a Pendant with a block at the one end, and a block with a hooke at
the other, to heave any thing in or out of the ship; they are of diverse sorts,
as the Botes tackles made fast the one to the fore shrouds, the other to the
maine, to hoise the Boat in or out: also the tackles that keep firm the Masts
from straying. The Gunners tackles for haling in or out the Ordnances: but the
winding tackle is the greatest, which is a great double block with three
shivers to the end of a small Cable about the head of the Mast, and serves as
a Pendant. To which is made fast a Guy, A Guy.
which is a rope brought to it from the fore mast, to keep the weight upon it
steady, or from swinging to and again* Into the block is reeued a hawser,
which is also reeued thorough another double block, having a strop at the end of
it; which put thorough the eye of the slings is locked into it with a fid, and so
hoise the goods in or out by the help of the Snap-blocke.

Cat harpings are small ropes run in little blocks from one side of the ship
to the other, Cat harpings.
near the upper deck to keep the shrouds tight for the more safety of the
mast from rolling. The Halyards belong to all masts, Halyards.
for by them we hoise the yards to their height, The Ties.
and the Ties are the ropes by which the yards do hang, and do carry up the
yards when we strain the Halyards; the maine yard and fore yard ties are
first reeued thorough the Rams head, then thorough the Hounds, with a turn in the
eye of the slings which are made fast to the yard; the mizzen yard and top yard
have but single Ties, that is, one doth but run in one part, but the Spretsaile
yard hath none, for it is made fast with a pair of slings to the boltspret. A
Horse.
A Horse is a rope made fast to the fore mast shrouds, and the Spretsaile
sheats, to keep those sheats clear of the anchor flookes.

To sling is to make fast any cask, yard, ordnances, To Sling. Slings.
or the like in a pair of Slings, and Slings are made of a rope spliced at
either end into it self with one eye at either end, so long as to be
sufficient to receive the cask, the middle part of the rope also they seize
together, and so makes another eye to hitch the hooke of the tackle, another
sort are made much longer for the hoisting of ordnances, another is a chain of
iron to Sling or bind the yards fast aloft to the crossetre^s in a ^ight, left
the ties should be cut, and so the mast must fall. Canhookes.
The Canhookes are two hooks fastened to the end of a rope with a noose, like
this the Brewers use to ^g or carry their barrels on, and those serve also to
take in or out hog heads, or any other commodities. A Parbunkell.
A Parbunkel is two ropes that have at each end a noose or lump that being
crossed, you may set any vessel that hath but one head upon them, bringing but
the loopes over the upper end of the cask, fix but the tackle to them, and
then the vessel will stand strait in the midst to heave out, or take in
without spilling.

Puddings.
Puddings are ropes nailed round to the yards arms close to the end, a pretty
distance one from another, to save the Robbins from galling upon the yards, or
to serve the anchors ring to save the clinch of the cable from galling.
Robbins.
And the Robbins are little lines reeued into the eyelet holes of the sail
under the head ropes, to make fast the sail to the yard, for in stead of
tying, sea men always say, Headlines.

yard.

Furling lines.
Furling lines are small lines made fast to the top sail, top gallant sail, A
smiting line.
and the mizzen yards arms. The mizzen hath but one called the smiting line,
the other on each side one, and by these we farthell or bind up the sails.
Brales.
The Brales are small ropes reeued thorough Blocks seized on each side the ties,
and come down before the sail, and at the very skirt are fastened to the
Creengles, with them we furl or farthell our sails across, and they belong
only to the two courses and the mizzen: to hale up the Brales, or brale up the
sail, Creengles.
is all one; Creengles are little ropes spliced into the Bolt-ropes of all
sails belonging to the maine and fore mast, to which the bolings bridles are
made fast, and to hold by when we shake off a Bonnet.

Bolt ropes.
Boltropes is that rope is sowed about every sail, soft and gently twisted, for
the better sowing and handling the sails. Bunt lines.
Bunt lines is but a small rope made fast to the midst of the Boltrope to a
creengle reeued thorough a small block which is seized to the yard, to trice or
draw up the Bunt of the sail, Clew Garnet.
when you farthell or make it up. The Clew garnet is a rope made fast to the
clew of the sail, and from thence runs in a block seized to the middle of
the yard, which in furling doth hale up the clew of the sail close to the
middle of the yard, Clew line.
and the clew line is the same to the top s^iles top gallant and spret sails,
as the Clew garnet is to the maine and foresailes. The Clew of a sail is the
lowest corner next the Sheat and Tackes, A Clew.
and stretches somewhat goaring or sloping from the square of the sail, and
according to the Goaring she is said to spread a great or a little clew.
Goaring. Tackes.
Tackes are great ropes which having a wall-knot at one end seized into the
clew of the sail, and so reeued first thorough the chestres, and then comes in
at a hole in the ships sides, this doth carry forward the clew of the sail to
make it stand close by a wind. Sheats.
The Sheats are bent to the clews of all sails, in the low sails they hale
aft the clew of the sails, but in top sails they serve to hale them home,
that is, to bring the clew close to the yards arm. The Braces belong to all
yards but the mizzen, every yard hath two reeued at their ends thorough two
pendants, Braces.
and those are to square the yards, or trauasse them as you please. The Boling
is made fast to the leech of the sail about the midst to make it stand the
sharper or closer by a wind, Boling.
it is fastened by two, three, or four ropes like a crows foot to as many
parts of the sail which is called the Boling bridles, Boling bridles.
only the mizzen Boling is fastened to the lower end of the yard, this rope
belongs to all sails except the Spretsaile, and Spret-saile Top-saile, which
not having any place to hale it forward by, they cannot use those sails by a
wind: sharp the maine Boling is to hall it taught: Sharp the Boling.

Ch^cke the Boling.

Lee fanng.


hale up the Boling is to pull it harder forward on: check or ease the Boling
is to let it be more slick.

Lee fanngs is a rope reeued into the creengles of the courses, when we would
hale in the bottom of the sail, to lash on a bonnet or take in the sail;
Reeuing.
and Reeuing is but drawing a rope thorough a block or oylet to run up and
down. Leech lines.
Leech lines are small ropes made fast to the Leech of the top-sailes, for they
belong to no other; and are reeued into a block at the yard close by the
top-saile ties, to hale in the Leech of the sail when you take them in. Leech
of a sail.
The Leech of a sail is the outward side of a skirt of a sail, from the
earing to the clew; Earings.
and the Earing is that part of the bunt rope which at all the four corners of
the sail is left open as it were a ring. The two vpmost parts are put over the
ends of the yards arms, and so made fast to the yards, and the lowermost are
seized or Bent to the sheats, Bent.
and tackes into the clew. Lifts.
The Lifts are two ropes which belong to all yards arms, to top the yards;
that is, to make them hang higher or lower at your pleasure. But the top-saile
Lifts do serve for sheats to the top gallant yards, the haling them is called
the Topping the Lifts, Topping the Lifts. Legs.
as top a starboard, or top a port.

Legs.
Legs are small ropes put thorough the bolt ropes of the maine and fore sail,
near to a foot in length, spliced each end into the other in the leech of the
sail, having a little eye whereunto the martnets are fastened by two hitches,
Martnet.
and the end seized into the standing parts of the martners, which are also
small lines like crow feet reeued thorough a block at the top mast head, and so
comes down by the mast to the deck; but the top-saile martnets are made fast
to the head of the top gallant mast, and comes but to the top, where it is
haled and called the top marnets, they serve to bring that part of the leech
next the yards arm up close to the yard, Latchets.
Latchets are small lines sowed in the Bonnets and Drablers like loops to lash
or make fast the Bonnet to the course, Lashing.

The Loose hook.


or the course to the Drabler, which we call lashing the Bonnet to the course,
or the Drabler to the Bonnet. The Loose hooke is a tackle with two hooks, one
to hitch into a chingle of the maine, or fore sail, in the bolt rope in the
leech of the sail by the cl^w, Bouse.
and the other to strap spliced to the chestres to bouse or pull down the
sail to succour the tackes in a stiff gale of wind, A Bonnet.

A Drabler.

A Course.


or take off or put on a Bonnet or a Drabler, which are two short sails to
take off or put to the fore course or the maine, which is the fore sail, or
maine sail.

A Knaue-line.
The Knaue-line is a rope hath one end fastened to the cross trees, and so
comes down by the ties to the R^ms head, to which is seized a small piece of
wood some two foot long with a hole in the end, whereunto the line is reeued,
and brought to the ships side, and h^led taught to the Rails to keep the ties
and Halyards from turning about one another when they are new. Knettels are two
rope yarnes twisted together, and a knot at each end, Knettels.
whereunto to seas a block, a rope, or the like. Rope yarnes.
Rope yarnes are the yarnes of any rope untwisted, they serve to sarue small
ropes, or make Sinnet, Mats, Plats, or Caburnes, and make up the sails at the
yards arms.

Sinnet is a string made of rope yarn commonly of two, four, six, Sinnet.
eight or nine strings platted in three parts, which being beat flat they use
it to sarue ropes or Mats. That which we call a Paunch, are broad clouts, Mats
or Paunch.
woven of Thrums and Sinnet together, to save things from galling about the
maine and fore yards at the ties, and also from the masts, and upon the
Boltspret, Louse, Beakehead or Gunwaile to save the clewes of the sails from
galling or fretting. Caburne.
Caburne is a small line made of spun yarn to make a bend of two Cables, or to
seas the Tackels, Ceasing.
or the like. Ceasing is to bind fast any ropes together, with some small rope
yarn. Marline is any line, to a block, or any tackell, Pendant, Garnet, or
the like. There is also a rope by which the Boat doth ride by the ships side,
Seasen.

Sarue or Siruis.


which we cal a Seasen. To sarue any rope with plats or Sinnet, is but to lay
Sinnet, Spun yarn, Rope yarn, or a piece of Canvas upon the rope, and then
roll it fast to keep the rope from galling about the shrouds at the head of
the masts, the Cable in the Hawse, the flooke of the Anchor, Spunyarne.
the Boat rope or any thing. Spunyarne is nothing but rope yarn made small at
the ends, Caskets.
and so spun one to another so long as you will with a winch. Also Caskets are
but small ropes of Sinnet made fast to the gromits or rings upon the yards, the
longest are in the midst of the yards betwixt the ties, and are called the
breast Caskets, hanging on each side the yard in small lengths, only to bind up
the sail when it is furled.

Marling is a small line of untwisted hemp, Marling.
very pliant and well tarred, to seas the ends of Ropes from raueling out, or
the sides of the blocks at their arses, or if the sail r^ntout of the
Boltrope, they will make it fast with marlin till they have leisure to mend it.
Marling spike.
The marling spike, is but a small piece of iron to splice ropes together, or
open the bolt rope when you sew the sail. Splicing.
Splicing is so to let one ropes end into another they shall be as fitme as if
they were but one rope, A round Splice.

A cut Splice.


and this is called a round Splice; but the cut Splice is to let one into
another with as much distance as you will, and yet be strong, and undo when
you will. Now to make an end of this discourse with a knot, A Knot.
you are to know, A Wall knot.
Sea-men use three, the first is called the Wall knot, which is a round knob,
so made with the strouds or lays of a rope, it cannot slip; the Sheates,
Takes, and Stoppers use this knot. A Boling knot.
The Boling knot is also so firmly made and fastened by the bridles into the
creengles of the sails, they will break, or the sail split before it will
slip. The last is the Shepshanke, which is a knot they cast upon a Runner or
Tackle when it is too long to take in the goods, Sheepshanks Knot.
and by this knot they can shorten a rope without cutting it, as much as they
lift, and presently undo it again, and yet never the worse.

CHAP. VI. What doth belong to the Boats and Skiff with the definition of all
those thirteen Ropes which are only properly called Ropes belonging to a ship
and the Boat and their use.
OF Boats there are diverse sorts, but those belonging to ships, A long Boat.
are called either the long Boat or ships Boat, which should be able to weigh
her sheat anchor, those will live in any reasonable sea, especially the long
Boat; A Shallop.

A Skiff.


great ships have also other small Boats called Shallops and Skiffes, which are
with more ease and less trouble rowed to and again upon any small occasion.
To a Boat belongs a mast and sail, a stay sheat Halyard, Rudder Rudder irons,
as to a ship, also in any discovery they use a Tarpawling, Tarpawling.

Bailes.


which in a good piece of Canvas washed over with Tar, to cover the Bailes or
hoops over the sterne of their Boat, where they lodge in an harbour which is
that you call a Tilt covered with wadmall in your Wherries; or else an Awning,
Awning.
which is but the bo^s sail, or some piece of an old sail brought over the
yard and stay, and boumed out with the boat hooke, so spread over their heads,
which is also much used, as well a shore as in a ship, especially in hot
countries to keep men from the extremity of heat or wet which is very oft
infectious. Thoughts are the sea^s whereon the Rowers fit; Thoughts.

Thowles.


and Thowles small pins put into little holes in the Gunwaile or upon the Boats
side, against which they bear the oars when they row, they have also a Daued,
and also in long Boats a windless to weigh the anchor by, which is with more
ease than the ship can. The two arching timbers against the Boat head are
called Carlings. Man the Boat is to put a Gang of men, which is a company into
her, A Gang.
they are commonly called the Coxswaine Gang who hath the charge of her. Free
the Boat is to bail or cast out the water. Free or Bail.
Trim the Boat is to keep her stright. Trim Boat.

Wind Boat.

Hold water.

Forbear.

A Spell.


Wind the Boat is to bring her head the other way. Hold water is to stay her.
Forbear is to hold still any oar you are commanded, or on the broad, or whole
side. A fresh Spell is to relieve the Rowers with another Gang, give the Boat
more way for a dram of the bottle, who says Amends, one and all, Vea, vea,
vea, Vea, vea, vea.
vea, vea, that is, they pull all strongly together.

The Entering rope is tied by the ships side, The Entering rope.
to hold by as you go up the Entering ladder, cleats, or wails.

The Bucket rope that is tied to the Bucket by which you hale and draw water up
by the ships side. Bucket rope.


The Bolt ropes are those wherein the sails are sowed. Bolt ropes.


The Port ropes hale up the Ports of the Ordnances. Port ropes.


The Jear rope is a piece of a hawser made fast to the ^eare rope.
maine yard, another to the fore yard close to the ties, reeued thorough a block
which is seized close to the top, and to comes down by the mast, and is reeued
thorough another block at the bottom of the mast close by the deck; great
ships have on each side the ties one, but small ships none: the use is to help
to hoise up the yard to succour the ties, which though they break yet they
would hold up the mast.

Preuenter rope.
The Preuenter rope is a little one seized cross over the ^ies, that if one
part of them should break, yet the other should not run thorough the Rams head
to endanger the yard.

Top ropes.
The Top ropes are those wherewith we set or strike the maine or fore Top masts,
it is reeued thorough a great block seized under the Cap, reeued thorough the
heel of the Top mast thwart ships, and then made fast to a ring with a clinch
on the other side the Cap, the other part comes down by the ties, reeued into
the Knights, and so brought to the Capstaine when they set the Top masts.

Keele ropes.
The Keele rope, you have read in the building, is of hair in the Keele to
scower the Limber holes.

Rudder rope.
The Rudder rope is reeued thorough the stem post, and goes thorough the head of
the Rudder, and then both ends spliced together, serves to save the Rudder if
it should be struck off the irons.

Cat rope.
The Cat rope is to hale up the Cat.

Boy rope.
The Boy rope is that which is tied to the boy by the one end, and the anchors
flooke by the other.

Boat rope.
The Boat rope is that which the ship doth tow her Boat by, at her sterne.

Guest rope. Shearing.
The Guest rope is added to the Boat rope when she is towed at the ships
sterne, to keep her from shearing, that is, from swinging to and again; for
in a stiff gale she will make such yawes, and have such girds, it would
endanger her to be torn in pieces, Swifting.
but that they use to swift her, that is, to incircle the Gunwaile with a good
rope, and to that make fast the Guest rope.

Chap. VII. The names of all sorts of Anchors, Cables, and Sails, and how they
bear their proportions, with their use. Also how the Ordnances should be
placed, and the goods stowed in a ship.
THe proper terms belonging to Anchors are many: the least are called
Kedgers, A Kedger.
to use in calm weather in a slow stream, or to kedg up and down a narrow
River, which is when they fear the wind or tide may drive them on shore; they
row by her with an Anchor in a boat, and in the midst of the stream, or
where they find most fit if the Ship come too near the shore, and so by a
Hawser wind her head about, then weigh it again till the like occasion, and
this is kedging. There is also a stream Anchor not much bigger, Stream
Anchor.

The first.

Second.

Third Anchor.

Sheat Anchor.


to stem in easy stream or tide. Then there is the first, second, and third
Anchor, yet all such as a Ship in fair weather may ride by, and are called Bow
Anchors. The greatest is the sheat Anchor, and never used but in great
necessity. They are commonly made according to the burden of the Ship by
proportion, for that the sheat Anchor of a small ship will not serve for a
Kedger to a great ship. An Anchors shank.

Flook.

Shoulder.

Beam or Nut.

Eye.

Ring.

Stock.


Also it bears a proportion in it self, as the one flooke, which is that
doth stick in the ground, is but the third part of the shank in length; at
the head of the Shank there is a hole called an Eye, and in it a Ring, wherein
is the Nut to which there is fast fixed a Stock of wood crossing the Flookes,
and the length is taken from the length of the Shank. These differ not in
shape but in weight, from two hundred, to three or four thousand weight.
Grapells, or Graplings, are the least of all, and have four flookes but no
stock; for a boat to ride by, or to throw into a ship in a fight, to pull down
the gratings or hold fast.

A Cable, the first, second, and third.
The Cables also carry a proportion to the Anchors, but if it be not three
stroud, it is accounted but a Hawser, yet a great ships Hawser may be a Cable
to the sheat Anchor for a small ship: and there is the first, second, and third
Cable, besides the Sheat Anchor Cable. Sheat Anchor

Cable.

Keckell.


If the Cable be well made, we say it is well laid. To keckell or sarue the
Cable, as is said, is but to bind some old clouts to keep it from galling in
the Hawse or Ring. Splice.
Splice a Cable, is to fasten two ends together, that it may be double in
length, to make the Ship ride with more ease, A shot of Cable.

Quoile.

A Fake.

Pay.

Pay cheap.


and is called a shot of Cable. Quoile a Cable, is to lay it up in a round
Ring; or fake one above another. Pay more Cable, is when you carry an Anchor
out in the boat to turn over. Pay cheap, is when you over set it, or turns it
over board faster. Veere more Cable, End for end.
is when you ride at Anchor. And end for end is when the Cable runs clear
out of the Hawse, or any Rope out of his shiver. A Bight.
A Bight is to hold by any part of a coil, A Bitter.
that is, the vpmost fake. A Bitter is but the turn of a Cable about the Bits,
and veare it out by little and little. And the Bitters end is that part of the
Cable doth stay within board. A Bitters end.
Gert.
Gert, is when the Cable is so taught that upon the turning of a tide, a Ship
cannot go over it.

To bend.
To bend the Cable to the Anchor, is to make it fast to the Ring; Vnbend.
vnbend the Cable, is but to take it away, which we usually do when we are at
Sea, and to tie two ropes or Cables together is called bending. Bending.

Hitch.


Hitch, is to catch hold of any thing with a rope to hold it fast, or with a
hooke, as hitch the fish-hooke to the Anchors flooke, Fenders.

Iunkes.


or the Tackles into the Garnets of the Slings. Fenders are pieces of old
Hawsers called Iunkes hung over the ship sides to keep them from bruising. In
boats they use poles or boathooks to fend off the boat from bruising. Breast
fast.
A Brest-fast is a rope which is fastened to some part of the Ship forward on,
to hold her head to a wharf or any thing, Stern fast.
and a Sterne-fast is the same in the Sterne. The use for the Hawser is to warp
the Ship by, which is laying out an Anchor, and wind her up to it by a
Capsterne. Rousing.
Rousing is but pulling the slackness of any Cables with men's hands into the
Ship. Shank-panter.
The Shank painter is a short chain fastend under the fore masts shrouds with
a bolt to the ships sides, and at the other end a rope to make fast the Anchor
to the Bow. Stop.
To stop is when you come to an Anchor, and veares out your Cable, but by
degrees till the Ship ride well, then they say stop the Ship. To those Cables
and Anchors belongs short pieces of wood called Boys, Boys.
or close hooped barrels like Tankards as is said, but much shorter, to show
you the Anchor and help to weigh it, there is another sort of Cans called Can
Boys much greater, Can Boys.
mored upon shoules to give Mariners warning of the dangers.

The maine sail and the fore sail is called the fore course, Sails.

Maine Sail.

Fore Sail.

Maine course.

Fore course.

Bonits.

Drablers.


and the maine course or a pair of courses. Bonits and Drablers are commonly
one third part a piece to the sail they belong unto in depth, but their
proportion is uncertain; for some will make the maine sail so deep, that
with a shallow bonet they will cloth all the Mast without a Drabler, but
without bonets we call them but courses; we say, lash on the bonet to the
course, because it is made fast with La^chets into the eylot holes of the
sail, Maine top Sail.

Fore top Sail.

Top gallant Sails.

Studding Sails.


as the Drabler is to it, and used as the wind permits. There is also your
maine top-saile, and fore top-saile, with their top-gallant sails, and in a
fair gail your studding sails, which are bolts of Canvas, or any cloth
that will hold wind, we ex^end along the side of the maine sail, and boomes
i^ out with a boome or long pole, which we use also sometimes to the clew of
the maine sail, fore sail, and spret sail, Misen.

Misen top Sail.

Spret sail.

Spretsaile top.

Sail.

Drift Sail.


when you go before the wind or quartering, else not. Your Miszen, and Miszen
top-saile, your Spret and Spret top-saile, as the rest, take all their names of
their yards. A Drift sail is only used under water, veared out right a head
by sheats, to keep the Ships head right upon the Sea in a storm, or when a
ship drives too fast in a current. Netting Sail.
A Netting sail is only a sail laid over the Netting, Nettings.
which is small ropes from the top of the fore castle to the Poop, stretched
upon the ledges from the Waist-trees to the Rouse-trees, Waist-trees.

Rouse-trees.


which are only small Timbers to bear up the Gratings from the half Deck to
the fore-castle, Stantions.

Gratings.


supported by Stantions that rest upon the half Deck; and this Netting or
Grating, which is but the like made of wood, you may set up or take down when
you please, and is called the close fights fore and aft. Head Sails.
Now the use of those sails is thus, all head Sails which are those belonging
to the fore Mast and Boltsprer, do keep the Ship from the wind or to fall
off. After Sails.
All after sails, that is, all the sails belonging to the maine Mast and
Miszen keeps her to wind ward, therefore few ships will steer upon quarter
winds with one sail, but must have one after sail, and one head sail. The
sails are cut in proportion as the Masts and Yards are in breadth and length,
but the Spret-saile is ^ parts the depth of the fore sail, and the Miszen by
the Leech twice so deep as the Mast is long from the Deck to the Hounds.
Leech.
The Leech of a sail is the outward side or skirt of the sail from the earing
to the clew, the middle betwixt which we account the Leech. The Clew.
The Clew is the lower corner of a Sail, to which you make fast your Sheats
and Tacks, or that which comes goring out from the square of the sail, Goring.
for a square sail hath no Clew, but the mainesaile must be cut goring,
because the Tacks will come closer aboard, and so cause the sail to hold more
wind; now when the Sail is large and hath a good Clew, we say she spreds a
large Clew, or spreds much Canvas. In making those sails they use two sorts of
seames down the Sails, which doth sow the breadth of the Canvas together, A
Monk seam.

A Round seam.


the one we call a Munke seam, which is flat, the other a round seam, which
is so called because it is round.

The Ship being thus provided, there wants yet her Ordnances, which should be
in greatness according to her building in strength and burden, but the
greatest commonly lies lowest, which we call the lower tier, if she be
furnished fore and aft. Likewise the second Tier, A Tier.

Third.

Second.

Half a Tier.


and the third, which are the smallest. The fore-Castle and the half Deck
being also furnished, we account half a Tier.

Sowage or to stow, Stowage.

To Stow.

Ballast.


is to put the goods in Howl in order. The most ponderous next the Ballast,
which is next the Keelson to keep her stiff in the Sea. Balast is either
Gravel, Stones, or Lead, but that which is driest, heaviest, and lies closest
is best. To find a leake, Trench the Ballast.

Shout.


they trench the Ballast, that is, to divide it. The Ballast will sometimes
shoot, that is, run from one side to another, and so will Corn and Salt, if
you make not Pouches or Bulk-heads, which when the Ship doth held is very
dangerous to ouer^et or turn the Keele upwards. For Cask that is so stowed,
tier above tier with Ballast, and canting Coins, Canting Coins.
which are little short pieces of wood or Billets cut with a sharpe ridge or
edge to lye betwixt the Cask; Standing Coins.

To bear.


and standing Coins are Billets or Pipe-staues, to make them they cannot give
way nor stir. The ship will bear much, that is, carry much Ordnance or
goods, or bear much sail; and when you let any thing down into the Howl,
lowering it by degrees, they say, Amain; and being down, Strike.

CHAP. IX. Proper Sea terms for dividing the company at Sea, and stearing,
sailing, or morning a Ship in fair weather, or in a storm.
IT is to be supposed by this the Ship is victualled and manned, the voyage
determined, Steep Tubs.
the steep Tubs in the chains to shift their Beef, Pork, or Fish in salt
water, till the salt be out though not the saltness, and all things else ready
to set sail; but before we go any further, for the better understanding the
rest, a few words for stearing and cunning the Ship would not be amiss. Then
know, Star-boord is the right hand, Lar-boord the left; Starboord.

Larbooad.

Cunning.

Stearing.

Mid-ships.

Port.


Starboord the Helm, is to put the Helm a Starboord, then the ship will go
to the Larbooad. Right your Helm, that is, to keep it in the mid ships, or
right up. Port, that is, to put the Helm to Larbooad, and the Ship will go to
the Starboord, for the Ship will ever go contrary to the Helm. Now by a
quarter wind, they will say aloof, or keep your aloof, keep her to it, A
aloof.

Keep your aloof.

War no more.

No near.

Ease.

Steady.


have a care of your Lee-latch. Touch the wind, and war no more, is no more
but to bid him at the Helm to keep her so near the wind as may be; no near,
ease the Helm, or bear up, is to let her fall to Lee-ward. Steady, that is,
to keep her right upon that point you steer by; Yare.
be yare at the Helm, or a fresh man to the Helm. But he that keeps the Ship
most from yawing doth commonly use the lest motion with the Helm, and those
steer the best.

The Master and company being aboard, he commands them to get the sails to the
yards, Gear.
and about your gear or work on all hands, stretch forward your maine
Halliards, hoise your Sails half mast high. Predy.
Predy, or make ready to set sail, cross your yards, bring your Cable to the
Capsterne, Boatswain setch an Anchor aboard, break ground or weigh Anchor.
Heave a head, men into the Tops, men upon the yards; A Pike.
come, is the Anchor a pike, that is, to heave the Hawse of the ship right over
the Anchor, what is the Anchor away? Tally.
Yea, yea. Let fall your fore-saile. Tally, that is, hale off the Sheats; who
is at the Helm there, coil your Cables in small fakes, hale the Cat, a
Bitter, belay, loose fast your Anchor with your shank-painter, stow the Boat,
set the land, how it bears by the Compass that we may the better know thereby
to keep our account and direct our course, let fall your maine sail, every man
say his private prayer for a boon voyage, out with your spret sail, on with
your bonits Drablers, steer steady keep your course, so, you go well.

How they divide the company at sea, and set, and rule the watch.
When this is done, the Captain or Master commands the Boatswain to call up
the company; the Master being chief of the Starboord watch doth call one, and
his right hand Mate on the Larbooad doth call another, and so forward till they
be divided in two parts, then each man is to choose his Mate, Consort, or
Comrade, and then divide them into squadrons according to your number and
burden of your ship as you see occasion; these are to take their turns at the
Helm, trim sails, pump, and do all duties each half, or each squadron for
eight Glasses or four hours which is a watch, but care would be had that
there be not two Comrades upon one watch because they may have the more room
in their Cabins to rest. And as the Captain and masters Mates, Gunners,
Carpenters, Quartermasters, Trumpeters, c. are to be abast the Mast, so the
Boatswain, and all the Yonkers or common Sailers under his command is to be
before the Mast. The next is, to mess them four to a mess, and then give
every mess a quarter Can of beer and a basket of bread to stay their stomachs
till the Kettle be boiled, that they may first go to prayer, then to supper,
and at six a clock sing a Psalme, say a Prayer, and the Master with his side
begins the watch, then all the rest may do what they will till midnight; and
then his Mate with his Larbooad men with a Psalme and a Prayer releeues them
till four in the morning, and so from eight to twelve each other, except some
flaw of wind come, some storm or gust, or some accident that requires the
help of all hands, which commonly after such good cheer in most voyages doth
happen.

For now the wind veeres, that is, The wind veeres.
it doth shift from point to point, get your Starboord tacks aboard, Tally.
and tally or hale off your Lee-Sheats. The Ship will not wayer, settle your

hale up the slatch of the Lee-boling. By Slatch is meant the middle part of
any rope hangs over board. Veere more sheat, or a flown sheat, that is, when
they are not haled home to the block. Fly.
But when we say, let fly the sheats, then they let go amain, which commonly
is in some gust, A pair of courses.
lest they spend their topsailes, or if her quick side lie in the water,
ouerset the ship. A flown sheat is when she goes before the wind, or betwixt
a pair of sheats, or all sails drawing. But the wind shrinks, that is, when
you must take in the Spretsaile, and get the tacks aboard, hale close the maine
Boling, that is, when your Tacks are close aboard. If you would sail against
the wind or keep your own, that is, not to fall to lee-ward or go back
again, by halling off close your Bolings, you set your sails so sharp as you
can to lie close by a wind, thwarting it a league or two, or more or less, as
you see cause, first on the one board then on the other; this we call boarding
or beating it up upon a tack in the winds eye, or bolting to and again; but
the longer your boards are, the more you work or gather into the wind. If a
sudden flaw of wind should surprise you, when you would lower a yard so fast as
you can, they call A maine; but a cross sail cannot come nearer the wind than
six points, but a Caruell whose sails stand like a pair of Tailers shears,
will go much nearer.

How to handle a ship in a storm.
It ouer-casts we shall have wind, foul weather, settle your top sails, take
in the spret-saile, in with your topsailes, lower the fore-saile, tallow under
the parrels, brade up close all them sails, lash sure the ordnance, strike
your top-masts to the cap, make it sure with your sheeps feet. A storm, Try.
let us lie at Try with our maine course, that is, to hale the tack aboard,
the sheat close aft, the boling set up, and the helm tied close aboard. When
that will not serve then Try the mizzen, if that split, or the storm grow so
great she cannot bear it; Hall.
then hull, which is to bear no sail, but to strike a hull is when they would
lie obscurely in the Sea, or stay for some consort, lash sure the helm a lee,
Under the Sea.
and so a good ship will lie at ease under the Sea as we term it. Weather
coil.
If she will weather coil, and lay her head the other way without loosing a
sail, that must be done by bearing up the Helm, and then she will drive
nothing so far to Leeward. They call it hulling also in a calm swelling Sea,
which is commonly before a storm, when they strike their sails left she
should beat them in pieces against the mast by Rolling. Rolling.

Labour.


We say a ship doth Labour much when she doth roll much any way; but if she
will neither Try nor Hull, Spoon.
Then Spoon, that is, put her right before the wind, this way although she
will roll more than the other, yet if she be weak it will not strain her any
thing so much in the Trough of the Sea, Trough.
which is the distance betwixt two waives or Billows. If none of this will do
well, then she is in danger to founder, Founder.
if not sink. Foundering is when she will neither veere nor steer, the Sea
will so over rake her, except you free out the water, she will lie like a log,
and so consequently sink. To spend a mast.
To spend a mast or yard, is when they are broke by foul weather, Spring a
mast.
and to spring a mast is when it is cracked in any place.

In this extremity he that doth cun the ship cannot have too much judgment, A
Yoke.
nor experience to try her drift, or how she capes, which are two terms also
used in the trials of the running or setting of currants. A yoke is when the
Sea is so rough as that men cannot govern the Helm with their hands, then they
seas a block to the Helm on each side at the end, reeuiug two falls thorough
them like Gunners Tackles brings them to the ships side, and so some being at
the one side of the Tackle, some at the other, they steer her with much more
ease than they can with a single rope with a double Turn about the Helm.

When the storm is past, though the wind may alter three or four points of
the compass, or more, yet the Sea for a good time will go the same way; then
if your course be right against it, you shall meet it right a head, so we call
it a head Sea. Sometimes when there is but little wind, A head Sea.
there will come a contrary Sea, and presently the wind after it, whereby we
may judge that from whence it came was much wind, for commonly before any
great storm the Sea will come that way. Now if the ship may run on shore in
ose or mud she may escape, or Billage on a rock, or Ancors flooke, repair her
leake, but if she split or sink, she is a wrack. But seeing the storm
decreases, let us try if she will endure the Hullocke of a Sail, Hullocke.
which sometimes is a piece of the mizzen sail or some other little sail, part
opned to keep her head to the sea, but if yet she would weather coil, we
will loose a Hullocke of her fore-saile, and put the Helm a weather, and it
will bring her head where her sterne is; courage my hearts.

It clears up, set your fore-saile; Now it is fair weather, Lardge. Laske.
out with all your sails, go lardge or laske, that is, when we have a fresh
gale, or fair wind, and all sails drawing. But for more haste vnparrell the
mizzen yard and launch it, and the sail over her Lee quarter, and fit Gives at
the further end to keep the yard steady, and with a Boome boome it out; this
we call a Goose-wing. Goosewing.
Who is at Helm there? Sir you must be amongst the Points; Well Master the
Channel is broad enough; Yet you cannot steer betwixt a pair of sheats;
Those are words of mockery betwixt the Cunner and the Stearesman. But to
proceed,

Get your Larbooad Tackes aboard, hale off your starboord sheats, keep your
coarse upon the point you are directed, Port, he will lay her by the lee; the
stays, or back stays, that is, when all the sails flutter in the wind, and
are not kept full, that is full of wind, they fall upon the masts and shrouds,
so that the ship goes a drift upon her broad side, fill the sails, keep full,
full and by. Make ready to Tack about, is but for every man to stand to handle
the sails and ropes they must hale, Tack about is to bear up the helm, and
that brings her to stay all her sails lying flat against the shrouds, then as
she turns we say she is payed, then let rise your Lee tacks and hale off
your sheats, and trim all your sails as they were before, which is cast of
that Boling which was the weather boling, and hale up taught the other. So all
your Sheats, Brases, and Tackes are trimmed by a wind as before. To belay, is
to make fast the ropes in their proper places. Round in.
Round in, is when the wind larges, let rise the maine tack and fore tack,
and hale aft the fore sheat to the cats head, and the maine sheat to the
cubbridge head, this is Rounding in, or rounding aft the sail; Rounding aft.
Pasarado.
the sheats being there they hale them down to keep them firm from flying up
with a Pasarado, which is any rope wherewith we hale down the sheats, blocks
of the maine or fore sail, when they are haled aft the clew of the maine sail
to the Cubbridge head of the maine mast, and the clew of the fore sail to the
Cat head; Do this when the ships goes large.

Observe.
Observe the height, that is, at twelve a clock to take the height of the
Sun, or in the night the North star, or in the forenoon and afternoon, if
you miss these by finding the Azimuth end Alnicanter. Dead water.
Dead water is the Eddie water follows the sterne of the ship, not passing
away so quickly as that slides by her sides. The Wake.
The wake of a ship is the smooth water a sterne showing the way she hath gone
in the sea, by this we judge what way she doth make, for if the wake be right a
sterne, we know she makes good her way forwards; but if to Lee-ward a point or
two, we then think to the Lee-ward of her course, but she is a nimble ship
that in turning or tacking about will not fall to thee Lee-ward of her wake
when she hath weathered it. Disimbogue is to pass some narrow strait or
currant into the maine Ocean, out of some great Gulf or Bay. Disimbogue.
A Drift.
A Drift is any thing floating in the sea that is of wood. Rockweed.
Rockweed doth grow by the shore, and is a sign of land, yet it is oft found
far in the Sea. Lay the ship by the Lee to try the Dipsie line, Dipsie line.
which is a small line some hundred and fifty fadome long, with a long plummet
at the end, made hollow, wherein is put tallow, that will bring up any gravel;
which is first marked at twenty fadome, and after increased by tens to the end;
and those distinguished by so many small knots upon each little string that is
fixed at the mark thorough the strouds or midst of the line, showing it is so
many times ten fadome deep, Plummet.
where the plummet doth rest from drawing the line out of your hand; this is
only used in deep water when we think we approach the shore, for in the

water.
Foul water is when she comes into shallow water where she raises the sand or
ose with her way yet not touch the ground, but she cannot feel her helm so
well as in deep water.

When a ship sails with a large wind towards the land, or a fair wind into a
harbour, Bear in.
we say she bears in with the land or harbour. And when she would not come
near the land, but goes more Roome-way than her couse, we say she bears
off; Bear off.
but a ship board, bear off is used to every thing you would thrust from you.
Bear up. Hold off.
Bear up is to bring the ship to go large or before the wind. To Hold off is
when we heave the Cable at the Capsterne, if it be great and stiff, or slimy
with ose, Surges.
it surges or slips back unless they keep it close to the whelps, and then
they either hold it fast with nippers, or brings it to the I care Capsterne,
and this is called Holding off. As you approach the store, shorten your sails,
when you are in harbour take in your sails, and come to an anchor, wherein
much judgment is required.

Neale to.
To know well the soundings, if it be Nealed to, that is, deep water close
aboard the shore, or shallow, or if the Leevnder the weather shore, or the lee

Offing. Land locke, Land locked.
is when the land is round about you.

Now the ship is said to Ride, To Ride.
so long as the Anchors do hold and comes not home. Ride a great Road.
To Ride a great road is when the wind hath much power. They will strike
their top masts, and the yards along ships, and the deeper the water is, it
requires more Cable; when we have rid in any distress we say we have rid
hawse full, Ride a stress.

Ride betwixt.

when the wind tide are contrary of equal power, Wind and tide.
which will make her roll extremely, yet not strain much the cable. To Ride
thwart is to ride with her side to the tide, Ride thwart tide.
and then she never strains it. Ride a pike.
To ride a pike is to pike your yards when you ride amongst many ships. Ride
cross.
To ride across is to hoise the maine and fore yards to the hounds, and topped
alike. When the water is gone and the ships lies dry, we say she is Sewed; if
her head but lie dry, Sewed.
she is Sewed a head; but if she cannot all lie dry, she cannot Sew there. Sew.
Water borne is when there is no more water than will just bear her from the
ground. Water borne.

Water line.


The water line is to that Bend or place she should swim in when she is loaded.

Lastly, To More.
to More a ship is to lay out her anchors as is most fit for her to ride by,
and the ways are diverse; as first, to More a fair Berth from any annoiance.
More cross.
To More a cross is to lay one anchor to one side of the stream, and the
other to the other right against one another, and so they Bear equally ebb
and flood. More along.
To More along is to lay an anchor amidst the stream ahead, and another
asterne, when you fear driving a shore. Water shot.
Water shot is to more quartering betwixt both nether cross, nor along the
ride. In an open rode they will more that way they think the wind will come
the most to hurt them. More Proviso.
To more a Proviso, is to have one anchor in the river, and a hawser a shore,
which is mored with her head a shore; otherwise two cables is the least, and
four cables the best to more by.

CHAP. X. Proper terms for the Winds, Ebbes, Floods, and Eddies, with their
definitions, and an estimate of the depth of the Sea, by the height of the Hills
and the largeness of the Earth.
A Calm.

A Breze.


WHen there is not a breath of wind stirring, it is a calm or a stark calm. A
Breze is a wind blows out of the Sea, and commonly in fair weather begins
about nine in the morning, and lasts till near night; so likewise all the
night it is from the shore which is called a Turnado, or a Sea-turne, but this
is but upon such coasts where it blows thus most certainly, except it be a
storm, or very foul weather, as in Barbaria, Egypt, and the most of the
Leuant. We have such Brezes in most hot countries in Summer, but they are very
uncertain. A fresh gale.
A fresh Gale is that doth presently blow after a calm, when the wind
begins to quicken or blow. A Loom gale.
A fair Loom Gale is the best to sail in, because the Sea goes not high,
and we bear out all our sails. A stiff Gale is so much wind as our
top-sailes can endure to bear. Eddie wind.
An Eddie wind is checked by the sail, a mountain, turning, or any such thing
that makes it return back again. It over blows.
It over blows when we can bear no top-sailes. A Gust.
A flaw of wind is a Gust which is very violent upon a sudden, A Spout.
but quickly ends. A Spout in the West Indies commonly falls in those
Gusts, which is, as it were, a small river falling entirely from the clouds,
like out of our water Spouts, which make the Sea where it falls rebound in
flashes exceeding high. Whirl winds runs round, A whirl wind.
and blows diverse ways at once. A Storm.
A storm is known to every one not to be much less than a tempest, A
Tempest.
that will blow down houses, and trees up by the roots. A Mounsoune.
A Mounsoune is a constant wind in the East Indies, that blows always three
months together one way, and the next three months the contrary way. A
Hericano.
A Hericano is so violent in the West Indies, it will continue three, four, or
five weeks, but they have it not past once in five, six, or seven years; but
then it is with such extremity that the Sea flies like rain, and the waives so
high, they over flow the low grounds by the Sea, in so much, that ships have
been driven over tops of high trees there growing, many leagues into the land,
and there left, as was Captain Francis Nelson an Englishman, and an excellent
Sea-man for one.

We say a calm sea, or Becalmed, Becalmed.
when it is so smooth the ship moves very little, and the men leap over board
to swim. A Rough Sea is when the waives grow high. A Rough Sea.

An overgrown Sea.

Surges.

The Rut of the Sea.

The Roaring of the Sea.

Floods ebbes.


An overgrown Sea when the surges and billows go highest. The Rut of the sea
where it doth dash against anything. And the Roaring of the Sea is most
commonly observed a shore, a little before a storm or after a storm.

Flood is when the water begins to rise, which is young flood as we call it,
then quarter flood, half flood, full Sea, still water, or high water. So when
it Ebbes, quarter ebb, half ebb, three quarter ebb, low water, or dead low
water every one doth know; and also that as at a spring tide the Sea or water
is at the highest, so at a Neape tide it is at the lowest. This word Tide, is
common both to Flood and Ebb; for you say as well tide of ebb, as tide of
flood, A Tide of ebb.

A Tide of flood.

A windward Tide A Lee-ward tide.


or a windward Tide when the Tide runs against the stream, as a Lee-warde
Tide, that is, when the wind and the Tide goes both one way, which makes the
water as smooth as the other rough. To Tide over to a place, To Tide over.
is to go over with the Tide of ebb or flood, and stop the contrary by
anchoring till the next Tide, thus you may work against the wind if it over
blow not. A Tide gate.
A Tide gate is where the tide runs strongest. Tide and half Tide.
It flows Tide and half Tide, that is, it will be half flood by the shore,
before it begin to flow in the channel; for although the Tide of flood run
aloft, yet the Tide of ebb runs close by the ground. An Eddie tide is where
the water doth run back contrary to the tide, Eddie Tide.
that is, when some headland or great point in a River hinders the free
passage of the stream, that causes the water on the other side the point to
turn round by the shore as in a circle, till it fall into the tide again.

As touching the reasons of ebbes and floods, and to know how far it is to the
bottom of the deepest place of the Sea, I will not take upon me to discourse
of; as knowing the same to be the secrets of God unrevealed to man: only I will
set down a Philosophical speculation of diverse men's opinions touching the
depth of the Sea; which I hope will not be thought much impertinent to the
subject of this book by the judicious Reader.

The height of mountains perpendicular.
Fabianus in Plinis, and Cleomides conceived the depth of the Sea to be
fifteen furlongs, that is, a mile and ^ parts, Plutarch compared it equal to
the highest mountains, Scallinger and others conceited the hills far
surpassed the deepnesse of the Sea, and that in few places it is more than a
hundred paces in depth, it may be he meant in some narrow Seas, but in the
maine Ocean experience hath taught us it is much more than twice so much, for I
have founded 300. fadome, yet found no ground. Eratosthenes in Theon that great
Mathematitian writes the highest mountain perpendicular is but ten furlongs,
that is, one mile and a quarter. Also Dicaearcus affirms this to be the
height of the hill P^lius in Thessalia, but Xenagoras in Plutarch observed the
height of Olimpus in the same region to be twenty paces more, which is 1270.
paces, but surely all those mean only those mountains in or about Greece
where they lived and were best acquainted; but how these may compare with the
Alps in Asia, Atlas in Africa, Caucasus in India, the Andes in Peru, and diverse
others hath not yet been examined.

But whatsoever the hills may be above the superficies of the earth, The height
of the hills compared with the superficies of the earth and depth of the Sea.
many hold opinion the Sea is much deeper, who suppose that the earth at the
first framing was in the superficies regular and spherical, as the holy
Scriptures directs us to believe; because the water covered and compassed all
the face of the earth, also that the face of the earth was equal to that of
the Sea. Damascen notes, that the vneuennesse and irregularity which now is
seen in the earths superficies, was caused by taking some parts out of the
upper face of the earth in sundry places to make it more hollow, and lay them
in other places to make it more conuex, or by raising up some part and
depressing others to make room and receipt for the Sea, that mutation being
wrought by the power of the word of the Lord, Let the waters be gathered into
one place that the dry land may appear. As for Aquinas, Dionysius,
Catharianus, and some Divines that conceited there was no mutation, but a
violent accumulation of the waters, or heaping them up on high is unreasonable;
because it is against nature, that water being a flexible and a ponderous body,
so to consist and stay it self, and not fall to the lower parts about it;
where in nature there is nothing to hinder it, or, if it be restrained
supernaturally by the hand and bridle of Almighty God, lest it should
ouer-whelme and drown all the land, it must follow, that God even in the very
institution of nature imposed a perpetual violence upon nature. And this with
all, that at the Deluge there was no necessity to break up the springs of the
deep and to open the cattaracts of Heaven, and power down water continually
so many days and nights together, seeing the only with-drawing of that hand,
or letting go of that bridle which restrains the water would presently have
overwhelmed all. How all the hills and dry land above the superficies of the Sea
hath made room for the Sea, therefore they are in equal height depth.


But both by Scriptures, the experience of Navigators, and reason in making
estimation of the depth of the Sea, reckon not only the height of the hills
above the common superficies of the earth, but the height of all the dry land
above the superficies of the Sea, because the whole mass of earth that now
appears above the waters, being taken as it were out of the places which the
waters now possess, must be equal to the place out of which it was taken; so
consequently it seems, that the height or elevation of the one should answer
the descending or depth of the other; and therefore in estimating the depth of
the Sea, we consider not only the erection of the hills above the ordinary
land, but the advantage of the dry land above the Sea; which latter, I mean
the height of the ordinary maine land, excluding the hills, which properly
answer the extraordinary deeps and whirle-pooles in the Sea. The rest is held
more in large Continents above the Sea, than that of the hills is above the
land.

That there is small difference betwixt the springs first rising out of the
earth, and their falling into the Sea.
For that the plain face of the dry land is not level, or equally distant from
the Center, but hath a great descent towards the Sea, and a rising towards the
mid-land parts, although it appear not plainly to the eye, yet to reason it is
most manifest; because we find that part of the earth the Sea covers
descends lower and lower towards the Sea. For the Sea, which touching the
upper face of it, is known by nature to be level and evenly distant from the
center, is observed to wax deeper deeper the further one saileth from the shore
cowards the maine Ocean: even so in that part which is vntouered, the
streamings of Rivers on all sides from the midland parts towards the Sea,
sliding from the higher to the lower declares so much, whose courses are some
1000. or 2000. miles, in which declination, Pliny in his derivation of water
requires one cubit of declining in 240. foot of proceeding. But Columella,
Viturnius, Paladius, and others, in their conduction of waters require somewhat
less; namely, that in the proceeding of 200. foot forward, there should be
allowed one foot of descending downward, which yet in the course of 1000.
miles, as Danubius, Volgha, or Indus, c. have so much or more, which will make
five miles of descent in perpendicular account, and in the course of 2000. or
more, as Nilus, Niger, and the River of the Amazons have 10. miles or more of
the like descent.

These are not taken as rules of necessity, The determination of these
questions.
as though water could not run without that advantage, for that respect the
conveyors of waters in these times content themselves with one inch in 600.
foot, as Philander and Viturnius observed, but is rather under a rule of
commodity for expedition and wholsomnesse of water so conueyed, left resting
too long in pipes it should contract some unwholesome condition, or else through
the slackness of motion, or long closeness, or banishment from the air,
gather some aptness and disposition to putr^fie. Although I say, such excess
of advantage as in the artificial conveyance of waters the forenamed Authors
require, be not of necessity exacted in the natural derivation of them, yet
certain it is, that the descent of rivers being continually and their
courselong, and in many places swift, and in some places headlong and furious;
Note the difference betwixt the springs of the rivers. and their falling into
the Sea is not great.
the differences of height or advantage cannot be great betwixt the springs of
the rivers and their out lets, betwixt the first rising out of the earth and
their falling into the Sea: unto which declinity of land seeing the deepenesse
of the Sea in proportion answer as I before declared, and not only to the
height of the hills: it is concluded, that the deepenesse to be much more than
the Philosophers commonly reputed: and although the deepnesse of the Sardinian
Sea, which Aristotle saith, was the deepest of the Mediterranean, recorded by
Posidonius in Strabo, to have been found but 1000. fadome, which is but a mile
and a fifth part, and the greatest breadth not past 600. miles: then seeing if
in so narrow a Sea it be so deep, what may we esteem the maine Ocean to be,
that in many places is five times so broad, seeing the broader the Seas are, if
they be entire and free from Lands, they are answerably observed to be the
deeper. If you desire any further satisfaction, read the first part of Purchase
his Pilgrimage, where you may read how to find all those Authors at large. Now
because he hath taken near 100. times as much from me, I have made bold to
borrow this from him, seeing he hath founded such deep waters for this our
Ship to fail in, being a Gentleman whose person I loved, and whose memory and
virtues I will ever honour.

CHAP. XI. Proper Sea terms belonging to the good or bad condition of Ships,
how to find them and amend them.
A Ship that will try hull, and ride well at Anchor, A wholesome ship.
we call a wholesome Ship. A long Ship that draws much water will do all this,
but if she draw much water and be short, she may hull well, but neither try nor
ride well; if she draw little water and belong, she may try and ride well, An
unwholesome Ship.
but never hull well, which is called an unwholesome ship. Howsing a Ship.
The howsing in of a Ship is when she is past the breadth of her bearing she is
brought in narrow to her upper works: it is certain this makes her wholesome
in the Sea without rolling, because the weight of her Ordnance doth
counterpoise her breadth under water, but it is not so good in a man of war,
because it takes away a great deal of her room, nor will her tacks ever so
well come aboard as if she were laid out aloft and not flaring, Flaring.
which is when she is a little howsing in, near the water, and then the upper
work doth hang over again, and is laid out brother aloft, this makes a Ship
more roomy aloft for men to use their arms in, but Sir Walter Rawleighs
proportion, which is to be proportionally wrought to her other work is the
best, because the counter poise on each side doth make her swim perpendicular
or straight, and consequently steady, which is the best.

If a ship be narrow, and her bearing either not laid out enough or too low,
then you must make her broader and her bearing the higher by ripping off the
planks two or three strikes under water and as much above, and put other
Timbers upon the first, and then put on the planks upon those Timbers, this
will make her bear a better sail, but it is a hindrance to her sailing, this
is to be done when a Ship is cranke-sided and will bear no sail, Crank side.
and is called Furring. Note also, Furring.
that when a Ship hath a deep Keele it doth keep her from rolling. If she be
floty and her keele shallow, put on another keele under the first to make it
deeper, for it will make her hold more in the water, this we call a false
Keele. A false Keele. Gripe.
Likewise if her stem be too flat to make her cut water the better, and not
gripe, which is when she will not keep a wind well; fix another stem before
it, A false stem.
and that is called a false stem, which will make her rid more way and bear a
better sail. The run.
Also the Run of a ship is as much to be regarded, for if it be too short and
too ^ull below, the water comes but slowly to the Rudder because the force of
it is broken by her breadth, and then to put a false stem post to lengthen her
is the next remedy, but to lengthen her is better; for when a Ship comes off
handsomely by degrees, and her Tuck doth not lye too low, which will hinder the
water from coming swiftly to the Rudder, makes her she cannot steer well, and
they are called as they are, a good run or a bad. A good run.

A bad run.


When a Ship hath lost a piece of her Keele, and that we cannot come well to
mend it, you much patch a new piece unto it, and bind it with a stirrup, A
Sirrup.
which is an iron comes round about it and the Keele up to the other side of
the Ship, whereto it is strongly nailed with Spikes. Her Rake also may be a
defect, Her Rake.
which is so much of the Hull, as by a perpendicular line the end of the Keele
is from the setting on of the stem, so much as it without that forward on, and
in like manner the setting in of her stem Post. Your French men gives great
Rakes forwards on, which makes her give good way and keep a good wind, but if
she have not a full bow she will pitch her head extremely in the Sea. If she
have but a small Rake, she is so blusse that the Seas meets her so suddenly
upon the Bows she cannot cut the water much, but the longer a ship is, the
fuller should be her Bow, but the mean is the best. Loom.
The looming of a ship is her perspective, that is, as she doth show great or
little: Her water draught is so many foot as she goes in the water, but the
Ships that draws most water are commonly the most wholesome, but the least
draught goes best but rolls most, and we say a Ship doth held on Starboord or
Larbooad, Held.
that is, to that side she doth lean most.

Ouerset.

Overthrow.


To ouerset or overthrow a ship, is by bearing too much sail you bring her
Keele upwards, or on shore overthrow her by grounding her, so that she falls
upon one side; and we say a Ship is walt when she is not stiff, Wale.
and hath not Ballast enough in her to keep her stiff. Wall reared.
And wall reared when she is right built up, after she comes to her bearing it
makes her ill shapen and unseemly, but it gives her within much room, and she
is very wholesome, if her bearing be well laid out. The Masting of a Ship is
much to be considered, and will much cause her to sail well or ill, as I have
related in the masting a Ship. Iron sick.
Iron sick, is when the Bolts, Spikes, or Nailes are so eaten with rust they
stand hollow in the planks, and so makes her leake, the which to prevent, they
use to put lead over all the bolt heads under water. Trim.
Lastly, the trimming of a ship doth much amend or impair her sailing, and so
alter her condition. To find her trim, that is, how she will sail best; is by
trying her sailing with another Ship so many glasses, trimmed a head and so
many a sterne, and so many upon an even Keele, also the casing of her Masts and
Shrouds, for some ships will sail much better when they are stack than when
they are taught.

CHAP. XII. Considerations for a Sea Captain in the choice of his Ship, and in
placing his Ordnance. In giving Chase, Boarding, and entering a man of war
like himself, or a defending Merchant man.
IN Land service we call a man of war a Soldier either on foot or horse, How
to choose a Ship fit to make a man of wane.
and at Sea a Ship, which if she be not as well built, conditioned, and
provided, as near fitting such an employment as may be, she may prove (either)
as a horseman that knows not how to hold his rains, keep his seat in his
saddle and stirrups, carry his body, nor how to help his horse with leg and
spur in a curuet, gallop, or stop; or as an excellent horsemen that knows all
this, mounted upon a Jade that will do nothing, which were he mounted
according to his experience, he would do more with that one, than half a
dozen of the other though as well provided as himself. But I confess, every
horseman cannot mount himself alike, neither every Seaman ship himself as he
would, I mean not for outward ornament, which the better they are, the less
to be disliked; for there cannot be a braver sight than a ship in her bravery,
but of a competent sufficiency as the business requires. But were I to choose
a ship for my self, I would have her sail well, yet strongly built, her decks
flush and flat, and so roomy that men might pass with ease; her Bow and chase
so Gally-like contrived, should bear as many Ordnances as with conueniency she
could, for that always comes most to fight, and so stiff, she should bear
a stiff sail and bear out her lower tier in any reasonable weather, neither
should her Gunroome be unprovided: not manned like a Merchant-man, which if
they be double manned, that is, to have twice so many men as would sail her,
they think it is too many in regard of the charge, yet to speak true, there is
few Merchant Ships in the world doth any way exceed ours. And those men they
entertain in good voyages have such good pay, and such acquaintance one with
another in shipping themselves, that thirty or forty of them would trouble a
man of war with three or four times their number manned with pressed men,
being half of them scarce hale Boulings. Yea, and many times a Pirat who are
commonly the best manned, but they fight only for wealth, not for honour nor
revenge, except they be extremely constrained. But such a Ship as I have
spoken of well manned with rather too many than too few, with all sufficient
Officers; Shot, Powder, Victual, and all their appurtenances, in my opinion
might well pass muster for a man of war.

His reward that first discries a Ship, or enters a prize.
Now being at Sea, the tops are seldom without one or other to look out for
purchase, because he that first discries a sail, if she prove prize, is to
have a good suit of Aparell, or so much money as is set down by order for his
reward, as also he that doth first enter a Ship there is a certain reward
allowed him; when we see a Ship alter her course, and uses all the means she
can to fetch you up, you are the chase, and he the chaser. In giving chase or
chasing, or to escape being chased, there is required an infinite judgment and
experience, for there is no rule for it; but the shortest way to fetch up your
chase is the best. How to give chase, and escape the chaser.
If you be too lee-ward, get all your Tacks aboard, and shape your course as
he doth to meet him at the nearest angle you can, then he must either alter his
course and Tack as you Tack as near the wind as he can lye to keep his own
till night, and then strike a Hull that you may not descry him by his sails,
or do his best to lose you in the dark; for look how much he falls to
lee-ward, he falls so much in your way. If he be right ahead of you, that is
called a sterne chase, if you weather him, for every man in chasing doth seek
to get the weather, because you cannot board him except you weather him, he
will laske, or go large, if you gather on him that way, he will try you
before the wind, th^ if your ordnance cannot reach him, if he can out-strip you
he is gone: But suppose you are to wind-ward, if he clap close by a wind, and
there goes ahead sea, and yours a lee-ward ship, if you do the like your ship
will so beat against the Sea, she will make no way; therefore you must go a
little more large though you chase under his lee till you can run ahead.

Board and Board is when two ships lie together side by side, but he that
knows how to defend himself, Board board.
and work well, will so cun his ship, as force you to enter upon his quarter,
which is the highest part of the ship, and but the mizzen shrouds to enter by;
from whence he may do you much hurt with little danger, except you fire him,
which a Pirat will never do, neither sink you if he can choose, except you be
able to force him to defend himself. But in a Sea fight we call Boarding, in
Boarding where we can, the greatest advantage for your Ordnance is to board
him thwart the hawse, because you may use all the ordnance you have on one
side, and she only them in her prow; but the best and safest boarding for
entering is on the bow, Boarding entering a ship.
but you must be careful to clear the decks with burning granados, fire-pots,
poutches of powder, Powder chests.
to which give fire by a Gunpodwer match, to prevent trains to the powder
chest, which are long boards joined like a triangle with diverse broad ledges on
either side, wherein lies as many peeble stones or beatch as can there lie,
those being fired will make all clear before them. Besides in an extremity a
man would rather blow up the quarter deck, half deck, fore castle, or any
thing, than be taken by him he knows a mortal enemy, and commonly there is
more men lost in entering, if the chase stand to her defence, in an instant,
than in a long fight board and board, if she be provided of her close fights: I
confess, the charging upon trenches, and the entrances of a breach in a
rampire are attempts as desperate as a man would think could be performed, but
he that hath tried himself as oft in the entering a resisting ship as I have
done both them the other, he would surely confess there is no such dangerous
service ashore, as a resolved resolute fight at sea. A ships close fights, are
small ledges of wood laid cross one another like the grates of iron in a
prisons window, betwixt the maine mast, and the fore mast, are called gratings,
or nettings as is said, which are made of small ropes, much in like manner
covered with a sail, the which to undo is to heave a kedger, or fix a
grappling into them, tied in a rope, but a chain of iron is better, and
shearing off will tear it in pieces if the rope and anchor hold, some have
used shear hooks, which are hooks like sickels fixed in the ends of the
yards arms, that if a ship under sail come to board her, those shears will
cut her shrouds, and spoil her tackling, but they are so subject to break
their own yards, and cut all the ropes comes from the top-sailes, they are out
of request. To conclude, if a ship be open, presently to board her is the best
way to take her. But if you see your chase strip himself into fighting sails,
Evident signs that a chase will fight.
that is to put out his colours in the poop, his flag in the maine top, his
streamers or pendants as the ends of his yards arms, furl his spret-saile,
pike his mizzen, and sling his maine yard, provide your self to fight. Now
because I would not be tedious in describing a fight at Sea, I have troubled
you with this short preamble that you may the plainlier understand it.

CHAP. XIII. How to manage a fight at Sea, with the proper terms in a fight
largely expressed, and the ordering of a Navy at Sea.
FOr this master piece of this work, I confess I might do better to leave it
to every particular mans conceit as it is, or those of longer practice or more
experience, yet because I have seen many books of the Art of War by land,
Many books of the Art of War for the land, none for the sea.
and never any for the Sea, seeing all men so silent in this most difficult
service, and there are so many young Captains, and others that desire to be
Captains, who know very little, or nothing at all to any purpose, for their
better understanding I have proceeded thus far; now for this that follows,
what I have seen, done, and conceived by my small experience, I refer me to
their friendly constructions, and well advised considerations.

A sail, how bears she or stands she, to wind-ward or lee-ward, set him by
the Compass; he stands right ahead, or on the weather-Bow, or lee-Bow, let
fly your colours if you have a consort, else not. Out with all your sails, a
steady man to the helm, sit close to keep her steady, give him chase or fetch
him up; he holds his own, no, To give chase.
we gather on him. Captain, out ^oes his flag and pendants, also his waste
clothes and top armings, Wast clothes.

Top armings.


which is a long red cloth about three quarters of a yard broad, edged on each
side with Calico or white linen cloth, that goes round about the ship on the
out sides of all her upper works fore and aft, and before the cubbridge heads,
also about the fore and maine tops, as well for the countenance and grace of
the ship, as to cover the men for being seen, he furles and slings his maine
yard, in goes his spret-saile. Thus they use to strip themselves into their
short sails, Fighting sails. To hale a ship.
or figting sails, which is only the fore sail, the maine and fore top
sails, because the rest should not be fired nor spoiled; besides they would be
troublesome to handle, hinder our sights and the using our arms; he makes
ready his close fights fore and aft.

How to begin a fight.
Master how stands the chase? Right on head I say; Well we shall reatch him by
and by; What's all ready, Yea, yea, every man to his charge, dowse your
top-saile to salute him for the Sea, hale him with a noise of trumpets; Whence
is your ship? Of Spain; Whence is yours? Of England; Are you a Merchant, or a
man of War? We are of the Sea; He waives us to lee-ward with his drawn sword,
calls amain for the King of Spain, and springs his loufe, give him a chase
piece with your broad side, and run a good berth ahead of him; Done, done, We
have the wind of him, and he tackes about, tack you about also and keep your
loufe, be yare at the helm, edge in with him, give him a volley of small shot,
also your prow and broad side as before, and keep your loufe; He pays us
shot for shot; Well, we shall require him; What are you ready again, Yea,
yea. Try him once more as before, Done, done; Keep your loufe and loge your
ordnance again; Is all ready? Yea, yea; edge in in with him again, begin with
your bow pieces, proceed with your broad side, let her fall off with the wind,
to give her also your full chase, your weather broad side, and bring her round
that the sterne may also discharge, and your tackes close aboard again; Done,
done, the wind veeres, the Sea goes too high to board her, and we are shot
thorough and thorough, and between wind a^d water. Try the pump, bear up the
helm, Master let us breathe and refresh a little, and sling a man over board
to stop the leaks; that is, to truss him up about the middle in a piece of
canvas, How to sling a man over board.
and a rope to keep him from sinking, and his arms at liberty, with a malet
in the one hand, a plug lapped in Okum, and well farred in a tarpawling clout
in the other, which he will quickly beat into the hole or holes the bullets
made; What cheer mates, is all well? All well, all well, all well; Then make
ready to bear up with him again, and withal your great and small shot charge
him, and in the smoke board him thwart the hawse, on the bow, mid ships, or
rather then fail, on his quarter, or make fast your graplings if you can to
his close fights and shear off. Captain we are foul on each other, and the
ship is on fire, cut any thing to get clear, and smother the fire with wet
clothes. In such a case they will presently be such friends, as to help one
the other all they can to get clear, lest they both should burn together and
sink; and if they be generous, the fire quenched, drink kindly one to
another; heave their cans over board, and then begin again as before.

Well Master, the day is spent, the night draws on, A consultation direction

a health to you all fore and aft, courage my hearts for a fresh charge,
Gunners beat open the ports, and out with your lower tire, and bring me from
the weather side to the lee, so many pieces as we have ports to bear upon him,
Master lay him aboard loufe for loufe, mid ships men see the tops and yards
well manned, with stones, fi^e pots, and brass bailes, to throw amongst them
before we enter, or if we be put off, charge them with all your great and small
shot, in the smoke let us enter them in the shrouds, and every squadron at his
best advantage, so sound Drums and Trumpets, and Saint George for England.

How a prise doth yield, and how to entertain him Sea-man like.
They hang out a flag of truce, hale him a maine, a base, or take in his flag,
strike their sails and come aboard with their Captain, Purser and Gunner,
with their commission, cocket, or bills of loading. Out goes the boat, they are
launched from the ship side, entertain them with a general cry, God save the
Captain and all the company with the Trumpets sounding, examine them in
particular, and then conclude your conditions, with feasting, freedom, or
punishment, as you find occasion; but always have as much care to their
wounded as your own, and if there be either young women or aged men, use them
nobly, which is ever the nature of a generous disposition. To conclude, if you
surprise him, or enter perforce, you may stow the men, rifle, pillage, or
sack, and cry a prise.

How to call a Counsel of War, and order a Navy at Sea.
To call a Council of War in a Fleet; There is your Council of War to
manage all businesses of import, and the common Council for matters of small
moment, when they would have a meeting, where the Admiral doth appoint it; if
in the Admiral, they hang out a flag in the maine shrouds; if in the Vice
Admiral, in the fore shrouds; if in the Rear Admiral, in the mizzen; If there
be many squadrons, the Admiral of each squadron upon sundry occasions doth
carry in their maine tops, flags of sundry colours, or else they are
distinguished by several pendants from the yards arms; every night or morning
they are to come under the Lee of the Admiral to salute him and know his
pleasure, but no Admiral of any squadron is to bear his flag in the maine
top, in the presence of the Admiral general, except the Admiral come aboard
of him to Council, to dinner, or collation, and so any ship else where he so
resides during that time, is to wear his flag in the maine top. They use to
martial or order those squadrons in ranks like Manaples, which is four
square, if the wind and Sea permits, a good berth or distance from each other,
that they becalme not one another, nor come not foul of each other; the
General commonly in the midst, his Vice Admiral in the front, and his Rear
Admiral in the Rear; or otherwise like a half Moon, which is two squadrons
like two triangles for the two horns, and so the rest of the squadrons behind
each other a good distance, and the General in the midst of the half
circle, from whence he sees all his fleet, and sends his directions, as he
finds occasion to whom he pleases.

Now between two Navies they use often, Stratagems for Sea-men.
especially in a harbour or road where they are at anchor, to fill old Barks
with pitch, tar, train oil, lincet oil, brimstone, rosen, reeds, with dry
wood, and such combustible things, sometimes they link three or four together
in the night, and puts them adrift as they find occasion. To pass a fort some
will make both ship and sails all black, but if the fort keep but a fire on
the other side, and all the pieces point blank with the fire, if they
discharge what is betwixt them and the fire, the shot will hit if the rule be
truly observed; for when a ship is betwixt the fire and you, she doth keep
you from seeing it till she be past it. To conclude, there is as many
stratagems, advantages, and inventions to be used as you find occasions, and
therefore experience must be the best Tutor.

Chap. XIV. The names of all sorts of great Ordnance, and their appurtenances,
with their proper terms and expositions, also diverse observations concerning
their shooting, with a Table of proportion for their weight of metal, weight
of powder, weight of shot, and there best at random and point blank enlarged.
The Names of great Ordnance.
A Canon royal, or double Canon, a Canon, a Canon Serpentine, a bastard Canon, a
demi Canon, a Canon Petro, a Culuering, a Basilisco, a demi culuering, a
bastard Culuering, a Sacar, a Minion, a Falcon, a Falconet, a Serpentine, a
Rabbinet. Carriages.
To all those do belong carriages whereon pieces do lie supported by an
axeltree betwixt two wh^eles, Trunnions.
whereon doth lie the piece upon her trunnions, which are two knobs cast with
the piece on each of hersides, which doth lie in two half holes upon the two
cheeks of the carriages, to raise her up or down as you will, Capsquares.
over them are the capsquares, which are two broad pieces of iron doth cover
them, made fast by a pin with a fore locke to keep the piece from falling out.
That the piece and carriages is drawn along upon wheels every one doth know,
Wheels.
if she be for land service, they have wheels made with spokes like coach
wheels, and according to their proportion strongly shod with iron, Trucks.
and the pins at the ends of the Axeltree is called Linch pins.

If for Sea she have Trucks, which are round entire pieces of wood like
wheels. To mount a Piece.

To dismount a Piece.

Beds.

Quoines.


To mount a piece is ^o lay her upon her carriages; to dismount her to take her
down. Her Bed is a plank doth lie next the piece, or the piece upon it upon
the carriage, and betwixt the Piece and it they put their quoines, which are
great wedges of wood with a little handle at the end to put them forward or
backward for levelling the Piece as you please. Trauas.
To trauas a Piece is to turn her which way you will upon her Platform.
Dispert.
To dispert a Piece is to find a difference betwixt the thickness of the
metal at her mouth and britch or carnouse, Britch.

Carnouse.

Musell.


which is the greatest circle about her britch, and her mussell Ring is the
greatest circle about her mouth thereby to make a just shot, there are diverse
ways to dispert her, but the most easiest is as good as the best: and that is
but by putting a little stick or a straw that is strait into the toutch hole
to the lower part of the Sillinder or Concave, Sillinder.

Concave.

Bore.


which is the bore of the Piece and cut it off close by the metal, and then
apply it in the same manner to the mouth, and it will exactly show you the
difference, How to dispert a Piece.
which being set upon the mussell of the Piece with a little Clay, Pitch, or
Wax, it will be as the pin of any Piece is to the sight, level to the
carnouse or britch of the Piece, otherways you may give her allowance
according to your judgment.

Taper board, Taper board.
is when a Piece is wider at the mouth then towards the britch, which is
dangerous (if the Bullet go not home) to burst her. Honicombed, Hony-combe.
is when she is ill cast or overmuch worn she will be rugged within, which
is dangerous for a cross bar shot to catch hold by, or any rag of her
wadding being a fire and sticking there may fire the next charge you put in
her; How to find it.
and you may find if she be Taper board, either with a crooked wire at the
end of a long staff, by scratching up and down to see where you can catch any
hold, or a light candle at the end of a staff thrust up and down to see if you
can see any fault. Britchings.
Britchings are the ropes by which you lash your Ordnance fast to the Ships
side in foul weather. Chambers.
Chambers is a charge made of brass or iron which we use to put in at the
britch of a sling or Murderer, containing just so much powder as will drive
away the case of stones of shot, or any thing in her. In a great Piece we call
that her Chamber so far as the powder doth reach when she is laded.

Cartrages.
A Cartrage is a bag of Canvas made upon a frame or a round piece of wood
somewhat less than the bore of the Piece, they make them also of paper, they
have also Cartrages or rather cases for Cartrages made of Latin to keep the
Cartrages in, which is to have no more powder in them than just the charge of
your Piece, and they are closely covered in those cases of Latin, Cases.
to keep them dry, and from any mischances by fire, and are far more ready
and safer than your Ladles or Budgbarrels. A Budgbarell.
A Budgbarrell is a little Barrel made of Latin, filled with powder to carry
from place to place for fear of fire; in the cover it hath a long neck to
fill the Ladles withal without opening. A Ladle is a long staff with a piece
of thin Copper at the end like half a Cartrage, A Ladle.
in breadth and length so much as will hold no more powder than the due charge
for the Piece it belongs to. A Sponge.
A Sponge is such another staff, with a piece of a Lamb skin at the end about
it to thrust up and down the Piece, to take off the dust, moisture, or sparks
of fire if any remain in her. A Rammer.
And a Rammer is a bob of wood at the other end to ram home the Powder and
the Waddings. Waddings.
Waddings is Okum, old clouts, or straw, put after the powder and the Bullet.
Wood cases.
A Case is made of two pieces of hollow wood joined together like two half
Cartrages fit to put into the bore of a Piece, Case shot.
a case shot is any kind of small Bullets, Nailes, old iron, or the like to
put into the case to shoot out of the Ordnances or Murderers, these will do
much mischief when we lie board and board: but for Spunges and Rammers they
use now a stiff Rope a little more than the length of the Piece, which you may
turn and wind within board as you will, with much more ease and safety than
the other.

Round Shot is a round Bullet for any Piece: Round shot.

Cross bar shot.


Crosbarshot is also a round shot, but it hath a long spike of Iron cast with
it as if it did go thorough the midst of it, the ends whereof are commonly
armed for fear of bursting the Piece, To Arm a shot.
which is to bind a little Okum in a little Canvas at the end of each Pike.
Trundle shot.
Trundle shot is only a bolt of iron sixteen or eighteen inches in length;
at both ends sharpe pointed, and about a handful from each end a round broad
bowl of lead according to the bore of the Piece cast upon it. Langrell shot
runs loose with a shackell, Langrill shot.
to be shortened when you put it into the Piece, and when it flies out it doth
spread it self, it hath at the end of either bar a half Bullet either of
lead or iron. Chain shot.
Chain shot is two bullets with a chain betwixt them, and some are contrived
round as in a ball, yet will spread in flying their full length in breadth; all
these are used when you are near a ship to shoot down Masts, Yards, Shrouds,
tear the sails, spoil the men, or any thing that is above the decks. Fire
works.
Fireworks are diverse, and of many compositions, Arrows of wild fire.

Pikes of wild fire.

Granados of diverse sorts.

Brass Balls.


as Arrows trimmed with wild fire to stick in the sails or ships side shot
burning. Pikes of wild fire to strike burning into a ship side to fire her.
There is also diverse sorts of Granados, some to break and fly in abundance of
pieces every way, as will your brass balls earthen pots which when they are
covered with quartered bullets stuck in pitch, and the pots filled with good
powder, in a crowd of people will make an incredible slaughter; some will burn
under water, and never extinguish till the stuff be consumed; some only will
burn and fume out a most stinking poison smoke; some, being but only an Oil,
being nointed on anything made of dry wood, will take fire by the heat of the
Sun when the Sun shines hot. There is also a Powder, which being laid in
like manner upon any thing subject to burn, will take fire if either any rain
or water light upon it; but those inventions are bad on shore, but much worse
at Sea, and are nought because so dangerous, and not easy to be quenched, and
their practise worse, because they may do as much mischief to a friend as to
an enemy, therefore I will leave them as they are.

Powder.

Serpentine powder.

Gross corned Powder.

Fine corned Powder.


There are also diverse sorts of Powder, the Serpentine is like dust and weak,
and will not keep at Sea but be moist. The common sort is great corned powder
but gross, and only used in great Ordnance. Your fine corned Powder for hand
Guns is in goodness as your Salt-Peter is oft refined, and from ten pence a
pound to eighteen pence a pound.

A Tomkin.
A Tomkin is a round piece of wood put into the Pieces mouth and covered with
Tallow, A Fid
and a fid a little Okum made like a nail put in at the toutch hole, and
covered with a thin lead bound above it to keep the Powder dry in the Piece.
Shackels.
Shackels are a kind of Rings but not round, made like them at the hatches
corns (by which we take them up and lay them down) but bigger, fixed to the
midst of the por^s within board, through which we put a billet to keep fast
the port for flying open in soul weather, which may easily endanger, To cloy a
Piece or poison her.
if not sink the Ship. To cloy or poison a Piece, is to drive a nail into her
toutch hole, then you cannot give fire. To vncloy.
And to vncloy her, is to put as much oil as you can about the nail to make
it glib, and by a train give fire to her by her mouth, and so blow it out.

Compass Callipers.
Compass Callipers belongs to the Gunner, and is like two half Circles that
hath a handle and joint like a pair of Compasses, but they are blunt at the
points to open as you please for to dispert a Piece. Horne.

Priming Iron.


A Horne is his touch box, his Primer is a small long piece of iron, sharpe at
the small end to pierce the Cartrage thorough the toutch hole. His Lint stock is
a handsome carved stick, Lint stock.

Match, and a sharpe pike in the other to stick it fast upon the Deck or
platform upright. Gunners quadrant.

The names of small Pieces, and their implements


The Gunners quadrant is to level a Piece or mount her to any random. A dark
Lantern is as well to be used by any body as he. For Morters, or such
chambers as are only used for triumphs, there is no use for them in this
service; but for Curriours, Hargabusacrocks, Muskets, Bastard-muskets,
Coliuers, Crabuts, Carbins, long Pistols or short Pistols, Bandilers.

Bullet bags.

Worms.

Scowrers.

Melting Ladles.

Quartered shot.


there belongs to them Bandiliers, bullet Bags, Worms, Scowrers, melting
Ladles, Lead, Molds of al sorts to cast their shot. Quarter Bullets is but any
bullet quartered in four or eight parts, and all those are as useful a
ship-boord as on shore. For the soul, trunk, bore, fortification, the
diversity of their metals, and diverse other curious Theormes or terms used
about great Ordnance, there are so many uncertainties as well in her mounting,
levelling upon her platform, as also the accidents that may happen in the
powder, the ground, the air, and differences inproportion, I will not
undertake to prescribe any certain artificial rule. These proportions
following are near the matter, but for your better satisfaction read Master
Digs Pantrimetria, Master Smith, or Master Burns art of Gunnery, or Master
Robert Nortons Exposition upon Master Digs Stratiaticos, any of those will show
the Theoricke at large. But to be a good Gunner you must learn it by
practise.

Note that seldom in Ships they use any Ordnance greater than Demi Canons, nor
have they any certainty either at point blank or any random.

Note your Serpentine powder in old time was in meal, but now corned and made
stronger, and called Canon corn powder.

But that for small Ordnance is called corn Powder fine, and ought to have in
strength a quarter more, because those small Pieces are better fortified than
the greater.

Now if you have but one sort of Powder for all, abate part, and cut off of the
breadth and length of your Ladle.

But Cartrages are now found the best and most readiest.

Provided always, that all Shot must be a quarter less than the height of the
Piece.

CHAP. XV. How they divide their shares in a man of War, what Books and
Instruments are fit for a Sea man, with diverse aduertisements for Sea men, and
the use of the petty Tally.
THe ship hath one third part, the victuallar the other third, the other third
part is for the Company, and this is subdiuided thus in shares. Shares.


The Captain hath 10 In some but 9. The Lieutenant 9 or as he agrees with the
Captain. The Master 8 In some but 7. The Mates 7 5. The Surgeon 6 3. The
Gunner 6 5. The Boatswain 6 5. The Carpenter 6 5. The Trumpeter 6 5. The 4.
quarter Mast. 5 apiece, or 4. The Cooper 5 4. The Chirurg. Mate 5 4. The
Gunners Mate 5 4. The Carpent. Mate 5 4. The Corporal 4 3. The quarter Gunners
4 3. The Trump. Mate 3 3. The Steward. 4 3. The Cooke 4 3. The Coxswaine 4 3.
The Swabber 4 3.

In English ships they seldom use any Marshall, whose shares amongst the
French is equal with the Boatswaines, all the rest of the Younkers, or
fore-mast-men according to their deserts, some 3. some 2. and. some 1. and ^.
and the boys 1. which is a single share, or 1. and. or as they do deserve.

Now the Master, or his right hand Mate, the Gunner, Boatswain, and four
quarter Masters do make the shares, not the Captain, who hath only this
privilege, to take away half a share, or a whole share at most, to give from
one to another as he best pleases.

For to learn to observe the Altitude, Latitude, Longitude, Amplitude, the
variation of the Compass, the Suns Azimuth and Almicanter, to shift the Sun
and Moon, and know the tides, your Rooms, prick your Card, say your
Compass, and get some of these books, but practice is the best. Master
Wrights errors of Navigation. Master Tapps Sea-mans Calendar. The Art of
Navigation. The Sea Regiment. The Sea-mans secret. Waggoner. Master Gunters
works. The Sea-mans glass for the Scale. The New Attracter for variation.

Instruments fitting for a Sea-man.
Compasses so many pair and sorts as you will, an Astrolobe Quadrant, a Cross
staff, a Back staff, an Astrolobe, a Nocturnal.

Young Gentlemen that desires command at Sea, Aduertisment^ for young
Commanders, Captains, and other Officers.
ought well to consider the condition of his ship, victual, and company, for
if there be more learners than sailers how slightly soever many esteem
sailers, all the work to save, ship, goods, and lives must lie upon them,
especially in foul weather, then their labour, hazard, wet and cold, is so
incredible I cannot express it. It is not then the number of them that here
can say at home what I cannot do I can quickly learn, and what a great matter
is it to sail a ship, or go to Sea; surely those for a good time will do
more trouble than good, I confess it is most necessary such should go, but
not too many in one ship; for if the labour of threescore should lie upon
thirty, (as many times it doth) they are so ouer-charged with labour, bruises,
and overstraining themselves they fall sick of one disease or other, for there
is no dallying nor excuses with storms, gusts, overgrown Seas, and
lee-shores, and when their victual is putrified it endangers all: Men of all
other professions in lighting, thunder, storms, and tempests with rain and
snow may shelter themselves in dry houses by good fires, but those are the
chief times Sea-men must stand to their tackling, and attend with all
diligence their greatest labour upon the decks. Many suppose any thing is good
enough to serve men at sea, and yet nothing sufficient for them ashore, either
for their healths, for their ease, or estates, or state; A Commander at Sea
should do well to think the contrary, and provide for himself and company in
like manner; also seriously to consider what will be his charge to furnish
himself at Sea with bedding, linen, arms, and apparel, how to keep his
table aboard, and his expenses on shore, and provide his petty Tally, which is
a competent proportion according to your number of these particulars following.
^he petty Tally.


Fine wheat flower close and well packed, Rice, Currands, Sugar, Prunes,
Cynamon, Ginger, Pepper, Cloves, green Ginger, Oil, Butter, Holland cheese,
or old Cheese, Wine vinegar, Canary sack, Aqua vita, the best Wines, the best
waters, the juice of Limons for the scurvy, white Biscuit, Oatmeal, gammons of
Bacon, dried Neats tongues, Beef packed up in vinegar, Legs of Mutton minced
and stewed, and close packed up, with tried sewet or butter in earthen pots. To
entertain strangers Marmalad, Suckets, Almonds, Comfits and such like.

Some it may be will say I would have men rather to feast than fight; The use
of the petty Tally.
But I say the want of those necessaries occasions the loss of more men than
in any English fleet hath been slain since 88. For when a man is ill, or at
the point of death, I would know whether a dish of buttered Rice with a little
Cynamon, Ginger, and Sugar, a little minced meat, or roast Beef, a few stewed
Prunes, a race of green Ginger, a Flap-iacke, a can of fresh Water brewed with
a little Cinnamon, Ginger, and Sugar be not better than a little poor Iohn, or
salt fish with oil and mustard, or biscuit, butter, cheese, or oatmeal pottage
on fish days, or on flesh days salt Beef, Pork, and Peas with six
shillings beer, this is your ordinary ships allowance, and good for them are
well if well conditioned, which is not always as Sea-men can (too well)
witness. And after a storm, when poor men are all wet, and some have not so
much as a cloth to shift him, shaking with cold, few of those but will tell you
a little Sack or Aqua vitae is much better to keep them in health, than a
little small beer, or cold water although it be sweet. Now that every one
should provide those things for himself, few of them have either that
providence or means, and there is neither Ale-house, Tavern, nor Inneto burn
a faggot in, neither Grocer, Poulterer, Apothecary, nor Butchers shop, and
therefore the use of this petty Tally is necessary, and thus to be employed as
there is occasion. To entertain strangers as they are in quality every
Commander should show himself as like himself as he can, as well for the
credit of the ship, and his setters sorth, as himself; but in that herein
every one may moderate themselves according to their own pleasures, therefore
I leave it to their own discretions, and this brief discourse, and my self
to their friendly construction, and good opinion.

FINIS.
