vi^e / yt which is called in English the water of life. First fill a pot of
old reed wine clear strong / and do therein powder of Canell / gylof^r / gynger
/ pelatur / nutmegge / galyngale / spyknarde / ma^s / quybyles / grains of
Parys / loge pepur / black syromoten / comyn / fenell sede / smalage / persly
/ sage / mynt / few / calamynt and horshoue of yche of them like much / and
be ware that they dyffre not the weight of a dram under nor above at the most
/ ye weight of a drame is two pens halfpeny / tha put all ye above said
powders in the wine / and after put them in a styllatory and dystyll it with
soft fire / loke that thy styllatory be well clemed so that no fumosyte go out
/ and loke that thy fire be of good cole / also receive thy water out of a
Lebecke in a viol of glass. This water is called the water of life / it may be
likened to bame and put in the stead of bame natural / for it has all ye
natures of kind of bame al^ ye virtues thereof / therefore philosophers do name
it the second bame This water is clear and lighter than the water of roses /
for it will flete above all lytours / for if oil be put above this water anon
it secheth the ground. This water kepeth flesh and fysshe both raw and
sothen in his own kind state. Also as lunge as a man is withouten wemme or
rottynge if he be washed therein it helps greatly against achys in the bones
pockes / such other. And no manner of thing that is put therein may not rot.
This water of life draws out the sweetness savour of all manner of spices and
of all rotes that ben therein netted or laid. Also it gyves sweetness to al
manner of maters that it is mingled with. And it is good for all manner of cold
sekenesse / namely for the palsy / for quakynge of a man lymmes / for
searching of a man senewes / and it is good against the cold gout / also
it makes an old ma to seem young / also it stregtheth al manner of spirits
within a man body when that he has drunken ^ quantyte thereof fasting /

a man sight. And on wounds it freteth away the deed flesh. Also it
destroys the Canker.
