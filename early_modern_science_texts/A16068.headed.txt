(...) health. In all these things are certain secrete virtues, which be
manifest signs of gods love and favour towards man: for he created them
to the intent that men should use them, glorify him, and give him thanks for
them. And because the use and knowledge of them, and their virtues, is so
expedient for al creatures, God of his mere goodness, hath not only given unto
the diligent searchers thereof, the gift of perfect usage, and understanding
of their operation in this time of Christianity: but also unto infideles
before Christ, being ignorant from whence that gyfte came: who,
notwithstanding their ignorance, did so reverence the wonderful virtues of
things created in the world, that they thought that each of those things had
had in it self a certain divine power, or else that there was of every thing
a several god or creator. Now, if they gave such honour unto things
created, not knowing the creator, what would they have done, if they had
known and confessed God to have been the only maker of the world, of man,
and of all things therein, of nothing? Truly they would not have done as
some curious Christians among us now a days do, which (as your honour well
understands) most impudentlye despise all manner of medecines, and
ignorantly dispute against the virtues and operation of herbs, and trees,
saying: that if the sick man be appointed of God to dye, all the medecines in
the world can not save his life. Whereunto it may easily be answered, that
every man that is vexed with a disease, is not appointed of God to die of the
same: but the infirmity is sent him as a punishment for his offences, and yet
hath God created things to give him ease and remedy for his disease, which no
Christ man ought to contempne or despise: for he that despises the work,
seems to contempne the workman. And again, because that the appointment and
determination of God, concerning the life and death of man, is so secrete, and
so far beyond the capacity of mans reason, and understanding, and that we
know not when God hath prefixed the term of our life, we use in our
infirmities and weakness, those remedies that God hath created to be received at
their hands, to whom he hath given the knowledge howe to minister them unto
us. All these things are abundantly enough known unto your honour, with a
great many more reasons then I am able to allege, and therefore I do but bring
owls to Athens in declaring this unto you. But thus much I may well say,
that most mad are they, and void of all reason Christianity, that while set
so light by the works of God: yea, they are unprofitable members of a common
wealth, not worthy to bear the name of Christians: for by their fond and false
persuasions to the ignorant and simple ones in their diseases, against the
receiving of any medicines, many times it chances, that they following their
foolish advise in neglecting Physic, they be cast away and perish, which
otherwise might have been saved. Me thinks this should be sufficient to
persuade the to embrace good and wholesome remedies: they see daily that
herbs, oinctmentes, plasters made of things growing on the earth, and such
like, by their virtues, do cure and heal external and outward wounds,
sores, cuts, swellinges, and other infirmities of the body, and yet they will
not believe that such virtues can heal the internal and inward diseases.
Utterly ignorant be they, that so imagine with them selves, for they that
despise Physic, despise a heavenly science. But what be they that thus
contempne it? Forsooth ignorant unlearned men, that bark at, and backbite
them that take pains for the commodity of all men. But it is commonly seen
and proved. Scientia non habet inimicum praeter ignorantem. Which saiynge (I
fear me) is verified more in some of us English men, than in any other
nation, I would God it were not. And yet I think there is no man so
bestial, so rude, or so blunt of wit, but that he is (by a certain instinct
of natural inclination) desirous to know things not before known, to hear
news not before heard, and to understand books in his maternal tongue, written
first in a foreign langage, to the end not to seem altogether ignorant in
matters both of the liberal sciences, and also of histories, set forth for his
rudiment and instruction, as in Cosmography, in Astronomy, in Philisophie, in
Logic, in Rhetoric, and specially in Physic, whereof we had never so much
need as in these our days, considering the strange and unknown diseases
that swarm among us, and mo in number then can be found remedy for. Therefore
considering with my self (right honourable) that I could not better declare my
bounden duty unto you, nor do my country a greater pleasure, than to put
some thing abroad under your honours name, whereby it might receive some
commodite: I have taken in hand to translate this noble and excellent work
called, The Secretes of the Reueuerende Master, Alexis of Piemount, first
written in the Italian toungue, and after turned into French, and of late
into Dutche, and now last of al into English, because that as well English
men, as Italians, French men, or Dutchmen, may suck knowledge and profit
hereof: being a work come out of the hands of so famous a man as Alexis is, and
dedicated first to such a noble prince as the duke of Sauoye is, to whom
trifles or fables are not to be presented, nor being a man under whose name
and protection lies or vain inventions ought to be set forth. Therefore
wayinge the age, the learning and fame of the auctor, the nobility of the
said Prince, men may easily judge that such intolerable pains have not been
taken in the collection of these secretes, to blow an vntrueth into men
ears, but rather that this book hath ben published and communicated to the
world by the said Alexis, for the care and good zeal that he had to the
health of men's bodies, and that men of all countries might have the knowledge
of that with ease, sitting at home in their studies, which he got with great
travail and labour, wandering almost al the world over, as in his epistle
here to the reader he declares.

And now (right honourable) like as Christopher Plantine of Antwarpe, the
printer of this work in French, chose the Prince of Piemount, to protecte and
adourne the fruits of his labours, under the honour of his name: even so I
the translator hereof into our English tongue, have thought it my duty
(with your honours favour) to present this my translation unto you, and to
put it forth under your honours name and protection, desiring, and humbly
requiring the same, to accept my poor good will, having good hope that you
shall find such things in the discourse of the whole book, that you will
not only take pleasure in the knowledge of them: but also commodity, if it
please you to put in experience and proof, those that seem most best unto
you: whereof there be some as excellent and as easy, as were ever set
forth in any toungue, as by your honours wisdom and judgment, in the
reading you shall easily perceive. I am not able sufficiently to praise the
excellency of the book, and the diligence of the author, ner to extol the
wonderful gifts of God in men, which according to their talent, impart to
the world the increase and fruit of soche gifts, as he distributes unto
them. Of the which gifts I think I should not much err, if I said Phisike
to be the best and the most necessary Nam si corporum nostroru,
tranquillitatis vitae (quae sine secunda valetudine vix esse potest) rationem
habere volumus, fatebimur medicinam excellentissimam, mortalibus necessariam
esse. And even so Cornelius Celsus which wrote most excellent Books of
Phisike, affirms saying. Alimeta sanis corporibus agricultura promittit:
sanitatem autem aegris medicina: et idcirco deo optimo maximo gratias habere
debimus, qui vitam nobis elargitus est: deinde medico, qui eam nobis conseruat,
diuturniorem{quod} facit.

All this learning and knowledge do the Greek auctors affirm to be most
ancient, and most necessary in a common wealth. For, as it is desired of all
men to live in health of body, so is it requisite that medecines, both
preservative and curatiue, be had and used among men, which not only
comfort the infirm and diseased body, but also puts the soul in
remembrance of Gods great power and might, that hath given such virtue unto
things growing on the earth, for man commodity, preservation, and health:
which health I pray God lunge to remain with you, and all your family with
much increase of virtue and honour, under the protection of almighty God.

Your humble Seruaunt William Ward.

Don Alexis to the reader.
THey that have known me in time past, or to speak plain, have used me
familierly all my life time, can peradventure, tel how God by his great
goodness, hath made me to be borne of a noble house and blood (according to
the commune, I will not say vain, persuasion of them, that stablish nobility
more in the merits of another man, than in our own) and that besides this I
have always had my pleasures, and great plenty of riches, yea far passing
the smalnes of my deserts. I will say yet more (not to boast or to advance my
self, but to the end to reform the gentill reader, and to give thanks unto
God) that there be many which know, how I being given even from my first
youth unto study, have gotten, not only the knowledge of the Latin, Greek,
Ebrue, Caldei, and Arabic tongue, and also of diverse other nations and
countries: But above al thing having by a natural inclination, taken a
singular pleasure in Philosophy, and in the secretes of nature, have wandered
and travailed abroad in the world the space of.xxvii. years, to the intent to
acquaint my self with all sorts of learned and discrete men. By the which
diligence and curiosity, I have learned many goodly secretes, not lonely of
men of great knowledge and profound learning, and noble men, but also of poor
w^me artificers, peysantes, and all sorts of men. Moreover I have ben three
times in Leuant, and sondry times have traua^led almost all other parts of the
world, without resting or seiourning at any time in one place above.v. months.
Now this my study and desire of knowledge, as well of the universal sciences,
as of particular secretes, and although it was given unto me by nature, as to
the most part of men (for every man by an instinct of nature desires to know
things) yet have I always been noseled up by a certain ambition and
vainglory, to know that, which an other should be ignorant of: which
thing hath grafted in me, a continual niggardnesse or sparing, to distribute
or communicate any of my secretes, yea unto my most singular friends that I
had: saying, that if the secretes were known of every man, they should no more
be called secretes, but public and common.

Now, it chanced these few days past, being in Milan: in the fowerskore and
two year, and seven months of mine age, that a poor artificer was
marvelously tourmented with the stone, and had been two days without making
his urine. The Cyrurgen that dressed him, knowing well that I had many
secretes, and singulerly for the stone, came to me, and requested me that I
would teach him the receipt, or at the least to give him the medecin,
composed and ready made, for the health of the patient. But I perceiving that
he would use other men things, for his own profit and honour, refused to
give it him, but willed him to bring me unto the sick man, and that I my self
would minister the medecin unto him gratis. The Physician, either fearing
blame if it should be known, that he had recourse to the aide of an other
man, having peradventure, bosted that he had the secrete himself, or else in the
mean time, still to make his profit in dissembling the matter, and differryng
it yet two days more, with diverse excuses and colours, until he brought me
to the patient, whom at my coming I found so nigh his end, that after he
had a little lifted up his iyes, casting them piteously toward me, he passed
from this into a better life: not having any need, neither of my secrete nor
any other receipt to recover his health. With this case I was moved to soche a
compassion and sorrow, that not only I wished my self evil, but also I
desired to die: saying my ambition and vain glory, to have been the cause that
this poor man was not succoured with the remedy, and gift that God the
father, and Lord of us all had given me. Wherefore, so great was the remorse
of conscience in me, that, desiring to sequestrate my self fro the world, and
not finding my self of soche a disposition of mind, that I could live in a
Monastery among religious men, better edified then I, I was at the last
fully resolved with my self, to choose a place separate from any Town, where I
have a little land, some books, and a study, for to avoid idleness. Here I
live a life, which I call a Monks life, with one servant, which goes to
the town, not to beg, but to buy my provision, and other things
necessary: for to sustain his poor life and mine, as long as it shall please
God.

But yet not having the power to put out of my fantasy, but that I was a very
homicide and murderer, for refusing to give the Physician the receipt and
remedy, for the healing of this poor manne, I have determined to publish and
communicate to the world, all that I have, being assured that few other men
have so many as I. And minding to set forth none, but soche as be most true
and proved, I have these days paste (taken partly out of my Books, and partly
out of my memory, all those that came to hand) made a collection of soche as I
am certain be veritable, true, and erperimented, not caring if some of them
be written, or printed in any other Books then this. For of this my collection
the reader, as touching those, may at the least take this vtilitee and
profit, that whereas before he mought have doubted, whether soche remedies
set forth by an other manne, were true or not, he shall be now assured,
under the affirmaunce of my faith: For truly, I would not set my self
(being in the age, and disposition, both of body and mind, that I am now
in) to write fables or lies, that should continue always. But of one poyncte I
will advertise the reader, and that is, that he do the things with good
diligence, and that in medecines concerning man body, he use the aid and
help of physicians: Although in dede many of them, moved with a certain
rustic, and evil grounded envy, with a passion of Ialousy, are wont to blame
and contempne things that come not of them selves. Wherefore, as well in this,
as in every other point, if he that will use these, should perchance find,
that the thing would not take effect according to his contentation, let him
beware that he abuse not him self in the confection of them, and to begin
again with more diligence. Assuring him self, that (as I have said) there is
nothing in this book but is true and experimented. And giving always glory and
praise unto god only for all, have a good hope, that, by mean of his divine
grace, I will consequently make you a present of the rest of all that I have
gotten in so many travails, voyages, costs, and diligent study.

Fare well.
THE Secretes of the reverent Master Alexis of Piemont.
THE FIRST BOOK.
The manner an secrete to conserve a man youth, and to hold back old age:
to maintain a man always in health and strength, as in the fairest flower of
his age.
All this is taken out of the long study, and diverse experiences, that a
gentleman made, by the space of many years, in the service of a noble Lady.
Being a thing most certain, that an old man, of three skore and ten years, all
withered withage, of a very evil complexion, and subject to diverse kinds of
diseases, was altered and changed, as into the age of sxe oir eight and
thirty years.
First, men ought to have always in remembrance, and before their iyes,
that no grace, gift, or commodity, is to be hoped for, but of God only. In
whose great clemency and goodness, the great prophet, being assured, and
stablished in conscience, through his perfect faith, cried, saying:
Renouabitur, sicut aquilla, inuentus mea. And by the same mercy goodness, he
prolonged, so many years, the life of Ezechias: made Moises to live a hundred
and.xx. years, and more, and not one of his tecthe, at any time moving: without
any dimnes of sight, or ache of head. He then, as a most mighty creator,
and father of all, having assigned unto man, the term of his life, and left
him to the arbitrament of his own will: and also having given virtue,
strength and properties unto things, and leaving them to execute ordinarily,
their mouynges and nature, hath also left power unto human creatures, to
preserve them selves in health, until the term and prefixed end of our
life, both universally and particularly. But, for asmoche as we know not,
how to employ things, according as they are convenable and meet for our
nature, and our chances or necessities, our disordinate manner of life makes
us to live, the most part in diseases, to precipitate our yougth and to
abbreviate much our life. Then, having our thought and mind, always firm
and sure in him, and replete with faith and devotion, saying in the name of
his infinite goodness, unto our selves: Longitudine dierum replebo eum, et
ostendam illi salutare meum. We will commence and begin, as inspired with him,
and assured to help our selves, with the virtue and strength of things,
created in the world by his divine power, only for our benefit. And minding
for a public profit, to communicate some thing, as well searched and found
out of my self, by long experience, as lately obtained and gotten, of a
special friend of mine, which also, by great diligence and experience, hath
by the space of seven years: proved this manner of preserving stablishing, the
health and yougth, I will first give you the manner, how to make a miraculous
licoure, conseruatiue, and restorative of the natural heate, and radical
humour, in the which two things consists, principally the health, the
vigour, the strength, and the life of man.

To make a precious licoure, and of inestimable virtue: the which taken at the
mouth, strengthens and augments the natural heate, and radical humidite
purifieth the blood, and cleanses the stomach from all superfluity of
humours: and by that mean conserveth the health and yougth, and prolongs the
life of him that uses it.
IN the month of May, at the Son rising, thou shalt take up in a peuter
dish, or some vessel of glass, being very clean, the dew that is fallen
upon Rosemarie, Borrage, and other good herbs, Sage only excepted, for it is a
thing most certain, that under Sage certain venomous beasts, are wont to
assemble, which infect and poison it, with their breathe: and though that the
leaves, may by wasihing be purified and cleansed, from soche exhalatio and
breathing, yet nevertheless, if the dew that falls upon the leaves, chance
to take soche venom and poison, it is not possible by any means to purify it:
and therefore you shall not take up the dew of Sage. Then, after having
gathered as much dew, as you think good, have three glasses ready, of soche
greatness as you will, the which glasses you shall fill, some what more then
half full: the one with Sugar, the other with Manna, and the third with
Honey, the rest of the glasses remaining still empty and void: and then fill
them all up, full with the said dew, stopping them fast with white wax, and
cover them with a linen clothe. Keep them also in a cupborde, or some other
place out of the Son, as long as need shall be to use of it, as we will
declare afterward. And then take the inice of Quinces, have ready in a little
glass, some good Agaric, broken in pieces only, and not in poulder: the
which you shall cover, with thesaid juice of Quinces, in soche sort as you
have done with the Sugar, and other things in the glasses, and keep it well
covered. Then, take the Juice of all these things following, of red Roses,
or incarnate, of Succorie, of Endiue of Fumiterie, of Buglosse, of Borage, of
Mallowes, of Hoppes, of the leaves and flowers of Marche violettes: of each of
these iuices a like quatitie: then mix them well together. That done, take a
pound or two of Aloes Epatica or as much as you will: for the more there is,
the better it shall be, because that thesaid Aloe being sosteeped, watered, and
prepared, as we will she we you, is a very exquisite familiar medecin, to
keep in a house, and take of it by little lumps or pills, ones in the weke,
when a man goes to bed: for it kepeth the body from putrefaction, and from all
evil humours: and is very profitable and good, against the ache or pain in
the ioinctes, and also for the French Pockes, as herafter we will declare
orderly.

Take of the said Aloe, of the best and the freshest, soche a quantity as you
will, and put it in a cup of glass, or clean platter, as is above said, and
set it in a window or some other place in the Son, watryng or stepyng it in
thesaid iuices mingled together, giving it thereof as often as shall be sufficient
to make it moist, and to make of it as it were athicke sirop. Then cover the
cup with a clean linen clothe, or paper, to keep it only from the dust, and
leave it so in the Son. And when it is almost waxen dry, embibe or water it
again as before, and let it stand in the Son. This shall you do, so often,
until you have made it soak and drink up as much juice, as the weight of
half the Aloe only: that is to say, if the Aloe weigh two pound, make it
drink up at diverse times, one poud of thesaid iuices. This done, take these
things followeyng, Turbit half and uncle, fine Sinamom, Spica Nardi, Foal
foot, alias Astrabacca, Squinantum, Carpobalsamum, Xylobalsamum. The wood
whereof natural balm comes.
Xilobalsamum, Lignum Aloes, Bdellium, Myrrh, Mastic, of each of them an uncle,
with half an uncle of Safron: All these things being well beaten into powder,
and put into a clean pan, you shall pour into them, so much common water,
that it surmount thesaied matieres, a good hand breadth, letting them boil
with a a small fire, the space of an hour or more. After this you shall
strain the said decoction, and by little and little, water from time to time,
the said Aloe in the Son, as you have before done: and this you shall do so
long, until the Aloe have drunk up all the decoction. This done, take it out
of the Son, and it shall be a precious thing, to keep in your house, as we
have all ready declared, which also maintains the body in health, kepeth the
head clean, and causes to have a good colour, and a quick and lively
spirit, to them that use of it. He that is not of ability to make this
mixtion, in the manner above said, may make it in this wise. Keep diligently
the said Aloe, in little dishes of wood, to make this that we will speak
of, here following. Take Aqua vite, not to fine, nor of the first stillyng, but
stilled twice, or thrice at the most. And put in diverse little violles of
glass (the one bigger then the other) all these things following, well beaten
into powder, at the lest those that may be beaten, putting also in each of
them, asmoche of the Aqua vite, as shall be three fingers above them in the
Violles, doyng as hereafter follows. Take an uncle of small fine Perles, well
washed three or four times in clear water: and then being dried, and laid
in the juice of Lemons, or Cytros, well strained, leave them so by the space
of three days: and so put the said perles, that they may be with thesaid
juice, remaining in the glass, putting to them Rose water, three fingers high
or above the perles, as is before metioned. Then take an uncle of fine read.
Coral, and put it likewise in the Juice of Lemons or Citrons, using it in al
points, like as ye did the perles, putting it in a glass by it self with
Rose water, with four vnces of blew V^triol, well burned in a close pot. This
done, take the flowers tender stalks of Rosemarie, of Burrage, of Buglosse, of
Sage, of Selandine, of Isope, of Scabiose, of Rue, of saint Ihons wort, of
Primroses, together with all the tender leaves of the said herbs: and then
stamp them slightly in a mortar of stone or wood, and put them altogether into
one glass, or into diverse, with as much Aqua vite, as will be above them,
three or four fingers, as we have said of the other things, and let them
frande so in the glass, well stopped with ware or bombase. Take after this,
half an uncle of Saffron, well beaten into powder, and put it in a glass by it
self, with Rose water, after the manner of the other things: then put to it
four vnces of Triacle, with Rose water, in an other glass, after the
foresaied manner: and take one uncle of fine Cinamom, a quarter of an Uncle of
Cloves, an Uncle of Lignum Aloe an uncle of Anise seed, and uncle of Fenell
seed, half an uncle of Smallage seed, five or six vnces of Ieniper berries,
half an uncle of Chervell seed, of the seed and bark of a Cedartree, of each
of them two vnces, half an uncle of Myrrh, a quarter of an uncle of Storax or
Styrax Liquida, an Uncle of Bengewine, an uncle of Sandali, of all sorts of
Mirabolanes, of each of the three vnces, of Pine apple kernelles mondified
three vnces, of yelowe Ambre which the Apoticaries call Carabe, two vnces,
three vnces of white Dittanie grene or dry, the eight part (or as little as you
will) of an uncle of Musk. Let all these things he well stamped, and mixed
together, and put in a glass with their Aqua vite, as is said of the other.
You must then stop well all the said violles or glasses, or other vessels,
with wax or bombase, and with parechement over it: and so set them a day in
the Son, and the night following, in the air abroad. The morrow after, take
some great vessel of glass, as thick as you can get, having no cover,
because you may always loke into it: and thereinto you shall power fair
softly the Rose water, that is in all the glasses, each of them being coloured
with their substance, in soche manner that no part of the substances, which
are in the bottom, be mixte with it. And after, having put al the said Aqua
vite, into the said vessel, as is above said, ye shall set it in some place,
where as no Soon can in any wise come unto it. But beware that the three
first glasses, that is to say, with the Sugar, the Mana, and the Honey in the
dew, ought never to be set in the Son, but must be kept until you put it in
ur, as we will show you. And after that you have poured, the Aqua vite, out of
all the said glasses, ye shall put in other fresh, and set them well stopped
in the Son, and in the night in the air, as is before said. Then put them
all together with the other, in the said vessel of glass, and put again in
every violle other Aqua vite, and do as before: and thus must ye do eight or
ten times, or till you see that the Aqua vite, will be no more coloured, or
have taken all the substance of the drooges, that are in the violles. A man
can not change the said Aqua vite to often, because ye must pass all the
said waters of life, through a bath called Balneum Marie, as we will
hereafter declare by the which ye may pass, as well a great quantity as a
small, and by this mean also, ye shall lose no part of the virtue, or
substance of the said things, having drawn and taken it all with the said
Aqua vite, of the which ye must first have made provision, of four or five
flagons. Then, ye must take all the said Aqua vites, being put into one
vessel, and mixte them well together, with the three first violles, where the
Sugar, the Manna, and the Honey, with the dew, is: and then the violle with
the Agarie, and three vnces of the said Aloes, prepared and watered. After
this, put all these things in a great violle made of good and thick glass,
to the end it be not in danger of breaking, in handelyng of it. And to be more
assured, after ye have well mixed all together, ye may divide all the
substances, into diverse small glasses, or violles, to pass them through the
said Balneum Marie, at sondry times or at ones in diverse little fourneises, in
this mananer. You shall set and trim the violles with straw or Tow, in the
bottom of a pan or caudron, wherein there must be water, and set the said
caudron upon a furnaise of earth, and this is called stillyng per Balneum
Marie: Then set unto the violle, his Limbecke, with his recipient that the
substance take no wind or vent: then you must make your fire so, that the
caudron may sees or boyle fair and softly, and so shall you distille and
make come into the recipient, all the Aqua vite as clear as Cristalle, the
which, because it hath been passed through, by distillation diverse times, will
be better for all things then the other, and principally to be taken at the
mouth, because it kepeth part of the virtue and strength of the things,
that it was put into. Also you must understand that of the five parts only,
of all the substance, which shall be in the violle or violles three or four
parts must be distilled: and the rest to remain in the bottom of the said
violles. This done, let the oven or foruaise and the caudron cool, and in
undoing the Limbecke, and the recipient, ye shall take away the violles,
keeping well this distilled water for to serve you, as we have before said: and
then put all the substance, which remains in the said violles not
distilled, into some other great and thick violle or glass, well covered or
bound in wicker or osiers, stoppyng it well with wax or bombase, and above
that, with a double parechemente, and locke it handsomely in some place, far
from the Soon, and out of all heate.

This licoure hath not his like in virtue, the which take every weke ones or
twice, the quatitie of a sponefull, preserves health, drives away all evil
complexions from the body, maintains and strengthens so the natural heate,
and radical moistness, and vpholdeth a man in his strength and vigour of
the heads, and of the wit, makes the visage well coloured, the breath sweet,
the body young and lusty, that a ma is not able worthily to esteem, or judge
the virtue thereof: and less able to express and praise the great goodness
of God the creator, that gives soche virtue unto things created, and
opens the wit and understanding of man to know them, and to use them to
the profit and commodity of his creatures.

Now the manner how to use it, is this: In the Spring time, ye may take it
alone, or with a little broth of Veale, Pigeons or Chickens, or else in
Maluoisie, or some other good white wine. In Summer, ye must take it with water
of Buglose, or the decoctio of Borrage, Buglose, Lettese, Succorie, Endiue, or
else some of the said herbs: and at all times it is good to take of it a
sponefull, put into half a glass full of the milk of a woman, new brought a
bed of a man child, or of a nurrice that gives a man child suck, or else in
Gotes milk. And the quantity oft using of it must be observed, according to
the persons, time: for, unto a weke and aged man and those that have been
lately sick, or weak of nature, ye must give it oftener, and a greater
quatitie, then unto a young and lusty man. Also a man may take of it oftener,
and more in Winter, then in Summer. Now ye must understand, that all the
flowers, herbs, and other things rehearsed, are not found together in one time
and season: wherefore the said liquor can not be made at one time, but
beginning the first or second week of May, it shall be at the least, the
end of September or October, before ye can make an end: and therefore you
must gather from time to time, each thing in his season, as you may get them,
and put them in some vessel, every one by them selves, or with the other
things that they ought to be joined with, after the manner above said: and use
to dress and trim the said things, according to the time that you may get
them in. And yet if you can not furnish your self, with al soche things as I
have declared, take those that you can get, provided, that the rest which
you can not get, be not of to great importance: but it should be more
expedient and sure, to have of all, saying there is nothing of any great cost
or charge, or to hard to be gotten. Moreover, if you will have your matter in
good perfection, there rests but to make a natural dissolutio of fine gold:
and when you will take of it, take two parts of the said licoure, one part of
the dissolutio of the gold, which we will teach you to make hereafter:
although that in this present book, we will make no mention of the perfitest
manner, of making soche a dissolution, which we have gotten by great study,
and observation, and by often expertece of the thing, that we will do, as well
for not being very possible to show it by writing, without making
demonstration thereof: as for other causes but we will put here some other
manners and ways, both good true, and of soche importance, that peradventure
better hath not, unto this day, been found.

A potion or drink, to be used in stead of Sirop, good for men of al ages and
complexios, that will be purged the which, taken what day you will, drives a
way the evil humours, without moving or troublyng the good, or doing any
burte: And is also very good for the great Pockes, and all infinnities, as well
of the stomach, as of the head: and is like wise profitable for them that be
in health, to take twice in the year, in stead of an ordinary purgation, that
is to say, in the Spring time, and in September.
TAke Mallowes, and boil them in water, until they be soft, that they can
almost be no softer: then strain the decoction, and take powder of Scene, and
of the bark of Lignum sanctum, called Guatac, of each of them seven vnces,
well beaten to powder, and cleansed or sifted, Salt Ammoniac two dragmes: and
in the mean time, set the decoction of the Mallowes upon the fire, with half
a pound of Honey, and let the said decoction be about two common glasses in
quantity, whereunto ye must put half a pound of wine lies, and then let it
boils fair and softly, the space of half an hour, skimmyng well the Honey.
After this, ye must strain it, and put it hot as it is into a pot by little
and little, where the foresaied things be, that is to say, the Scene, the
Guaiac, and Ammoniac salt. Now in powryng, you must always stir the said
things with a Spoon, or some other thing. And then immediately ye must cover
the pot with his cover, in shutting it close, and closing it up with clay,
round about the sides, so that nothing may breath or respire out, and so set
the pot upon the fire, by the space of two Pater nosters, and no more. Then
take it from the fire, and wrap it in a pillow of feathers, well warmed by the
fire, or in a tubbe or barrel, full of bran well heated, or in some clothe
very hot, to the end it may be well nurrished and kept warm and leave it so
by the space of ten or twelve hours. Then afterward ye must open the pot, and
strain the said substance, through a strainer or thick canuesse, you must
have ready before, half a glass of white wine, and in the same three or four
vnces of Rubarbe, cut in small pieces, and that the Rubarbe have been in it,
the space of a day or two before: the which wine ye shall power into the
decoction of the said things, as soon as it is strained, as is aforesaid: and
put thereunto an uncle of Aloe Epaticum, prepared and ordered, as is above
said: or at the lest as the Apoticaries do sell it, and call it Aloe Lotum,
with the juice of Roses, or other wise, the which ye must put in, well beaten
to powder, with half an uncle of Cassia Lignea, and keep all this composition in
a violle, or other vessel well covered. The manner of receiving it, is to heate
it a little at the break of the day, and to take half a glass full or more
of it, according to the exigent of the sickness, and the quality of the
person, having taken it, he must keep his bed a while, and sleep, if it be
possible: and then rise and walk about the house, or else where at his
pleasure. Nevertheless, it were better that he kept the house, and specially
because of the moving of the body. And this may he use.v.vij.ix. or.xj.
mornings: for the plurality can not hurt. Also this potion or drink, is of
soche exquisite boutie for man body, that we need to use none other manner of
purgation, or medicine.

A very easy and good remedy, for to heal all manner of Pockes, which is
made with little cost, and requires not that a manne keep his bed or his
house, but may use it going in the streets: And it is also very good for all
sorts of grief in the iointes, in what part of the body so ever it be.
TAke.iij. pounds of raw Honey, and a poud of the Juice of the flowers of an
herb called Molis or Lung wort, which hath his leaf somewhat long, fat, or
full of carnosite, and somewhat white, his flower Yelowe, fassioned like a
belle: and for lack of the flowers, the Juice of the herb: then take half a
pound of Lignum Sanctum, beaten into powder, and having let it boil in common
water, a good while, ye must strain it, and put the said juice with the said
Honey, into a pot, putting to it three vnces of Aloe epaticum, ordered as is
before said, or as the Apoticaries sell it, washed with the Juice of Roses. And
then, upon the said Aloe beaten to powder, ye must pour as much of the said
water, wherein the Guaiacum hath boiled, as will mount in the pot four or
fine fingers high: Sorbu latin. Frech. Corme There grows none i England,
therefore we have no English name for it, sauig some english it, and cal it
seruis beries
then add thereunto two vnces of the Vineigre of Squilla, and let it boil
fair and softly, by the space of half an hour, or a little more, skummyng
well always the H^unie, and when it hath almost boiled enough, put unto it
three vnces of fine Sinamo, well beaten into powder, set it again a while upon
the fire: then, having taken it of, and setten it up to keep, ye must heate
of it in the morning a glass full: and after you have drunken it, eat a little
piece of a Quince, or of a fruit called in Latin Sorbum, in French Corme, or
grene Grapes, Pom Granade, or of some other binding thing, what ye will: and
keep your bed, sleapyng as long as you will: and also after you be risen,
and have done your business, yea, out of the house, if it come so to pass.
But (as we have said) to keep your bed or house, is always the best for
you, when ye use Physic. And this potion or drink, must you take from day
to day: but if the pain be not to vehement, it shall suffice being taken
twice in the week: and this doyng, you shall see a wonderful operation, and
ye shall not need to use Lignum sanctu, nor any other thing. This remedy only
is sufficient for all men, and hath been proved and experimented diverse
times, and upon diverse persons.

To dissolve and reducte gold into a potable licoure, which conserveth the
youth and health of a manne, as well taken by it self, as mingled with the
foresaied licoure, spoken of in the second Chapiter of this present book, and
will heal every disease that is thought curable, in the space of seven days
at the furthest.
TAke a glass full of the Juice of Limons, and heate it over the fire, until
it begin almost to sees: then take it from the fire, and strain it three or
four times through a Linen clothe, and afterward distille it through a long
gutter of Felt: then take two pound of raw Ho^nie, and set it on the fire
in a pot, mixyng with it the said Juice of Lemons, and adding thereunto half a
pound of common salt, that is clean, white and well beaten: mix well all
together, and let it sees fair and softly, until there remain no more skum
of the Honey. Then take that remains in the pot, and distill it in a urinal
of glass, making but a small fire at the beginning, encreasyng it by little
and little, and at the end great and sharpe: and when all is cooled again, open
the violle, and power the water out of the recipient, into an other violle,
stoppyng it sure for taking vent. This done, ye must break the urinal of
glass, and take the lies that shall remain in the bottom, and put it into a
covered pot, the which pot you must cover over and over with clay or mortar,
to the entente it may the better endure the fire: and after put it into some
fournesse, where glass is made, or into a potters fournesse or Lune kill, or
some other semblable thing, so that it may be in a great fire, by the space
of two or three days. And after that the said substance shall be taken out
again, stamp it well, and for a pound of the same, put in four vnces of
Manna, and two vnces of Sugar candy, and if there be more or less of the
substance, ye must put in a good proportio of the Manna and Sugar candy, in
equal quantity with the substance. Then put al into an other urinal of good
glass, well claied, and power upon it the water, which you kept before in the
violle, putting thereunto twice as much fine Aqua vite, as was in the said
first violle. And having trimmed and set the urinal of Glass upon the
fournesse, with his limbecke, and his recipient, and well closing all the
iointes with clay or mortar, ye shall make the matter distill fair and
softly, with a small fire: for it will easily distill: when it will distill no
more, augment your fire, so that ye may distille all that is possible. But you
must leave the water, with the violle, upon the fournesse, without moving it
any whit, until you will put it in experience. This done, take fine gold
foil, that is of xxiiij. Carates well fined with Antimonium: and take of the
said fotle, what quantity ye will, in a cup of glass, in minglyng them well
with Honey, or with Iulep roset or Violet, as men are wont to dress it to
write withal, whereof we will put parfitely all the manners and fasious, in the
fifth book of this volume. And after you have well vnmixed, and purged it from
the said Honey with hot water, as shall be said in the same place, you
shall put them to stille in a violle of glass: and then having taken of the
recipiente, put the said water into a long necked glass, well stopped with
white wax, having first put upon the said gold, which is in the violle, the
height of five fingers of the said water: and then set to the limbeck with his
recipiet, stoppyng well with clate the iointes, making the water, which shall
be upon the said gold, to distill with a small fire, not augmenting it at the
end, to make all to distill: and care not if the gold remain some what moist.
This done, take away the Limbeck fro the Violle, without taking away or
vntiyng the recipiente from the said Limbeck, not sturryng the water out of the
recipient. But take some man to help you, who, whiles you take the Limbeck of
from the Urinal, shall power upon the said gold, the same water that you kept
in the violle, stopped with white wax: let him put in as much as at the
first time, that is to say, the heighte of five fingers: then immediately set
the Limbeck upon the Urinal again, closing well with clay the iointes or
sides a new, making the distillation as before, and so consequently, until all
the water of the said violle, be distilled upon the said gold. And finally,
ye shall power the gold out of the violle into a glass, somewhat great, to
hold the water that you have distilled into it at diverse times, as we have
said in the Chapiter before: then set to the Limbeck with his recipient, and
see that by the space of.xv. or.xx. days, the water of the bathe be hot,
without seethyng, so that yet nothing may distille. Then after make the water
to sees, and distille all that may be distilled: and in the bottom of the
violle, the gold will remain dissolved into a licoure most precious, which
you must keep in some little glass well stopped. And if you will have it yet
finer, you may make it without taking it out of the said glass, in putting to
it again the said water, and distilling it a fresh, not keeping (for all that)
the water from seethyng, as you did before, but make it sees and distille all
at ones and this distilling may you reiterate as oft as you will: for the
oftener it is distilled, the better it is. Thus doing ye shall have a right,
natural, and perfect potable gold, whereof somewhat taken alone, every
month ones or twice, or at the least with the said licoure, whereof we
have spoken in the second Chapiter of this book: is very excellent to
preserve a man youth and health, and to heal in few days, any disease
rooted in a manne, and thought incurable. The said gold will be also good and
profitable, for diverse other operations effects: as good wits diligent
searchers of the secretes of nature, may easily judge. In this same manner
(observing all things diligently) a man may make of s^iluer beaten into foil
to have likewise a potable s^iluer, of a marvelous virtue, yet not soche as
the gold: And I assure you, that I saw above,.v. years ago, an English man
have a water made of silver, peradventure, trimmed dressed after an other sort,
according to diverse differet ways, teding (notwithstanding) all to one end,
with the which water the said English man did many things, esteemed as
miraculous, in healing many painful diseases and infirmities of ma.

To heal an excrescens or growing up of the flesh, within the yard of a man,
albeit it were rooted in of a long time.
TAke the lies of Honey distilled, or, if you ca not have soche, take Honey,
and burn it in a pot: and put the black leefe that shall remain in the
bottom, into an other pot, or into an iro pan, set it to burn or calcine in a
vernishers fournesse, or soche other in a great fire, by the space of.iij.
or.iiij. days, whereof ye shall have a substance as yelowe as gold, the which
will be excellent, to lay upon all manner of wounds: for it eats away the
evil flesh, mondifieth, and heals the good, without pain or grief, which
makes to be much better for all wounds, then is the Precipitatum, that the
Syrurgens commonly use. Take then of this powder an uncle, of Dogs turdes.ij.
vnces, leese of wine half a dragme, which is the half of theight part of an
uncle, fine suger^ a dragme, roche Alume burned a dragme, of Nill a dragme let
all these things be well beaten to powder, and sifted through a fine seeue
then take grene leaves of an Olive tree, and beat them in a mortar of stone,
moisting them a little with white wine, the which being well stamped, ye must
strain in a press, or between.ij. trachours, for to get out the Juice, and
put to it as much Plantaine Juice: then set it to the fire in a little pot,
and afterward put in it by little and little the said powder, minglyng
altogether continually: And last of all ye must add unto it, a little grene
wax, and a very little Honey rosat, that it may be a liquid ointemente and
so keep it. This ointemente is very precious, to consume all manner of
ercrescence, or growing up of flesh, in any tender place of the body, as in
the secrete members, or in the nose, whereunto a man dare not applicque any
strong or smartyng thing. Now when ye must use it for the carnosite, within a
man yard, you shall take first of all a Squirte, and fill it with white
wine, wherein dry Roses, and Plantaine leaves have been sodden and boiled,
wherewith also ye shall mix a little woman's milk, or the milk of a Got: then
wash well the man yard within, with this Squirte: After this take a little
wax candle, somewhat long, and of soche greatness, as it may enter into his
yard, at the point whereof ye shall put a little of the said ointemente,
warming it a little, and thrust it as far into his yard as you can, until you
feel the Carnosite, and leave the said ointmente within the yard a little
while: then take it out again, and do thus morning and evening, lying a bed
his bealie upward, when ye shall put in the candle with the ointement, and you
shall see a marvelous effect: for it shall heal him thoroughly, in few
days, without any danger.

To heal all manner of inflamatio and evil disposition of the liver, and by
this same secrete have been healed certain persons, which had their faces as
it were Leparie, great swollen legs, their hands inflambed, and rough
within side.
TAke flower, or Amilum made of Barley, which ye shall easily find at the
Apoticaries, and sees it half an hour in common water: then strain it, and
put it in an other new pot, that is clean and not, putting to it a few
Mallowes, Succorie, Hoppes, Endiue, and Burrage: and sees all these together,
until it be dissolved, and add to it an uncle of Sandal: and then strain
all, and take in a linen clothe, as much Cassia extracta, as will go in to
two Nuts, and put it within the said linen clothe with the Cassia, while
the water be hot, pressing it so harde between your two fingers, that all the
substance of it, may go into the said water: then put it to the Sugar or
Penides, as much as you will. Of this drink, which is of a very amiable
savour, ye must take from day to day, a little glass full in the morning,
lying in your bed, with your breast upward: then laying some linen clothe upon
your stomach, sleep if you can, and take of it also after you be up, and have
done your necessaries, the which doyng you shall find your self very well
healed in few days. But here note, that this must be done in Summer, and not
in Winter: and he that hath his stomach very cold, may wear before his breast,
some piece of Scarlat, or other clothe, and sometime annointe his stomach with
an oil, made for the weakness of it, the perfect composition whereof, we
will put hereafter.

To heal the Emorhodes or Piles in a night, a rare secrete and very
excellent.
TAke the leaves of grene Elder, and boyle them in water, until they be
dissolved: Then take a piece of red cloth, a little bigger then the palm of
your hand, and stretch it a long upon your palm. Now, must the patient be in
his bed, with his bealy douneward, because ye must lay the said leaves upon
the Emorhodes, hot as they were taken out of the caudron, having laid upon them
before, a little oil Olive. Then take an other little piece of cloth, with other
leaves, and take away the first, continuing thus, and chaungyng always the
leaves, if not all the night, at the least as long as ye may: and also in the
mean time, ye must let the patient sleep as much as he will, who, in the
morning shall find him self as lusty, and as well disposed as if he had never
had the disease.

A singular ointment, which heals all burnynges with fire, not leaving any
cicatrice or scar where it hath been.
TAke the white of two Eggs, two vnces of Tutia Alexandrina, two vnces of
quick Lime washed in.ix. waters, an Uncle of new Wax, with as much Oil
Rosatte, as shall suffice, and make thereof an ointmente, which ye shall find
very good, for this that we have spoken of.

A perfect and proved remedy for them that be weak of stomach, and can not
keep their meat, without vomiting it up again.
Having taken two pound of red wax, and made provision of a dishefull of
oil olive, take pieces of Alabaster, and heate the in the fire, and then
quench them in the said Oil: heate them again, and quench them as before:
and so three or four times. This done beat the Alabaster to powder, and mix
it with the said ware and oil, wherein it was quenched: then put all to
distill through a croak necked violle, like a Bag pipe claied round about,
saving the bottom, which distillers beyond sea do use, the French men cal
Retorte or Cornue, and make soche a fire, as the Oil may distille, with al the
rest yt possible may be distilled: and then keep it, putting to it half an
uncle of Myrrh, beaten in powder. And when you will put it in effect, ye must
take a little pan of Brass, or Iron: and having the tops and leaves of Worm
wood, which is a bitter herb, put them in the said Oil, and sees or fry
all together: then take it, hot as it is, and rub the patients breast with
it, up to the throat, doyng thus always at night, when he is in his bed, and
it shall make his stomach strong. He must use in his meat, as much Rosemarie
as he can, be it raw or otherwise, and specially in his drink. He must use
likewise the most excellent Aqua vite, whereof we will speak hereafter.

An excellent remedy, wherewith a woman of.xxxvi. years was healed, that had
so marred her stomach, that in the space of two years and an balfe, she was
never naturally purged douneward: and as soon as she had eat any thing, she
vomited it up again, so that she became yelowe, and as dry as a stick.
A Monk, of the order of saincte Augustine, a man of great knowledge, and
full of marvelous secretes, healed the said woman, with this remedy
following:, in the space of.xvij. days, made her as whole and sound fair, and
well coloured, as she was before her sickness.

First of all, he had made a little oven, like unto soche as men bake bread in,
ye which he did heate with rosemarie: and the said Oven was in facion like a
Bakers Oven, wherein he baked little pretty loaves and cakes, which he gave her
a lone, without any other thing to eat, viij. or.x. days, and gave her white
wine to drink without water. He gave her also gentle meates, with Sinamom and
Sugar: and every morning gave her in a glass, about a finger heighte of
water, made after this manner following. Aqua vite half a glass full, wherein he
put the yelowe pill of half a Citron, or Orange cut in pieces, the flowers of
Rosemarie a handful, fine Sinamom an uncle, Safron a quarter of a dragme,
Begewin a dragme, with a little Musk: and made her to be washed over and over,
or bathed in the decoction of Rosemarie, and other sweet herbs, ones a week:
and every night anointed her breast with the said Oil, distilled and sodden
with Wormewoode. And above al things, commanded her to keep a Cushen upon
her stomach, in the night time, and caused her to lye long a bed in the
morning: he made her also eat the confection of Diambre. And in this wise he
made her in xvij. days, as whole and as fair, as she was before, whom no
Phisicion could ever find remedy for, during al the time of her sickness.

Three remedies very good against he worms in little children.
TAke the flower of wheat well bolted, as much as will lye upon three
crowns of gold, and put it in a glass, and power unto it well water, or
foutain water, so much as will steep the said flower, and make it look like
as it were milk, and no thinner: then give the child drink of it, and you
shall see that with his siege, the Worms will come forth stark dead, which
is a very good remedy.

The second remedy.
TAke a Citron or Orange, and make in him a hole, as big as a penny, by the
which hole with wringing, ye shall make the licoure come out: and having made
a hole into the middle and more, ye shall power in to it oil of Bay free or
leaves, the Juice of Rue, the Juice of Wormwood, Triacle, flower of a kind of
poulse corn, called Lupinum or Lupinus in Latin, having one stalk, the leaf
in five divisions, the cod creuised about, having in it five or six
grains, harde, broad, and red. They be common in France Italie, but here
vnneth known. And sees all this a while: and then power it in a dish, and
annointe therewith the childes navel, stomach, temples nosetrilles, and the
uttermost part of his pulses, and ye shall immediately see a wonderful
operation.

The third remedy.
FOr children that be so little, that a man can not minister the medecin in at
the mouth, you shall take very good Aqua vitae, wherewith ye shall wash or
weate the stomach, or the breast of the child: then powder over the said
places, with the powder of fine Myrrh, and lay the child down a little while,
with his breast upward, and you shall see incontinent, that with the dung of
the child, the worm shall come out dead.

To heal children of the Lunatike disease, which happens unto them, by
reason of a worm with two heads, that breeds in their bodies, the which
worm, coming unto the heart, causes them to have soche a passion, that
often times it kills them.
TAke the tender stalks of a Wildyng tree, and dry them in the shadow: then
stamp them well, and sift them, and take of the said powder, and the root
of Gentian, of long Perne of each of them a quarter of an uncle, and half a
quarter of an uncle of Myrrh. All these things well beaten in powder, ye shall
put in a disshe, or in some other vessel, as you think good: moist them with
a little water: then take of it with your two fingers, and weate the lips and
the mouth of the child. Do this three or four times, and you shall see the
worm come out dead with his siege. This have I often times seen by
experience, and many children, which, for lack of good help, have died with
soche manner of Worms, the which afterward being opened, men have found
the Worm sticking upon their hearts. And for the same accident the other
remedies, which we have written before, against the Worms, be also very good.

A remedy for the falling sick ness.
TAke Germander gathered in Ma^, when it is in blosome: dry it in the shadow,
and make it in powder. And when you will use it, take the yelke of an Egg or
twain, and sturryng or breaking it with a sponefull of the said powder: then
sees it, and give it to the patient to eat. Do this, Morning and Evening,
eight days long: but all this while he must abstain from wine, and carnal
company of women, from al sort of poulse, as Beans, Peason, Vetches, Tares,
and soche other, from Salads, salt Flesh, and from all other things, which
are of a harde concoction or digestion. A very goodly and notable secrete.

To make oil of Brimstone, to heal all manner of Cankers diseases or sores,
which come of a putrified humour, and run continually, commonly called
Fistules, and also to heal old and inveterate wounds.
TAke Brimstone beaten in powder, and having steeped and mollified it, with
common oil, put it in a Gored, apt to still out of, so that it be brought
as it were like pa^e, the which you shall distill through the mouth of the
said Gored: and the oil that shall drop out, ye shall put into a violle,
filling it half full: and afterward fill up the said violle with Plantan
water, and with the Juice of Cardus benedictus, and so let it boil a pretty
while. Then wash the wound with Aqua vite, or white wine, and lay to it of
the said oil, and in few days ye shall heal it parfitly.

To take away the venom or poison from a wound, made by some poisoned weapon
or arrow.
TAke Assa Fetida, and a gomme called Galbanum, of each of them an uncle, and
steep them in Vinaigre, the space of a night, then set it to the fire to
dissolve, and strain it through a Linen clothe, miring with it two vnces of
Vnguentu diabasilicu: and lay it to the wound, and incontinent the said
ointmente will draw unto it self, and kill all the venom, so that the wound
may afterward be healed, as all other manner of wounds be: and in case ye
lack, or can not get Galbanum, it shall suffice to have only Assa Fetida, to
draw the venom out of the said wound.

Against the biting of all venomous beasts.
AS soon as the person feleth himself bitten, with any venomous beast (or at
the least as soon as is possible) take grene leaves of a fig tree, and
press the milk of them, three or four times in to the wound. And for this
serves also Mustard seed mingled with vinagre.

To draw an arrow head or other Iron, out of a wound.
TAke the juice of valerian, in the which ye shall weate a tent, and put it
into the wound, laying the said herb stamped upon it, then make your binding

And after heal the wound, according as it shall require.

Against a vehement cough of young children.
TAke the Juice of Persely, powder of Commin, womannes milk, and mix all well
together: then give the child drink thereof, and after, make this ointment
following. Take the seed of Line or Flax, and Fenigreke, and sees them in
common water: then press with your hand, the substance of the said herbs,
which you shall mingle with Butter, and so annointe the childes breast with
it, heatyng it often times.

For him that hath a bunch or knobbe in his head, or that hath his head
swollen with a fall.
TAke an uncle of Bay salt, raw Honey three vnces, Commin three Vnces,
Turpentine two vnces, intermingle all this well upon the fire: then lay it
abroad upon a linen clothe, and make thereof a plaster, the which ye shall
lay whote to his head, and it will altogether aswage the swell yng, and heal
him clean and nete.

A good remedy for one that is deffe.
TAke Mint, Sage, Penniroiall, Rosemarie, Isope, Mugworte or Motherworte, wild
Mint, Calaminte, Camomille, Millefoile, Yarrow or Noseblede, herb saincte
Ihon, Wormwood, Southernwood, Centorie, of each of them a hand^full: Sees

oils following, to be made at the Apoticaries: old Oil two vnces, oil of
Leek, oils of Almondes, of each of them an uncle, of the juice of Rue half an
uncle, of Maluoisie an uncle and a half: put all these things in a log necked
glass or violle, and let it sees with a small fire, until the Juice and the
Maluosie be almost all consumed: then take it from the fire, and put in to
it these Drogues following, well beaten into powder, that is to say, Spiknard,
Coloquintida, the stone of a Beaver, called Castoreu, Mastic, of each of them a
grain and a half: stop well the said violle, that nothing may take vent:
then put it in a pan full of water, and make it sees the space of three
hours. Then take it from the fire, and power the said licours in some platter,
which you shall set in the son, and leave it there until it shall become
very clear, and having strained it through some fine linen cloth, and pressed
well the substance, ye shall put a grain and a half of Musk in a disshe, and
incorporate it well by little and little, with the said Oil, and then keep it
in a violle, well stopped with wax and Parchmente. After this, take the pan
with the said herbs, and heate them upon the fire: then take, for a cover or
lid, a fonnell made of white Iron: and when ye go to bed, cover the pan
with the said fonnell, and see that the pan be good and hot: then, by the
little hole above, let the patient take the smoke into his ear, by the space of
half an hour. This done, heate the said oil, until it be luke warm, and
let it drop into his ear two or three drops: and stop his ear with a
little Musked bombase, or Cotton, and let him sleep thereupon. Now he must, in
receiving the parfume or smoke into his ear, have in his mouth some dry
Beans, and after he hath chewed them, spit them out again, to the end that in
chewing, he may open the conduits of his Ears. And with the grace of God, he
shall find himself healed in few days, provided, that the disease be in
aniwise curable. If in case this help not, ye need not seek any other
remedy in the world. If a man have also any hummyng or noise in his ears,
let him use the said medecin, you shall se, with Gods help a wonderful
thing: for it will heal the defenesse of a man, though he have had it.xxx.
years, so that he be not borne deaf. Let him use also to take pills to purge
his head, and to eat good meat always.

To heal a woman that hath the Matrice out of her nanaturall place.
TAke a Flint stone that hath been always in the earth, and not taken the
air, and put it in some basket, covered in a great fire: and when it is very
hot, put it in a little Tubbe or barrel, and weet it with Vinagre cast upon
it, and cause the woman to stand over it, to receive the smoke or parfume of
it, and than let her go to bed, for this must be done at night. Ye shall,
after this, take of the juice of Rue, make a little round balle of Cotton,
whereunto ye shall tie a thread: and than dip the said balle in the said
juice of Rue, and put it into the mouth of the Matrice, the which will
incontinent take the balle, and draw it in, and than it will return into his
natural place again. But you must bind and tie the ball sure and well,
least peradventure it should remain within. After this, make an ointment as
follows, wherewith ye shall anoynte the reins of her back. Take an herb
called in Greek Ciclaminos, of the latines Rapum, Tuber terrae, or Vmbilicus
terrae, of the Apoticaries Panis porcinus, of the French men Pain de pore, and
Rue, as much of one as of the other, and stamp them well: and than sees it
in a pan with old oil, until the whole be diminished by the third part.
This done, let it cool again, and having pressed out all the substance, ye
shall power it into an other new pan, adding to it a little new wax, and
heatyng it all together, until it be well incorporated: tha annoynte her
raynes with all, and lay hot Tow upon it, and than swaddel her as women do
yonge infantes. And so she must be laid in her bed, with her belly upward,
and her head lower than her buttocks. This must ye do from night to night,
three times, she shall be healed. She must also eat whote things in
operation, as Pigeons, and Hens, with spices and other like things. She
shall be healed without any grief, and if she had had it.xxx. years.

To make a woman's milk to come and increase.
TAke the green leaves of Fenell, make thereof a decoction, be it in wine or
water, whereof ye shall give the woman drink, as well at her meals, as other
wise, as often as may be, and she shall be abondant in milk. Furthermore, if
the woman have not ordinarily her natural purgation called Flowers, this well
serve her for a good medecin.

A very goodly secrete for the gommes or burgeons that remain of the great
Pockes, as well old as new.
TAke Bole armenick, Vinagre, and oil Roset, and make thereof a defensife, A
defesife is made when a surgien will lay any drawing or healing plaster upon or
to a wound, he makes some oyntmet restrain ^iue because it shall not draw or
heal to fast, and that is called a defensife.
or ointment, anointing the burgeons round about.iij. or.iiij. fingers large:
tha take.ij parts of the oil of an herb called Euphorbium, first found out
by Iuba the king of Libia. Look Ruellius, Lib. 3. cap. 53. and one part of
oil Violet: and mix them together, and annoynt the burgeons with all, having
first well washed them with Red wine, vorie hot. And when you have thus
anointed them, with the said oil of Euphorbiu, lay upon it some little band
anointed with Butter, leaving it so three or four hours, or as lunge as you
will: than uncover the Burgeons, and if you find no bladders, do once again
as before, until you se some. And than you may prick and break the said
bladders, or let them break of them selves: than ye may heal them with some
healing ointment.

Another remedy for the same bourgeons of the Pockes.
Wash the burgions with Wine, and make the defensif above said: than
take.iij. parts of Vnguentum aureum, and one part of Sublimatum, well broken
or beaten: mengle the said Sublimatum with the said ointment, and lay it with a
plaster upon the burgeons, leaving it thereupon, a day or more, if you can, ye
shall find the burgeons or buds, and the flesh fair and neat, which will
seem to be a miraculous thing, and if it work not well at the first, ye
must renew it again, twice or thrice, according as the burgeons shall be hard
and old. Now, when they be thorowlie dissolved and leused, take Butter washed
with Wine, and lay it upon a linen cloth, and put it upon them, and so shall
you heal them perfectly. Note also that the said ointment, with the
Sublimat, will draw unto him all the aquosite, and evil humours of the arm or
leg, whereunto it is laid. Wherefore it will not only heal the place where
you lay it, but will also purge the whole member of all evil humours, that is
in it, and therefore there is a very good water confect and made of it, for to
heal scabs, as we will tell you afterward. It heals also all other
accidents, whereupon you make any outward application: and (as we have said)
draws to him self al the watrishnes, and humour of the member, whereupon it
is laid. Now, when you will lay it upon the burgeons, or upon any corrupt
place, weet well the linen clothe, and the band that you will bind it withal:
weet well also round about the infect or sore place: for the said medecin,
will draw all the corruption thorough the said places. And this is a very
worthy and cra^i^te secrete, for all things, so that it be well used, made
and applied.

A very easy and parfite remedy for him that hath any blow with aswo^
d^staffe, or stone, or other like thing, yea, though he were gr^uouslie
wounded.
TAke Taxue barbatus, and stamp it, and take the juice of it: and if the
wound bleed, wipe it, and make it clean, wasshinge it with white wine, or
water: than lay of the said juice upon the wound, and the herb upon it, of
the which you toke the juice, and than make your bindinge, and let it be on it
a whole day: and you shall se a wonderful effect.

A water to beale all manner of wounds in short space: which is a thing that
every man ought always to have in his house, for the accidents and chances
that may fall, saying it is easy to be made, and with little cost, and that it
is of so marvelous an operation.
TAke a pound of new yelowe wax, or as much as you will, and let it melt
upon a fire in a clean pan: and then power it into another pan, or dish,
wherein must be Malmsey, Muscadel, or other white wine that is very good:
afterward take it out of the wine and melt it again: then power it again upon
the said wine, doing so.vii. times. And then take the said wax, melt it upon
the fire, mixyng with it a handful of brick finely beaten into dust:
incorporate all well together, put it into a croak necked viol of glass,
which distillars, call a Bagpipe, claied about up to the midst of the neck:
let it distill first with a little fire, by the space of.viij. hours: afterward
make your fire greater, at the end very great. But you must above all thing,
close well the sides and joints of the said vessel, and of the recipient,
which must be somewhat great. After that the oven all the other things be
cold again, you shall take the water out of the recipient, and shall power it
into a viol well stopped with wax and cyred clothe, so that in no race it
may take vent: neither set it in a place where any heate of the son or fire
may come to it: for it is of so fine a substance, that it would fly and
vanish away immediately. The said lycour is marvelous good for all kind of
wounds: and ye must weate and moist the wound with it, and hynde upon it a
piece of lynen clothe steeped in the said water. And among all the experiences
that hath been seen, this was experimented and proved upon a seruaunt of a
noble man called Feonello Pio de Carpe, resydent in Venise, the year 1548. the
which servant having received a stroke with a dagger upon the instep of
the foot, which is a place very dangerous, did nothing but lay thereto a
little of the said water, which a gentell man of the said Senyor Leonello had
in his house: in the space of two days he was so healed that scant could a
man perceive the cicatrice or scar where the cut was: it is also exceeding
good for shronken synowes. And if this foresaid water be well and naturally
made or distilled the second time, it is of so fine and persyng substance,
that if a man lay of it upon the palm of his hand, ye shall see it perse
thorough incontinent and in a moment, and leave the place dry as though it had
never been laid there. Therefore they that have any knowledge may help
diverse diseases, in adding to it some other liquor or powder, such as they
would have perse into the flesh.

To make oil of S. Ihons wort, which is called in Venise, and in diverse other
places red oil: and is of such virtue that a man can skantly express it,
as well to heal wounds, as other infinite diseases, whereof we will show the
most notable, and those that have been found true by experience.
YOu must gather in the month of May and June, the herb called of the Greekes
Hypericon, of the Latynes Perforata, of the Frenchmen Millepertuis, and of us
in Englande S. Ihons wort, before it begin to floryshe or have flowers: and
stamp it in a mortar of marble, or of wood very clean, and put it so
stamped in a violle or glass: and then power to it as much white wine as will
cover it all over, and add to it of good oil olyue about the height of two
fyngers, leaving it so in the said glass well stopped, and after that ye must
gather the said herb with his blossoms upon S. Ihons day in the morning after
the son is risen, and putting the blossoms a part, ye must stamp well the
herb with the stalks, and after ye have cut it very small, take it out of the
mortar, and stamp it in the same mortar also a little, the flowers or blossoms
which you kept a part, and mingle them with their herb, which was stamped
before. But the blossoms must wey four times or very nigh as much as al the
herb that ye gathered in the month of May, and before S. Ihons day, and was
put in the said violle or glass, with the wine and oil olyue. You must
after this mingle al these things together, and put them in some violle or
glass, or else in some pan of earth very clean, with the said wine and oil
olyue, and put to it again other wine and oil, until al be covered as
before: and then set al this in the Son in some vessel well stopped. And
twelve or fiftene days after when the seed of S. Ihons wort shall be ripe, you
must gather of it in the morning after the Son is up: and stamp it well, and
so mingle it with the said herb, and blossoms: but you must put no wine to
it, saving only the oil olive. And the said seed must in quantity wey as
much as the fourth or third part of the said herb before the wine be put
to it: also the oil must be of such quantity, as may be above all the
substances a good handful or two. After this set a caudron of water on the
fire, with hey or straw in the bottom: and put the said violle into it so
that it be not in danger of breaking, when the water begins to sees. This
manner of setting the violles or glasses in a caudron of boylyng water, is
called of our modern Philisophers, Balneum Marie, and it is dressed and
trimmed in this sort, as well for to distill with a Lymbecke, as for to make
putrefaction, evaporation, or dissolution: of the which things we will speak
afterward, when we comme to the matter of distyllyng. Then must you make the
water in the said caudron to sees, with the substance which is in it, by
the space of three or four hours, according to the quantity of the said
substances, vntyl the wine, or at the least the most part of it be drunk and
consumed, which ye shall know in this manner. Take a little of the substance on
the end of a stick, and caste it in the fire, and if it burn without any
noise, it is a sign that there is no moore wine left. The said violle must
be uncovered while the water boils, because the wine may evaporate and
breathe out. And if the said substance be so great in the violle, that it
pass five or six pound, ye shall put to it these things following, according
to the weight and measure that we will show you, and keep always good
proporcion, according to the quantity of the weight of the water, which
shall be moore or less then five pound. First take quick brymstone, or else
when it is made into long canes or sticks half a poud, commune white salt,
eight vnces, of smallage a dishfull well washed, first in water, and then in
honey rosat, or other honny (so that it be sodden and skymmed) four vnces:
ten vnces of Turpentyne, washed once or twice in well, river, or conduit
water, of the juice of Taxus barbatus, of the juice of white or black
Dictamum, of each of them four vnces, of Saffron three vnces, roots of
Dictamum, roots of Gentian, the roots of Imperatoria the roots of the herb
called Crocodilium or Carlina, the roots of Valerian, and the roots of
Selandyne, of each of them two vnces. And if the said roots be green, you
must stamp them well: if they be dry, ye must beat them into powder: an
uncle of myrre, two vnces of red ware, two vnces of fine Triacle, an uncle of
the seeds of a Cedar tree, three vnces of yuy seed thorough ripe, four vnces
of the seed of a Bay tree thorough ripe, six vnces of aqua vitae, an uncle of
Synamom, half an uncle of lignum Aloe. Let all these be well stamped, and put in
a violle or urinal with the said herb, blossoms, and oil: ye must stop
well the said violle, that the substance have no manner vent or evaporation.
Then make a fire under the caudron so that the water may be hot without
seething, and keep it so the space of two or three days: and the longer the
better. If in case the fire go out in the night there is no great danger: ye
may make it again in the morning, but you must keep it so much the longer.
Having then taken the violle out of the caudron, and left it in the Son all
the rest of the Somer, keep it in your house well covered: and the older such
oil wareth, the better it will be. But it shall be good to put to it every
year new juice, of the said herb S. Ihons wort, and of the blossoms and
seed well stamped, and that the said blossoms, herb, or seeds be sodden,
by the space of four or six hours in oil olive: and then must you power
all the oil with the substance into some vessel, and press well all the
blossoms and the herb, and cast them away, and put in other: and if ye
should do so every year the oil would not be the worse but rather
better. If al these foresaid things can not be gotten in one season or time it
is no matter: for a man may put them in as he finds them: and if ye can not
get them all, ye may put in them that ye can find or get. The virtues of this
excellent oil are infinite, of the which we will speak only of the chiefest,
those that have been proved by experience, as well of us as of other in our
presence, and by our appointment and ordering. First, it hath as much or more
virtue, then the true and right balm, and it is good for all cold griefs,
as well within as without the body: for the Sciatica, and cold gout, in
heating it and rubbing the place withal: for a quartayne, tertian, or quotidian
ague, when a man anointeth the rains of the back an hour before the ague
come. Also it heals marvelous well Colicam passionem, when a man rubbeth or
anoynteth warmely his breast or stomach withal, and when it is put in glisters
with other substances, as we will declare in the chapter of the Colicke
passion. And if ye anoint the place about the privy members of a man or woman,
it will make them to urine or peace well. If a woman have her fruit dead in her
womb taking three or four dragmes of the said oil, she shall be delivered
incontinent. It is likewise good for all griefs of the breast or stomach. It
is a thing above all other most excellent and miraculous for the plage,
anoyting the rains of the back, and in drinking two dragmes or two dragmes
and a half in good white wine: but note that it must be drunk before the
sixte hour after the sickness is begone, and rub the place of the
sickness with it, it being heated. It heals moreover all manner ulcers,
sores, boils, botches, and corrupt matter within the skin covered with a
skabbe, as well old as new, also brusings, or knocks. And good for other
infinite things, as every man may daily prove by experience. And specially it
is very good for the retraction or drawing again of wounds or such like.

To make an oil of a red dog, by the mean whereof (beside other infinite
virtues that it bath) I have bealed a friar of S. Onofres, who had by the space
of xij. years, a lame and dry withered arm like a stick, so that nature gave
it no more norishement.
TAke a yonge dog of red hear, and keep him three days without meat: and
then strangle him with a corde, and let him lye dead a quarter of a hour,
and in the mean time boil a kettle of oil upon the fire, and put the dog
in whole or in pieces, it makes no matter how, so that he be all there with
the skin and hear: and make him sees so until he be almost sodden to
pieces, keeping always the kettle close covered. In the mean time take
Scorpions to the number of four skore or a hundreht, and put them in a
basin on the fire, until they be thoroughly burned. Then put them into the
said kettle with the oil the dog, putting to it a good dishfull of great
ground worms, achees called of the apoticaries bismalua or maluiscus and in
Latyne hibiscus or Athaea.
or smallage well washed, a good handful of S. Ihons wort, a handful of
wild or marsh mallowes, and a handful of wall wort, with an uncle of Saffron.
Sees all these things well together, until the flesh of the dog be broken
and fallen in pieces. And because ye must have much oil, ye may at the first
put into the kettle two parts of water, and one part of oil: and in
seething ye may power in water, until the dog be all together broken, as is
already said: then let it wax cold. After this ye shall take the bones of
him and the herbs, and when ye have pressed and squissed them well, that all
the substance remain in the said oil, caste them a way.

This done, you shall take only that which is above upon the water: that is to
say, the oil and the grease, and cast away the water, if there be much: but
if there be but a little, so that you can scant discern the oil fro the water,
ye shall take all together, for a little water can not be but good. Then
strain it thorough a strayner or canuese, first weated or steeped in white
wine: and take then vnguentum Agrippe seven or eight vnces, of the marie of the
gambon and bones of a hog, a pound, of the marie of the hinder thighs of an
ass a pound, or as much as you may get. Put all these things together,
with the said oil and grease: and make it sees upon the fire: then add to
it a dishefull or an half of oil rosat: when it setheth, you shall put to it
three vnces of Mastick, two vnces of Gomme Elemi, eyghte vnces of red Wax:
but the Masticke and the Gomme must be well beaten into powder and sifted.
And when all this hath boiled the space of half an hour, let it cool again,
and set it in the Son in some kind of vessel well covered by the space of
certain days. Then shall you have an excellent substance and matter for all
kind of cold infirmities, and for many other. And as I have already said, I
have seen the experience of it in a Friar of S. Onofrey, that is to say: of
them that wear anhabit of Roan colour: but (as he said) he dwelt not in the
monastery, because of the said infirmity of his left arm, which was as
dry as the branch of a withered tree. Moreover, he said unto me, that he
did not remember nor could tell whether that chanced unto him, either by
sickness, or by some wound or hurt. The said arm was become smaller then
the other almost by half, so that the said arm had almost no strength at
all, and could not help it self in no wise. I caused him then to be
anointed with the said oil (which I had set in the Son the Somer of the
year 1547.) by the space of.ij. miserere, made him tarry in the Son until
the said oil was clean dried up, and had pierced thorough the said arm: and
within.lv. days, men did perceive and see perfitelye that the veins gave
nourishment unto the membre. Nine days after, the arm was as full of flesh
as the other: and with the help of god, was as whole and sound, as though it
had never been hurt. This said ointment or oil is a precious thing, and good
for al cold infirmities, for the gout: and specially for all contractions or
shrinkinges together of synowes or members, and wounds, albeit, the man were
wounded in the midst of the body, in putting into it this oil, shall a
miraculous thing beseene: and it is also good for the sinews. As I came from
Jerusalem in the year 1518. in a ship, of the which the master was called
Peter de Chioggia, we were set upon by five foists of Pirates, on this side
Corphu, and one of the Mariners so attainted with the stroke of a gone that he
had his arm bruised and broken, and with the same blow another hurt in the
breast. The Physician would have cut of the arm. But among other things that I
carried about with me, I found a bore of the said ointment, wherewith I anointed
his arm, and in the space of six or seven days, he was healed miraculously. I
have made many experiences, as well upon myself, as upon others: and having given
of it unto diverse men to aid them selves withal, they have told me that they
have found in it a marvelous virtue operation. If you make this oil in the time
when the herb of S. Ihons wort is found, ye shall put in the herb, the
blossom, and the seed: but if it be in the time when it can not be found,
after ye have made the first decoctio of the dog, as we have said, ye shall
boyle the oil the grease once again, putting to it the oil of S. Ihons wort,
whereof we have spoken before, or as ye may get it: that is to sai, half as much
as al the oil and grease is. And if ye can not find bismalua or wild mallowes,
ye may put in stead of it, y^ ointment called Dialtea, which is found commonly
at the Apoticaries. And when ye will boyle the dog in the kettle, it shall be good
to put to it, three torteses that live on the land and not on the water, and so
shall the said ointment be very excellent for the gout. A certain man of mine
acquaintance, of the age of thirty years, vexed with the gout, whom I made
take of this oil, and anoint himself a little in the place of the grief, and
about it, putting to it two parts of oil rosat, one part of oil violet, two
parts of the said oil of the dog, told me that he had found a marvelous
ease and help by it. And the said grief returning again four times at
sundry times, yet anoyntinge himself therewith three times (as is aforesaid)
the pain came unto him no moore in the space of three years that we were in
Rome together, which was the year 1514. And this man was called Diego, a
Portugall, and dwelled at the mount Iordan. Since that time, being gone to
Venise, and from thence into Leuaunt, I have heard nothing of him.

To make an ointment, the most excellent in the world, whose virtues are
infinite, as we will declare afterward. Which, Princes ought to command to
be made and kept in their common wealths: and that it should be made in the
presence of Physicians, as Triacle is made: or at the least every man ought to
have it in his house, and specially because a man may make a great quantite of
it: and the longer it is kept the better it waxes.
TAke first oil Roset, the oils of Violettes, the Oil of Neuuphar, oil of
Spick, oil of the herb called Costum commonly called Cocus or herba marie,
the oil of Bay, oil of Nutmegs, the oil of the blossoms of Iasemin, of
each of them a pound. The oil of Nutmegs, and of Sinamom, is made in
seething, Nutmegs, or Sinamon well stamped, in oil Olive. And in the like
manner, ye may make the oil or decoction of Xilobalsamum, of Carpobalsamum, of
lignum Aloe, of Myrrh, of Frankincense, of the gum of Ivy, of Masticke, and
of Cloves, and it shall suffice only, to put in the oil of these said spices,
half as much as each of the other mounts unto, that is to say, half a pound.
Likewise must ye make oil of Campher, but ye must not sees it, but only
warm the oil Olive, in a little pan and pour it so upon the Campher a good
way of from the fire: than must you soubdaynlie cover it: for the Campher is so
fine and delicate, that it would incontinent breath out and vanish away: and
therefore doth the Campher cleave unto the lid, and sides of the pan because
it cannot get out. You must put only half an uncle of Campher, for every two
or three pound of the whole quantite of the other oils together: than add to
it, a pound of the oil of Turpentine, made by distillation, and three vnces
of the oil of Storar liquida: after this, put all these oils so mingled
together, into a great cauldron or kettle tinned within, which must be high
and narrow, to the end that all the things, that ye will put in, may
afterward be well covered, with the said oils: And the said cauldron, ought
to have a cover that may close him well and justly: than set it upon a small
fire, and put in three of these black Vipers, iij. Toads.x. of these little
beasts, called in latin Tarantulae or Stelliones, which be like unto
Lisardes, having spots on their backs like Stars, and.l. Scorpions. And
if ye can get any other venomous beasts, put them in quick, if not at the
first time, at the least at every time when ye can have them: and after you
have well covered and closed the cauldron, give it but a light fire, the space
of.v. or.vi. days. It shall be good to set the said cauldron, in manner of a
Fornayse, as it were to make Salt peter, or as Soap cawdrons be set: than
after, by the space of a day, make the fire a little greater, until all the
venomous beasts be broken into pieces, and almost consumed in the said oil,
whereinto it should be good, to have put first, a pot of good white Wine. Than
having taken the cauldron from the fire and taken all the said beasts, press
them or wring them hard in some canuesse or linen cloth, weat^ with white
Wine. Than take the oil of Saincte Ihons wort, compound, as we have before
declared, half as much as all the oil of the said beasts, and the third
part of the oil of the red dog, mingle all well together, and put to it
the blossoms of Selandine, the blossoms of Saint Ihons wort, such a
quantite as you will, putting also to it, a handefull of white salt, the
juice of Taxus barbatus, and of white Dictamu, at your discretion: the juice of
Crispina rubra, if ye can get it. This Crispina rubra, is a herb like unto a
Thistle, and is taken of Ioannis Agricola, to be the brier called Respis: but
it hath leaves l^sser, and tenderer than a Thistle, and is eaten almost in
every place, in Italie, in Salads. And there it is called in some places,
Cardonello, and in Venise, Sigone. The red Crispin is in al points like unto
the white and green, and differs in nothing, but in colour: it is a very
precious herb. I saw once a man, that clefte a yonge Kids head, almost a
sunder: and after laid to it, only the juice of the said red Crispin: and
joined the head together, and bound it with a band: and in two days the
Kid was healed, as sound as he was before. Also it is very good, in the
time of a Plage or pestilence, as we will afterward declare. Than, if you can
get of the juice of the said Crispina, or Cardonello, ye shall put a pound of
it, with the said oils, and as much of the juice of Carduus benedictus, a
pound of the flouers or blossoms, of the said Carduus benedictus, an uncle of
Lignu Aloe in powder, and an uncle of Saffran. Set all these things well mixed
together, in the Sun, all the whole Summer time, in diverse vessels of glass,
or of earth leaded within, well covered with paper or linen clothe. And keep it
as a precious thing: whose virtues to express, it is impossible. The said
oil is excellent good, principally for all manner of contractions, and
shrinkinges of the members, of a mans body, and of wounds, as well old as
fresshe, against Fistules, Cankers, and the disease called in latin Struma,
which is a swelling in the throat, of gathered matter and blood, which we
call in English, the Kings evil, or the Quinses, when the place of the sore is
rubbed with it, or when Tow weate in the said oil is laid unto it, and
beginning in the first quarter of the wane, or decreasynge of the Moon, (with
the grace of God) the said accidents, shall be healed before the new Moon. Also
the said oil, is good against all manner of venom or poison, being anointed
about the hart, if the Poison be taken at the mouth: and if a man be bitten
with any venomous beast, or hurt with any intoxicated weapon, ye must wryng
well the blood out of the wound. and than rub the place, and round about it
with the said oil. It is also good for any meber that is stiff, and nomine,
and almost for all diseases that can chance unto mans body, whereunto any
outward application is made of it.

A very true and proved remedy, against a Quartayne ague.
(...) iij. or.iiij. grains of Frankincense, of the male kind otherwise
called Olibanum: than cover again the said hole, with the little piece that
you toke of first, roast it so upon the embers, so that it burn not, but that
it may wax tender. Than take it from the fire, and break it into.iiii.
parts, with all the Frankincense in it: and so give it the patient to eat, it
will by and by, make the Apostume to break, heal him clean. The foresaied
Smith, had al ready shut his teeth, so that men were fain to open them with
a spoon or knife: and so they put of it into his mouth, as well as they
could, and straight way he turned with his breast, upon the beds side, and
spit out a great part of the matter, that was come forth of the Apostume
broken: and thereupon slept more than.ix. hours, and when he waked, he called
for meat, found him self thorowlie whole, which was a thing worthy to give
God thanks for.

Another secret, or remedy, against the said disease of the Pleuresye.
TAke the flower, that sticks on the bourdes and walls of a Mill, and make
thereof paste with water: and so make little cakes, of the bigness of a groat,
or somewhat more, and having baked or fried them, in an iron lady, or in a
friyng pan, with the oil of Scorpions, lay one of them so upon the place,
where the patient feels his grief, and that as hot as he may endure,
rubbing, and annoyntyng it with the said oil of Scorpions: and when one of
the cakes is almost cold. Lay to another very hot, heate the first again in
the said oil, and so consequently take away one, and put to another.x
or.xv. times, and shortly after the Apostume shall break, and in spitting the
matter out, the patient (with Gods aid) shall be healed.

Another good secret against the same disease.
OPen a white lofe new baket, in the middle, and spread it well with good
Triacle, on both the halfes, on the crommie side, and heate it at the fire:
than lay one of the halfes, upon the place of the disease, and the other half
on the the other side of his body directly: and so bind them, that they stir
not, leaving them so a day and a night, or until the Apostume break: which
I have sometime seen done, in.ij. hours or less. And than take away the
bread, and immediately the patient will begin to spit, and void the
putrefaction of the Apostume, and after he hath slept a little, ye shall give him
some meat, and with the help of God, he shall be shortly healed.

Another remedy against the same disease.
TAke a tooth of a wild Bore: and if the payne hold him in the right side,
ye must take the tooth of the right jaw: if otherwise, ye must take the left
tooth: yet not withstanding. it hath been found by experience, to be all one
of which jaw so ever it were. Scrape the said tooth with a knife, upon a
clean table, or upon a paper: than take of the same scrapynges, as much as
you may lay upon two grotes, and give the patient drink of it, with a little
Barley water, or in the broth of little red grains like unto Ciche peason,
or with white Wine with a little water. This hath always been found very good
and true.

To make a water, good for the breast or stomach, of the which men use to give
them drink, that be tourmented or grieved with the stitch in the side, or
pleuritike Apostumes the which water is of a very good savour, and mondifieth
meruclous well the breast or stomach.
(...) the space of two Miserere: and then wasshe the leg well (that is to
say the wound and round about the wound) with the said wine luke warm.
Then take these pouders following, that is to say, Aristolochia, both of long
and round, Masticke, Myrre, Dragons blood, called in English Pellytorie of
Spain, Aloe epaticum, Nyll, called in Latyne Tutia, the bark or ryne of
gourdes burned, of each of these an uncle, Nummia, or as some call it, Humia,
and Boale armoniacke, of each of them a quarter of an uncle well stamped, and
strained, lay all upon the said grief: than take the herbs boiled in wine,
as is aforesaid, and bind them upon the wound with a band, in chaungyng it
twice a day, or at the least once, and you shall see the leg healed in few
days.

To heal swollen knees or legs, red, and full of humours: a secrete
marvelous good, easy to be made, and of little charge, and often times
proved.
TAke the skin of a dog, if you may get it: or if not, take a white lambs
skin, or else the skin of a kid, and cut a piece of it as broad as the
palm of your hand, or moore, and another piece of the length of your hand,
or somewhat moore: then melt in a pan on the fire these things following:
rosen of a Pine tree two pound, Galbanum.v. vnces, Masticke an uncle, Musk,
Amber, Tyuet, of each of them six grains, or as much as you will, break the
Masticke between two papers: then put the rosen and the Galbanum to melt in a
pan with a small fire, and when it is well melted, ye shall put the
masticke to it, and stir them well with a little stycke, to the intent that
nothing burn. After this lay it abroad whote as it is, upon the said skin
half a finger thick. Then take twelve or fiftene of these little beasts
called Monks peason or sows (whereof is found a great quantity under
stones in moyste places) and them in a mortar, with a little Barrowes grease^
make thereof an unction or ointment to lay upon the said plaster of the
skin, heatyng the said skin at the fire, and lay it under the knee, or
under the calfe of the leg, harde bound, and leave it so two or three days:
but if the leg be hearie, ye must shave the hear away with a rasour, for the
plaster would else cleave to it, when you take it of again, if you find that
it hath made little bladders, pierce them, and wipe them clean. This done, wash
them with the wine, wherein the decoction of the Agrimoyne, the Olive leaves,
the Roses, and plantaine was made: and so wipe and dry them again. Make
clean also the said plaster, remouynge and sturryng a little the ointment:
and after having heated it again by the fire, lay it again upon the leg.
Do thus every third or fourth day, and you shall see that the plaster shall
have drawn unto it self in a small time a great aquositie of the leg, and
shall have taken away the redness, inflammation, and swelling. And if there
be a wound, you shall heal it, as we have above said.

A very sure and perfect remedy against a Sciatica, often times proved and
experimented in diverse parts of the world.
First make this confection that follows. Take three pound of raw honny, and
put it in a pan with two glasses full of water, and make it sees or boyle
together, until you see the skume or froth mount up, the which you must
take away. Then take the roots of the herb called in Latin Acorus and in
English Galingale, or of the herb called yelowe Gladen, make them clean, cut
them in small pieces, and stamp them well. Take of these herbs one pound for
the said three pounds of honey, and put them by little and little into the
said pan, always sturryng them a little, letting them so boyle, by the space
of a good hour.

Then put to it also an uncle of fine Synamom well beaten into powder, take it so
from the fire, and keep it in the same pan, or in some other vessel. Give
unto the patient of this conserve at night when he goes to bed, about four or
five sponefulles, and in the morning early as much or more. Give him also
thereof before his meals and after: the oftner he eats of it the better he
shall be. If it be in winter, heate it for him a little: and while he thus uses
it, let him always sit upon his buttocks, that is to say: upon the bone or
huckle where the Sciatica is, with the plaster declared in the chapter before,
that is to say, of yt Rosen, Galbanu, Masticke, the little beasts called Monks
peason or sows, with the rest there mentioned. Then, at the end of ten days
take it of, and lay it other ten days upon his thigh. And from thence take
it again, making it clean, mixing and stirring it a new, and lay it under
the calfe of the leg ten days more: and at every time you shall see that
it will have engendered little puffs or bladers, and drawn to it self al the
aquositie and watrishnes, in such sort, that it will take away the grief
and heal it. This is a very rare secrete against such a disease, which
very few Physicians cold hitherto find certain remedy for. If in case the
disease be old or hath run lunge, give the patient sometime this glister
following. Take Mallowes, Mercurie, Fenell, green or dry, Wormewode, Rue,
wild Cucumbers broken, as much of the one as of the other: than, put to it
two handfuls of bran, sees all in common water, until the third part
be diminished: and so let it cool again. After this, take a dish and a
half full of this decoction, three sponefulles of skimmed Honey, oil of
Camemille, and oil of Rue, of each of them an uncle and a half: mingle all
well together, and make a Glister of it, which you shall minister unto the
Patient in the morning: and so make him lye upon that side where the Sciatica
is. Two days after ye shall give him another Glister, after three days
another: and than four days after yet another, continuing so a month
together. If the grief be so endured and hardened that it will not behealed by
the aforesaid remedies, you may give him Pills the third day after, the
fourth day, the fyfte day, and so unto six or seven times. But the Pylles
will profit the Patient nothing at all unless he abstain from eating salt
or sharpe meates, and from all sorts of pulse corn, as Peas, Beans, Tares,
and Fitches, and such other: likewise from drinking water, or white wine.
Many have been healed only with the said plaster, not leaving to do
their business abroad notwithstanding: other have also used the conserve. But
in so many years I have had but two upon whom (for to take away the disease
being old and far goen) I was constrained to use the said Pills and
Glisters, whereby they were healed. I had also one, which used but only the
plaster and the conserve, of whom the huckle bone was out of joint, and
hardened, and with the said remedy he was perfectly healed in the space of
three skore and ten days, and the said bone returned again into his
former place and state: but he told me that whilst he used the said plaster
and conserve, a Nonne counseyled him to take from day to day, four times,
the bigness of a Nut of Turpentine washed in Borrage water, and that he
should not tell me of ^t, whereby he found him self healed in short time.

A water for to heal in five days at the most, all manner of great skabbes,
as well inward as outward: and is a water clear and white, and is of an
odoriferous savour, such as a man may present to a Queen.
TAke Plantaine water two glassefulles, Rose water a glassefull, of the water
of the flowers of Cytrons or Orenges half a glass full, or less: put all
this together in a clean pan or violle of glass: and put to it an uncle of
Sublyme, that is to say: quick silver, such as commonly is found at the
Apoticaries: it must be well beaten to powder. Then let it boyle (...) his
body, as lunge as he may, and he shall find it very excellent.

Another remedy against the same disease.
TAke half a glass, or less, of the juice of Barberies, when they be very
red, and ripe, and put into it as much red Coral, well beaten in powder, as
will lie upon two grotes, and give the patient drink thereof.

Another perfect remedy against the same disease, and to make a man peace that
hath been.iiij. or.iiij. days without making water, and that in the space of
half an hour, and will break the stone within.x. or.xij. days.
TAke fine powder of Virga aurea, and put a sponefull of it, into a new laid
Egg, soft roast, and give the patient drink thereof, in the morning at his
breakfast, and let him not eat at the least in four hours after, and than
shall he make water in less tha half an hour. If ye use this continually,
the space of x. or.xii. days, as is a foresaid, you shall make him peace out
the stone without any pain or grief.

Another remedy against the Stone and payne of the raynes.
TAke the seeds of blew Violettes, or march Violettes, the seeds of common
Burs, with their little poddes and all, or ripe Burs a pound, put them to
dry in an Oven (for otherwise it will be a hard thing to stamp them) stamping
them afterward with their seeds. This done, take a quick Hare, strangle him
with a corde, to thentent there be none of the blood lost: put him so whole, or
in pieces into some vessel, feet, guts, head and all: than put him to burn
in an Oven, so that all, as well the bones, and the skin, as the flesh be
brought to powder, this done, ye shall stamp it well, and mingle the powder
with the two other pouders aforesaid: dry Oken leaves, well beaten to
powder.iiij. vnces, dry Saxifrage or Sampire, half a pound, Bay berries.v.
vnces. Let all these things be well beaten in powder, sifted, and mixte
together.

Give of this powder unto the patient, as much as will lie upon a groat,
making him to drink it, in the morning, to his breakfast, in white wine, and
let him do this often times. It is the most exquisite thing in the world, as
well for the gravel, as for the stone: but for the gravel, you must take
less, and not so oft as for the Stone.

The last, and the most excellent remedy of all, against the stone, be it in
the reigns, or in the bladder, of what qualite or quantite, so ever it be.
IN the month of May, when Oxen go to grass, or be at pasture, ye shall take
of their dung, not to fresh, nor to dry: than distille it fair and softly
(to the end it smell not of the smoke) into some vessel of glass, or earth
leaded within, of the which dung will come a water, without savour or evil
stench, which will be very good, to take of all manner of spots, or
blemishes in the face, if you wash it, with it, morning and evening. You
shall keep the said water, in a Violle well stopped: than take.iij. or.iiij.
Radishes, such as men eat in salettes, cut them small, put them in a Violle,
and fill up the violle with wine greek, or good Malmsey, or other good white
wine, letting it stand so in the Sun, and in the air, a day and a night.
Than take one part of that wine, two parts of the said water, of the Ox
dung, half a part of the water of Stawberies. iij. or.iiij. drops of the
juice of Limons, or Citrons: and let there be of all these waters, so
proportioned together, half a glass full, or some what more, into the which,
you shall put a piece of Sugar, or a little Honey roset: for the one and the
other, serve as well to the savour, as to the profit of the substance. After
this, you shall put to it some of the powder mentioned in the Chapiter before,
as much, as will lie upon a groat, and than give the patient drink of it, and
shortly after you shall se a wonderful effect^ for many, unto whom I have
given of it, have not tarried half an hour, but they have pissed, in the
which peace, they have found so many little stones, that all together, came
to the bigness of a Walnutte, and of others, unto the quantite of a hasel
Nut: in using often the said remedy, they have finally been perfectly
healed. I caused once a gentleman of Millan, to take of it by the space of.xii.
days, whom the Physicians esteemed as dead, would have cut him, but in the
space of the said.xij. days, I made come out of him so many stones, that all
together came to the quantite of an Egg, I made him make his water thorough a
linen cloth, laid over an Urinal, to the intent, to take up the stones
together: and the third morning, he would take the glass, a little more than
half full, and shortly after, being about to make water, he began to cry
out, for the great pain he felt in his yard: after this payne was paste,
looking in the linen cloth, he found a stone as lunge and as big, as a
Been, somewhat pointed at one of the sides, which peradventure, in passing
thorough his yard, caused him to have all that payne. Now, although that many,
as well of old time, as now of late days, have written diverse and sundry
remedies, against the said disease, yet was there never found a surer, truer,
or presenter remedy, than this. The said water and the powder, may be kept
lunge, but you must at every time renew the wine of the said Radish, and the
juice of the Limon or Citron, for in the space of two days (the wine chiefly)
gives such a sent, that a man may scant endure it.

For him that spittet^ blood, by having some vein of his breast broken.
TAke Myse dung, beaten in powder, as much, as will lie upon a groat, and put

the powder with wine. If you cannot get the seeds of Crosses, give him of the
powder of Mene, of the which there is always enough found at y^ Apoticaries:
if he be bruised or hurt outwardly, annoynt the sore place with oil Roset, and
than lay upon it, the leaves of Myrnis, and of dried Roses, and so shall you
heal him parfitlie.

A very good and easy remedy, against the disease, called the Kings evil.

Pepper. Al these things being well beaten into powder, boyle them, in the said

and keep it in a viol well stopped in some moist place, than give the patient of
this wine to drink, three times a day, at every time a glasseful, that is to
say, morning, noone, and night.

And while he uses this, he must eat no other bread but Barley bread, and
drink his wine without water. He must also abstain from eating any manner

ought a man to begin, at the full moon, continuing until the end of the

they will be healed incontinent: if not, they will resolve and leuse, and
shortly heal thoroughly.

To heal the same disease by a substance taken at the mouth.
Dress a Hen as it were to eat, so that she be boiled in a great pot or
caudron, with a great deal of water without Salt, letting it boyle until all
the bones be separated from the flesh: then take the said bones and dry

much of the one as of the other. And so take a sponefull of the two pouders,
and mingle it with Honey, causing the Patient to eat of it at night when he
goes to bed, and in the morning when he rises. This ought to be done from
the beginning of the quarter decreasinge of the Moon unto the end: It is a
very excellent secrete. It also happened to me of some men, in whom the said
disease was so old and so far gone that this said remedy could not help
them, whom I caused to take with the said powder specified as follows,
which ought to be made after this manner. Take a certain little Serpent called
a Slow worm^: boyle him in oyl^ Olyue, until he be broken and consumed, then
rub the evil with the said oil, and lay pieces of tow upon it, leaving it
so three or four days: and after that, make a new anointing, and lay tow to
it again as before. By this said remedy I healed them perfitlye, thanks be
unto God.

you shall set it upon the fornesse with his Limbecke and recipient, distilling
it with a small fire, whereof will come a clear and precious water, continue so
the fire, until the water begin to change his colour, and come forth white:
then change the recipient, and receive the said white water a part, for it is
not good, but for to blanch and make white the face, and there is neither
spot nor lyntell, or any kind of red burgeons in the face of a man, the
which, being washed with this water by the space of fiftene days will not go
out, and wear away, leaving the face and the skin white, shining and well
sauouringe. This is a very rare kind of washinge, and meet for great ladies
and princesses. You shall mi^e the first water which is clear, with Aqua vite
of like quantity, the which is called Mel balsami. Now having put and
left all these things in a violle well stopped, the space of two days, set it
to distill with a small fire, then receive and put the first water by it self,
which will distill very clear, and odoriferous. When you see that the water
begins to come forth like rain water, change your recipient, and receive
that same likewise by it self, until you see the third water come out,
which will be of sanguyne colour, the which you shall power into a violle,
and stop it well with wax: keep it diligently as a precious thing: for it
hath many notable and excellent virtues, of the which the best be these that
follow. The first is, that if you lay a little of it upon a fresh wound,
there need no other medicine to cure it. The second is, it is good for al old
wounds, against the Canker, the worms, and against Nolime tangere, and all
other diseases growing, ye must weate the soore places with it every second

days, he or they shall be healed. The third is, that if any manne have a
Carbuncle, or Saynct Antonies disease, called commonly in Italye and in
France, S. Antonies fire, or other pestilenciall syckenesse, and wash the
place with the said water, will it kill it within an hour. The fourth is, it
is good against the pain of the eyes, so that the eye be not out, or lost: if
you put a little drop of it into the eye in the morning, and as much at
night, it will heal the pain in fiftene days. And although it be somewhat
pricking, yet the grief of it passes soon away, so that it can not in any
wise hurt the eyes. The fifte is, that if any man have the stone in the rains
of his back, and in the bladder, drink three drops or a dragme of it with a
little white wine, he shall be delivered thereof in few days. The sixte is, that
it heals the Emeraudes or Piles, if they be washed with it every day once.
The seventh is, that it heals all manner of disease or pain of the Matrice the

skurfe, and other like things, washing them with it often times. The eleventh
is, that if a man put a drop of it into his ear at night or in the morning,
it takes away all the grief and worms that engender in the ear. The
twelfth is, that it heals all venomous biting, when ye wash the venomous
place with it, and is far better for such an accident then the triacle is.
The thirtenth is, that it kills all worms in man body, if a man rub
his nosestrelles, or drink a very little of it. And finally, it is also very
good for venomous hurts or wounds, and for all wounds incurable. It heals
the kings evil, and the disease called the falling sickness, and all other
infirmities in the exterior parts of the body, and with this water may a
man wash him self, or else drink it. It is also good for every cold
sickness, and restorative for old folks, or those that are consumed and
debilitate with hunger, sickness, or sorrow of mind. It conserveth the
radical moisture, and natural heate, it mainteyneth health, and keeps a man
in lunge life, who so ever uses it as it ought to be used.

Pills of a Marvelous operation and virtue, against the Sciatica, which we
promised to speak of in the chapiter of the Sciatica.
TAke ^illes Alephangines, of Hermodactil maioris and minoris, of each of them
a scruple which is the third part of a dragme.ij. grains of salt Gemma,
dissolve and stir them with the juice of roses, and make of all this
substance five pylles, and at the begynninge, when the Sciatica is fervent and
great, you shall take of the said five pylles every four days: and when it
begins to decline and assuage, you shall take them only the fyfte day,
than, the syxt, the seventh, and the eight day, until all be done: and take
them always in the morning at the break of the day, absteynynge at the least
six or seven hours from meat. Now, although that the said pylles be not for
a man to keep his chambre, and that they provoke not to the stool, yet ye
must not drink any white wine, nor water, nor eat any salt things, nor
any kind of pulse corn, as beans and peason, with such other like nor
oynyons, garlyke, or such like, if the disease be inveterate, old, or far
gone.

A notable secrete to heal a mad man, be it that the madness came unto him by
a whyrlynge, or giddynesse of the head or brain, or otherwise.
First of all make him four Clysters, in four mornings, one after another.
Let the first glitter be simple: that is to say, made with water wherein ye
have boiled or sodden wheat bran, commun oil, and salt. Let the second be of
water sodden with malowes, mercurye, pellitory of the wall, and violet leaves,
with oil and salt. Let the third be of water boiled with oil, salt, sodden
wine, and honny. And let the fourth glitter be of the like decoction that the
third was, adding to it end^ue, buglasse, and the tops of the branches of
Walwort. And after that this decoction is strained, ye shall put to it an uncle
of Cassia fistula, and half a quarter of an uncle of Metridate. Now, having
given him these four clysters four sondry mornings, you shall give him this
medicine. Polipodium of an Oak well stamped, a handefull or twain, and wrynge
out the juice of it, and put it in a glass the quantite of two fingers high,
putting to it two vnces of honey roset, and a quarter of an uncle of Electuary
roset, and as much of dyafenycon. All these things being well incorporated
together, give them unto the patient to drink at night when he goes to
bed.ij. or.iij. hours after the son set, and give it him luke warm: if
in case he will not take it, bind him, and hold him parforce, make him open
his mouth, put some stycke between his teeth, and than power the medecin into
his throat, as men do unto horses. And when he hath taken all, if it be in
Winter, you shall make him sit so upon his bed half an howre, well covered
round about, to the intent he take no cold after it: if it be in Summer, ye may
let him go about the house where he will, but se that he go not out. When the
medecin hath done his operation, take this oynctment following: that is to
say, a pound and a half of the juice of the roots of Walwort, whereunto you
shall add as much butter: boyle this together a good while, until all the
juice be almost consumed, than put to it oil of Camomill, oil roset, oil of
saint Iohns wort, of each of them an uncle. Incorporate well all these things
on the fire, and make thereof an oynctment, wherwyth you shall annoynt the
patient frome the neck unto the fete, arms and legs and all: but the
oynctment must be hot, and he must be so well annoycted and rubbed that the
oinctment may penetrate and pierce thorough. Continue, doing this the space of a
month, annoyntynge him every evening and morning, or at the least once a
day. The third or fourth day after you have begone to annoynte him, burn him
with a hot iron upon the seam or ioynynge together of the head, and at the
first lay upon the mark a linen cloth with barrowes grease, leaving it so
the space of viij. or.x. days: and after wrap a great Cyche peas in yuy
leaves, and put upon the said yuy leaves a piece of the sole of a shoe made
fine and thynne, byndynge it under his throat with some band, or beneth his
head, so that it may bide on, and change it always at night and in the
morning. If in case he pass four months and receive not health, or return
to his wit, ye must begin again to give him the same clysters he had
before, and the same medecynes, annoyntyng him as before: and without doubt
(by the grace of God) he shall be hole. He must eat at the begynninge chyckens,
mutton, and roast veale: after, you may give him roast and sod with pottage
of Amylum, beetes, and mallowes, and also new laid eggs, putting spices in
his meat, causynge him sometime to eat, (either in his pottage or otherwise)
betayne, sage, maioram, mint, not suffering him in any wise to take salt,
sharp, nor aygre things, pulse corn, Garlic, Onyons, nor such like, ye may
give him white wine with water: let him also cary ever about him some good
odours, and hear melody or music: speak oftentimes soberly and wyselye
unto him, admonishinge him to be wise and sage, rebuke him of his folly when he
doth or speaks any fond things. And in such case the auctoritie of some
fair woman avails much to tell him all these things, for good admonitions
are of great virtue, and strength, for to stablyshe and settle a brain
troubled or dysquieted with any sycknesse or passion.

Pylles of master Mychael a Scot, the which heal the grief or payne of the
head, be it inveterate or recent, purge the brain, claryfye the syghte, cause
a man to have a good memory, good colour in face, and be also very good for

scruple, Myrrh half a scruple: stamp all well together, and make thereof
Pylles with the juice of Colewortes, and take three or four of them when you
goo to bed, every third or fourth day once.

Against the payne of women's breasts, a very excellent remedy.

in Rose water, set all this on the fire to melt in a clean pan, and when it
is cold again, spread it upon a lynnen cloth, and lay it to the sore breasts,
but you must have first washed the said sore places with white wine, wherein
hath ben sodden leaves of Roses, Plantayne leaves, and the leaves of an Olyue
tree, both green and dry, and after having wyped and dried it again, lay
the plaster to it, dressed and prepared as I have said, and incontinent the
sore shall he healed.

which have need of quick and sudden ripinge.
TAke crommes of bread, Raysins dried in an Oven, or otherwise, and than well

plaster, leaving it so until night, and change it morning and evening, so
shall you make it soon ripe and break, then dress it with oil roset, and

your discretion, and as much of the one as of the other: and add to it more,
a handful of Succorie, with his roots, let all this sees in the said
caudron or kettle, the space of an hour, or a hour and a half, and then
let it cool again so that you may well endure your hand in it. Than take
out all the said substances, and put them in a clean canuesse, and wring
out all the substance into the said water in the kettle: put in it also two
or three pound of the said roots of Maluauiscus stamped, as before, then set
it to boyle and sees again three hours or more: take it from the fire, and
do as you did at the first time: but if it had so much sodden that all the
roots were broken and consumed, it should not need to have strained or
wrong them thorough a canuesse. This done, take the decoction of it, and set
in a pot upon the fire, with as much Honey, or little less, leaving it to
boil so fair and softly, taking away the skomme that shall come of the
Honey. After it hath thus boiled a good space, add to it an uncle, or as much
as you will of Sinamon, and a quarter of an uncle or more of Bengewine stamped,
a little Musk: then take it immediately from the fire, and cover it, to the
intent it take no vent: specially, if you have put in the musk, which would
else vanish away with the smoke, wherefore you may put in the Musk when
the water is luke warm after it is taken of: So shall you have an excellent
conserve to use and occupy all the winter, as well at night, as in the
morning, and at all times when you list, but you must at every time you take
warm it again, and take thereof.ij. or.iij. sponefulles at a time. And if you
will have it thicker, put to it powder of sugar, or Penides: if you will have it
clearer, ye must put to it a little more of the first decoction, which we have
spoken of. This secret is of such excellency, that if a man use of it in the
winter, as before is said, it is not possible for him to be vexed or turmented
with the cogh, rumes, murres, catarres, or any other like disease.

A goodly and pleasant secrete to beale the cogh, in rubbing the soles of

well with the said confection, and then warm them again as hot as you may
endure, rubbing them well a pretty space: and being a bed let your feet
be bound with some warm linen clothe, and rub also the small of your
legs with the said ointment, by this mean you shall be healed in three
nights were the cogh never so vehement. If you will at your meals use of the
said decoction in your wine, or otherwise, you shall find your self well at
ease in your stomach, and head, and shall the better drive away your cogh, and
all other evil dispositions of the body.

A very goodly and easy remedy to heal in a day or twain, all manner of
inveterate and old wounds, wherein is grown dead and superfluous flesh, and
wounds that can not be cured by any other medycynes.
TAke three vnces of Turpentine (first washed in commune water, and then in
Rose or Plantaine water) and the yolke of an egg, an uncle a glass full of the

vessel, then put to it four vnces of Ceruse or white lead well stamped,
litarge of silver very fine and thin, three vnces, common Wax, four vnces,
and leave it so long upon the fire, until you may spread it with your
finger upon a marble stone. This done, take it from the fire, and power a little
vinagre upon it, but you must hold it far of, to the intent it leap not in
your face: than make of this ointment a plaster, as great as all the soore,
and make a hole in the midst of it as big as a penny: after this, make a
little plaster of some ointment that mortifies, of the bigness of y^ said hole:
than make another plaster of the same bigness, the which you shall lay upon the
soore, so that the plaster with the mortifiyng ointment be between both, and
leave it upon the soore the space of.xxiiij. hours, than change only the
middle plaster, that is to say: he that mortifies, and put another in his
place, the which you shall also let lie four and twenty hours: and before that
the plaster be laid round about and stretched, annoynt the place very
thick with fresh Hogs suet, or Hens grease, to mollify it, and so you
shall make it harde in the middle, and round about you shall make a circle of
tender flesh, in such sort that the soore will break out and come forth.
And the eight and forty hours once passed, after you have taken of the
plaster, lay upon it another plaster made with fresh Hogs grease, and
immediately will fall of from it a dead flesh in manner of a round pummel, and
there will remain a hole, the which you must heal with some oyntmente or
else with Diaculum magnum: when the flesh begins to grow, lay to it

Dandelion. The roots of Turmentylle, white Dictanium, of each of these an

Triacle. You must ministre this medicine before the sickness has continued
with the person twelve hours, for it is than surer. If in case after the
twelve hours it work not so well as you would have it, yet must you have a
good hope. And if the patient be yet in the age of infancy, you shall give him
half a dragme of it, with an uncle and a half of one of the said waters, and
with a like quantity of Triacle. The said drink is not soluble or laxative,
nor causes no grief to him, but only kills the poison. If any man had
drunken or eaten any poison, this is a very good medecin for him: it is also
good against a hot fever or ague. Note also that (if it be possible) the
patient must be let blood before he take the said medecin: if not, let it
be done afterward, that is to say, on the same side that he fealeth the grief.

soore, or the place of the plage, and hold her so a good while. Then you shall
see that the said Hen will have drawn all (or at the least some) the poison
and infection, and that shortly after she will die. It shall be good to do
this with two or three or more Hens, immediately one after another, the
which will draw all the venom out of the soore. This done, annoynt the place
with good Triacle, and let not in the mean time to use other remedies by the
mouth, whereof we have spoken here before, that is to say, the Yuy or Bay
berries, or some other remedy, that you find must ready. If the soore be so
harde that it will not break, you may use the foresaied remedies to make it
break, to the intent that all the venom may comme out, and void from the
heart.

An advertisement and warning of great importauuce, to preserve a man
self in time of pestylence.
BEcause the evil humours that be in man body, do easily receive the
corruption infection of the air, it is good to keep the stomach, and the head
clean purged, not to ouerlade it with eating and drinking, but to abstain

or of other such like things, and above all, to use often of the leese of
wine, called Tartre, which you must beat well in poulder, and steep it with
hot water, than strain it or dreane it fair and softly out: Afterward dry
it thoroughly, as men do white salt, than keep the same poulder, and put three
vnces of it with a pound of sugre roset, and in the morning take a good
sponefull thereof until there be an uncle or more, and do this from day to
day, for it will keep your body clean, and purged: and he that can not do it
with Sugre roset, let him take the leese stamped, and steep or wasshe it in
the broth of flesh or of colewortes, sturringe it until al be leused and
undone that may be leused, then let it stand a while, and after power softly
the broth into a dish, cast away the substances that go to the bottom, and
drink the broth: do this every day at the hours of your meals, or at the
least every second day, or when you shall think good. It shall be good also
to eat in your pottage, things that purge the blood, as Buglasse, Borrage,
Succorie, Let tyse, and such like: and above all not to keep your stomach over
charged, nor to empty: and in the morning betime, to take some of the
foresaied preseruatiues, as the poulder that was experimented in England (as we
have recited) or such other like. Than.ii.or. iii. hours before dinner to take
some of the said other preseruatiues, as the Rue with a fig, and with the
Walnutte, which is a thing very good, or some of the said confections, or a
piece of the pill of a Cytron conficte, or a sponefull of the juice of Citrons
dressed as we will declare hereafter, and to use of it at meals in manner of a
saulce, and after meals to use of the seed of Citrons confict in Sugre, as
they make the Coriander, and Almondes, which is a thing very good against
all manner of venom and poysen. And likewise at your meals to eat the white
and the inn side of a Cytron with a little sugre if you will, and to eat it
with flesh, or bread (as men eat lemons) in the morning, at none, and at
night when you go to bed. It should be also very good to bath and wash your
hands, your temples, your pulses, and pour nose with Vinaygre roset, or
with other, whereunto you must put a little Campher, rose water, Lignum Aloes,
Xilobalsamum, if you can get it, if not, a little Sinamom in steed of it. It
is good always to keep such manner of Vinaigre beside you in some viol, for
to use of it when time shall require: for it is a very good preservative: and
if you can not have the Vinaygre compound, as is said, use Vynaygre of common
wine. Also it shall be good to cary about you some parfume, or good odour,
either in your gloves, shurte, handkercher, cap, beard, or to hang it
about your neck, or otherwise. Your house ought to be kept as clean and as
nete as is possible, not sauoringe of pysse nor other ordure, ye ought to keep
it shut, washinge often the gutters and priuies. Ye must also keep as few
foul and stinking clothes in your house as is possible. Rich men ought
oftentimes to parfume their houses with some notable parfume, whereof we will
put in the book following a good nombre. Poor men may make provision of
leaves, and of the wood of a Bay tree, of Rose mary, Ienepar, Cypres, and to
use it as often as they may, burning it in the midst of their chamber, or
house, and principally at night and in the morning. Likewise of Orange and
lemon pills, or other sweet smelling things. Storax calamita, and Labdanum,
be good chepe and are very good for this purpose. As concerning the
disposition of courage and mind, ye must consider that sorrow, sadness, or
melancholy, corrupt the blood and other humours, weaken the heart, and
deprave hurt nature, therefore ought a man to avoid them as much as is
possible. Also if a man be to merry oriocunde, it dilateth, and enlarges the
pores and passages of the seed of man, and the heart, so that he is the more
inclined to receive the evil air, and venom, which are things* that
penetrate and pearce sore. Also a man must beware of drinking to much wine,
for it makes merry and chereth a man out of measure. Now because that in time
of a pestilence every man is afraid, so that he thinks that a man can not
ketch the disease, in being to merry (onles it be so that he be drunk, as is
said) but contrary in being to sad or sorrowful: for sorrow sadness come of
them selves, not sought after: Therefore it is good to use temperance, and
moderatio, walking and recreating him self honestly, not using to much
carnal company or copulation. And above all, a man must have always a sure
hope and confidence in God, ever to he ready and disposed to dye, when it
shall please him to call us, not estemynge so much this mundaine life, or
fearing so much death, which is none other thing than an issue or
departing out of this life full of calamities, and an entering into an eternal
life replenished with all joy, solace, and pleasure.

To dress and order the Juice of Cytrons, for to use of it as is before said.
TAke the Juice of Citrons as much as you will, and put it in a pan leaded
within in, than add to it two vnces of skimmed Honey for every pound of
the said Juice, a little Sugre after your discretion, a little Synamom in

take of it before your meal, and at your meals, in steed of sauce, which
is a very good remedy, as well for to preserve a man against the infection of
the air, as to drive it away after he isfected with it. It is also a very
good medicine for to take as soon as a man doubts to have received some
poison into his body.

times. Than make balls of it, or little round loves, the which you must
keep in boxes of wood with cotton, wolle or bombase.

be this. Take the Macaleb, which are little soot and odoriferous grains so
called, the which you shall stamp in a mortar, with Rose water, or some other
sweet water, until they be like a sauce, and having put them in a poke of
linen clothe, you shall press the milk out of them in a pressoure, or
between two little bourdes. Then bray again, with the said water, that which
shall remain in the poke, and press it a new, until there issue no moore
milk. But here I must advertise you, that this milk continues not above two
or three days: therefore you must immediately put it in effect and occupy it.

left it so covered in a dish or platter, you shall lay it a broad again in
a very hot Sun, when it is dry enough to beat, beat it in poulder, and
sift it finelye almost all: You shall sprinkele or water this poulder, with
Musk rose water, and lay it abroad upon a great sarce, turned downward,
good and thick, and some what course, under the which sarce, you shall make a
perfume as follows, couexinge it with a clothe, which be thus: Bengewine two
grains and a quarter, Labdani half a grain and more, Storax calamita two
carrettes, lignum Aloes half a grain and more, fine Musk half a grain. Beat
all these things grosselye, and after mix them together, then put by little
and little the poulder under the sarce in some pot shard, with a little fire
in it, and caste it in as you would do Frankencese, staiyng at every time,
until the first part, first cast in, be consumed. Now, all the said
perfume being done, if you will make the said poulder very fine and
exquisite, unto every uncle add these things folowinge, Bengewine a carret,
Musk four grains, Civet two grains, beat these by them selves very
small and fine, and mingle them with the said uncle of poulder, so that all
may be well incorporated together: than keep it well, for it is notable and
singular.

Another way to make it very perfect.
TAke the recente and fresshe dung of an Ox, and dry it in the Sun, or in
an oven, then beat it, and sift it, sprinkle it well after with Rose water,
and leaving it so in a vessel, the space of a day, dry it again in the
Sun. And when it is dry, bathe it again with Rose water, and dry it
again, and do so three or four times. The last time you shall water it or
bathe it somewhat more then the other times, because it may cleave to the
bottom of the vessel, which must be well leaded within, and very clean,
after this you shall remove and stir it well, and perfume it with some
perfume, that the other foresayed poulder was perfumed with. Then having
perfumed it diverse times, you shall let it dry in the said vessel, taking
heed also that it take no vent. And after it is well dried stamp it, and sift
it a new again, and then keep it in some violle: and if you will make it
very fine, take an uncle of the said poulder, three grains of fine Musk,
four grains and a half of Bengewine, two grains of Cyuet, bray and
incorporate all well together, and keep it.

A sweet and odoriferous poulder, very excellent to lay in chests and
confers.
TAke the buds of Roses as many as you will, and dry them in the shadow:
than set them abroad when the son is most hotest in a clean vessel,
putting to them such a quantity of Rose water as will bear them up, and
sturrynge them well, leave them in the Sun (covered with a linen cloth)

take for every pound of Roses, ten grains of Musk, and a quarter of fine
violettes beaten small into poulder, in putting to them by little and little of
the said poulder, and mixinge well all together, until they begin to be
incorporated: but before you put in the said poulder, dreane and power out the
water of the said vessel, that there remain not a drop in the bottom. This
done, lay the said roses abroad in a basin of copper, or of brass, which is
better, and let the said basin be plain and even, not inbossed, and set them
in the Sun when it shines most hotest, covering them over, so that
nevertheless they may dry, than make a poulder of them, and keep it. And if

rose water be vanished away, which may be proved in this manner. Put a little
stick down to the bottom of the vessel, and pluck it out again quickelye,
and put it in the fire: and if it burn without any noise, it is a token that
there is no moore water: but tart until it be all well consumed, sturringe

and put it into a round vessel leaded, styrringe it well with a pestle,
adding to it by little and little good and fine Muskte rose water, and so stir

vessel well leaded, until the rose water be consumed: than add to it Musk,
Cloves, Nutmegs and such like substances of a reasonable quantity,

Another Pomaunder.

an hour: than having well scommed away all the ordure and filth, put in three
vnces of white Wax, and make it sees a little, and after strain it into a
new vessel well leaded, leaving it so all a night. This done, you shall take
out al the white Pomaunder, and because there will remain a little ordure in the
bottom, you shall put it in mortar with rose water, stir it: the more you do
sever it a sonder in styrringe it, and put rose water to it, the more shall you
fine it: but you must se that the mortar be clean. Than take the tallow or
grease of a young barrowe, and steep it in cold water, leaving it so the

said grease well of all the little skins that is in it, veins, and
gristels.

Take likewise twenty of the foresaied Apples, and for each Apple put in three

rose water, until the said water be consumed, and after you have boiled it
fair and softly, put in the said Apples stamped, and make them boil, adding
to it a little fine Synamom, Spiknard, Nutmegs, and other spices, such as you
think good. And when it hath boiled enough, strain it thorough a linen cloth,
into some clean vessel. It should be well done to put to it a little calves
tallow well purified in the manner aforesaid. And when it is sodden and
strained, mix all together and put it in a clean vessel, it is a very
exquisite thing.

the said wine with the spices, than having taken it out, you must pour it
on again, so often until it become as clear as it was before, styrringe it
sometime in the strayner or bag: and here note that this is to make but a
flagon full. Wherefore, if you will have more, you must take a greater
quantity of the said things. And for to make it very excellent, you may
bind a little Musk in a fine linen clothe at the end of the strayner, so
that all the substance may pass over and upon it, the which by that mean
will receive the odour and sent of the said Musk.

To make little cusshins of parfumed Roses.

poulder, to thend that al may be well incorporated, so shall you leave them so

Taffeta, of what bigness you will, and according to the quantity of the buds
that you would put among all the poulder. Than close up the bags, and for to
stop up the seames, you must have your mixtion of Musk, Amber, and Ciuette,

press out the oil, which you shall keep in a clean vessel well stopped, In
this manner may you make oil of Musk, of Amber, of Bengewin, of Storax
calimita, of Aloe, of Synamom, of Mace, and of Nutmegs. You may make them
also in diverse sorts, and put to them Aqua vite.

To make an excellent parfume to parfume Chambers, garments, Coue^lettes,
Sheets, and al other things, belonging to any Prince.
TAke pills of Citrons dried in the shadow, and if you can not get of
Cytrons, take of Lemons, or Oreges, or if you can get none of these, take the
leaves of Roses either green or dried, according to the season of the year:
and whatsoever is of al these things abouesaid, you must occupy it whole or by
small pieces, and not in poulder. And when you will make the parfume, take of
the said pieces as much or as many as you will, and annoyncte them well with
Ciuette on every side: after lay them upon some coals in the midst of the
Chamber, or some corner, as you lift, this will give a very pleasant and
precious odor thoroughoute all the Chamber. If you will yet make it better,
you may put with the Ciuette, Musk, and Ambergrise, as much as you will: and
if you desire to make it with less cost, and yet nevertheless very good,
take Rose water of the flowers of Orenges, or such other odoriferous and sweet
water, with Oil of Iasemin, or of Cloves, or such like at your pleasure, with
the which you shall temper and steep Storax calamita, and a little Lignum
Aloes, if you have any, if not, you shall do well enough without it: add to
it as much Ciuette as you will, and make a licoure thereof as thick as sau^ce,
wherewith you shall annoynte the Citron or Orange pills: than lay them so
upon the coals, and it will be an excellent thing, and continue twice as
lunge as it would do, if you burned the odours without the pills, and besides
that it makes the parfume to dure longer, they make also the composition far
better and perfecter. If with the said parfume you would parfume lynnen
clothes, Sheets, or other like things, make it in this manner. Put the lynen,
and things that you will have parfumed, in a cofer, that hath no chinckes,
cliftes, chappes, crestes, holes, or is broken, whereby the smoke may have issue
out. You must range and lay your linen and other things on each side of the
cofer, leaving a place in the middle to set a little pan, or other vessel
with fire in it, and the said pills to parfume them, you may also lay
clothes upon the ly^de of the cofer. This done, you must set in the middle the
little vessel with coals, and a^so the pills: and having shut the cofer,
you must let all the parfume burn out, not opening the cofer of lunge time
after. And having thus tar^ed, open the cofer, and turn your linen and
other things, to the end to parfume them on the other side that is not
parfumed, and put in new parfume, doing as before, you shall find this of a
great excellency, so that the cofer it self shall be so well parfumed with
it, that all that you put afterward in it, shall savour of it. And if you
will, you may also parfume in the said cofer other little coffers for
handkerchers, and other things, as little cusshy^s, and bags of Roses,
which are parfumed also with out side, being kept in the confers, for they
give always an odor and savour to things that you put in them.

Round apples or balls to take ou^ spots of oil (...) grease.
TAke purgine Soap, or soft Soap, and incorporate it with the ashes of vines
finely sifted, as much of the one as of the other, than put among the said*
poulder Roche Alome burned, and the dry leese of ^yne well beaten into
poulder, incorporate well all together, and make thereof little round Apples or
balls: which you may use to take out spots of any garment.

To make a paste for sweet ^eades or Beadestones.
TAke a pound and a half of black earth well beaten into poulder, four
vnces of Gomme dragant, and lay it a steep, or temper it in a mortar, with as
much Rose water as will cover the earth with the said Gomme dragant, and
stamp it well by the space of half an hour, with these sweet things
folowinge. That is to say: Storax calamita, an uncle, poulder of Cloves half
an uncle, Labdanum, half an uncle, Synamom half an uncle, Sandalum Citrinum,
half an uncle: beat all into poulder very finelye, and mix all together with
the foresaied paste, than take it out of the mortar, and bray it well between
your hands, by the space of half an hour. And than you may make thereof
Beads or Beadestones.

THE Secretes of the reverend Master Alexis of Piemount.
THE THIRD BOOK.
A goodly secrete for to condite or confyte Orenges, Citrons, and all other
fruits in syrop, which is a notable thing.
TAke Cytrons, or other fruits, and cut them in pieces as you will, taking out
of them the juice or substance that is within them: than boyle them in fresh
water about half an hour, until they be tender, and as soft as you wuld have
them. And when you have taken the out, cast them in cold water, leaving them so
until night. After this you shall set them again to the fire in other fresh
water, and do but only heat it in that water with a small fire, for it must
not sees, nor be to hot: but let it only simper a little, you shall continue
thus.viij. days together, heatinge them every day in hot water, and putting
them again at night in cold water. Some heat the water but once a day, to
thend not to make the citrons to tender, but change the fresh water at night
to take out al the bitterness of the pills, the which being taken away, you
must take sugre, or clarified honey and prepared (as we will declare afterward)
wherein you must put the citrons, having first well dried them from the water.
In winter you must keep them from y^ frost, leaving them two or three hours in
a place mete for the purpose: and in Somer you shall leave them there all a
night, and a day, and a night in honey. Than boyle the honey or sugre again by
it self, without the Orenges or Citrons, by the space of half an hour or
somewhat less, with a small fire, and being cooled, set it again to the fire
with ye Citrons, continuing so.ij. mornings to the end to bring the honny to
his perfection, according as need shall require. If you will put honey in
the water, and not Sugre, you may clarify it twice, and strain it thorough a
stramer, according to the art and manner, that hereafter I will tech you, to
the end you may have perfitelye the use and facion of making all such
things. Now, having thus warmed and clarified it, you shall strain it, and
set it again on the fire, with the Citrons only, making it to boyle with a
small fire, the space of a quarter of an hour: than take it from the fire, and
let it stand and rest, at every time you do it, a day and a night. The next
morning you shall boyle it again together, the space of half an hour, and do
so two mornings, to the end that the Honey or Sugre may well and perfitlye
be incorporated with the Cytrons. All the art and conninge consists in
boiling this cyroppe together with the Cytrons, and also the cyrope by it
self. Wherefore he that hath no skill in the boiling of it, will quickelye
let it take the smoke, so that it shall savour of the fire: but he that can
trim it well, it is an exquisite and pleasant thing. In this manner may al
other fruits be dressed: as ripe Peaches with the in side and skin, Lemons,
Orenges, Appeles, green Walnuts, Lettuse, well made clean, and voided of
their great leanes, and other things like, all the which you must boyle, as
is aforesayed: but some more some less, after as need shall be, and according
to the nature of the fruit. So shall you make always a good perfect, and
durable thing.

The manner howe to purify and prepare honey and sugre for to confite Cytrons
and all other fruits.
TAke every time ten pound of Honey, the white of twelve new laid eggs,
and take away the froth of them, beating them well together with a stick, and
six glasses of fair and fresh water: then put them into the Honey, and
boyle them in a pot with a moderate fire, the space of a quarter of an hour,
or somewhat less, than take them fair and sofetlye frome the fire, scumming
them well, and pass them so hot thorough a strainer: for it shall be the
fairer, and the clearer, for any thing that you will occupy or use it about.
Having thus ordered it, take for six pound of Cytrons, twelve pound of
Honey. The Sugre is also ordered and dressed in like sort as the Honny is:
but if you will con^ite Citrons with Sugre, you must note this difference,
that for six pound of Cytrons, you shall put but.ix. of Sugre, for to
confite them, so that they may be kept all the year. This is, because the
honny makes a great deal moore skumme and froth, then the sugre does, and
therefore you must put the third part moore of Honey. In keeping this
proportion, you can not fail to do it well.

To confite Peches after the Spanyshe facion.
TAke great and fair Peches, which you shall pill and make clean, and cut
them in pieces, and so lay them abroad upon a table fair and clean in the
Sun by the space of two days, turning them ever at night, and in the
morning, and put them hot into a Iuleppe of Sugre, well sodden and prepared
as is aforesaid. And after you have taken them out, set them again in the
Sun, tourninge them often until they be well dried. This done put them
again into the Iulep, and then in the Sun, until they have gotten a fair
bark or crust, as you will have them, and this shall you do three or four
times: then being thus prepared, you may keep them in boxes for winter, for
it is a soueraygne thing.

To make Conserve or Confiture of Quinces, called in Latyne Cotoneatum,
Cydoniatum or Cydonites, as they do in Valence, which also the Geneuoyes
do use.
TAke Quinces, and purify them, and when you have taken out the kernelles,
sees them in fair fresh water, so much, until they open and break, then
strain them through a clean strainer, that there remain nothing in the said
strainer, but only the hardness of them, that is to say: the skin the
kore and such like. For eight pound of the said strained substance, you
must put three pound of fair and fine Sugre: and taking a vessel of tin
fair and large in the bottom, you shall myngle the Quinces with the Sugre:
and then set them to boyle with a little fire, sturrynge them with a broad
sklyse of wood, until all be well sodden, which if you will know, loke when
all shall leuse it self, and cleave no more to the said vessel, for then it
is sodden to his perfection, and shall be time to take it of. And if you put
to it any Musk, stamp it with a little Sugre, as much as you will, cast it
into the said vessel, stirring it always with your sklyse of wood. If you
will add spices to it, put in Synamom, Cloves, Nutmegs, and Ginger, as much
as you will, boiling the Musk with a little Vinagre. This done, with the
broad sklyse lay of this confection of Quinces upon a table, where first you
must have sifted and strewn Sugre, and so make round, broad or long pieces,
as you will with the circle of a bore, of what greatness you list: then set
them in the Sun until they be thorough dry. And when they have stand a
while, turn them up side down: making them always a bed of lifted Sugre
both under and above. Then turn them still in the said Sugre, and dry
them in the Sun, so lunge until they have gotten a fair white crust of
Sugre. Better comfites of Quynces, sweeter, or hartier than this, a man can not
make. In like manner may you dress and trim Peches, Pears, and other kinds
of fruits: A thing of great singularity.

To make a paste of sugre, whereof a man may make all manner of fruits, and
other fine things, with their form, as platters, dishes, glasses, cups, and
such like things, wherewith you may furnish a table: and when you have done,
eat them up. A pleasant thing for them that sit at the table.
TAke gomme dragant, as much as you will, and steep it in Rose water, until
it be mollified. And for four vnces of Sugre, take of it the bigness of a Bean,
the juice of Lemons a walnut shell full, and a little of the white of an egg:
but you must first take the gomme, and beat it so much with a pestel in a
mortar of white marble, or of brass until it become like water, then put to
it the juice with the white of the egg, incorporating well al together. This
done, take iiii. vnces of fine white sugre, well beaten to poulder, and cast
it into the mortar by little and little, until all be turned into the form of
paste. Than take it out of the laid mortar, and bray it upon the poulder of
sugre, as it were meal or flower, until all be like soft paste, to the end
you may turn it and facion it which way you will. When you have brought your
paste to this form, spread it abroad with Sinamom, upon great or small
leaves, as you shall think it good: and so shall you form and make what things
you will, as is aforesaid. With such fine knackes as may serve a table,
taking heed that there stand no hot thing nigh unto it. At the end of the
banquet they may eat al, and break the platters, dishes, glasses, cups, and
all things: for this paste is very delicate and saueurous. If you will make a
thing of moore finesse than this, make a tart of Almondes stamped with sugre,
and rose water, of like sort that march pains be made of. This shall you lay
between two pastes of such vessels or fruits, or some other thing as you
think good.

To make a confection of Melons or Pompones.
TAke what quantity of Melons you will, and take them before they be full ripe,
but let them be good, make as many cuts in the as they be marked with
quarters on every side, having mondified them, taken out their kernelles, and
pilled of the utter rine, steep them in good vinaigre, leaving them so by
the space of ten days: and when you have taken them out, take other Vinagre,
and steep them a new again, other ten days, removing and styrringe them
every day: than when time shall be, take them out, and put them in a course
linen cloth, driyng and wiping them well. Finally set them in the air the
space of a day and a night, than boil them in honey, and by the space of ten
days give them every day a little bubbling or boilinge, leaving them always
in the honey: and let them boil at each time only but one wawme. Then take
the said pieces, put them in what kind of vessel you will, and take these
spices folowinge, the poulder of Cloves, of ginger, of Nutmegs, of Sinamom,
whereof you shall make spices, this done, make one bed or rank of the pieces
of melons, another of the spices: than take fine white honey, and pour it upon
them in the said vessel.

To make Melons and Pompones sweet and very delicate.
TAke fine sugre, and dissolve it in water, than take the seeds of a Melon,
and cleave them a little on the side, that sticks to the melon, and put them
in the sugared water, adding to them a little Rose water, leave the said
seeds so by the space of three or four hours, and then take them out, and you
shall see that as soon as the said seed is dry, it will close up again.
Plant it, and there will come of it such Melons as the like hath not been
seen. And if you will give them the savour of Musk, put in the said water a
little Musk, and fine Synamom. And this may you do also with the seeds of
Pompones and Coucombers.

To confyte orange pills, which may be done at all times of the year, and
chiefly in May, because than the said pills be greater and thicker.
TAke thick Orange pills cut in four or.vi. pieces, and sti ep them in water
the space of ten or.xii days. You may know when they be stieped enough, if
you hold them up in the sun and se thorough them, for than they be stieped
enough: and if you cannot see thorough them, let them yet steep until you
may: than afterward lay them to dry upon a table, and than between two dry
linen clothes. Moreover put them in a kettle, or vessel leaded, adding to it
as much honey as will half cover the said pills, more or less as you shall
think good. Boil them a little, stirring them always and than take them from
the fire, least the honey sees to much, for if it should boil but a little
more then it ought to boil, it would be thick and massife. Let it than
stand rest four days in the said honey, stirring and mengling well every
day the said Orenges and honey together. For, because there is not honey
enough to cover over al the orange pills, you must stir them well
oftentimes, to the end they may al equally receive of the honey. This shall you
do three times, geuinge them one bublinge or boilinge at each time, and so let
them rest and stand.iii. days as we have said. Finally you shall strain or
dreane them from the said honey, and boil them in as much other honey as
you shall think will suffice, and after you have let them boyle the space of
a Credo, take them from the fire, and bestow them in vessels, putting to them
of the best spices you can find, as Ginger, Cloves, and Sinamom: mix all
well together, and you shall have made an excellent thing. And note, that the
honey that shall remain, will be still good for to dress and trim other
Orenges, or other things withal.

To confyte walnuts.
First take Walnuts when they be little green, with the pill or husk and
al, and make in them.iiii little holes, or mo, than stiep them in water.xi.
days, or more or less: make them clean and boil them in honey, as the
foresaid Orenges, but make them sees four times as much. And note that the
honey is always good, but you must oftentimes put in fresh, because it
consumes. Finally you shall dress them with spices, as the Orenges, but put
not many cloves to them for they will make them to bitter.

To confyte Gourdes.
TAke the neck of the Gored and cut it in lunge pieces, as you think good,
and power upon the boiling water, and do so.xi. mornings, but you must have
pilled them finely; and taken away the inner part that serves for nothing.
This done, sees them in a kettle until they be neither to much nor to little
boiled, but even hole and massive not broken: than dry them upon a table in
the shadow the space of two days, and after wipe them clean piece by piece,
with a linen cloth, do with them as with the Oreges.

To confite cherries.
TAke cherries and leave them a day in the sun than take out the stones, and
set them in the sun again three days: after this sees them as we have
said of the Orenges: but you must leave them in honey.xv. days, and by the
fire.iii. days, so that they may only be kept warm, to the end they savour
not of burning, or of the fire. And after you have well mixed and incorporated
all, you shall put them in honey with spices. Al these confitures may dure
many years, so that you refresh them with other honey boiled a little, when
they be diminished.

To make little morsels as they use in Naples, an exquisite thing, for they be
very savoury, do comfort the stomach, and make a sweet breath.
TAke three pound of fine sugre, ye flower of meal.vi. pound, of Sinamom three
vnces, Nutmegs, ginger, pepper, of each of them balfe an uncle, but let the
quantity of the pepper be greater than of the residue, raw white honny, not
clarified, three vnces. First make a round cycle with the said flower, in the
middle whereof, you shall put the Sugre, and upon it a pound of Muskt Rose water,
bray and break well all these things with your hands, so lunge, until you
feel no more Sugre. This done, you shall put in the said spices, and than the
honey, mixinge well all together with your hand. After this mengle it again
among the flower, keep some of it to flower the tile or other things that you
must bake it upon. And when all is well brought and made into past, you shall
cut the little morsels in sunder with your hands, making each of them three
vnces weight, or there about, than turn and make them in to the form of a
fyshe, dressinge them with your instrument meet for the same purpose. Than
heate your oven and lay them upon little tiles of copper or earth, making
first upon the tiles a good thick bed of flower, you must bake them the mouth
of the ove open, keeping evermore a fire at one of the sides of the mouth of the
oven, ye must also touche them often times, to se if they be baked enough, and
whither they hang sure, and hold together between your fingers: You may
also bake them in the fire in ouens of copper covered, such as tartes be made
in, then when you have taken them out you must gilt them.

self, mingle them together, and than make in the Limbeck a row or bed of
them, than a bed of the poulders, and one of Turpentine, and so another of
the snails, and thus one upon another, until the Limbecke be full, than cast
upon it a glassefull of good white wine, and make unto it a temperate fire. Thus
shall you have such a water as you wuld desire, the which you shall keep in a
flagon of glass: for it is very good to make white and to beautify the flesh,
and to take away the wrinkles of the face: A thing proved.

To make a water of white Melons, that makes a fair skin.

Alom burned an uncle, Turpentine washed a pound.xij. new laid Eggs stamped
with shells and all, white Snails cut in pieces as many as you will, Sugar.
iiii. vnces, with a glassefull of goats milk, and one of white wine: than
fill the Limbecke with the said things, layeng rank upon rank, as we have
said of the other water before. Give it than a little fire, and keep the water
in a viol, which will be excellent to wash your fa^e with. After this
manner is made ye water of Auguria of the blossoms of beans, of mallowes, and
of the blossoms of Tansey, or wild vine, other such like things.

To make a very good water of Gourdes, as well garden Gourdes as wild.
TAke Gourdes, and pluck of their utter pill or bark, cut them into little
round wheels, than put to them six vnces of succarine Alome, an uncle of Alom
sciffilae or plumae, the value of a penny of Myrrh, half a pound of
Turpentine washed, four new laid eggs stamped and well beaten together,
six Lemons cut in trenches, Snails as many as you will, a glass of white
wine. Beat into poulder that which ought to be beaten, and mix well all
together, making the first rank of Sugar, the second of poulder, and the
third of Snails: than put the wine, the Lemons, and the eggs upon all the
rest, and so distill it with a small fire: and the water that comes of it
must be kept.viii. or.xv. days in the sun in a viol. A man may make the like

shells. After this take out the yelkes finelye that you break them not, and
put them in an earthen dish leaded. This done, take the value of a penny of
white Turpentine well washed, the value of a half penny of sugre Candy, and
twice as much of the paste of Borar, Campher, Verdegrise, Roche Alome, of each
of them six deniers. All these things well beaten to poulder, take.ii.
quarters of quick silver mortified with spettle, or the juice of lemons, oil of
wine leese called Tartarum.iiii. vnces, a white onion, which you shall boyle in
white wine, strain thorough a strainer, and mingle al this with the yelkes of
the eggs, incorporatinge, and beating all well together, with the juice of
two lemmons. And at night when you go to bed, lay the said composition upon
your face, neck, and breast, lettinge it so dry of it self. Now, you must
stir it well at every time you will occupy it, and you may not take it to
soon from your face, for than you shall mar the skin: but you must let it
lie on the space of eight days. And although you would think the said
composition burned or flawed of the skin of your face, you may not for all
that take it of, but let it work his operation, and at the end of eight days
take it of in this manner following. Take wheat bran, mallowes, leaves of Marche
violettes, Bean poddes, crommes of bread, and a good quantity of raw honny,
and boyle al these things together, until it be all soft, than power it in
to some pot, and let it cool until such time as you may endure the smoke
thereof, holding your face over the pot. Also cover well your head, your
breast, and other places, where you have laid the said past, and hold your
face so over the smoke of the pot until the sweat drop down by al your face.
And when you perceive your self to sweat take a little of the said water, put
crommes of bread in to it, and when you have well sweet, take of the bread
crommes, rub with them al about where the composition is laid: for there the
skin will be very tender, and therefore must you rub hard, until your face be
clean of the said past, or composition, than immediately wash your face with
clean water, and wipe it dry again. After this, you must take some distilled
water, wherein is no strong substance, and bath your face with all five or
six times. If in case there remain behind any of the said past in any place
of your body, rub it well with the said crommes of bread, or some linen
cloth, wet or dieped in such distilled water, and you shall incontinent see
that that skin which was rough, thick, and rude, shall be changed and altered
into a fine, fair, and delicate skin. But beware that in eight days after
you go not abroad in the open air, or to nygh the fire, lest the new fine,
tender, and delicate skin, should be burned, or take any hurt. This is a
goodly secrete.

For him that hath naturally a red face.

water away, which will be very good for scabs, or skurfe: power to it other
sethinge water, was^he it well, as before, four or five times. This done,
take.xii. or.rv. Perles, and a Carlyn or two of gold broken in sonder, or
else a little Campher, a little Boras, a little Talchum, if you have any. All
these things shall you break and bruise in sunder, with one hand in a mortar,
and so leave it forty days in the Sun, stirring it every day with your
hand the space of half an hour. After the said forty days take four
new laid eggs, the which being a little heated by the fire: you shall

foresaied things, thorough a white linen clothe, than let the grease cool,
until it be harde again: and if there be any ordure or fylthe at the
bottom, you must take it away. After this take two vnces of the oil of

scabs.

To make a water that makes the flesh and skin of a man or woman very
fair, and will be kept like a precious balm.
TAke a yonge crow even out of the nest, if you may get one so: if not, take
him as yonge as you may: to whom (by the space of.xl. days) ye shall give
none other meat, but the yelkes of harde eggs. Than kill him, and flaw him,
breaking the flesh into small pieces: than take leaves of a myrtle tree, and
lay one rank of them, and another of the little pieces of the crow, in some
great viol of glass, powdered and strewn over with the poulder of Talchum,
stamped with the oil of sweet Almondes, and put in as much of it as your
discretion shall judge, for a great quantity will do no hurt to it. And if
there remain yet any pieces of the said crow, make thereof another rank,
adding thereto some myrtle leaves, and than of the Talchum, and the said glass
must be large, wide, and lowe. Finally you shall pour upon it three or four
vnces of the oil of Myrrh, dressed with eggs, as is declared in this book.
Than set the said viol or glass under the Limbeck, stopping well the sides
and joints, that it take no vent, and likewise the recipient: and give it at
the beginning a small fire for the space of four or five hours, so that al
these things may be dissolved, and as it were, break, and corrupt among them
selves: than make the fire greater and greater, and at the end very great for
the space of an hour, letting it after cole. And if the fire have ben great
enough, the water will be yelowe, and somewhat red, the which water you shall
put into another like glass, great, according to the quatitie of the said
water putting to it half a pound of rosemary blossoms, half a glassefull of
Aqua vite, setting al to distill again with the limbeck, and recipient as
before: you must put in the recipiet, or at the beke of the limbeck, some fine
little cloth, wherein must be white Bengewin stamped between ij. papers as well as
you can. When this water shall be distilled, it will be very clear fair, which
you shall keep in a viol, well stopped with wax, and cered cloth, to the end it
take no vent, and you may neither keep it in the sun, nor in any hot place.
This will be a noble and precious water, which hath not the like in the world
for to make the skin fair, and to preserve it. The manner how to use it is
this. First, you must wash your face well with clear water distilled, and
than rub well both face, breast, and other places of your body where you list,
with a piece of scarlet wetted in the said water, and lie down upon your bed,
holding a little while, the piece of wet scarlet upon your face, and thus may
you do every.viii. or every.xv. days once, or else every month, or every two
months. In the mean time you may use some other water, as the water of Bean
blossoms, of gourdes, of melons, of onyons, of white flourdelice, of the rote
of the herb called in latin Dracontium, or more commonly Serpentaria, in
english dragons, and of other like: but you must take heed that you put in it
no sublime, nor Ceruse in any wise. Thus shall you have a water of a marvelous
virtue, to make your skin and flesh fair and natural, and to conserve and
keep it lunge yonge, gay, fresh, and nete.

A very goodly water to wash the face, neck, and the breast, whereof a man
may make a great quantity, for the more there is of it, the better it is: It
makes the skin and flesh of the face fair, not burtinge or destroying the
teeth, and shall seem that the face is nothing at all helped with any colour,
but that it is even so by nature.
TAke two fat Pigcons, two pound of Veale, seeds of Spurge, pilled three
vnces of Pine apple kernelles, sweet Almondes, bitter Almondes, the roots of
white and yelowe flower delice, Beans broken in pieces and mo^dified, the gall

Diptum, a little lemon the yelow pill taken away, cut in pieces, the cromme of a
white lofe wet in milk gomme dragant stieped in wine, gomme Ammoniac slieped
in Vinaigre, and let there be of all these things a reasonable quantity. Than
put thereunto flowers or blossoms of Ligustrum, which is a tree having leaves
like an olive tree, but they be brother and softer, more grene of colour, which
doth bear white flowers and sweet, whereof is made an oil called Oleum
ciprinum. And this free doth grow in watery places, as Willows and salowes
do, and bears a black fruit like unto an elder free, and distill all these
with a small fire, having bound or tied a little linen cloth with Musk, and
white Benge wine, at the beck of the Limbecke: than keep the water in a glass
well stopped, for it will be very excellent to make a white and natural
skin or flesh, without hurtinge the teeth or any other thing.

To make a very excellent red colour for the face, which is natural, and
continues lunge upon the face, making it always gayer and fairer.
TAke the whites of.xxv. harde Eggs, and put a glassefull of the milk of
green figs among them, if you can get none of it, take little figs that be
not ripe, and cut them in small pieces, which you shall mingle with the said
eggs: and than distill them, and the water that shall come thereof, makes of
it self the flesh white: but if you will make it red, take for every
glassefull of the said water, two vnces of Alome Scissilae or plumae, beaten
in poulder, half an uncle of the grain called in latin Coccum, wherewith
scarlet is died, and two vnces of the grains that men use to die Cr^mson ^ilke
with. Let all this he put in a viol well stopped, that it take no vent, then
set the vyole in a kettle of boat water (not boiling hot) by the space of
eyghte days. This done, strain out well the substance of the said
colours, and take the water so coloured and died: and put to it as much
more of the same Alome, and grains as before, and set it again altogether in
hot water, by the space of eight days: than strain out the water, and add
to it the third time some Alom, and grains, with a little gomme Arabic, that
is to say, for every glassefull of water, half an uncle of gomme, setting it
again in hot water eyghte days, as before: and after you have taken it out,
strain it, and you shall have the fairest red, that is possible to wish
for. Than weate some little piece of Scarlate or Crimson sylke in it, and rub
your face therewith so lunge until the flesh begin to wax somewhat
chafed, and the red well pierced thorough. You may also add to it what odor
or savour you will. And if you will not set the violle in hot water, as is
aforesaid, set it before a little fire, not sufferynge it to sees, and that
for the space of a day or moore: than strain it, and you shall see all
things come to pass, as I have said.

Another kind of red very good for the face, easier to make, and with less
cost.
TAke two vnces of fisshe glewe very clear, and steep it in white wine, the
space of five or six days, until it be very soft: than take Brassell that
is good and of a good colour, well scraped or cut in small pieces, than steep
it in well water, so that the water be above it moore than a hand breads,
and a half, this done, boyle it together with a small fire, assaiyng evermore
the colour upon a paper, until it be to your fantasy. And before you take it
from the fire, put to it, for every glassefull of the said colour, an uncle of
raw roche Alome beaten in poulder, and Gomme arabic, as much as three or
four beans. Than take it frome the fire, and keep it in a v^olle close
stopped: so shall you have an erquisite thing. Women of base degree, are wont
to sees only the Brasyll in wine or water, putting to it a little roche Alome,
and Gomme, letting it hoyle until the colour be to their mind.

Other take red Sandal or Saunders, the which they put in wine, or at the
least in Aqua vite, and not boyle it at all, but keep it so the space of a
night. Than in tourninge the water, they put moore Sandal to it, and a little
moore Alome, according as they like the colour.

An excellent white above all other,
TAke brayed Talchum, and burned tin beaten in to poulder with a wooden
pestell, than wash them and mingle them together, and put them in some manner
of platter, or other great and large vessel, covered with such another, and
so set it in a glassemakers fornayse, the space of three or four days. And
having taken it out, it will be as white as snow. Than bray it finely with
the water of yonge figs, or with the milk of green figs, or with
distilled vynagre, or some other such sharpe and clammy thing.

To make hear as yelow as gold.
TAke the ryne or the scrapynges of Rubarbe, steep it in white wine, or in
clear lye: and after you have washed your head with it, you shall weate your
hears with a sponge or some other cloth, and let them dry by the fire, or
in the Sun: After this weate them and dry them again: for the oftener you
do it, the fairer they will be, without hurting your head any thing at all.

To make lye to wash the head, which (beside that it comforth the brain, and
the memory) makes the hear long, fair, and yelow, like gold.
TAke lye that is not to strong, but as women commoly make it to wassh their
heads: and make as much of it in a kettle, as will serve you ten washinges,
putting to it this following. The pills of ten Orenges, or of sweet Lemons, if
you have any, if not take sour ones, the pills of Cytrons, as many as you
can get, be they green or dry it is all one, the blossoms of Camomell,
Bay leaves, a handful of the herb called Maiden hear, half a handful of
Agrimoyne, two or three handefulles of Barley straw, chopped in pieces, half
a dishefull of a kind of pulse corn, called in Latyne Lupinus and in French
Lupius, having one stalk, the leaf in five deuisions, the cod creauesyd
about, having in it five or sire grains, harde, broad, and red, they be
commonly in France and in Italye, but here in Englande vnneth known, and
therefore they have no English name: they must be dried, a dishefull of
Fennygreeke, half a pound of wine lies, or two or three disshfulles of Brom
blossoms, whereof it is good always to have some dry in your house to make
such things withal. Put all this that I have named in a great vessel with
the said lie, leaving it always so, to take thereof and occupy when you
will. And the longer the said lye shall be compound with the foresaied
things, the better it will be. The said composition will be good for five
or six months or moore: and you may renew it at your pleasure. But when
you will put it in use, take it handsomely and cleanly up, without touching in
any wise the said drooges put in it: and in heatinge it again you may put in
it a little Myrre and a little Synamom: and thus shall you make it very good, as
well for the health of the head, and eyesyghte, as for to beautify and make
the hear fair.

Lye to make hear black.
TAke Gomme lye, and boyle it with a handful of the leaves of Beete, three or
four handfuls of Sage leaves, either green or dry, and as much Myrre as you
will, with Bay leaves, and a few leaves or outward pill of a Walnut. But
when you will use of those lies that make yelowe or black, rub not your
face, or your neck with it, least they become black, or yelowe, although
they dye not the skin so soon as they do the hear. And after having thus
washed your hear, you must wash your face with common lye, or clear water,
or else with white wine.

An oil for to annoynt the hear, which makes it yelowe like gold, long and
glystryng like burnyshed gold.
TAke a glassefull of the oil of Sesamum, which is a white grain growing in
India, whereof oil is made, which is called oleum Sesaminum, if you can get
of it, if not, take oil Olyue not green, but very yelowe, and clear, where
unto you shall put three vnces of dry brom blossoms, well modified, from
the verdure and greenesse that is in them, and from the white that you shall
find within: than stamp them so grosely, adding thereunto an uncle of the yelowe
that is in the middle of white flower delices, and a quarter of an uncle of
Curcuma, and the sixte part of an uncle of Saffron, with a little Synamom,
Bengewine, Musk, and Civet, if you will. All these things will give a good
savour, help the colour and comfort the head: you must put all together into
one vessel or violle, wherein must be oil, which you shall keep in the
Sun all the Summer, and so take of it at every time, a little for your face,
and the older it waxes, the better it will be. Also you may at the end,
put the oil again upon the said drooges, into the vessel, for they will
continue still good together many years: or else you may change those
substances, according as you see need. It shall be also very good to anoint
with this oil the kombe that women kembe them selves with, in the Sun: or
else lay some linen cloth hot upon their head, and let it so lye, without
putting any other thing to it. This is a thing very rare and excellent for a
queen: for to do thus there can not be found a better.

A very goodly way or manner howe to make yelowe aberne hear, without standing
long or nothing at all in the Sun, a rare and a very excellent secrete.
TAke half a pound of Antimonium, half a pound of wine leese, nine vnces of
salt Peter, al these things being finely brayed and incorporated, take an
earthen pot or pan, and put it in the middle of a fire, that the fire may be
both above it and vnderneth it, until it be red hot: than caste in the
said poulders, by little and little with a spoon, tarrying a little space
between every sponefull casting in, until the first be all burned, and
continue so casting in one sponefull after another, until all be in. But this
must be done in a chymney, or in an open place, because there will rise such
abundance of smoke that it is not possible for you to endure it, than having
letten it cool, break the said pan, and in the bottom you shall find as
it were a manner of a thick cake or browne lofe. Than break the said matter
and substance in divers pieces upon the ground, or in some clean place, and
you shall find in the middle, certain little grains like unto fine silver:
but they be brittle and easy to be broken. And this is it that the searchers
out of the secretes of nature do call the king or chief of Antimonium,
which in operation belonging to metal serves for many things, as we will
after declare. But this will not serve any thing at all for to make hear white
notwithstanding you must keep it by it self. Than take the rest, and the
black substance and yellow, and all that you find in the bottom, and on
the sides of the said pan. All the which things (because they will
incontinent wax moist) you shall stamp grossely and quickly, adding to it
for every pound, an uncle of Vitrioli, rubified or made red, as we will show
you hereafter. This done, put all these things together in lye, not to
strong, and let it steep until it become as it were a saulce, putting to
it, two vnces of the oil of yelkes of Eggs, if you have any, if not, take
Oil Olyue. Now, you must keep this licoure thick as it is, in some
vessel, until it be harde, and you shall find it always good. When you will
put it in effect, take common lie, and put into it two or three vnces of raw
Roche Alome stamped, and wash your head with it as you are wont to do. And
after you have washed it, without dryinge it any otherwise than of it self,
annointe all your hear with the said lycoure heated, and being thus
annoyncted, wrap them in a hot linen clothe, resting your self a while.
This done, you shall take of the said annoinctynge, washing your head with
hot lye, using and dressinge the Soap as you shall think good. And finally
wasshe your head and hear again with a little warm white wine, and wrap
them with a hot linen clothe, or dry them in the Sun, or by the fire, as
you will, and last of all you shall annointe your self with our said oil,
or with the Oil of Iasemin, or some other odoriferous and sweet Oil, which
may conserve the hears that they break not, and may give them a lustre to make
them glister and shine, using this manner of annoynctinge every.xv. days, or
every month, as you list your self. By this mean you shall have fair
hear and glistering like gold. But remember to use in al things a
discretion, and diligence, at the first when you use any receipt, as for an
example in this confection, you must take heed that the lie be not to
strong, least with the said oynctment (which I tell you is very strong) it
eat and consume your hear. Also you must well consider the quantity, and
howe lunge it must lye on your head, before you wasshe it away, as is
declared: and so, according to the experience that you shall have in the
effect, you shall use and govern your self in all things, for there is no
rule so certain, but leaves always some place for the discretion, diligence,
and Judgement of the personne that will follow it, and put it in ur or
effect.

An ointment to make the hears fall from any place of the body.
TAke the whites of three new laid eggs well beaten, eight vnces of quick
lime, an uncle of orpiment, and the whole being beaten in poulder, let it be
put among the whites of the eggs and add to it after a little lie, so much
that it may make it a liquor thick like saulce. Than with a pencil or some
other thing, anoint the place frome the which you will have the hears fall,
and leave the oinctmente so upon it the space of a quarter of an hour, or a
little more, than wash the place with warm water, and all the hear will fall
of, or if not, you must annoincte it again, and having stayed a while, wash
it as before, and the hears will fall of without doubt. Finally you must
anoint the said place with oil Roset, or with the oil of Violettes, and the
skin will remain very fair, and without hurt.

An oil or licoure to make the hear fall of, and may be kept as lunge as a
manne will: It is also good for all occasions.
TAke an uncle of Soda (which is ashes made of grass, whereof glassemakers
do use to make their Crystal) ten vnces of quick lime eyghte vnces of
Orpimente, and make thereof a fine poulder, which you shall put in a pan,
with as much sweet and clear lie as will be above the poulder a handefull:
than boyle it together a good hour, and after having let it stand by the
space of xxiiii. hours, you must strain it, and take three vnces of it, and
put thereto an uncle of oil Olive, and let it boil together until the water be
consumed and vanished away, which you shall know, casting a drop or two
into the fire, with a little stick, and if it make no noise, it is a sign
there is no more water left. If you will make it odoriserous sweet, put to it
Musk, or Civet, so keep it: and when you will make the hears to fall of, wash
first the place well with hot water, tha annoinct it with the said oil, and
leave it so a certain space and than wasshe it again with hot water, and all
the hear will fall away. Finallye annointe the place with oil Roset, or
violet oil.

An advertisement or lesson for them that will make the hear fall of.
First, you must note that the hear will not fall away, but when the moan
decreases, that is to say, in the quarter of the wane, and it is far better to
make them fall of with the oinctmente, or with oil, than to pluck them out
with a pair of pincers, as some gentle women do use in France, because it
doth violence unto the flesh, moves the blood, and enlarges the pores, and
also makes the hear to grow again greater.

Therefore in all sorts it is good to anoint by and by the place with some
cooling or refreshing oil, as oil roset, or of Violettes. Likewise, you
must understand that oftentimes the oynctment being mixed with Orpiment,
burns the skin, and that comes by the naughty or to strong composition
of it, or when a man lets it dry to lunge upon the place, or without first
wasshinge the place with hot water, or when a man annoincteth not the place by
and by after the hears be fallen, as we have said before.

To cause that the hear shall grow no more or to make them come out thynne
and fine like the first soft hear or mosynes of the face.
A Man can scant find a remedy that the hear grow no more, because that many
when they will do it, they make certain oyntementes very cold and dry,
wherewith they anoincte the place a good while, not doing any good at al, by
reason of the power of nature, which hath always his course, and casts out
her superfluities, with the hear. Therefore they burn the skin and do but
mar it, wherefore you must note that they must make them fall of in the last
quarter of the wane of the Moon, and then incontinent annoyncte the place with
oil rosat, or of Violettes: this done, the hear grows again weaker,
softer, and finer: and slacks at every time moore and moore in coming forth.

But if you will that it never grow more, use these remedies folowinge, which
are very good, and certain by experience. Take the little stones of Olives
burned, the outward coddes of beans, dried, the seed of Henbaine, Litarge of
gold and silver, the shells of fyshes called in Latyne Tellmae, burned, and
the juice of black Poppy, as much of the one as of the other, and half as
much Orpiment as of one of those things. All this being beaten to poulder,
boyle it in as much oil Olive rosat, as will cover them six fingers height,
styrringe it continually by the space of two or three hours: than let it
cool, and strain the said oil, and so keep it, putting to it the fourth
part of the oil of Selandyne. And when the hears be fallen, take a little
linen cloth, wet in the said oil luke warm, and lay it upon the said
place, leaving it so bound on all a night. In the morning take of the lynnen
cloth, and annoynt the place with oil rosate: and at night lay the lynnen
cloth on again wetted as before: and this do.vi. or.vii. nights, but let it
be in the wane of the Moon. And if you perceive that the hears grow again,
make them fall away again at the next wane of the Moon, doyng in al points
as before: you shall not oft do it, but you shall make that the hears shall
never grow more.

To make a kind of cloth or plaster to take the hear from the face, neck,
and hands, or from any part of the body.
TAke two vnces of Turpentyne, half an uncle of white wax broken small, or
some what moore or less, according as need shall require, Bengewyne, Storax
calamita, at your discretion. First melt the wax a little, with a little
fire, and than the Bengewyne and Storax: after this, put in the Turpentyne,
adding to it a little Ceruse well brayed, and setting it to the fire, put in
to it a little Masticke, and make thereof a mixion neither to thick nor to
clear or thin. Than take a piece of linen clothe of what bygnesse you will,
and lay it abroad upon a table, spreading afterward the said composition upon
it with a spoon, or some other thing, as it were in manner of a plaster, than
let it cool, and keep it so the one upon the other open, without folding up
the lynnen clothe, for when the said mixion is cold, it is harde. If you will
put it in proof and occupy, do as follows.

At night when you gooe to bed, wash your face and neck with luke warm
water, rubbinge it well with a linen cloth, or with your hand: and when it is
dry or when you have wiped it, take a piece of the said plaster, or cyred
clothe, and heate it by the fire, until the said mixion be liquid and
soft, then immediately bind it upon your face, or upon the place, from
whence you would have the hear to fall, and press it harde on, leaving it
so all night. In the morning go to your lokinge glass, and pluckynge of one
end of the said lynnen clothe, you shall pluck away with it all the hear
of your face, and so shall you leave a very fair skin. And if in case there
remain yet any of the said mixion upon the flesh, wasshe it with hot water,
and with wheat bran, rubbinge it so lunge with some piece of lynnen cloth,
till you make it fall of, than wash your face with Aqua vite, or white wine, or
with some other distilled water, being not to strong, but let it be of Melons,
or gourdes, or of such other like and use afterward waters meet for the face,
as you list, and thus shall you keep and maintain your face as clear as
glass.

A marvelous secrete, which the great lords of the Moors do use, whereby
they make that their children have no hear under their arms, or other place
where they will. And this secrete found I in Syria, the year 1521. by the
means of a lord of the country, whose daughter I healed.
AS soon as the child is borne, they make ready by and by a piece of fine
gold, or a Ducar, or else a ring, or some like thing, and keep it in the fire
until it be red hot, not melting it, than they carry it with a payer of
tongues lay it upon the place, where they will no hear shall grow, and
immediately annoynte it with oil Rosat, or the oil of Violettes: than
after.xxiiii. hours, they do the like again, and by this means there grows
never hear in that place. I have often times made the hear fall from young
gentil women's brows and foreheads with this medecin and they have found it
wonderful: but the gold must be very fine, which suffexeth no token, mark or
scar to remain where the burning was, as other metals do. I have kept this
secret hidden a lunge time, ^although that diverse times, men would have given
me great gifts, yet I would not publish it a broad, until now that I have
done it, in this present book.

To make a kind of cloth, called cloth of Leuant wherewith women use to colour
their faces.
TAke the shearynge of skarlate, and boyle it in water, where quick Lyme hath
been boiled: and after you have boiled it a good space, you shall strain it,
and take a potful of it, and put into it two vnces of Brasill, cut in little
pieces, adding to it an uncle of Roche alume, and as much of Verdigreese, and a
quarter of an uncle of gum Arabic: and after you have well boiled it, the
space of half an hour, take a piece of old linen clothe, of what bigness
you will, and wet it in this decoction, or red colour, than cover the pan, and
let the said mixtion cool, by the space of a day after you have taken it
out, dry it in the shadow, and keep it in some vessel, among odoriferous
and ^oote things, for to help you.

The same another way.
TAke a glassefull of Aqua vite, a quarter of an uncle of the grain that I
spake of before called Coccum, half an uncle of Brasyll, half an uncle of gomme
armoniacke, put all these things together, in the glass where the Aqua vite
is, than stop it clase, for fear it take vent, and the said glass must
be full. After this set it upon a small fire, making it sees fair and
softly, or else set it in the Sun, by the space of two or three days.
This done, strain it, and put in it pieces of old linen clouts, as we have
said before. If you think, in strayninge this water, that the colour is not
red, to your mind, your may put in moore of the said grain and brasell.

To dye a white beard or hear of the head into a fair black.
TAke good galls of Leuant, or such like, and fry them in oil, but let them
not burn: than stamp them, and sift them once or twice. Take also Ferretum
or Spanish black, which the Frenchmen call Atrament d'Espaigne, the which
likewise you shall stamp and beat well to poulder. Than take a pan full of
lye, and put into it the pylles or rynes of Pomegranades, Walnut pills,
Pineapples, Myrre, Sage leaves, as much as you will. Let all this boyle
together, until it be brought unto the third part. You must have in it
also two parts of gall, and one of Ferretum, tempering and incorporating all
well together, until the black colour content you, wherewith you may die your
beard, and hear, in this manner. Wash your beard with lye not to strong,
least it hurt you: and whiles your head or beard is yet hot, annoynt it with
the said confection: but it must be luke warm, to the intent it may
penetrate and pierce the better, and so leave it a certain space. Than wasshe
your head or beard first with lie, and than with hot water, and you shall
have your head and beard sayre and black. This hurts not, nor smarts
any thing at all, neither brings any inconvenience to the head.

A noble and excellent poulder to make clean the teeth, to make them fast and
white, and to conserve the gommes. A better thing can not be found, and it
were to give or present to a Queen or Princess.
TAke Lacca of grain, Lacca de grain, is a certain confection or mixtion,
made of grain, and are little round red balls. Lacca is a Turkish word, and
not used among us, but amongst the Italians,
if you can get (...), if not, take of the grain it self that is very good.x.
parts, seven parts of barley cakes or bread, so burned that they be brought
to coals, Lignum aloe (...). parts, fine pommeyse stone scoured and made
clean in embers, and stieped or tempered in white wine, or in Vinaigre eight
parts, dragons blood three parts, roche Alome burned four parts, honey
burned in a pan until it be first black, and than yelowe, three parts
(and this may you do of the lees of honey, that remains when it is
distilled, putting it in a pan, and setting it in a glassemakers fournesse
the space of a day or two) coals of the wood of rosemary, three parts, fine
Synamom two parts, Bengewyne one part, Bole Armenick oriental, nine parts,
white wine lees two parts, Aleblaster one part small pearls one part, the
scrapynge of yuorye two parts, little Quinces not ripe, of the byggenesse of a
Walnutte, or a little more, six parts. Now the best be those that be not
come to perfection upon the tree; the which you must burn in the fire, even
unto coals, Mastir eight parts. Let all these things be well stamped, and
passed thorough a fine sarce, adding thereto a little Musk, and some Gold or
Silver foil. This done, you shall keep the said poulder in some box well
stopped, and so shall you have a precious thing. And when you will occupy of
it, wasshe your mouth well first, with clean water, or wine, than rub your
teeth with your fingar, or some lynnen cloth, taking of the said poulder upon
it, and after wash your mouth well. Thus oft doing, you shall always have
your teeth very white, fast in your head, strong and not hollow.

To make a very excellent conserve to scour the teeth, to comfort the
gummes, and to make a sweet and good breath.
BEcause the use of the poulder to scour teeth, seems less commodious, than
some licoure or conserve, which agrees better with the mouth, therefore we
will write here a very excellent one, which hath not his like in the world,
and must be made as follows. Take one part of syrop roset, two parts of the
syrop of Myrtell, or of the wood called Lentiscus, out of the which comes a
gomme called Mastir, put this together in a clean pan, than put to it of the
said poulder for the teeth, whereof we have spoken in the Chapter before, so
that al may be brought into soft paste or dow, than set the little pan upon
chafing dish, wherein must be some hot ashes, with a few embers, or else
at the least set it far from the fire, and make it boil sayre and softly,
styrringe it always, until it be as thick as honny or thicker: than take it
fro the fire, and put to some goldfoile and musk, what quantity you will. And
so shall you have a singular thing for to do this that I have spoken of.

An advertisement or lesson concerning the making of poulders, and conserves
for the teeth.
IF you will make the said things as excellent as is possible, you must take of
the said things as much as you may get: or if you cannot have them al, take at
the least the most excellent, as grain, pearls, Coral, yellow Amber, Lignum
aloes, Boale Armenick, also the coals of Barley Cakes or loves when they are
burned, and all the other things be very good in it. And if you woulds give it
to some great prince or lord, which had rather have it of a good colour, or
would know the things in it, you may make it as is said, of sew things,
with goldfoile and Musk. And he that will make it with less cost, and a
greater quantity, may (with the things metioned in the chapter with the
poulder) add poulder of brickes, poulder of marble, Crevice or lopsters
shells burned, and a little white salt, the lees that remains in the
bottom when men make strong water, called Aqua fortes, is also very good,
either by it self, or mingled with some other thing, and so shall you have a
great deal of substance with small cost. And if a man will make a conserve of
little charge, and without much labour, he must take raw honey, or honny
roset, and mingle it with the said poulders, and so rub his teeth therewith,
with his finger, or with a linen clothe, and wash his mouth well after it.
Doing this every eight days, he shall make his teeth very fair and white. A
thing very good, and mete for every man.

An excedinge white and good poulder to scour the teeth, which is meeter for
lords and great men, then any of the other before.
First here is to be noted a goodly and notable secrete of great virtue, for to
scour and make white teeth, which is the pommeise stone alone, so that it be
of that fine and white stone, which shoemakers do use to whiten white leather
Shoes, and well beaten in poulder: For in rubbinge your teeth with the same
poulder, if scours and makes them clean, and takes away all the roughness
of them, as men see by experience, that the pommeise stone is used to polysshe
bones, marble, and other like things. I have scene of my friends, men of great
judgment and knowledge, which gave nothing unto great men and Lords, but
the said poulder, when it is well beaten in poulder, a man can not tell what it
is: also you may give it a little savour, laying it among bags of Musk and
Amber, of whom it takes an odour, and I have seen men of estimation, that
held it for a thing of great importance, when they saw the virtue and
operation of it. Now, if you will make a white poulder, more noble and more
profitable for the teeth, and gommes, take small pearls stamped a little, or
else whole, and put them in a dyshe, or in a wide glass: than take the
juice of lemons or orenges, strained thorough a linen cloth, at the least six
or seven times, and pour it upon the said Pearls, until it cover them over
three or four fingers high, and you shall see that in short space it will
begin to boyle, and than cover it with some paper, or linen cloth, leaving
it so three or four days, and at the end you shall find the said pearls
dissolved and molten in the iayde juice, and turned into a paste as white as
snow, mary there will be a little yellow skin upon it, engendered of the
said suyce. This done, take clear well water, or the water of Lentiscus
distilled, and pour it upon the said paste, three or four fingers heighte
above. Than take a little fork, or the steal of a silver spoon, or some
thin stick, and styre the paste well about in the said water, lettinge it
so stand, and finallye caste out the water, and if you see yet any of the
yellow, remain upon the said paste, wash it again, as before, and cover it
with a paper, lettinge it so dry of it self, in the sun. After this you
shall take three parts of the said paste, or white poulder, four parts of
white Pommeise stone, as is aforesayed, two parts of white Bengewine, one
part of Roche Alome well burned, one part of white Coral, half a part of
white yuorye, half a part of Aleblaster very white. Break and bruise all
these well upon a table of marble, or in a silver cup, putting to it some
silver foil, and thus shall you have a very white and excellent substance or
matter to make your teeth as white as snow. And if you will, you way put it
to keep in a conserve, with the syrope of Cedar, or honny Roset, or otherwise
as you will. Also, if you will make the said poulder very red, dress it
only with the Lacca of grain, and a little red coral. Now, because that
in stampinge, it will wax somewhat white, put to it a little Boale Armonicke,
with a little of the juice of Dragons blood, and also gold foil. You may
g^ue to all these said poulders what odor and savour you will, but unto the
white poulder you may put no Musk nor Amber, nor any other such drooges, for
it would take away the whiteness, but you may put it well enough in a
little bag among Musk, or other odours.

A distilled water, excellent for to make the teethe white immediately, and
to preserve them wonderfully.
TAke a pound of the first water distilled of honny, the which is white:
than put it in a viol, with an uncle of commune white salt, half a pound of
raw roche Alome, an uncle of Salt Peter, half a poude of ye water of the
leaves of Lentiscus, two vnces of Mastick, the heighte of two fingers of
Vynaigre in a glass, and as much white wine: Distil all these things with a
small fire, that they smell not of the smoke, nor any burning: continuing
your distillation in such sort, that you be at the least four and twenty
hours in distilling the whole, or else you may make it distill in Balnee
marie, which is the sureste of all. Now, you must continue your
distillation so long, until there be a moist substance to come forth, and
into the water that distills out, you shall put a little poulder of fine
Synamom, a little Lignum Aloes, and Boale Armonicke, for to give it a red
colour, which many men like well: also for to give it a strength and odour,
you shall put in raw honny making it dissolve in the heate of the Sun, for
it is a thing good for the gummes, and gives a good favour to the water. Keep
this well as an excellent thing, and it were for a queen. And when you will
occupy of it, wash well your mouth first, and wipe your teeth with a little
piece of white linen clothe, and than pike them with a tooth piker made of the
wood Lentiscus, or some other thing wet in the said water, or with a
little clothe, rub them a little, and incontinent you shall perceive and
feel it fasten and bind your gommes, and comfort your teeth making them
fair and white. And he that loves better the white then the red, let him
put no Synamom, Boale armonicke, nor Lignum Aloes into it, after it is
distilled, but let him put it in to destill with the other things, putting of
each of them as much as there is of Masticke, and it shall be even as excellent
and as white as otherwise.

Three advertisements or lessons of importance to keep the teeth white and
incorrupt and also a sweet breathe.
THe first is, he that uses not to wasshe well his mouth ever when he hath
eaten his meals, shall I have always yelowe teeth a stinking breath. The
second is, he that sleeps with his mouth close, hath likewise an evil
breath, and foul teeth. The third is, that for to maintain and keep the
teeth fair and white, and a sweet breath, when a man is laid is his head,
and when he wakes in the morning, it is good to purge well the breast and
throat, spitting out all that is gathered together that night: which also is
good for the stomach and head. And having your teeth and breath warm take a
lynnen cloth or the corner of the shete, and rub your teeth well within and
without, to take away the fumositie of the meat, and the yelownesse of the
teeth gathered together in the night: for it is that, that makes your teeth
yelowe, and gommes red, and corrupts your breath. This is a very
necessary thing to be known, and ought well to be observed: It is also good
to eat every morning some grains of Masticke.

A decoction to wash and scour the mouth, to fasten lose teeth, to
consolidate and make sound the gommes, and to make the flesh grow again if
it were decayed or fallen away.
TAke half a glassefull of Vynaigre, and as much water of Lentiscus, of
Rosemarye, Myrrh, Mastick, Boale Armenicke, the moisture that distills out
of Dragons blood, Roche Alome burned, of each of them an uncle, ^ine Synamom
half an uncle, well, river, or fountain water, three glassefulles: mingle all
well together, and let it boyle with a small fire, adding to it half a pound
of honny, taking away the scum of it, than put in a little Bengewine. And
when it hath boiled a quarter of an hour, take it from the fire, and keep it
in a clean vyole, and wash your teeth often times withal, as well before, as
after meat: and holding it a while in your mouth, it is very good for the
head, and makes a sweet breath. A thing of great excellency.

THE Secretes of the reverend Master Alexis of Piemount.
THE FIFTE BOOK.
To make perfyt Asure, such as comes from beyond the seas.
TAke first a pound of Lapis Lasuli, spotted like Marble, and somewhat of the
colloure of Asure, with some veins of Gold, or green, of the which you
shall make this proof following. Take a little piece of it, and put it upon
hot coals, blowing it with a pair of bellows, the space of an hour, than
let it cool again and touche it with your hand, if it break, and undo like
earth, it is nothing worth, but if it abide fyrme and harde together, and
keep his colour of Asure, it is good. Than take a pound of the same, and
break it into small pieces, which you shall melt in the fire the space of a
good hour, blowing it continually. This done, take good Vyneygre distilled,
in some kind of vessel, wherein you shall quench the said pieces, and let
them dry: than take water made as follows. Take a pan leaded, and put in
it a quart of clear water, and a little raw white honey. Boyle it, and
skymme it well, until there be no more skumme, and so let it cool. Than take
of Dragons blood well stamped, the quantity of a Walnutte, and wet it little
and little with the said water, and it being well dipped, strain it thorough a
linen cloth, into some vessel leaded. And you must note, that the water may
not be to rod, nor to clear, but between both, that is to say, between
clear and red, to the end that the Asure may take a Violette colour. After
this, bray well the said Lapis lasuli, so molten and burned, with the said
water (as vermilleon is commonly brayed) by the space of an hour or more: tha
assemble it together in a glass, or some other vessel leaded, ample and
large, drying it in the shadow, and not in the Sun: for it would lose his
colour. And when it is dry, beat it well to poulder, and keep it in some
clean lynen cloth well (...) than make this past folowinge. Take two vnces of
the cousin or gomme of a white pine tree, two vnces of Pigraeca two vnces of
Mastick, two vnces of ye oil of line, two vnces of Turpentine, two vnces of
new Ware: stamp well that must be stamped, and cut the Ware into small
pieces, than put all in a new pan, and boyle it till it come to his
perfection, which may be known, by casting a drop of it into cold water,
and if in taking it with your wet hand, it cleave not to your hand, it is
parfecte: and therefore you shall strain it thorough some clean cloth, into a
vessel full of cold water, but this must you do while it is yet hot, for if
it be cold, it will not strain, and leave it so lunge in the water, until it
be harde, than take it and set it to dry. Now, when you will incorporate it
with the poulder, do thus: Cut the said confection in small pieces, which you
shall put into some kettle tinned within, and set it so on the fire, and when
it begins to bubble up, put to it an uncle of the oil of bitter Almondes,
letting it so boil the space of two Miserere, and in the mean time make ready
your poulder of Lapis lasuli in a vessel, with some little stick made for the
purpose: than take the kettle, and pour it by little and little, into the
vessel upon the said poulder, not ceassinge to stir it always with the
little stick, until it be all well incorporated with the said poulder of
Lapis lasuli, This done let it cole, than annoinct your hands with oil Olive,
and take the said substance, and toss it up and down with your hands, to
the end to incorporate it well together. And after you have brought it to the
form and fashion of bread or paste, put it in a vessel leaded, and keep it
so the space of ten days at the least.

And when you will take out of it the Asure, make first clear lie, with the
ashes of vynes, of the which you shall set a kettle full to the fire,
seethinge it as hot as you may endure your hand in it: than after, put the
said confection or paste in a vessel leaded, and add to it as much of the
said lie as you shall think good.

Than styre the said substance fair and softly, until you see the Asure
come out, and when you see it issued out, pour the said lie with the Asure
into a vessel leaded, of the which vessels you must have a good number, than
put to it again of the other hot lie, doing as before, putting it afterward
again into another vessel, and do thus until there be no more Asure. And
here you must note, that of a pound of Lapis lasuli if it be fine, there is
lost but an uncle, and is had out of it in the whole, eleven vnces, that is to
say: five vnces of good and fine, three vnces of a mean sort, and three vnces
of courser. The fine is worth at the least two crowns and a half the uncle,
the mean, a crown an uncle, and the other half a crown. Now, after you have
gotten out all the Asure, loke well which is like the one the other, for to
put each of them by them selves into three parts, as we have said. Than wash
it well with fair and clear lye, pouringe it out of one vessel into another,
until it be come to a good colour, and purified from all ordure and filth. And
when you think it is clean enough, dry itin the shadow, in a chamber, and
when it is dry, take a glassefull of fine Aqua vite, and steep in it a little
good brasill, than trim and dress your Asure with the same Aqua vite, and
let it dry, continuing so the space of three days, until the Asure be
participant, and have taken part of such lycoure, and than it shall be of an
excellent fine colour. Keep each sort by it self in bags of leather well
sowed and bound.

To make a fine confection of grain, called Laeca of grain.
TAke a pound of the shearinge of scarlette, and put it in a new pan full
of lie that is not to strong, and boyle it until the lie take the colour of
it. This done, take a bag, large and wide above, and narrow poincted beneth,
whereinto you shall power the said shearing of scarlette, and the lye, setting
a vessel vnderneth, than wring and press the bag harde, that all the
substance, and all the colour may strain and dreane out, after that wash
the shearinge and the bag, in the vessel where the colour is. And if you
think that the shearinge hath yet more colour in it, boyle it again with
other lie, ordering it as before. This done, you shall heate the said coloured
lye upon the fire, but let it not boil, and you must have ready upon the fire
some clean pan, with clean water, into the which being hot, you shall
put.v. vnces of Roche Alome, beaten to poulder. And as soon as you see it

until the liquor that shall issue out, be no more red, but clear as lye:
having thus strained all the water, the colour will remain in the bag,
which you shall undo and sever a sonder with a sclyse of wood, putting it down
to the bottom of the bag, and bring it al into a mass, or lump, or into
little tablettes, or into what form you will, and than dry it upon a new

donge. And if you can not have enough in one morning, do the like two or
three times, or as oft as you will: than when you have well dreamed out the
water of this dong you shall put into every pot of the said water, the
bigness of a bean of Roche Alome, and as much gomme Arabic. Than steep what
colour you will in it, using divers vessels, if you will have diverse colours,
and put in what pieces of wood you will, holding them at the fire, or in the
Sun: and at each time pluck out some pieces and lay them apart, leaving

tree, will go of all to gether, and the paper will remain written white,
because it was kept and preserved by the same mylk, from the yncke, where the
letters were. The like may you make with the yelke of an Egg, tempered in
water, with the which you may write also: And when the writing is dry,

and they will goo of, and leave a white space, whereby you shall have fair
white letters in a black paper.

To make a green colour for to write and paint withal.
TAke green byse, and steep it alone in Vynaigre, and pass it thorough a
linen cloth, and bray it well upon a Porphyry stone, with clear water, and
put to it, in brayinge it, a little honny, and let it d^e well, than bray it
again well with Gommed water, and it will be perfect.

To trim and dress Asure.
AZure is brayed with honey, as green, but ye need not purge it otherwise:
temper it with ye whites of Eggs beaten, or with the water of glewe, and not
of Gomme. The water of glewe, is made with parchement glue, clear and
mollified, and strained as Gomme is.

To dress or trim Cinabrium, for to write or paint with.
BRay well the Cinabrium upon a Porphyre stone, with clear condite water,
than let it dry, and put it in an ynckehorne, or glass, but it is better in
an inkhorn in winter. After this pour peace into it, mingling it well
together, and leaving it so until night, until all the Cinabrium be gone to
the bottom: than change the pysse, and do as before, leaving it so until
the next morning, chaunginge so the urine or pysse four or five days, vntyl
al be well purged. Than take the white of an Egg well beaten, until it be
brought into clear water, which you shall pour upon the Cinabrium, so that it
be more than a fingar above it: After mix well al together with some stick of
a Walnutte tree, or else with some little bone, than let the Cinabrium
descend down to the bottom, and do with this as before with the pysse, the
space of two or three days, and this will take away all the savour of the
peace. This done, ye shall put another white of an Egg and mingle all well
together, and than it will be perfyt: you must keep it well stopped. At every
time that you will occupy of it, stir it well: and when the white of the
Egg is so dressed, as is declared, it never corrupts.

A ground to lay gold upon any mettle or iron.
TAke Vernix liquida, a pound, Turpentine, Oil of lyne, of each of them an
uncle: mire well all together, and it is made.

To gylte the edges of books.
TAke the quantity of a Walnut of Boale Armenicke, the byggenesse of a Cyche
peas of Sugre Candye: bray them dry the one with the other, and put to it
a little of the white of an Egg well beaten, than mingle well all together.
This done, take the book that you will gylte, which must be well bound, well
glued, even cut, and well polished, set him fast in the press, and that as
even and as right as you can possible. Then with a pencil give him a wipe
over with the white of an Egg well beaten, and let it dry, than give him also
another with the said composition. And when it is well dried, scrape it, and
polish it well. Last of all when you will lay on the Gold, wet the said
edges with a little clear water, with a pencil, and than incontinent put on
the gold leaves, cut in that biggenesse they ought to be, and when it is
dry, pollyshe it with a dogs tothe. This done, you may make what work you
will upon it.

To keep whites of eggs as lunge as a man will without corruptinge, and
without putting Arsenick to it. A secrete not much known.
TAke the whites of Eggs, not breaking them in any wise, and put to them as
much white Vynaygre as shall suffice, that is to say, a reasonable quantity,
leave it so the space of two days, than pass it thorough some linen cloth,
without breaking or beatynge the white of the Eggs, leaving it so the space
of eight days, than strain it again, and put it in a violle well stopped,
for to occupy when you have need.

The manner howe to make the ground or foundation for Indicum.
TAke Gomme Armoniacke three parts, Gomme Arabic one part, Serapinum, a
fourth part, steep these in Vynaygre, until they be very soft, than mix
them well, and strain them thorough a linen cloth, and it will be very good to
occupy when you have need.

Another perfyt ground for the same thing.
TAke Gomme Armoniack an uncle, Gomme Arabic three vnces, and steep it in
Vyneaygre the space of a day and a night, than take the biggenesse of a
Walnutte of good yellow Honey, and a Garlyke head, well pilled and made
clean, and well stamped. Boyle all these things together in strong Vynaigre,
putting to it a little Aloe Epatic, and let it boyle a good while, than
strain it thorough a linen cloth and wring out well all the substance of it.
And if you think it be liquid or soft, or to clear, boil it again, until
you think it is thick enough, than keep it in a glass, or vessel of earth
leaded, or of bone. When you will gilt any thing, anoint it first with this
composition, with a pencil, and rub it well, so that the ingra^ing be not
filled, leave it so as long as you will: than, when you will lay on the leaves of
gold, blow a little your breath upon the said foundation or ground, and set
on the said leaves of gold, disposing and ordering them as is requisite,
pressing them well down with a pencil, or with a little wol or bombase, and
than shall you have a very excellent giltyng.

A goodly way howe to make Gold and Silver in poulder, a thing easy to be
done, and there will come of it an excellent colour. This is a very rare
secrete, which hath not been used nor known until this present.
TAke leaves of gold a crown weighte, or as much as you will, and set it to
the fire in some little clean pan or pipkin, and in another vessel you shall
put four times as much in weighte of quick silver, a good way of from the
fire, so that it may but only warm a little, for otherwise it might vanish
away. Let not the leaves of gold take so much heate, that they melt, but let
them wax almost red. This done, take them from the fire, and the quick
silver likewise, which you shall pour hot upon the leaves of gold, and
incontinent mingle them well together with a little stick, the space of a
Paternoster, and pour it afterward into a dyshe full of clear water, and you
shall have a dow of the said gold and quick silver, but the colour of the
gold will be so darkened and obscure, that a man shall perceive and see
nothing at all. And this is the dow that the Goldsmythes call Amalgam, and
the learned men Malagma, which is a Greek word, and being corrupted of the
Arabians, was changed into Amalgam. Also you may make this cold, in brayinge
the leaves a good while with the quick silver upon a Porphyre stone, until
all be mixed and joined together.

And braying it also with strong Vinagre, or the juice of Lemons, it will
sooner be made, and will incorporate and come together the better, than must you
wasshe it wise or thrice with clear water. Now, how soever you have made this
dow, or Amalgam, you must strain it thoroughe a lynnen cloth, fine and
thick, to the intent that a part of the quick silver may go thorough: or
else strain it thorough a wild goats skin, or a lambs skin, which is
far better, and press it harde, to thintente there may come out as much
quick silver as is possible. Than take that remains in the cloth or skin,
and put to it half as much fair quick Brymstone citrine. First stamp well
the Brymstone and mingle it with the said paste or dow: and being so
mingled, set it on the fire in a dysshe or iron lad^e, leaving it so until
all the Brymstone be burned, and all the rest yellow. Than let it cole, and
put it in a dish washing it so often with clear water, till you have a fair
colour of Gold. Than keep it in some glass or earthen vessel leaded, as you
do the other punned and brayed Gold, and when you will put it in experience,
steep it in Rose water, or other, wherein you shall have mollified or dissolved
some clear gomme Arabic.

Than dress and order it to write or paint with, and you shall have an
excellent thing. When you have written or painted, being once dry, you may
burnishe it with a dogs toeth, which you can not do to the other brayed or
punned gold, that Scriveners and Painters now a days do use. This secrete
hath been practised of the old and ancient writers, as we see in some of
their books. But now you must use the practise to burnish it, laying a white
paper upon the gold, and rubbinge first upon the said paper with the dogs
toeth. And if you think that it is not yet burnished enough, you may
burnishe it once again, with the toeth upon the Gold without the paper
betwixt.

To make a very fair Vernix, to varnish the said gold, and all other
workmanship.
TAke Bengewine, and bray it the best you can betwixt two papers, than put it
in some violle, and pour upon it good Aqua vite, that it be above the
Bengewyne three or four fingars high, and leave it so a day or twain, than
put to it, for half a violle of such Aqua vite, fine, or six blades of
Saffron slenderly stamped, or else whole. This done, strain it, and with a
pencil Varnish therewith any thing gilted that you will, which will become
bright, and fair, dryenge it self immediately, and will continue many
years. Now, if you will dress Silver in such a manner, do even with the
silver leaves as you did with the Gold, if not, in steed of Brimstone you
shall take white commun salt, then dress the Varnish in the foresaied manner,
putting to it the Almonde or Bengewine, that is to say, the white that is
found in the midst of Bengewine, and put in no Saffron at all. And the said
Varnish of Bengewine, and Aquavite, without any other thing, is very good to
varnish all things, as well painted as not painted, and also to make tables
and coffers of Walnutte tree, and Nebene to glister and shine, and of all other
things: Likewise works of Copper gilted, and not gilted: for it makes
bright, preserves, aydeth the colour, and dries incontinent, without taking
any dust or filth, but that you may make it clean with a linen cloth, or with
a foxes tail, which is better, as if it were not varnished at al.

To bray or break gold or silver easily after the comes manner that the best
workmasters do use.
TAke what gold leaves you will, and incorporate them well in a cup of
glass, with Iulep roset, stir ringe it well with your middle finger, little
and little. And when all is incorporated together, bray it well upon a
Porphyre stone, than pour by little and little, clear water upon the said
stone, mixing it always: After strain the said gold Iulep, into a dish, or cup
of glass, and wash well the stone that there remain nothing. Than stir
all with your finger in the said dish, and let it so repose: after, pour the
water out, and put in other fresh, clear, and warm, and wash it so,
until all the Iulep be washed and cleansed out, and that the water (putting it
in your mouth) be in no wise sweet, than let it dry. This d^en, you shall put
it in a cup of clean glass, and rake out a few hot embers a good way from
the fire, that the glass break not, whereupon you shall set the said cup,
until the gold wax very hot, and be returned to his natural colour.
Finally temper it with go^med water, for to put it in experience.

To make a lycoure, that makes a golden colour without gold.
TAke the juice of Saffron flowers, when they are fresh upon the plant, and
if you can get none, take Saffron dried, well made in poulder, and put to it as
much yellow and glistering Orpiment, that is scaly, and not earthy: than,
with the gall of a Hare, or of a Pike (which is better) bray them well
together. This done, put them in some violle under a donghyll certain days,
then take it out and keep it, and when you will write with this licoure, you
shall have a fair colour of Gold.

Another liquor of the colour of Gold, for to write and to gylte iron, wood,
glass, bone, and other like things.
TAke an egg laid the same day that you begin to make this, the which egg
you shall open at one end, and take out all the white, than take two parts of
quick silver, and one part of salt armoniack, that is clean, and well
beaten: and of these two things, you shall put as much upon the yelk of the
egg that remains in the shell, as will fill it up again: than mingle well
all together with a little stick. After, stop the said egg with the piece
that you took of, closinge it well with a piece of wax, that nothing may
enter into it, nor any thing issue out.

Than lay it under horse donge, right up, the open end upward, this done,
take another half egg shell, and make as it were a cover or a cap upon the
said broken end, covering it with dung, and leave it so the space of twenty
or five and twenty days, and so shall you have a very fair colour of gold,
for to write, and to do what you will withal. And if the said substance be to
harde or to thick, you may break it, or temper it with gommed water.

Another goodly liquor, to make a golden colour with little cost, and is a
thing easy to be done.
TAke the pills of Citrons, or Orenges very yelow, and clear the well of the
white that is within side, than stamp them well in a mortar of stone, or
wood, well made clean, and take good yellow Brimstone, clear and bright,
and well beaten in poulder, which you shall mingle with the said pills
stamped, stampinge well all together. This done, you shall put all this into
a violle, and keep it in a deep cellar or cave, or in some moist place, by the
space of.viii. or.x. days. Finallye, you shall heate it again by the fire, and
then write or paint with it, and you shall find it a very excellent colour of
Gold.

To make yncke, or a colour to write with, in a very good perfection.
TAke good Galls, and break them in three or four pieces, that is to say,
stamp them slightly, and put them in a fryinge pan, or some other iron
pan, with a little Oil, frieng them a little, then take a pound of them, and
put it in some vessel leaded, pouringe into it as much white wine as will
cover it over, more then a good hand breadth. After, take a pound of Gomme
Arabic, well stamped, and eyghte vnces of Vitriole well made in poulder: myxe
all well together, and set it in the sun certain days, stering it as often
as you may: then boyle it a little if you se that you have need, and after
strain it, and it will be perfect. And upon the lees that shall remain in
the bottom, you may pour other wine, and boyle it a little, and strain it.
You may put wine upon the same lees as often as you will: that is to say, until
you se yt the wine which you put in, will stain or be coloured no more. Then,
mingle al the said wine, whereunto you shall put other g^s, gomme, and vitriole,
as at the beginning the keeping it in the Sun, you shall have a better inck
then the first, and do so every day, for the oftener you do it, the better you
shall have it, and with less cost. And if you find it to thick, or that it
be not flowing enough, put to it a little clear lie, which will make it
liquid and thin enough. If it be to clear, add to it a little gomme
Arabic. The galls must be small, curled and massive within, if they be good.
The good vitriolle is always within of a colour like unto the elemet. The best
gomme, is clear and brittle, that in stamping it, it becomes poulder easily,
without cleaning together.

A good way and manner howe to make ink for to carry about a man in a dry
poulder, which (when he will write with) he must temper with a little wine,
water, or vynaiger or with some other liquor, and than he may incontinent put
it in experience. Vvyth the said poulder all other ink may be amended, be it
never so evil.
TAke Peche or Abricot stones with their kurnels, sweet Almondes, or bitter,
(...) that they have their shells harde, and that the Almondes be within them.
And if in case you can get but the said stones without their kurnels, it
shall be good enough, but yet not so good as with the kurnels. Take then all
the said things together, or those that you can get, and burn them upon the
coals: and when they be very red and ens^amed, take them out, and thus
being redacte and made into very black coals, keep them in a pan.

Take likewise Rosin of a Pine tree, and put it in a pan, and make it flame
and burn: than take another little scillette, or else a little bag holden
open, with little sticks laid a cross over it, or otherwise, as you shall
think good, and hold the mouth of the bag downward over the flambe, so
that the smoke of the said Rosin may gather together, and stick round
about the said pan or bag, and when al the Rosin to burned, and all cold
again, cause all the said smoke to fall upon a paper, or table, or some other
thing, and keep it, but if you will not take the pains to make this smoke,
bye it of them that make printers ink. Of this black or smoke, you shall
take one part, or what quantity you will, of the coals of the said stones
another part, of Vitriole one part, of fried galls, as is aforesaid, two
parts, of Gomme Arabic four parts.

Let all these things be well stamped, sifted, and mingled together, and then
keep well this poulder in a linen bag, or of leather, for the older it is,
the better it will be. When you will occupy it, for to make y^ke thereof, take
a little of it, and temper it with wine, water, or Vynaigre, the which being
put into it warm, the yncke shall be the better, nevertheless, being put in
cold, it makes no great matter, and you shall have immediately very good
ink, which you may carry where you will without spillinge or sheadinge. If
you have naughty inck, put to it a little of the said poulder, and it will
become immediately very good black, and have a good gloss.

To make a great deal of yncke quickly, and with little cost.
TAke of the black that Curriers or tanners do black their skins with, for
you may have much for money: than take of a fyshe called a Cuttle, which
costs almoost nothing, and chieflye in places nigh to the sea side, and in
eating the said fish at diverse times, you may keep the galls together.
Than myngle the said galls with the Tanners colour, and without any other
thing, you shall have a perfect Ink. To make it yet better, you may put to
it of the said poulder made of the coals of Vitriole, of Galls, and of
gomme, and the said. Ink shall be very good to print in copper, putting to it a
little vernix, a little oil of line, so that it may be liquid and flitting of
it self, for to pearce the better into all manner of engrauinges, and that it
may abide well upon the paper, without renninge abroad.

To make Printers Ink.
PRinters Ink is made only with the smoke of Rosine, as is abouesaid, and
is tempered with moist Varnish, you must sees it a little, to make it liquid
or thick, as you shall need. But in Winter moister then in Somer: and always
the thicker makes the letter fairer, blacker, clearer, and brighter. But in
what manner so ever it be, it must be ever well mixed with the smoke. And to
make it liquid, as is said, you must put to it more oil of line, or of
Walnuts to the bernyshe. If you will make it thicker, put less Oil, and
more smoke, lettinge it sees more. If you will Print red, in stead of the
said smoke, mingle Vermillion well brayed, with the said Varnish. If you
will Print green, put in green Bice. If you will make it Blew (as men have
done sometime heretofore) take Azure of Almaine, or of that of glass, which is
now made at Venise, doing in all points as we have spoken of the black
ink.

To make yncke so white, that although a man write with it upon white paper, it
may easily and perfytlye be red. A very goodly thing.
TAke the shells of new laid eggs, very white, and well washed, then bray
them well upon a clean marble stone, with clear water. Put them in a clean
dish, until the poulder descend to the bottom: after dreane out the water
lightly, and let the poulder dry of it self, or in the sun, and so shall
you have an excellent white, that neither Ceruse, nor any other white in the
world may be compared unto it, if you dress, and keep it clean. And when you
will occupy it, take gomme Ammoniac well washed, and mollified of that yellow
skin that is about it: then steep It the space of a night in distilled
Vynagre, and in the morning you shall find it dissolved, and the Vynagre
shall become whiter than milk: the which you shall strain thorough a clean
lynnen cloth, and with a little of this white liquor you shall temper the said
poulder, and than write or paint with it, and you shall have a white,
excellent above all other sorts. A noble woman of Italye used no other thing
to blanch her face: and kept her self very white with al, and yet it
appeared not that she used any such thing. Also the said poulder hurts
nothing at all the face, nor the skin, nor yet the teeth, as the sublime,
the Ceruse, and other like things do, which gentylwemen oft use, to their
great detriment and hurt. But if you will use the said white made of egg
shells upon your face, you must bray and consume it very fine, and that it
have almost no palpable substance, and that it may be penetratiue and
pearsinge, to the intent it may continue. In the which thing every man may
prove and assay what his wit is able to do. But above all things, when you
will use it for the face, it is necessary that you put to it the third part of
calcined and burned Talchum, as we will show you in the book folowinge.

To make a poulder to take of blots of yncke, fallen upon the paper, or else
the letters and wrytinge from the paper: which is a rare secrete, but yet
profytable.
TAke Ceruse well brayed, and make thereof a dow with the milk of a fig
tree, then let it dry: afterward bray it again, and dry it as before, and
so seven times: then keep it so in poulder. And when you will use it to take
out blots, or letters out of paper, take a little linen cloth wet in
water, pressing and wringing the water out, then spread it abroad upon the
place where you would have it, and leave it thereupon until the paper and the
ink be moyste with all: than take away the wet cloth, and upon the blot
or letters that you will have taken away, put a little of the said poulder of
Ceruse, leaving it so the space of a night. In the morning, you shall take a
linen cloth clean and dry, wherewith you shall rub of softly and finelye
the said poulder, and the paper will remain exceeding white for to write upon
again, as well as before, and better. And if al be not well rubbed of at the
first time, you may do it once again, and you shall not fail.

To make a kind of varnish, but much fairer, and better than that which
Scriuenars do use; and is of less cost, and stinks not as other varnish
doth.
THe Varnish which Scriveners commonly use, is nothing else but the gomme
of Ieniper made in poulder, and of the same is liquid varnish made, in
boiling the said gomme in the Oil of line, and of this poulder do Scriveners
use to cause that the ink run not abroad, and that the letter be the
fairer and cleaner. Now for to make a poulder of like effect, and very fair,
with less cost, and without any evil savour, take Egg shells what quantity
you will, taking away the little skin within side: and when you have grossely
stamped them, put them in a panns that will endure the fire, covering it
with some cover, then set it in some glasiers or potters furneis, or in a
brick, tyle, or lyme makers kylle, leaving it there until all the shells be
come into a very white poulder, which is called Egg lyme: syfte it, and keep
it. And when you will occupy it, caste a little of it upon the paper, or
parchement, and spread the poulder well upon it, rubbing it well with a Hares
foot, or otherwise then taking away that is to much, write upon it, and you
shall find it of better effect then the vernix. When the writing is dry, if
you will take away the said poulder, yea the common varnish, for fear
least men should white their hands, rub the paper or parchement with
crommes of white bread, for it will draw to it self, and take away all the
varnish or poulder that is upon it.

To make ink to rule paper for to write by, wher^ of the writing being dry,
the lives may so be* taken out, that it shall seem ye have written without
lines.
TAke Paragon stone, stamp and bray it well, then take the bygnesse of a little
nut, of the fayreste tartre or lees of white wine, calcined and burned,
setting it to steep and dissolve in a dyshful of clear water, and than
strain it out. And with this water you shall temper the black poulder of the
Paragon stone, until it become like ink, with the which you shall rule your
paper, or parchement: and write upon those lines what you will with common
inck. And when the writing is dry, for to take out the said lines, you shall
take harde crommes of white bread, and rub your paper over with them, and
the lines that you have ruled, will go out, as clean as though there had
never been line at all. This is a goodly secrete, and very rare.

THE Secretes of the reverend Master Alexis of Piemount.
THE SIXTE BOOK.
To sublime Quick Silver, that is to say, to make common sublyme, that
Goldsmiths, Alebemistes, and Gentil women do use, and that men use in many
things concerning Phisycke.
TAke a pound of Quick Silver, and put it in some vessel of wood with a
little Vynaygre, and Salt Peter, than bray it, and mortify it well with a
wooden pestell. Than take half a pound of come salt, four vnces of Salt
Peter, and let all this be well brayed, and put upon the Quick Silver in the
same vessel of wood, styringe well all together, putting to it two pound
of Roche Alome burned. Incorporate well all this together, and put it in a
violle, or some pot, luted and clayed a finger higher then the substance
within is. Then put it, and dispone it, in a pan or scillet, upon sisted
ashes: than set the said pan on the furnes, setting the Limbecke upon the
violle or pot luted, and then the recipient, to receive that distelleth out,
as men do in all manner of distillations. Make to it at the first a slow fire,
until all the moisture be drawn out, which you shall take out of the
recipient, and keep well, for it will be good for many things, and specially
for to mortify other Quick Silver, to make other sublime. This done, make
your fire greater, and continue it so, until you see Mercury or Quick Silver,
to be sublimed thoroughly white, that is to say, that it be risen above al the
substance, and made as it were a white cake. And if you will make it higher,
that is to say, unto the neck and brim of the violle or pot, then take a
sheet of paper, and wrap it round about the violle or pot, that is to
say, about the body of it that is uncovered above the furneis: then increase
your fire, and make it greater, and this white cake will rise by little and
little, and will cleave to the brim of the pot, remaininge there like a
little be^e of white sublime, then let it cool. Than take of the recipient,
and lift up the Limbecke, making the pot clean without side, to the intent
that when you break it, there fall no filth among the said sublyme. This done,
break the violle or pot and in taking of the sublime, you must keep it from
the smoke, and in this sort you may make a loaf or cake of a hundred, or two
hundred pound, or as much as you will, kepinge always the proportion of the
quantity of the things, according to the weighte here above written. The
lees that remains in the bottom of the said pot or viol, may be stamped
and dissolved in boilinge water, and than strain it, and let it sees, and
than dry thoroughly: there will remain in the bottom a salt, which will be
of the nature of the Salt Peter, of the common salt, and of the Alome that you
did put in. And the said salt will be very good to make other new sublime,
with other Quick Silver, and vinaiger: or else in stead of Vynaigre you may
take the foresaid water that distills in the sublimation, and so shall you
make it very perfect. And you must note, that the said sublime, made with
Roche Alome, is better for gentlewomen, that will paint their faces with
sublime. But I counsel them, that in stead of sublime, they use some of the
waters that I have spoken of in the books before. For Goldsmiths,
Alkemistes, and for many things required in Physic, it is better to put in
raw Vitriole, in stead of burned Alome: but this is very evil and hurtful for
gentlewemen: for, the most part of them that make sublime, make it with
Vitriole partly because it is made with less cost, and partly because it is
profitabler for many things, the made with Alome, which is almdost for
nothing but for gentlewemen. There be some naughty personnes that put
Arsenic Cristallyne to distille with Quick Silver, a thing practised of to
many men. Wherefore it is good and profitable to admonyshe every man that he
take heed, for certainly, in respect of a little gain, they make them
selves worthy to be burned quick: for besides that men se oftentimes, that by
such sublyme women have their faces swollen withal, like a bladder blowe^,
also it may happen that in Physic they hurt or kill men The said sublime
made with Alome and Vitriole, may easily be sublimed a new, that is to say,
for every pound of this sublime, to put to it half a pound of common white
salt, or burned Alome, or vnsleaked lime, in setting this to sublime, as
before: the which will sublime it self much sooner, and will wax fairer, the
oftener you sublime it. The Alchemistes, following the precepts of Geber, of
Saint Thomas, and other Philosophers, go about and spend time to sublime it
diverse times for to make it firm, among whom there be that sublime it a
hundredth times, and other some two hundredth times, and yet at the end bring it
to none effect: and that comes, because that always they put in, in
subliminge the said lecs, that is to say, the salt, alome, or vitriole, as
we have said. And seeing that the nature of the fire is to fix and make firm
things that soon flit away, the oftener the said sublime comes to the fire,
the more doth it fasten at every time, but that part that is fastened, is
always mingled with the said lees, and so is lost: Therefore they which made
the said sublimation, not considering the reasons and causes why such a
thing happens, found that by little and little their sublime was
diminished, and (peradventure) thought it had flown away, or else consumed
in the fire, rather than to believe that it remained in the said lees, from the
which it can in no wise be separated. Now minding philosophicallye to
proceed in the fasteninge or fixinge the said sublyme, you must first sublime
it three or four times, with common salt, burned Alome, lime, or Talchum, as
is said to the intent that in this wise it may be mondified, and cleansed from
all earthy and unclean substance, that it conteyneth, and frome the
superfluous moisture, whereof it is full. It is mondified and made clean of
the earthy substance, because the earth sublimeth not, but remains in the
bottom of the viol or pot, cleauinge with the grounes, which is the Salt,
Alome, or Vttriole that is put in it, the which things we call here lees or
dregs, because they remain in the bottom, as the lees of wine, or of Oil
doth. Also it is pourged of the aquositie, or superfluous moisture, two manner
of ways. The first is, because that with the same, or distilled water,
wherewith it was watered, as we have said before, the moisture or watrinesse of
the said Quick silver distills out in a vapour. The other is, because of the
oft subliminge it, the nature of the fire is annexed unto it, which
diminishes it, the which two things are the principal cause why it
fastens. And so are they the only parts that make the perfyt fixion or
fasteninge, according as they are sufficiently joined with the things that
you will fasten or fix. And here we mean no other thing, by the thing fixed
or fastened, but that the fire hath made such a decoction, that it danisheth
not away, or is lightly carried away with the wind, and that all the
substance remains in the bottom, and consumes no more.

Therefore, after you have sublimed it three or four times, and that it is
well pourged of the carthye substance, and of the superfluous moisture, as is
aforesayed, you shall set it to sublime a part by it self, without any
grownes or lees, and shall sublime it so often, until all remain fixed to the
bottom of the violle or pot, and that it fly not away nor diminish for
any great fire that you make.

But if you will make it in less space, and easier, observe this rule, which
is certain and infallible.

When you have sublimed it three or four times, or oftener, you shall add to
it the fourth part of fine silver calcined and burned, as we will afterward
declare: than after you have mixed it well together, set it to sublyme: and
when it is sublimed, mingle that which is risen up, with that that remains
in the bottom, then sublime it again, and so, so often that it rise up no more
but remain in the bottom for al the vehemence of the fire, and so shall it be
perfect, very white, clean, fusible, and penetratiue or pearsinge. And he that
would make a good quantity of it, and is not hable to put to it as much
fine silver, as the fourth part of it, he may make it in this manner folowinge.
After he hath sublimed it three or four times, with the grownes or lees, as is
aforesaid, let him keep it by it self, and take a little of it that is to
say, as much as for to join or put with the fourth part of fine silver, that
he should put to it, as in example. If he have but half an uncle of Silver, let
him take an uncle of the said sublime, and when he hath mixed it together, let
him sublime it as often as before, until all remain fixed in the bottom, and
he shall have two vnces, or little less of sublime fixed: for the fire in
dryenge it, and making the decoction, cateth and consumes some part of it,
beside that consumes in stampinge, and in the vyole or pot. Than let him
take these two vnces fixed, or as much as is of it, with three times as much
of sublime not fixed, that was kept, and then let him mingle all together, and
sublime it as oft as before, until al be fixed. And if he will make more of it,
let him take again three parts of the other sublyme: and so shall he make it
as often and as much as he will, which is much better then to make it all at
once, for by this means is volatile fixum, and fixum volatile oftener made,
which is that, that the philosophers esteem most, and is also more fusible,
more pearsynge, and of greater virtue. In this operation consists all all the
secrete, and the greatest maistry of the Philosophers, and chiefly of Geber,
who makes the most part of his work in this manner of subliminge and
firinge often times, and only keeps the thing secrete that must be
sublimed, the which thing because he will hide it from them that be not
worthy to know it (as him self affirms) he calls it Quick Silver, but he
means another thing, although in effect the same thing declares that it
is but quick silver, but brought from his nature unto a perfecter degre, as for
example. Dow, is meal, not in his first essence and being, but is redact and
made of the baker, into a more estimable nature, and nearer to perfection. No
man ought to hope to attain to this high knowledge, by his own wit, but
only by the grace and gift of God, who (as all the Philosophers say) Cui
vult largitur, subtrabit.

To make Cinabrium, and thereof to make loaves of a hundredth or two hundredth
pounds, as great as a man list as those are that come out of Almayne, which
secrete hath not before this time been known of any in Italy.
ALl those that delight in secretes, and principally in things belonging to
metalles, know howe to dress Cinabrium, but in a small quantity, as a pound
or two at a time, and not past. In Germanye, and some parts of France, there
be that make it in great lompes, or masses, and send it so into Italye, and
over all the world, and yet keep it marvelous secret to them selves, without
publishing it unto many men. Therefore we will also communicate this secrete
(although it consist in a small thing) to the glory of God, and the profit of
the common wealth, reaching here in a brief manner, to make it in as great a
quantity as a man will. Take of Quick Silver nine parts, Brimstone citrine
two parts, yet many men put three parts of Brimstone, for the nine parts of
quick silver, other four, and some as much of the one as of the other. But
when it is for to paint with, there cannot be to much Brimstone, for there
comes the livelier colour of it, and for other things it is better that for
one poud of Quick Silver, there be but three or four vnces of Brimstone.
Put then the Brimstone in some large pan, melting it with a slow or small
fire: when it is molten, take the Quick Silver in a linen cloth, in your
left hand, and wring it little and little into the said Brimstone (which
must first be taken from the fire) and mingle it with a stick, to the end the
quick silver may incorporate it self well with the Brymstone, not ceasing to
stir it, and to loose it always from the pan, until all be well cooled,
and you shall have a black mixture, which shall be neither like the
Brimstone, nor quick silver. Stamp this mixtion, and bray it well, and sift
it, and of this poulder you may make what quantity you will, putting it in a
great pan. Now if you will dress the Cinabrium, you shall take a violle of
glass as great as you will, yet see notwithstanding that ye fill the said
violle but a quarter full with the substance that you shall put in it. And
after having well luted and clayed the violle, with a clay or paste made with
white clay, and the shearinge of cloth (which men call Lutum sapientiae, as
we will show you hereafter howe to make it perfectly) and when it is well
dried, put in as much of the said poulder, as will fill a quarter of the
said violle, or less, and without closing up the mouth of the said
vessel of glass, ye shall set it upon a great furneis, if you have much
substance, than make under it a flight and slow fire, the space of two or
three hours, and afterward somewhat greater. But for to make a great
quantity of it, you must ever and anon, put in of the said poulder,
leaving so styll the said vessel of glass upon the fire to sublyme: then
take a stick made meet for the purpose, that may reach to the bottom of
the said vessel, and be more then a handefull without, and have also upon
the stick a round lump of the said Lutum sapientiae, to the intent that
the said stick so being put into the viol, it may close the mouth of it, and
that when the stick rises up, the piece of Lutum sapientiae, may also rise
withal, and open the mouth of the said violle. You must have also made
ready, and settled, a fonnell (such as they fill hogs heads of wine
withal) which must have always the neck of it within the mouth of the
vyolle, and that the stick may go thorough the middle of the funnell, that by
that means, it may stop the strayte of the funnell, with the mouth of the
violle.

All these things thus set in order, you must keep the said poulder nyghe
unto the fire, to the intent that it may be hoate: for if you should put
it in cold, upon the hoate that is in the Violle, you should make cold, and
let the sublimation of the Cinabrium.

Now, when the first poulder hath been on the fire, the space of five hours,
and that it is thoroughly, or partly sublimed, lift up the stick a
little, that is in the pot, and so open the mouth of it, in lyftinge up the
round piece of clay that stopped it, and put in three or four sponefulles
of the said poulder that you kept warm, then let down the stick, with
the round buttonne of clay, that it may close the vyolle, as before.

And you must understand, that the said stick is not put into the violle
for any other cause, but to keep that the said poulder which is in the
bottomme, beginning to sublyme, should not cleave round about the mouth of
the violle, for than it would stop it so, that you could put none other
poulder into it, nor make the loaves so great, as is said: and herein
consists the whole Secrete to make the loves great. For if you would put
in all the substance at once, that is to say, a hundrethe, or two hundredth
pound of substance, you should make the mass, or lump so great, that it
would never be brought to perfection, and must make so great a fire to it,
that rather it would melt both the vessel, and also mar the furneis, than
the matter or substance would sublyme.

But in putting it in thus by little and little, the stick being in the
middle, all the substance sublimeth, bakes, and waxes red, and by little
and little, sticks to the highest part of the vessel, then, in putting to
it again new poulder, it descends to the bottom, and there finding all
things hot, with that that it is hot it self, and in a small quantity it
sublimeth, bakes, and waxes red incontinent, incorporatinge it self with
the first. So in putting in, by little and little new hot poulder, and
keeping always the fire in one state, you shall make as great a quantity of it
as you will, and shall have very great loaves of fair Cinabrium, the which will
have only a hole in the middle, which is the space where the stick went
thorough. Finally, you may put to it new poulder in taking away the stick all
together, and closing the mouth, and than make a fire: for this last poulder
will likewise sublyme, and will make a bottom to the lofe of Cinabrium,
Moreover, note and understand, that the great fire, that is to say, long
continued and kept, hurts not, and now and then you must move, and lift up
and down the said stick, to the intent that the Cinabrium cleave not to it,
and stop so the mouth of the vessel, that you can put no more fresh
poulder to it, as is said. This is the sure, and perfect way and mean howe
to make Cinabrium in as great loaves as you will, which hitherto hath not
been known in Italye. You may do the like in pots of potters clay white,
so that they be well luted and clayed over, that they may endure the fire,
and not break.

To fine and renew Borax.
BORAX was called of the ancient writers Chrisocolla, and was both natural
and artificial, as Plini, Dioscorides, and other write, and men did use of it
in Physic, and also to sowder Gold and Silver, and other metalles, as men use
yet now a days: for the nature of it is to melt, and to resolve quickly
any souderynge. It is used in work also for to make a body, that is to say,
to gather together the fylynge of Gold and silver, and in all other things,
wherein a man hath need of a quick and sudden foundinge or melting.
Moreover, gentlewemen help them selves also much with it to make them
fair: for it makes the skin very white, fine, and clean, without danger
of any poison, or of hurtinge the teeth, or flesh.

The ancient men of old time had of it grene, whereof now a days is none
found, nor yet any man makes it. Mary, we have that is very white, and
alsoo somewhat black, which peradventure a man may say is like their grene.
The white is in little lunge pieces, with certain synewes or veins all a
lunge, so like unto Roche Alome, that many are deceived, or deceive other with
it: For when a man sets the said Borar upon the fire, it boils, and
swells up in all points like Alome, and so remains white, and full of
hoales like a sponge, and easy to be broken with your hands, even as Roche
Alome burned. But subtyle and crafty merchants know Borax from Alome three
manner of ways. The first is, that Alome put in a mans mouth is eygre and
sharpe of taste, and restraintife, but Borax hath no manner of taste, but a dead
and unsavoury guste, as a mean between the savour of Oil, and whaye of Milk.
Therefore they that will deceive other, and falsify the true Borax, take little
pieces of raw Rocfe Alome, and keep them in Oil of Almondes, in why, or in
milk. Some other put to it also honny, or sugre, for to moderate the
eygernesse of the Alome, with the sweetness of it. Other there be, that melt
all the said things on the fire, and than set them to cool in some cold
place, vntyl all be waxen into ye, or little stones, and putting to it Salt
Peter, Sal alcali, Tartre, Alome de fece, and such like things, and make
little stones somewhat like unto Borarx but first they differ in form and
fashion, for the true Borax is always lunge in form, and the stones where
Alome is among, are never brought into any form, but into little square
stones. Furthermore, they differ in the second sort, and that is this: That
Alome being burned, makes a greater lump, then when it is raw: but the true
Borax is brought and reduced into a very small quantity, and this is an
evident sign to know it. The third, which is of most importance and the
sureste, is, that the matter wherein the Alome is, will not souder in no manner
of wise, and will not melt neither, so well as the Borax will. I say, it will
not melt so well, because that where any Salt Peter, Tartre, and Sal alcali
is, there the matter will melt, at the least in some part: for all the said
things help to the foundinge of metalles. The Salt Peter, when there is a
good quantity of it, is known incontinent upon the fire, for it makes the
boiling wateryshe, and casts about, as it were little sparks of fire.

The other things made with the foresayed mixions, divers times, in whaye,
milk, or in water, and congeled into little pebbles, make certain stones, but
they be always salt, to bright, and to violent to melt: for when a manne
will souder any work of Gold, or thin Silver with it, it causes the work
to melt together, and where as there is Sugre, it leaves the Gold and Silver
spotted. Men make other mixtures, which are very good for to souder, or to
melt, which nevertheless are different frome the Borax in form and
savour, of the which we will make mention hereafter.

Now, for to return to the true Borax of our time, men bring us certain
barrels full, of a kind of grease, full of certain little pebbles, which is
called the dow or paste of Borare. Unto this day men have brought it out
of Alexandria, where it was alsoo of old time made: and therefore is it that
the ancient Arabian Anthones, which have written of things concerning
mettalles, called the Borax Nitrum Alexandrinum. And within these few years,
they have begone to bring it frome the West parts, yet I can not tell
whether it be made there, or else peradventure it be brought lately out of
the Indes. There was within these few years so great lack of it in Italye,
that it was sold at the least, for a crown an uncle, of that, that was made
into stones. And now, within this two year, there is come such hahoundaunce
out of the West parts, that the pound is worth but a crown and a half,
and less.

The way howe to make it (which is used in the said West parts) is thus. In
Mines, where Gold and Silver, or Copper is gotten, is found a kind of water,
which (as I my self have seen and proved by experience) is of it self very
neet and excellent for to souder or to found with. And also I know a place
in Germanye, where there is a great vein of such water, which
notwithstanding, the paysauntes know not of. Now, they take this water, with
the earth that is underneath it, or on the sides, and boyle it a certain time,
and than strain it, and so leaving it, it congeleth into little pebbles, even
like unto Salt Peter.

And therefore if a man should keep them lunge so, they would not continue,
but would resolve by little and little: Also for to make them better, and to
preserve the, and norishe them in their own nature and kind, they take the
grounds or dregs that is left of the said water, earth, putting to it
barrows grease, or the grease of some other beast: than they goo to the mine,
where they make a great hole in the ground, in the bottom whereof they lay a
rank of the said grease, upon that a rank of the said little pebble stones,
and than again another of grease, and so consequently as much as they will, but
so that the last rank be of grease, or of the said dow or paste, and so
they leave it open and uncovered, the space of certain months: yet many of
them do all this within their houses, in the earth, or in great vessels.
Than, when they will sell it, or send it out of the country, they take the
said paste or dow, with the stones and all, with a fire pan or some like
thing, and fill barelles and tonnes of it. Alexis speaks of Italy, and not
the translator of England.
This is the same that comes unto us, which we call dow or paste of Borax.
It is sent also from the country where Borax is made, or little stones of the
said paste, so renewed and fined as I will show you. About thirty year ago
they sent much more of this Borax, fined and renewed, than they did of the
paste, because that in Italye they could not dress nor make it, nor bring it
into little stones, wherefore it was not put in ur, but of certain women in
distillations, for to paint them selves with. Since there hath ben one in
Venise that began to dress it, and after him a woman whom he had taught. These
two gat a great sum of money, and the said secrete was lunge between them
two only, although it was desired of every man lunge before. Finally, it is
now come so far forward, that many men in Venyse can dress it, but one
makes it far better, then another, and peradventure very few have the
perfection of dressynge it, with such adnauniage that he loose nothing of the
substance, and to make as much of it as is possible perfectly, as I will
show you hereafter following. Now, you must take first of the said paste, that
is not mouldy, vinewed, or putrified, for than it is a sign that it should be
old, and of many years, and thereby the little stones should be diminished,
lost, or decayed. Yet nevertheless this is of no great importance: for it is
better to assay with your finger within the past, to se if it be full of the
said pebbles, for the world being all together given to gain, and full of
deception and fraud, they that make it, put sometime very few pebbles in the
said grease, for to have more substance: and beside this, they that bye it to
sell again, take out also a good quantity of the said pebbles: wherefore it
is necessary to be circumspect, to the intent that diligence may surmount,
or at the least discover the gile and deceate. Fynallye, if you will fine and
renew the said Borax from such paste or dow, do thus. Take water luke
warm, that is to say, for two pound of paste, half a payle full, which
you shall put into some earthen vessel, putting the paste into it, than with
your hand fray and stir it in sonder, as you would temper leaven for to
kneade, after this, strain out the said water well thoroughe a straynoure,
and take the little stones that remain in the said vessel, that is to say,
those that be of the bigness of a Walnut, or bean, and put them in a vessel,
sprinklinge them with Oil Olyue, as though it were a salade, but the Oil
must be white: and if you have none good, take common oil and set it in the
sun, purging it well, and annointe the said stones with it, mingling them
well together with your hand. Afterward put them in a little bag, and mix
them well together again, as men do confitures, this done, put them in
little boxes, and keep them, and thus shall you have the best Borax that can
be possible. If you will renew and multiply it, do thus. Take the same water
that was strained out, and put it in a kettle upon a small fire, keeping the
fire always in one estate, than scymme it with an iron ladle, and put also
with the scum, the ordure and filth that shall be in the bottom: but take
good heed, that in seething it fly not away. Continue thus dooinge until it
be well sodden, which is known thus: put a little upon your nail and if it
run not, it is enough sodden, or else you may prove it upon a paper, as men do
Syrops, and if it bide still, it is sodden, or wet a stringe in the said
water, and hold it betwixt your fingers, than pluck it out by the end,
and if you feel it rough, it is sodden. Then take the kettle from the fire,
and cover it with some cover fytte for it, that there fall no ordure or filth
in it: this done, bury the kettle in wheat bran, and close it well round
about, covering it with clothes or other things, so that it be well stopped.
You may bury it, or hyde it in a hot dungehyll, and leave it there the space
of eight or ten days, and afterward uncover it, and you shall find crust
upon it, the which you shall take and put in on one side, and you shall find
in the said kettle, as it were little pieces of ice, which you shall take
out, and put in another vessel, wasshinge them with cole and fresh water,
than dry them upon a table in the shadow, and let those stones which at
the first time remained in the straynoure, be mingled with the said pieces of
ice. Than take Alome de fece, that is white, four pound, in three payles full
of water, three vnces of Salt Peter, than boyle this with a small fire, and
scymme it, as you did the other, in prouinge it upon your nail, or upon paper,
if it be sodden, as before. This done, take it from the fire, and let it rest,
and when it is clear, take a little payle full and a half of it, and set it on
the fire in another clean kettle. And when you see that it will boyle, put in
the said crust, and that it be of ten pound, and make it sees as the
other did, essayinge upon your nail or paper, as you did before. Than put it
in a little virkin, and lay two sticks a cross, with four cords, whereunto
you shall tie a little lead, to the intent they may stretch well, and without
touching the bottom, by four fingers, and that to the end the Borax may
stick and cleave to it, and than bury it as before. This must not be put int
the bag, but anoint the same that you find sticking upon the cords with a
feather, and the other that remains still in the vessel, you shall sprinkle as
it were a salade. The clear that you shall take out of it, must be of the
biggenesse of a hasell nut or bean: and the other will be less, you shall put
into the water that remains, which water you shall set on the fire, making
it sees, and doing as before, and so continue until all the water be
converted and turned into Borax, so that nothing be lost. And remember (at
the beginning when you dissolve in luke warm water, as we have said before)
to put to it the bigness of a ciche peas of the ruen of a Hare, for that will
make all the other parts of the Borax to cleave and take together.

A good and easy way to make Aqua fortis, better then any other.
TAke Roche Alome and Vitriole, or salt peter, or else all three together, of
each of them like quantity, that is well calcined and burned, and well brayed.
And if you will have it stronger, put as much salt Peter a part, as of Alome
and Vitriole together: put all this in some pot or violle, well luted and
clayed over, and in the recipient or receptorie two vnces of well water, for
every pound of the said substances. Let the receiptorye be in fresh water,
and always wet above with some wet linen cloth, so that it be never dry.
And by this means the exhalations or fumes will better mingle them selves with
their water, and will not stick or cleave to the recipiente. This done, take
the pot or violle luted, and trim it so that the mouth hang downward,
joining it with the recipiente, without a Limbecke, luting and claiyng well the
ioynctes and sides with flower, and the whites of Eggs: and dispose and order
it in such manner, that the fire come not to the recipient. And at the
beginning put a few hot coals under the bottom of the vyolle or pot,
until the matter loose and dissolve it self, and pass his first fury. This
done, cover it with coals, and the fire must be very high: and for to do
best, there must be little walls of brick to hold up the great coals, in
great quantity upon the said pot. When you have made this great fire, the
space of three or four, or six hours, all will be made.

Than let it cool, and take out the water, which is very good and perfect, and
keep it in a vessel of glass well stopped with wax.

The true and perfyte practise to caste medalles, and all other workemanshyppe,
as well in brass, as in gold, Silver, Copper, Lead, Tynne, as of Crystal,
Glass, and Marble.
First of all, you must have always the earth or sand ready, wherein you
will fashion and form your work: but because there be divers sorts, and
every man dresses it as he can get it, and as he has skill in making it,
we will put here some of the surest and most parfitest, and of diverse kinds,
to thend that if a man can not get or make the one, he may evermore have
recourse to the other. And understand, that all these that we will put here,
may be set a work each of them by them selves, or mixed one with another, or
all together, for they are good every way. The bounty and perfection of each
of these earths for to cast any mettle in, consists in these things, that
is to wit: that first and chiefly it be fine and small, and in no wise
rough, or full of grommels, to the intent that all things may easily take
print. Secondly, that they receive the metal well, and that they neither
cleave, break, chappe, or wax into a crust. They must also be tempered with
a water called Magistra, (of the which we will speak afterward) to the
intent that being dry, they may be harder, and hold faster together.
Thyrdelye, that they may continue, and serve at diverse foundinges and
meltinges, to the intent that when you will caste many medalles, or other
things all of one sort, ye need not at every time make new moulds. Also
you must understand, that for metalles that are soft, as Lead, and Tynne, all
earth, so it be good, will suffice: Provided always, that it be fine and
small, and well tempered with the said Magistra, as I will declare here after.

The first earth to caste in a mold all manner of fusible matter.
TAke Emerill, that men burnishe swords or armour with, and bray it very
small, in flaming it, as we will show you afterward, and temper it, or
reduce it into dow or paste, with the said Magistra, as I will tell you
hereafter, and so dressinge it, you shall make a very good earth, which will
continue for many foundinges and meltinges, so that it be well governed and
tempered, and the more it is occupied, the better it will wax: Provided, that
it be always brayed a new, and than watered and tempered with the Magistra.

The second earth or sand.
TAke pieces of those vessels, or pots of earth that are made in Valentia
in Italie, or other that glassemakers use to keep their molten glass in the
furnesse, and if you may only get the bottoms, or the pieces from the middle
to the lower: most part of them, it shall be the better, in taking away the
glass that is round about them, if not, take them as you may. Than take
Goldsmiths crosettes, or melting pots, new, and break them in pieces,
and that the weight of the said crosettes be as much as the pieces of the
said vessels before. All these things being first beaten and stamped in a
mortar, let them be well brayed after upon a Porphyry stone, with water, as men
bray colours, and having made them very fine and small, by seethinge them
again on the fire, as we will after declare, keep them in little goats
leather bags, or in some cloose boxes, to the end that because of their
fineness they fly not, and vanisshe away in the air.

The third earth, or sand.
TAke the filinge of iron, sand, or iron oore, or the sparks that fly from
hoate iron when it is beaten, or else all together: but that it be pure
without any earth or filth: than put it in an iron pan, or in some other
vessel that will endure the fire, sprinklinge it with strong Vinaigre, and
keeping it on the fire the space of eight hours, after this temper it again
in Vinaygre, and then incense, and heate it in the fire, brayinge and renewing
it diverse times, as the other. And keep it in leather bags, or in boxes well
stopped.

The fourth earth or sand.
TAke pieces of a pommeise stone made hot in the fire, and quenched in
Vynaygre four times. Than take. ii. parts of the sparks of iron brayed and
stamped, one part of the pommeise stone Mingle al together, and put it in the
fire, and bray it often times, and so keep it as the other.

The fyft earth, and the most parfyt.
TAke mutton bones, but if you take those of the head, they will be better, if
not, take of what part so ever it be, and burn the upon the coals or in some
furneis, until they wax very white: than stamp them, and sift them. This
done, you shall put the poulder in some iron pan, or other thing, among the
coals, so that it may burn well, than put to it a good handful of tallow,
styringe it with some iron, in such wise, that all the tallow may be burned
with the said poulder, leaving it so on the fire yet half an howre. Than
take it out and bray it, and burn it again, sprinklynge, and brayinge it
often times as you did the other, until it be very fine and small, and than
shall it be perfect, and will serve for many foundinges or meltinges.

The syxte earth.
TAke Cuttle bones, and burn them in the fire, until they be very white, and
use the in all things as you did the mutton bones, and than keep it as
before. Fynallye, there is also earth made of the ashes of Vynes, of straw, of
burned paper, of horse dung, dried and burned, of brick stamped, of Boale, or
of red earth, or other like things that remain in the fire without
melting, wherein men print very well all manner of metal, the which also
neither break, cleave in sonder, nor chappe, as is aforesayed.

A goodly way and manner howe to make all these earths very fine, and small,
and almooste impalpable.
TAke which of these foresaied earths you will, or any other, and after you
have well stamped it, and syfted it, dry it in a kettle by the fire, or in a
fryenge pan, or other vessel, until it be very whoate: than take it frome
the fire, and stamp it well, as before, with water or Vynaigre, heate it
again, and bray it stylle with water, or Vynaygre, and never dry: doyng so
five or six times. Fynallye you shall put it in a vessel of white earth,
well leaded, and power into it as much clear water as will surmount it four
fyngars high: than stir it with a little clean stick, and let it rest
the space of an Aue Maria. Afterward pour the said water finely and wisely
into some other vessel that is clean: And upon the said earth that remains
in the first vessel, you shall power other water, and styre it as before:
than power the same with the other first powered out, and thus do so often,
until that with the water, you have poured out all the finest and smalleste
part of the same earth. And if there remain yet in the first vessel any
part of gross earth, bray it a new, and than put it with the other. This
done, you shall let all the same fine and small earth, which you poured into
the other vessel, go down to the bottom: and than power out fair and
softly the water, and let the poulder dry that remains in the bottom, the
which afterward you shall bray well once again, and pass it thorough a fine
sieue or sarce of Silk, if you think good, and you shall have a poulder,
such as there is not the like, which you must keep, as the other before, in
leather bags, or in boxes of wood well stopped, pastynge or gluing the
sides, to the intent that the poulder fly not away, for it is a substance
almoost as fine and as subtyle as the air.

To make a water called Magistra, wherewith the said earths to make moulds
is tempered, and moysted again at every casting and foundinge.
TO cause that the said earth be fast and firm, and that being fashioned
and dry, it may hold together, and not fall again into poulder, you must
make this water, which is called la Magistra, which is a word, not known
frome whence it is deducted, as the Philosophers have forged and given names to
certain waters, according to the effect that they serve for, as they have
done of this water. And it seems that they meant by this, the same thing
that we understand by the mean or way, or such a thing, that is a mean or
way to keep together or to dissolve, or to do some like thing: thus it is
made. They take common salt, the which they wrap in a linen cloth wet in
water, or other liquor, and being so lapped up, it is laid in the middle of
the embers in a furneis, or in some other like place, to the intent that with
a^payre of bellows they may give it always a great fire, or else they put
it in some croset, or other small vessel, iuted and clayed, blowing it well the
space of an hour, than they let it cool. And he that will not blow it
always, as is aforesaid, let him lay it in the midst of hot coals, and
yet cover it well with fire, and when it is cool again, be must stamp it,
and put it in a pot well leaded, and put to it as much water as will cover it,
four or six fingars high: than must he set it on the fire, and styrringe it,
he shall make all the said salt to dissolve. This done, it must cool again,
and he strained or passed thoroughe a felt twice: and this is done for to
moist or bain the said earths, and to make them hold together, as we will
declare afterward. Also you may make this Magistra with the whites of Eggs,
beaten with a stick of a fig tree, until they be converted and turned in a
froth or scum, then let them rest the space of a night, and in the morning
pour out the water that is found under the froth. With this water is the
said earth moysted and hayned, and it appears that it is better then other:
for it makes it faster and firmer, and cleaner, nor cleaves so soon unto the
things caste in the moulds: therefore some put a little of this water of
whites of Eggs, with the other Magistra made of salt. Other put to it a
little water of Gomme Arabic, adding in all things judgment, experience,
and industry.

To make Lutum sapientiae very parfytie.
TAke of the best white potters earth that you can get, for in one place there
is better than in another, that is to say, of that which can best endure the
fire, as such as they make pots of in Padua, and likewise in Germany: for it
is of such perfection, that the pots which be made of it, and wherein they
dress their meat, may also serve to found metalles in. Take then of the
best, and specially if it must serve for a thing that hath need to be lunge
upon a great fire, otherwise, take such as you can get. There is found of
it, that is of a gray colour, as the common sort is, and also there is white,
that men use in some place of Vicence, which is like loaves of Gipsum, or
plaster, and is called of the Italians Florette de Chio. We here in Englande
upon the use thereof, may give it what name we will. Potters use of it in
Venise, for to white the dishes, and other things, before they varnish or
polish them. There is also found of it that is red, as in Apulia, where
there is great quantity, and that they call Boale, and is the very same that
some Apoticaries do sell for Boale Armenick, and the Venitians use of it, for
to paint red the forefrontes of their houses, with lime, brick, and
Vermillion, covering it afterward with Oil of line. This red earth is the
fattest, and the clammiest of all the rest, and therefore it cleaves soonest
by the fire, if it be not tempered with some other substance. And because that
all the said earths be to fat, the one more than the other, therefore men
put to them some lean substance. Now, if you take of that of ash colour,
which is most come, and the lest fatty, you may compose and make it in this
manner. Take of the said earth four parts, of cloth-makers floxe or shearing,
one part, ashes that have served in a buck, or other, half a part, dry horse
donge, or the donge of an Ass, one part. If you will make it parfiter, put to
it a few stamped brickes, and sparks of iron: let all these things be well
stamped, and sifted, that is to say: the earth, the ashes, the horse donge,
the brickes, and the sparks of iron: than mingle all together, and make it
into earth, and make a bed thereof, upon the which you shall caste by little
and little, the floxe, as equally as you can. This done, power to it water,
styringe it well first with a stick, and than with a pallet broad at the
end. And when all is well incorporated together, as you would have it, lay
it upon some great board, and beat it well, and that a good space with some
great staff, or other instrument ofyron, mingling and stearinge it well, for
the longer you beat it, the better it is. By this mean you shall have a very
good clay for to lute or clay, and join violles, flagons of glass to still
with, and bottels of gourdes for stilling and other great things, as furnesses
and such like, as we will declare afterward. But he that will make it with
more ease, let him put the earth only, the flox, and the horse donge, with a
few ashes. Some put no horse donge to it, and some no floxe, according to the
purpose that they make it for. For to stop and close up the mouths of
stillinge glasses, or violles, to the intent they take no vent on the fire, the
said clay will be very good: nevertheless men put to it two parts of quick
lime, and the whites of Eggs, and then it will be surer to let nothing vent
out but the glass it self. All kind of clay or earth would be kept moist, and
ready dressed for him that will occupy it continually, but it must not be kept
to watery nor yet left to dry, for than it would serve for nothing, saying
that after it is once hardened, a man can not dress it any more to do any
good withal. And when you put water to it, it is mollified by little and little
above, and is as it were a sauce, but within remains harde, and if you put to
much water to it, you mar it utterly. Therefore, when you see that it
begins to wax dry, feed it a new little and little with water, styringe
it till it be well, and so shall you make it perfect.

Certain things, which he that will take in hand any foundinge or casting
of metalles, must always have ready, and in ordre.
BEcause that instruments and means, be those that make all things come out
of the workman's hand with a perfection, therefore, to the intent that when
the time is come to begin a work, you be not vnfurnyshed, or sustain damage
for lack of things necessary: First, let your coals be of strong wood,
yonge and dry, your crosettes or melting pots without cleftes or chappes,
and of gray colour, which commonly are better than the black, or white. you
must have a little burde to give it vent over the mouth of the croset, which
is uncovered for certain causes: a cane or reed to blow away the ordure and
filth out of the croset, a thing easier than with a pair of bellows: an iron
with a hoke, for to take the coals out of the croset or melting pot, and
likewise a pair of tongues: a press of wood to keep fast and sure the
forms or moulds in pouringe in the mettle: two little tables or more of
walnut tree wood, or box, or of some other harde and massive wood, or else
of copper made very even and equal on every side, for to turn the moulds,
and to keep them steddye: two pieces of wolle, or more, to the intent, that
if in fasteninge the moulds in the press, they be not equal and even with
out side, these pieces may fill up the empty place: a compass and a rule for to
part and divide the casting holes and pipe wherein the mettle must run: an
iron made like a scrapinge knife or rasoure, sharpe at the end, and edged at
the sides, such as gilters do use to make even the casting holes, or pipes of
moulds, the which will serve to make the breathing hooles and pipes that the
vapoure goes out at when the work is made, and having no such instrument,
you may make them with a knife, as handsomely as you can. You must also have
ready a little oil, and turpentine in a dyshe, with a little paper, or some
piece of linen cloth to wet in the said oil and turpentine, and to burn
it, for to parfume the forms and moulds when they be well wiped, to the
intent the metal may run the better. And because that sometime such
parfume fills up the holownesse and engraving of the work, you must have a
hares foot to wipe away the superfluity of it, and also for to swepe
together the dust, to the intent it fall not when you will caste any thing in
the moulds. And than must you have a brush, or rubber of latin wire, and one
of sylke, such as men make clean combs with, for to rub and pollishe the
work, before it is formed and fashioned, to the intent to pollishe it and
dress a new, as need shall be, when the work is caste.

The manner or order that a man ought to keep, wh^re ^e will cast or found
medalles, or any other thing.
First, you shall lay the medalle or other work that you will caste, in a
dyshe with strong Vynaigre, Salt, and burned straw: than rub it well with
your hand, until it be clean: likewise with a rubber, or brush. This done,
wash it in fresh water, and wipe it with a linen cloth. After this, lay
upon a table of hard wood, or of copper well pollyshed, half the mold or
form, that is to say, the female. And let the middle part, that is to say,
that which is joined to the other, be laid upward upon the table, in which
things thus laid, you shall lay your medalles, or the thing you will form
or fashion, and let it be clean, as we have said, ordering it in such
sort, if there be but one, that it be just and directly against the
conduit or pipe, and as lowe in the frame as it may, to the intent that the
pipe or cundite may be the longer, and that it may have metal enough. If there
be more than one, you shall order and set them on the sides of the form or
frame, and leave place in the middle for to make the hole or pipe, to power the
metal in. And if there be more then two, you must beware that one receive not
the mettle of another, but make to every one his little pipe or condite,
which may answer and come justly to the pipe or hole in the middle. Then
take one of the said fine earths, well sifted thorough a fine sarce, and when
you have well brayed it, put it in a platter, or great dish, to the intent
that in handelinge it, there go nothing out, and you shall moist it little
and little, with the water called Magistra, mixinge it well with your hands,
and rubbinge it so lunge between your hands, that wringing it with your
fist, it hold and cleave together, but you must note, that I speak of
moistinge it, and not of thorough wettinge it, for it may not wet your hand in
pressing it, nor cleave unto your hand like past, but tha it only hold
together a little more or less then dry flower or meal, and being so wrong
in your hand, it may break in pieces when you touche it with your fingar. And
having thus brought it to a form, lay it handsomely upon the medals in the
form or mould, with thendes of your fingars, and than with your hand wring
it, and press it harde down, not sparing to press it well, in putting upon
it the other little table, and pressing it down with your hands, as hard as
you can, yea with all your might.

Than with a cutting iron with a right and even edge, and with a ruler made
just and even by line the said forms with the earth, cutting away
handsomely, the earth that passes over the said moulds, and so lay them
upon one of the pieces of wolle, and then the little flat table, then you shall
take with both your hands the two little tables, above and beneth, and holding
them fast together, turn handsomely y^ moulds upside down, and taking of the
table, you shall se under the medals, in lyftinge it up, if there be any earth
entered in, if there be, you must take it away with the hares foot. Then,
setting the other part of the form or mould in his place, you shall fill it
with the same earth, pressing it well, as before, and making it even and
equal with the iron. Afterward, with the point of the iron, you shall lift
up a little, at one of the corners, half the mold or form, and take it of
fair and softly with your hand, and take out the medalles nimbly, touching
them a little round about, with the point of a small pen or quil, if at the
first they will not come out, turning downward that part of the mould wherein
they did stick when you opened it. And if yet they will not come out, strike
them a cross with the point of a knife, until, that turning downward the
moulds, they come out. And if in case they be not well printed, according to
your mind, you may put them again into their place, and press them again:
and having set on both sides the two pieces of wolle, and the tables, close
them in the press. Fynallye, with the said shave, or sharp iron, make the
said pypes or conduits holowe, compassinge them with your compass, and
rule, in such sort, that they come just and equally: than shall you trim
them so against the fire for to dry, turning them sometime, until they be
well dried. Then with a match or wyke tempered or wet in Oil, and
Turpentyne, and being set on fire, smoke it, and if there remain any
superfluous thing, wipe it away with the hares foot. Then join them together
again, and having laid to them the wolle, and tables, wring them a little in
the press, and in the mean time having made ready and molten the metal (if
it be silver, or white copper, it is known by the shining of it, and
clearness in the melting pot: and if it be tin, by casting into it a stone,
or some paper, and that it burn it) you shall cast it, and the thing shall go
well, without any other help or aid, for to make it run, saving that
after the tynne is molten, put in a little, that is to say, a twentieth part of
sublimata in respect of the whole quantity, and one ^ghte part of
Antimonium: for beside that these things make it run well, they harden it
and make it sownde well.

Then the moulds being cold, take out handsomelye the medalles: and when you
will caste other, you must parfume and smoke the moulds again: and then
press them, and so cast your things as before, and do it as often as you
think good. And if you see that the moulds be not broken, and that you will
keep them for another time, you may lay them in a dry place, and they will
keep well. Finallye, the said earth taken out of the moulds, brayed and
sifted, will be always better to serve your turn. The medalles so caste, are
sodden again afterward, and wax white, so that they be not of Tynne. Also
you may give to all these medalles what colours you will, as we will declare
more at large hereafter.

To make a white, to blanch and make white medalles, or other things newly
molten, and also for to renew medalles of old silver.
TAke the medalles, or other things newly founded or molten, or else the old
ones that you will renew, and lay them upon the coals, tourninge them
often, until they wax of a gray colour, than rub them with a brush of
copper wire, putting them afterward in this white colour folowinge. Take
salt water of the sea, or common water salted, with a handful of bay salt,
wherein you shall put the lees of white wine, and Roche Alome raw.

Boyle all this in a pan leaded: and if the work be of copper, made white by
any sophistical substance, you shall put to it these things folowinge, that
is to say, Silver heaten, or Siluerfoile, the weight of a Spanish Real, Sal
Armoniacke, weighing three times as much, Salt Peter the weighte of flue
Realles. All the said things being put in some pot of earth, with a cover
having a^ole in the midst, set them in the middle of the fire, covering it
with ashes and coals up to the neck, and leave it there so, until all the
humours be breathed out, then let all cool again, and beat it into poulder
very small. This done, take an uncle of this substance, or somewhat more or
less, and boil it in the said white confection of the Salt water, only
half a quarter of an howre, putting in the medalles, or other works. Then
pour out this water with the medalles into clear and luke warm water, and
after rub the medalles with the Tartre or lees, and other things that
remain in the pot: and having washed them well with fresh water, wipe
them dry.

To gilt iron with water.
TAke well, river, or conduit water, and for three pound of the same, take two
of Roche Alome, an uncle of Romaine Vitriolle, the weight of a ponny of
Verdegrese, three vnces of Sal gemma an uncle of Orpimente, and let all botle
together: and when you se it boyle, put in lees called Tartre, and bay salt,
of each of them half an uncle, and when it hath sodden a little while, take it
from the fire, and paint the iron with all, than having set it in the fire to
heate, burnishe it, and it is done.

The like another way
TAke Oil of line four vnces, Tartre or wine lees two vnces, the yelkes of
eggs hard roasted and stamped, two vnces, Aleo cicotrinum, an uncle Saffron a
quarter of a dragme. Boil all these things together in a new earthen pot a
good space, and if the oil of line cover not all the said substances put in
more water until there be sufficient, then anoint your iron with this mixtion,
having first burnished it, and so shall you make it of the colour of gold.

To gylte iron with gold foil, and water, or else with gold mixte with
Quick Silver, as goldsmythes are wont to gilt silver.
TAke Romayne vitriole an uncle, roche, Alome, two vnces, salt Armoniack an
uncle: all these things being well beaten in poulder, and boiled in common
water, take your iron well burnished, and wet it with the said water,
rubbinge it well: than lay on your goldefoyle, and let it dry by the fire.
This done, burnishe it with stone Hematite, as men are wont to do, and it will
be very fair. If you will gilt with gold mixed with quick silver, as
goldsmiths use to gilt silver, you shall add to the said water, a dragme
or Verdigreese, half an uncle of Sublimatum, and let it boyle al together, than
put your iron to boyle in the said water: but if it be so great that it can
not go in, rub it with the said boiling water, and heate it, that it may
receive the Amalgam of the quick silver and the gold, the which Amalgam we
have taught you to make in the fifth book, in the chapiter of mingling or
mixinge gold. And when you have heated the iron, gilt it with the same gold
so mixed with the quick silver, and smoke or fume it at the fire with a lamp,
or with Brimstone, as goldsmiths commonly do, or rather with wax, whereof we
will hereafter show you a very good manner and way, and better then that is used
in Germany, or in any place where it hath hitherto ben used.

To die or colour into the colour of brass, or also to gylte Silver, which
shows better, and continues longer.
IT is a thing most certain, that gold set upon white iron or silver, shows
not so fair as upon brass: for as soon as it begins to wear a little, men
may see the whiteness of the iron or silver, which is not so soon secne upon
any red colour. Therefore many practiciens, when they will gylte any
wood, or other thing, lay the bottom or ground (not of red, as the most
part do) but of yelow to the intent that the gold shall not so soon appear
worn, as upon the red, and more upon the white.

The said yellow can not be laid upon iron or silver: but leaving all this
aside, when you will gilt silver, or give a colour of brass unto iron, you
shall do after this manner. Take verdet, or Verdegrise, Vitriol of Almain, and
salt Armoniacke, at your discretion, but let the Vitriole be of a greater
quantity than the other things: put all this well beaten in poulder into
strong Vinaiger, letting it boil half an hour. And when you have taken it
from the fire, while the substances be yet boilinge, you shall put in your
iron that you will colour, covering well the pot with his cover, and with
cloth upon it that it vent not out, and so let it cool, and you shall have
your iron well coloured, of a brazen colour, and thus may you gilt it with
quick silver, as if it were brass. Esteem this as a goodly secrete, and also
profitable.

A water or colour to lay under Diamonds, as well true as counterfeit, that
is to say, made of white Sapphires, as we will declare afterward.
TAke the smoke of a candle, gathered together in the bottom of a basin, and
make it into a dow with a little oil of Masticke: than put the said
mixtion under the Diamond in the ringe, where you will set it.

To counterfeit a Diamond, with a white Saphyre.
THis secrete is known well enough of the Iewellars, that use almoost all one
manner indifferent good: but we (after we have described their fashion) will
show you a way far better. They take a Sapphire of a good white colour, and
set it in the fire in a goldsmiths croset among the fylinge of iron, or of
gold, thinking because it is of great value, that it is better for such a
purpose, but yet the fylinge of iron is a great deal better. They let this
fylinge or rubbysh of iron become almost red, without melting it, and cast
their Sapphire into it, leaving it therein a pretty while. And after they have
taken it out, if the white colour like a Diamond do not like them, they cast it
in again, and so often, till they se it be to their fantasy, than they set it
in a ringe, and colour it as before. Now here follows another way a great
deal better. Take white smalte well beaten in poulder, and mingle it with the
said filinge of Gold, or iron, but so that there be as much smalte as
filinge, then take a little other smalte without fylynge, and make it into
dow, with your spettle, and in this dow wrap your Sapphire, and let it dry
well at the fire.

This done, tie it at the end of a small and fine wire, and leave the other
end so lunge that you may pluck it out when you will. Afterward cover it
with the said filinges, and leave it so on the fire a certain space, until
the filinge be very hot, as is aforesaid, but so that in no case it melt: than
pluck out once your Sapphire, to se if the colour please you, if not put him
in again until it be fair to your mind.

To engross thin Ballesses to set in rings.
IF you have Ballesses as thin as paper, dress them of what greatness or
largeness you will, and take a piece of fine Crystal coloured like a Balls:
then take a great grain of Mastick, the which you shall stick upon the
point of a knife, and heate it well again the fire, and sodaynlye it will
caste out a little drop like the tear of a mans eye, having a lustre like a
pearl, with the which drop, glewe on the said Balls upon the Crystal,
and fear not that it will gather to a lump, or hinder the colour: Then
pollishe it, and give it a lustre, and so set it in gold, and it will be very
fair, and seem to be verily a Balls.

To make Rubies of two pieces, and Emeraudes, as they make them at Mylan.
TAke the drop or tear of Masticke, whereof we have spoken in the Chapiter
before, and if you will make Emeraudes, you shall colour it with Spanish grene
tempered and mingled with Oil, putting to it a little wax, if need be, and
if it be to thick, temper it with water: But if you will make Rubies, take
Gomme Arabic, Alom succarine, raw Roche Alome, as much of the one as of the
other, and let it boyle all together in common water: than put into the said
water some Brasill cut small, and let it sees, putting to it some Alome
Catine so called, because it is boiled in a caudron, of the which the more
there is, the darcker it will be: then take the drop of Masticke abouesaid,
and colour it with the said red. This done, take two pieces of Crystal,
dressed and trimmed with the whele, of what fashion and greatness you will, so
that the piece which you will lay uppermost, be not so great as the other
vnderneth, that is to say, the one dressed upon the other, as the nail upon
the finger, just on every side. After this lay that vnderneth, upon a little
fire pan, or some other instrument of iron on the coals, that the said
Crystal may be very hot, and than touche it upon with the said red drop
or tear, which you shall take upon the end of a stick: but it must be so
hot that it may drop down the better: and when you see that the said piece
of Crystal is coloured enough, you shall take the other lesser piece, that
must be set above, which likewise must be hot, and set it upon the said
drop, and it will conglutinat^ and glue together the two pieces of Crystal,
without causinge any thickness or let unto the lustre of the Ruby, the which
will be clear and bright on every side. Afterward set it in your ringe,
setting to the Ruby the red leaf, and the grene to the Emerauldes, as we
will teach you hereafter how to make the said leaves for all kind of stones,
as well fine, as artificial.

To make a paste or dow for precious stones, as Emerauldes, Rubies, Saphyrs,
and such like, which be but of one piece, well coloured within and without.
TAke potters lead burned, iii. vnces, and put it in as much water as will
cover it a finger or two high: then stir it with your finger, letting it go
down to the bottom. Afterward pour out the water, which will serve for to
wet within side the earthen pot leaded, to the intent that the matter cleave
not to the sides of it, wherein you put all the substance. Than take other.iij
vnces of Vermillion dried, and mingle it with the said lead, then an uncle of
Crystal calcined and burned, or else of a Calcidoine stone, with.xiiij.
or.xvj. carattes at the most, of Rubricke, or sparks of Copper. All these
things well stamped, and mingled together, you shall put in a pot of earth
leaded, well wet within with the said water of the lead: then cover it, and
set it in a glass makers furneis, by the space of three or four days, and you
shall have a very fair paste or dow, the which you may cause to be dressed
with the wheel, as you will. At Venise men bye the stone for a groat or six
pence at the most. And for to make yellow stones, you shall put to it the rust
or rubbish of iron. And to make Rubies, put to it Cynople or red lead: and
in those that be of colours, you shall follow the order that we will teach you
hereafter.

To make Emerauldes, and other stones or Jewels.
TAke Sal alcali, and dissolve it in water, distilling it thorough a felt, and
dry it, then dissolve it again, and dry it so three times, afterward beat it
into poulder: then take fine Crystal; and cause an Apoticarye to stamp and
sift it for you, as they do Crystal prepared. Then take two vnces and a half
of the said Crystal, of Sal alcali, two vnces, Spanish grene an uncle, first
tempered and stieped in Vinaygre, and than strained. The said three poulders,
you shall put in a vessel, as in a new earthen pot leaded, the which pot you
shall lute and clay over, and cover it that it take no vent, then leave it so
clayed and luted the space of three days, the longar the better, until all be
thorough dry. Afterward, you shall put it in a potters furneis, the space
of.xxiiij. hours. Then take the said composition, and dress it as men do
fine stones, and you shall have them excellent. And if you will have Rubies,
put Cinople to it, in stead of Spanish green. If you will have Sapphires, put
to it Lapis Lasuli, But if you will have Iacinthes, you must put in Coral in
stead of green Verderame, as is before said.

To calcine or burn Crystal and the calcidoyne stone, to put in the said
mixtions of precious stones.
TAke Tartre calcined and burned an uncle, and dissolve it in a dish full of
clear water, then strain it out, and take the pieces of Crystal, or
Calcidoin stone, and heate them upon the fire in an iron ladle or fire pan:
than quench them in the water that is in the dyshe: take them out, and heate
them again, and quench them as before in the same water, doing so six or
seven times, and they shall be very well calcined and burned. Then beat them
finely into poulder and put it into the said mixtion. Nevertheless remember, that
if you will make Emerauldes, you must beat ye said substances to poulder in a
brafen mortar: but if you will make Rubies: or other, you must stamp them in
an iron mortar, and beware that they touche not the brass,

A water to harden the said stones.
BEcause that all the said artificial stones are commonly brittle, for to
harden them, do as follows. Take little pieces of Calamita, and calcine them
as you did the Crystal: then beat them into poulder, and put it in a
moyste place, until it be turned and dissolved into water, with ye which you
shall knede Vitriole Almaine, or Romayne, raw, without making it red: then
make thereof a soft paste or dow, or else a syroppe, which you shall still
in a glass or Viol with a crooked neck, or in an vrinal, and with the water
that comes of it, you shall knede barley flower, making a harde past, in the
which you shall wrap your mass of stones, made as is before said, or the
stones self, when they be dressed and fashioned with the whele: then put them,
so wrapped in the same paste, into an oven with a bache of bread, and take
them out with the bread. And when you have taken of the paste, you shall find
your stones harde, as if they were natural. If you se it be need, you may
cover them with the said paste, and bake them again in the oven, and than
shall you have them parfite and harde.

To calcine fine silver.
Saying that we are entered into the matter of calcininge, we will show you
the calcination of fine silver, and than of Talcum, as we have promised before.
There be diverse ways of calcininge silver, whereof we will put here three of the
best. Take fine silver beaten very fine and thin, then cut it in pieces as
big as a Spanish real, or more or less, for it makes no great matter:
then take a croset, or an erthen pot, and lay in the bottom of it a rank
of common salt, not white, nor prepared or trimmed to eat, but even as it
comes out of the salines or salt pan, and it must be stamped very small.
Upon this salt you shall lay likewise a rank of the said pieces of silver,
and then another of salt, and another of silver, and so consequently as lunge
as your silver lasts, in such sort, that the last rank may be of salt,
and that good and thick: then cover all this with a paper, lutinge and
clayinge well the croset, or little earthen pot, and leaving a little hole
in the covering the biggenesse of a goose quill. And when it is dry, cover it
over, and round about, with coals and embers, and leave it in such a fire,
at the least three or four hours: then having taken it out, and all being
cool, open the croset, and take out the pieces of Silver one after another,
making them clean that the salt stick not upon them. And if you perceive
that they be so brittle that you may break them with your finger, like a crust
of bread, it is done made: if not, put them again into the croset or pot,
setting them in the fire as before. And to make it perfectly, you ought to do
this three times or more. This done, make your silver into poulder, and wash it
in a dishfull of hot water, let it sink to the bottom. After, strain out
the water so handsomely, that you lose no part of ye said poulder: or to avoid
al dangers pass it thorough a felt: this done, put other hot water to it,
strain it out as before, so often till you may know by the taste of the water,
that al the salt is purged away. Than shall your silver be well calcined,
diminished of the weight, dried, and become fro his nature into a massif part,
and somewhat like unto gold. Thus will it serve you for diverse things, if you
can dress it well. The like is done with Talcum, in stead of common salt: but
than you need not wasshe it in hot water. Some calcyne it with salt, or
Talcum twelve or.xv. times, and more, to the intent to have it more massive and
sounder, and more commodious to take colour. It may be also done in this
manner, that is to say, to melt the silver in a Goldsmiths melting pot, and
for every uncle of the same, to put in a pound or more of Brimstone stamped,
and that little and little. True it is, that so it will consume more than by
the salt, or Talcum, but it shall be far better if the Brimstone be first
purged in strong lye (that is to say, made with strong ashes, and quick
lime, or such like things.) Now let us come to the other manners of calcininge
silver.

The second manner of Calcininge silver.
TAke Aqua fortis seperatiua, made with Salt peter and Alome, as we have before
declared, then take fine silver, fyled or polished, or beaten into leaves, or
made in small pieces, or grains, that is to say, of the said silver one
part, and of aqua fortis, three parts, and have the said water in a viol:
then put in the said silver, and you shall se it will incontinent begin to
boyle, and that the bottom of the viol will be hot if the water be good. Let
it so boyle, until it boyle nor eat no more, holding still the viol in your
hand, or setting it in some place far from the fire. But if the water be
not strong, you must set it a little to the fire, holding styll the viol in
your hand upon the embers, or else you may set it upon a few ashes, or
upon some little furneis. And when it hath left boiling, and eaten all the
silver, you shall se the water wax green, so that there shall remain no
silver in the bottom, if that the water were well calcined and burned: for
than it would make as it were white lyme at the bottom, or if there were any
gold in the silver, it would make it descend to the bottom in little round
pieces, like pearls, or like sand. Now, after that the said silver is
dissolved, and eaten of the said aqua fortis, you shall take another viol
bigger, or an vrinal, or earthen pot half full or more of well or river water,
whereinto you have dissolved, and have in a readiness a good handful of common
white salt: then let the said water be strained two or three times. This
done, you shall pour the aqua fortis which dissolved the silver into the salt
water, leaving it so the space of.iiij. or six hours: then shall you find at
the bottom as it were a bed of herbs or green rushes, which shall be the
silver dissolved, and the salt aqua fortis, and also a part of the common salt
that you did put in. Afterward distill the said water by a felt, and take the
silver that is so descend to the bottom, and put it in a croset, covering
it well, to the intent there fall no ordure nor filth into it: than bury and
cover it over and over in hot burning embers, covering it well also with
fire, that it may burn the space of.iij. hours or more. Finally, let it cool
well again, and pour the silver out of the croset, into a dishefull of hot
water, stirring it a little together with your fingar, and than let it rest:
and after pour out fair and softly the said water, and put in other, doing as
before, until the water wax no more salt. This done, let the silver dry,
which shall be very well calcined for to serve your turn in any thing that
you will.

The third manner of calcining silver.
YOu shall mix together into dow or paste called Amalgam, one part of silver
leaves, with three or four parts of quick silver, as we have declared in the
fifth book, in the chapter of the manner how to bray gold: then bray this
Amalgam, or paste, with common salt, and set it to the fire until the quick
silver be vanished away, afterward wash it with hot water, so much and so
often, that the water be no more salt, then shall you have your silver
calcined. After this, if you think good, you may bray it again with other
salt, without other quick silver: and then put it to the fire in a croset,
three or four hours, and wash it again, as is aforesaid.

To calcine Talcum quickly out of hand.
BEcause that Talcum is a thing of so great importance, and so much desired
of all good wits, men have found diverse ways to calcine it, the which
teach us that we must put to it twice as much salt peter as common salt, or
raw Tartre with the Talcum, and then put all this in a furneis certain days,
and then to seperate the salt or Tartre, with hot water. Other heate it upon
the coals, and quench it in pysse, and do it often times. Other there be that
wrap it in little white pieces of woollen cloth, and put it in the midees of a
great fire, the space of half an hour, or more, and than they find it
thoroughly molten and all in a light piece, and full of hooles like a sponge, not
much differing from burned Alome. All the which ways, to say the truth, are
nothing worth, nor do not perfectly calcine it, where they corrupt the nature
of the Tartre, and make it become like unto quick lyme, or Alome, or else of
little strength. Now, for to calcine it out of hand and perfectly, you shall
take the Talcum raw and made into little leaves, or stamped as well as is
possible, and than put it in a croset, or in a fire pan among the hot coals.
And when it is very hot, or rather red hot, you shall put to it drop by
drop, distilled Vineaigre wherein Tartre hath ben dissolved, and put thereunto
the third part of Aqua vite, pouring it by little and little upon the hot
lees or Tartre, that is to say, three vnces of Vynaigre for every pound of
Talcum: then take it from the fire, and you shall find it fair and well calcined.
Finally, you shall wash it with hot water, to the intent to seperate the lees or
Tartre from it. It is calcined also, being made in leaves as thin as is
possible, laying them by ranks or beds, with little flat pieces of silver,
in a croset luted and clayed, than put them in a furneis where glass or brick
is made, by the space of four or five days. The like is done also with little
pieces of Tynne.

An excellent and very easy way to gilt iron, copper, and silver, to make it
seem like massyue gold.
FIrst if you will gilt silver, or iron, you must give it the colour of copper,
as we have aforesaid? than take beaten gold, which you shall mix with quick
silver, and make Amalgam or paste thereof, as is said before, and shall put the
said Amalgam in a little dish, upon the which you shall pour the juice of a
fruit called Cucumis asininus, such a quantity that it may be above the said
substances a fingar high. Keep this gold thus prepared and trimmed, and cover
it, to the intent there fall no filth nor ordure into it, which you may use and
occupy when you will. Afterward, the things that you will gilt, must be very
clean, and well polished, then with a pencil you shall give them of the said
gold so prepared with quick silver, and as it were dissolved, rubbing it well
all about. If you will not do so, you may gylte after the common manner of
goldsmiths: yet notwithstanding with gold made into Amalgam, or mixed as is
aforesayed, chafing the work that you will gylte with Aqua fortis, as they
do. Then make the quick silver vanish away, as the goldsmiths of Italy
commonly do, that is to say, with a lamp of line seed Oil, and with Brimstone,
and make afterward a gilt upon the work, that is like Saffron. But I counsel
you to use this manner in the chapiter folowinge, which is partly the same that
the goldsmiths do use, in France and else where, but it is much amended,
and this is it.

A parfyt manner and way to gilt, and to make the quick silver to vanish away
from the thing gilted.
PVt in a pan the rubbish or scum of copper, and the filinge of iron, then
pour upon it strong Vynaigre not distilled, as much as will cover it two or
three fingars high. Let it boyle so the space of an hour, then pour out the
said Vineaigre, and put in other, letting it boil as before, and do thus four
or six times. Afterward make the said Vynaigres put together, to evaporate or
dry up, or else make it distill out, for to have one vynaigre of it, which
will be good for many things. This done, you shall put unto the said poulder
remaining at the bottom, the eight part of Almayne Vitriole, and as much of
Ferrerum of Spain, and the half of an eight part of salt Armoniacke, with a
little Brimstone: then into a little molten wax with a little Oil of line, or
Oil Olyue, you shall put little and little the said poulders well mingled
together. Fynallye take that which you have covered with the said Amalgam of
gold and quick silver, and with a pensyll cover and lay it over well with the
said wax so mixed, than put it, so cyred, in the midst of hot burning
coals, and let it burn and consume all the wax. This done, you shall have
such a gilt, that it shall be like massive gold. And at the end you may
polish it with brusshes of copper wyre and cold water, or you may burnishe it
as you will.
