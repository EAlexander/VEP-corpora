VIRTVS IN ACTA


To the Right worshipful sir William Winter Knight, Master of the Queenes
Majesties Ordinance by Sea, Suruaior of her highness marine causes. c.
William Bourne wishes increase of woorship unto the state of honour and true
felicity.
WHat great commodity and profit Right worthy worshipful Knight, hath always
redownded unto the common weal, and govern ours of the same, which in martial
affairs and warlike discipline, have chiefly delighted and taken great pains
and care in the same, and unto what excellent fame and renown it hath always
brought and exalted unto high dignity, those that have taken upon them, for
their Prince and Countries prosperity great exploits, rather putting them
selves in danger of their lives, then their Prince and Country should be
dishonoured. Then I may say without any objection or doubt, that your woorship
is one: For I my self can witness, and of my own knowledge, know, that no
person in this Land hath such great judgment and knowledge in martial affairs
by Sea, both touching the shipping, for that purpose, and also the provision
for the same, as your woorship hath: and as for your courage, valiantness, and
wisdom, which is not unknown unto the world, whereas I being most simple
have written this base and rude volume, which I do call a Treasure for
Travailers, am so bold to dedicate it unto your worship, not for that the
Book is worthy to be preferred unto so worthy a person, but for my bounden
duetyes sake, to acknowledge my good will towards your worship, for that I
have most largelye tasted of your benevolence towards me, being as a poor
Gunner, serving under your worthiness, hoping that your woorship will take
this simple work in good part: the which work is divided into five Books,
the first is Geometry perspective, the second Book is appertaining unto
Cosmography, the third Book is Geometry general, the fourth Book is
Statick, and the fifth and last Book is appertaining unto natural Philosophie,
as the contents of the matter do appear in the Tables of the Books, hoping
that your worship will take this simple thing, as a true token of my good will
towards you, although the thing it self be but rude simple. And thus, I
cease to trouble your worship any longer, at this time, beseeching the living
God to prosper you in al your affairs, in perfect health, with all your
children and family, Amen.

By your worships at commandment, William Bourne.

The Preface to the Reader.
Considering with my self, gentle Reader, with howe infinite pains and
labour, divers heretofore, men of most excellent wits, and of passing
knowledge, have compiled their Books, and with what heed and circumspectnesse
they have examined and perused their travails, and with what fear and
warynesse they have published the same. and not without good cause why, for
thereby they have opened them selves, their name, and fame, to no small
dangers and harzardes: namely to the view, judgment, and report of all
men. For which cause, now seeing I have taken upon me at this time a harde
enterprise, a burden too heavy for me to bear or sustain, who have at
length showed my self so hardly, as to publish this little Treatise, I being
altogether unlearned, and having no help of any other learned persons, being
of my self altogether destitute both of knowledge and learning.

Wherefore I desire thee, gentle Reader, to bear with my rudeness, and
consider that it is the good will which I bear unto my natyue Country, for to
profit the common wealth, as much as lies in me, although that it be not
learned like, yet I pray thee hold me excused, being altogether ignorant,
lacking the capac^e both of knowledge and eperience (who having taken upon me)
to publyshe this to the scannyng and trying of so many touchestones, and
dangerous crimes, that I being so simple, should enterprise so far to take
upon me to open any Science.

But notwithstanding, I do see, that it is so needful a matter to be known
unto a number of persons, that do desire for to have instructions in those
causes that are contained in this simple volume, the which book I do call A
Treasure unto Travailers, and is divided intoo five Books.

The first book.
And the first book conteyneth the particular conclusions of the Skall
Quardrant or Astrolobe, and in the like manner the particular conclusion of the
Cross staff c. Also the use of the Horizontall or flat Sphere, whereby to
draw or take the plate of any country. c.

The second book.
The Second book doth show unto you, if that you do know the Longitude and
the Latitude of any place truly, then howe to know the distance in miles from
you, or any place assigned, and by what point of the Compass that it is from
you.

And because that London is the most famous and the most principal place here
in Englande, I have have named certain principal places here in Europe, and
also in Africa, and in Asia, and also in America, with some of the
principallest Ilandes in the world, both their Longitude and Latitude, and
their distance from the city of London, and by what point of the Compass that
it is from London, and also how much that the Moon doth change rather or
later, then it doth at the city of London, and what length their longest day
is of. c.

The third book.
The third book is as touching the measuring of Superficials and solid bodies,
and howe to augment them, or diminish them, unto what proportion or bigness you
list, whether that it be the tonnage of any ship, or the bigness of any
kaske. c.

The fourth book.
The fourth book is as touching the Art Statical, as to know the weight of any
ship swimming on the water, and such other like. c.

The fifth book.
The fifth or the last book is as touching the natural causes of sand and rocks
in the Sea, and diverse such other like causes, as it doth appear in the table
of the contents, of the Books. c. The which things, in my opinion, are very
necessary for al manner of persons, and especially unto such as be Travailers:
which causes me to give the book unto name, A Treasure unto Travailers. For
what thing can there be more better unto a Trauayler, either by Sea or by
Land, (Gold Silver only excepted then to know the distances from place to
place, and to have capacity to know the height and the lownes of any thing, how
to make a Plat or Card for any country. c. which is declared in the first
book.

And also how necessary a thing it is for a Travailer to know unto what quarter
of the world any place doth bear from him, what the distauce is thither,
Geometric perspective.
what length the day is of, when he is the^e: as I have known a great number of
persons that have travailed unto sundry places, when they have come home, they
have had no judgment at all, as touching that place that they have travailed
unto, for that they have not known unto what quarter of the world the place
is, that they have been at: neither in respect what the distance is thither.
And these matters are showed in the second book.

And also it is not hurtful, Cosmographia.
but necessary for a Trauayler to know how to measure al manner of
Superficalles, as land, pauementes, board, and Glass, and solid bodies, as
Timber and Stone, and the burden or tonnage of shyps, and the bigness of any
thing.

And furthermore it is necessary for a Travailer in like manner, Geometric
general.
to have a way to get the true weight of any thing that swimmerh on the water,
in like manner to know the weight of any thing that synketh into the water, what
it waigheth in the water, to be lifted fro the bottom unto the superficial
part of the water, as it is declared in the fourth book. And furthermore, it is
very necessary convenient for Travailers either by Sea or by land, Staticke.
to have knowledge in the natural causes of sundry things that are to be seen
in travailing, as the cause of sands banks, as well in rivers as in the sea,
Natural Philosophie.
and the cause of Marish ground and meadows, the cause of cliffs on the sides
of rivers, on the sea coast, with such other like matters, as is declared in
the fifth and last Book.

And now it is possible, that some persons will marvel, that I being so
simple, and not learned, should take upon me to be a medler in these causes,
for that they be matters that do appertain unto learned men. And it is
possible, that it will be disliked of a number of people, as envy dwells
generally in the hearts of most men, for that is the property of many people,
to dislike all things that are not done by them selves, using to read Books
to no other end, but to find faults in them.

Discouragement.
And yet it is possible, that they will do nothing the selves, which were a
cause of discouragyng unto any person that doth write: yet notwithstanding it
shall not discourage me, for that I am utterly unlearned, and therefore it shall
not dislike me, if any learned man doth find any fault therein: for I being
simple and unlearned, it is no discredit for me, either to be taught, or to
have the faults showed unto me. For by that means I may reform the faults,
either by them, or my self.

And furthermore, I do not intende to make any book to teach them that are
cunning learned: But the only cause of my writing of this book is, to instruct
or teach them that are simple and unlearned: And therefore notwithstanding, I
shall the better like of it, Books are written to the intent to teach the
unlearned.
if any learned man should write or set out any book, as touching these
causes, to reform this. And my opinion is this, if that any Book be set
forth unto the common people in the world, that then it is to the end, to
teach the symplest sort of people that are not instructed in learned causes.
But if that it be any high point in learned causes, then it is not for the
common sort of people, but to be in learned men's Libraries, and therefore as it
is not written by a learned man, so in like manner you must not look for fine
or eloquent school terms, but even to take the substance of the matter rudely
as it is, and more to regard the necessarinesse of the matter, whether it may
do any good in the common wealth. c.

And yet notwithstanding my opinion is this, that no person is to be disliked
of, that doth his good will and endeavour, No person is to be disliked that doth
his good will to do good.
to do good in the common wealth, howesoeuer that it proves. But those
persons are utterly to be dyslyked of, that do hurt willingly in the common
wealth, as extortioners and usurers, and conuayers of Corn and Vitayles, and
other necessaries and commodities that his country doth lack or hath need
of.

And al those persons are not to be thought well of, Persons that are to be
disliked.
that do desire to live easily, abusing the good benefytes that God doth
bless the earth with: as al licentious livers, as drunkardes, banketters,
whoores, and whooremaysters, and such as do use an excess in apparel, much
above their degree.

And also those people are to be abhorred of al men, who do annoy the earth,
that use quarrellyng and fighting, robbing and stealing, caring not howe they
come by it, so that they may have it, with which this our country of England
flows at this day, (the more is the pity) for what wickedness is there that
can be devised, but that it is used here in England amongst al degrees, which
must needs procure the wrath of God to light upon us. And there is as great
abuse amongst the Clergy, which should be as Lanternes to give us light, to
lead us unto virtue. Abuses of Englande.
But now in these days they be as Lanternes to lead us unto vice. So that al
degrees of people are given unto wickedness, although that we have the Gospel
of Iesus Christ, preached daily unto us, yet wickedness doth abound, for what
sin or wickedness is there, but that it is suffered and used, as wichcraft
and sorcery, and magical Enchantment, and coungering, which is the greatest and
most abominable dishonouring of God, that may be.

For in their magical Enchantment and coungeryng, Magical Enchantment is a
great dishonoring of God.
do they not observe hours in the making of Carecters, set up pickturs of the
Rood, and Agnus Dei, and the Doom, and a number of such other pickturs,
painted, and gilded upon Virgin Parchment, as they cal it. And then in like
manner their cirkles must be perfumed, inbalmed with sweet odours, and they
must have a knave priest, made by the Popes law, to hallow a certain
portion, with a number of such vain Ceremonies. And when that they have the
devil, whom they do serve, do give him in some cases some thing for a
sacrifice, and when that they do give the devil a charge to tel them any
question that they would know, then are used a number of superstitious words,
as in the name of the virginity of the Virgin Mary, and the head of Iohn
Baptist, and a number of vain Saints more, besides a number of such
detestable Ceremonies, to the great dishonouring of God. c. And who is the
cause and the procurement of these most odious and detestable matters, but a
number of vain, wicked people, yea some of the be of no small wealth nor
calling, that do procure these matters: For if that they have lost any thing,
the they must repair unto a Conjurer, to know where that is again. And
furthermore, there are some vain foolish Gentlemen, which seek to live
pleasantly and idly, that must live by gaming and play, and he must have a
familiar in a Ring, What manner of christian is he that desires to be familiar
with the devil.
or such other like place. But what manner of Christian do you think him to
be, that desires to be familiar with the devil? So that a great number of
people that are in the world, desire to live idly and pleasantly, caring not,
so that they have their pleasure here, although their soul go unto hell, and
there to be tormented in fire Brimstone ever world without end. Wherefore God
turn the hearts of those that are the cause of wickedness, and especially here
in our native country, Realm of England, for that we have a most gracious and
virtuous Queen reigning over us, and such a one as doth always study for the
setting forth of the word of God and sacred Gospel of Iesus Christ, The
vertuousnesse of the Queenes majesty is our preservation.
and doth always study for peace traquility. And considering the great
wickedness that is used in England, the wrath of God would have lighted upon us
long before this time, but only for the grace vertuousnesse of the Queenes
miaesty, that God hath spared us for her sake. Therefore let us al pray unto
God for her long life and prosperity, that she may reign long over us. For
surely my opinion is this, except we do repent and turn fro our wickedness,
the wrath of God will light upon us. For in these days every man is but for him
self, the elder sort of people are give generally al unto excessive huge
covetousness, and the younger sort of people are given generally unto pride and
whoredom, and other vain toys, The abuses of al degrees.
as idleness and gamyng, so that in respect few or none have the fear of God
before their eyes. And if any persons do frame them selves to live virtuously,
according unto the law of God, then they shall be but derided both of the elder
sort, also of the younger: for the covetous rich persons will say, he is a
fool, he can not make shift to live, he hath too precise a conscience: and the
youngest, vain glorious proud fools, will say, He is a scriptured man, he
will not have us to be meery nor go clenly. Covetousness is called good
husbandry.
So that in these days, extortio covetousness is called good husbandry: and
the one of them will commend the other, saying, He is a wise fellow, he will
live, how frauduletly soever he come by his goods. So what wickedness soever
that it be, Pride is clenlinesse, swearing lustiness, drunkenness, good
fellowshyppe.

Whoredom, friendship (...) a trick of youth.


the same shall be commended by them that use the like: as pride in these days
is called clenlinesse, and swearing lustines, saying, he is a lusty fellow,
and drunkenness, good fellowship, and whoredom a trick of youth or
friendship, so that the one sort of people do heap up the goods on the earth
vnsaciably, and the other sort of people, spend it away most vainly and
wantonly, so that the good gifts or benefytes of God, which are the riches of
the world, are abused on every side, not used as they ought to be, that is to
say, to do good upon the earth with that, for it was created for the use of man
to a good end, to take his portion of it, the rest to use unto some good
purposes at his discretion, for that God doth send it him, unto that end, and
not to be heaped up, neither to throw it away wickedly, as a number do:
Therefore men do not rightly consider, wherefore they were borne upon the face
of the earth.

The first cause that man is borne for, is to serve God.
First he is borne to serve God, for that he hath created him, and al mankind,
and hath created him a reasonable creature, and hath created al thing for his
use: as first the earth, with al his mynerals, as we do dig out of the
earth, Gold, Silver, and al other metals, and stones, to make us necessaries
to serve mans use. And also the face of the earth, he hath created to bring
forth Trees to make us Timber, and Grass to feed Cattle, to make us food
and meat: Corn to make us bread, with al his other benefytes, which man
receives from the face of the earth. The Sea with al other Ryuers, brings
forth Fish of innumerable sorts, to make us food and meat, yea the very Sea
is for mans use, too pass from Country unto Country.

The air in like manner, wherein are multitudes of feathered fowls, for mans
use, yea the very Heavens are for mans use, as the Sun, Moon, and Stars,
are created for the use of man. And also he hath redeemed us from the Original
sin of Adam, by his precious blood sheeddyng. Wherefore we are first
borne too serve God.

The second cause that man is borne is to serve his country.
And secondly, we are borne to serve our Prince, and na^yue Country, that is
to say, to defend our Territoryes, that no other ferreine Nations do spoil
us of our labours, or our Prince of her dignity.

Thirdly man is borne to labour to live
And thyrdly, we are borne to provide for our household, and our family and to
see that they be trained up, to live in the fear of God, and to know their
duty to their magistrates, and to train them up unto some faculty, whereby
they may get them a living. c.

Wherefore I would wish al those persons, that it hath pleased God to bless
upon the face of the earth, with any worldly revenues, or substance and
living, to practise some thing, whereby they may do some good upon the face
of the earth. And in like manner to train up their children in the nurture and
fear of God. c.

Especially the noble men and gentlemen, and they themselves not to desire to
live pleasantly and idly, The causes of al degrees.
but to practise some virtuous thing, as martial affairs, or such other like
causes, as their capacity will serve them. For there were two causes in the
beginning of all degrees of the temporaltie or layetie, whereof al Noble men and
Gentlemen had their original and beginning, and they are worthy to be had in
honour unto the worlds end, for their parentage, and the much the rather, if
that they do follow the rule of their noble and worthy progenitors.

The first cause was, for their noble acts and deeds in the defending of
their Country against their enemies. c. The first cause.
So by that means, for their valiantness against their enemies, they were
extolled and advanced unto high dignity, every person according unto his
deserts, and had lyuings to maintain their state, and they to defend their
Territories whilst the common people did manure and till the ground.

And the second cause in degrees of nobilytie and gentlemen, The second cause.
was to them that made good and wholesome laws for the good government of
their common weals. Therefore I would wish al noble me and gentlemen to follow
the noble race of their progenitors: and then they are the highlyer to be
esteemed. But otherwise, what a shame and discredit, if that they do rightly
consider of it, is it for them to be evil members in the common weal:
considering howe worthily their ancientrie did attain come unto their calling.
Good members in a common weal.
Therefore I would wish every gentleman, to practise something, that he may do
good, either to defend the common weal, or else to profyt it some otherway, and
not to be idle and to seek to live easily, whereby the common weal may be the
better maintained, the Prince the better served, and our Country the better
furnished, with such persons, as are able to defend the Prince, Crown, and
dignytie, as well in their good counsel, and also in their acts and deeds. And
also in my opinion, they are very necessary members in the common weal in
diverse respects, that are Travailers into other Countries, and they are able
to profyt their own Country in diverse respects: for that he is able to give
judgment by his own Country of other, whether it be as touching the
government of the common weal, in the executing of their laws of the manner
of traffic, and in the usage and nature of the people, both in their Cities
and Towns, and in their Country, and what manner of commodities they have,
and of the situation of their Towns, and in their fortifycation, and also of
what strength and force other Princes and states are of, and of the order and
manner of using them selves in martial affairs in the wars, and what their
Artillery is, and how they are weaponed and armed, and furnished in every
respect, which is very necessary to be known unto the nobility, for that
they may provide them selves, and their Country for their better safety, and
also they shall know what thing shall annoy their enemies most.

Then it is a plain case, that Travellers into other Countreies do much
profit the common weal. For suppose this, that if we, or any Country did live
in that order, that we did travail into no place or Country, neither no
nation unto us, then in process of time we should become barbarous and
savage. Therefore the Travailers are much to be commended in diverse respects.
Wherefore I will show you my opinion, what manner of people are meetest to be
travailers. For a number of people have travailed, and when they have come
home, they have had no judgment of their travail, but have been utterly
ignorant of such things as were most meetest of a Travailer to be noted, and
partly some of them were not capable in those causes, What manner of persons
are the meetest to be Travellers.
and some of them many times, their heads are occupied with other vain and
foolish causes. c. as this first: those people that are able to benefyt their
country by their travail, when they are come home, ought not to be to young:
for commonly a young man his head is occupied with every vain and light
cause, as with banqueting, and play, and game, dancing, and dalying with
women, and gazing upon vain toys. c. So that his head is occupied with no
other thing, but all pleasant matters.

Therefore he that is sent to be a Travailer, What a Travailer should consider
of.
to the end to profyt his Country, ought to be a man that hath a stayed a
modest head, and such a one as is capable, and hath a good wit with him, and
learned. And if he be seen in the Mathematical Science, it is all the
better: For then he shall the sooner conceive any matter. And also he ought
not to be either to young nor to old, but between the age of.40. and 56. or
57. years. c. And these be the principallest points, that a travailer should
consider of. First, to consider what manner of Nation he is entered into, whether
they be politic or wise, or Civil people, or whether they be a rude or
barbarous nation: and so in his travailing to frame his usage accordingly as
near as he can, that the people may like well of him* for in so doing he
should understand the better of the state and commodity of the Country,
City, Town or place: and when that you do come into any City or Town, view
of what manner of ground it stands upon, and what it may be or is subject
unto, and in like manner how it is fortified and provided, and how it is
maintained, and whether it stands upon any haven or river, that hath vent
unto the Sea, or any water, that hath no vent or passage unto the Sea, but
thorough or by some other City or Town, before it comes unto the Sea. And
also under whom it is, and howe it is governed, and what their Laws and
Ordinances be: And what notable Monuments of buildyngs there be: and any
other rare and notable thing that is not common: And also to learn what
nation, Country, City or Town that may most annoy them, and also what
Country, City or Town doth most pleasure them, and what trade or
Merchandise they are principallest maintained by, and what commodities are
most plentiest, and what commodities or things necessariest, are most scantest,
and what the nature of the soil or ground is thereabouts, that is to say, what
the ground is most aptest to bring forth, or most unapt, as touching Corn,
Trees, and such other like, whatsoever it be. And al^o what manner of Money and
coin is used, both in Silver and Gold, and other base Money in Copper, if
they have any. And also what the people hath most pleasure in, and what they do
most abhor or hate, and whether the Country be a plain and champion
Country, or Hills and Mountains, or lowe marsh or marishe ground, and whether
it be full of Rivers or not, and also how the Princes or the other Governors
do leuey their Soldiers in the time of their wars, how they do arm them,
and weapon them, and furnish them in every respect, and what duties or
customs, or tolles, or such like charges are paid, whether it be of them
selves, or upon strangers, or any other kind of goods or merchandise, and
what thing it is they make most store of, that they will not have pass out of
their Countries, with all such other likeness, that for brevity I do omit.

And now such persons as have noted these causes at their return home, are
able to profyt much the common weal in diverse respects, and are persons of
great valor unto their Country, for that they are able to profyt the state,
and the common weal of their Country in diverse respects. For all those
persons are of great valor and price, and are as special Jewels unto their
Country, What persons are of valor in the common weal.
and in the common weal, that are politic, cunning, and valiant in mar^hall
affairs: for thereby their Country is defended and preserved from the
foreign enemies: For look what Country is rich and welthye, then other
Princes are desirous thereof, for to have the spoils, and the benifyts of it:
wherefore by polycie and manlynesse they must be defended. Therefore men expert
in marshall affairs are very necessary in a common wealth.

And furthermore, all those persons, that are wise and sober, and discreet in
the good gouernemet of the common weal, such as do maintain virtue and
suppress vice, are persons of great valor to their Country, and also those
persons are able by their wisdom and knowledge to benefyt or profit their
Country, whether it be in the teaching of good arts and Sciences, or by any
other means, so that the common weal be the better maintained, are persons of
great valor, and are as Jewels unto their country, and their country is
beholding unto them. But contrariwise, all those persons that are not able to
profyt the common weal in any respect, and also desire to live pleasantly and
wantonly, and have great livings and riches, and do no good therewith: all
those persons are more beholding unto their Country, then their Country is
unto them. But if they have great store of riches, and do covet to heap more,
caring not how they do come by it, so they may have it: such persons are the
destruction, and are as Caterpillars to the common weal of their Country, for
that they do annoy and hurt the prosperity and the state of their Country, for
that they catch and heap up into their custody more then doth suffice
themselves, by great quantities, whereas thowsandes do lack to serve their
turns, that are better members in the Common weal then they are. And all such
persons, the Common weal hath a good turn when they are delivered of such a
one: For by that means is dispearsed that heap of store unto a number of
persons hands besides that which he would have heaped up more, if that he
had continued longer. So that some of the richest sort of people are not the
best members in the common weal, but the worst: and yet it behooves some
persons to be rich, and by their riches the common weal is the better
maintained, as thus.

The Prince of any Country being godly and virtuous, the Common Weal doth
the better flourish, and is continually kept the safer from the foreign
enemies: and the Noble men, and Gentlemen, that are virtuous, and given to
practise the good government, the preseruement of them selves, and the state of
their Country. So then their riches do good, and also if the Merchant be
rich, so that he do not hurt his own Country, but wins his riches out of
other foreign Countries, or any other good and virtuous Subject, by his riches
he may do good, if he do use that he hath to the furtherance of the common
weal: So that it is necessary that there should be rich persons in the
common weal, for a number of causes, so that those rich persons be virtuously
bent, but otherwise they may do hurt. And thus gentle Reader, I do make an
end, desiring you that you will take this simple Book in good part, and if
there be any faults committed by me, either by ignorance or negligence, I pray
you let me gently understand thereof, for man cannot be so precise, but that
he may err. And thus I betake you unto almighty God, the Creator of all
things.

By yours, William Bourne.

A brief note, taken out of M. Does Mathematical Preface that goes before
Euclides Elements now extant in our Inglish tongue, as touching what the
Mathematical Sciences are, that is to say, all those Arts that order number,
measure, or wayght, and time, without the which, in respect, we can do
nothing. For what can be done in any respect, but we must use number, which
is Arithmetic? or what can be done, but we must use measure or wayght, which
is Geometry? or what can there be done, but that we must use time, which
doth appertain unto Astronomy? for by number we know howe many or few
there are: and by measure we know whether it be inches, feet, yards, scores,
miles, leagues, pounds, ounces, galloes, quarts, or tons: and by time, we
know whether it be minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years. c.

Board, Glass.

3 Stereometrie. Is the measuring of all solid bodies, as Timber, Stone, Kaske,
such like.

Things measured that have distance from you.
4 Apomecometrie. Is how far any thing is fro you, whether it be on land or

FINIS.
To the Reader of the first book,
The first book of the treasure for travellers, containing the particular
conclusion of the Scall for to know the hieght of any Tower, Steeple, or Hill,
or Wall, and the dystance unto them, and the particular conclusions of the
Cross staff, and to know the things before rehearsed after the playnest order
of teaching, also there is the conclusion of the horizontal or flat Sphere how
to take the plat of any country, after the playnest order, with such other
like, very necessary for all sorts of trauelers either by sea or by Land,
written by Willyam Bourne.

To the Reader of the first part.
GEntle Reader, there is contained in this first book, the particular
conclusions of the Skal, as touching the knowing o^ heigthes, both by right
shadow, and contrary shadow: and also howe to know any distance by the
Skalle. And although that M. Thomas Dygges hath set out a book called
Pantometria, which is extant in print, as touching the conclusions of the
Skall, which is very learnedly done. Yet notwithstanding I do not think it
hurtful to show it particularly and plainly, whereby they may do it in most
causes, without Arithmetike. For the Skall being put but into.12. parts, it
may be counted by the head, without Arithmetike: but if the Skal be put into
many parts, then it must of force require the aid of Arithmetike. And also
there is the particular conclusions of the Cross staff, as to take the
wideness between any two marks, and the length of any wall, and the distance
unto any place, with other necessary matters to be donne with the plain
Cross staff. c. And also there is the Conclusion of the horizontal or flat
Sphere, howe to take the plat of any Country, after the playnest order of
teaching, that is to say, by the point, and parts of points of the Compass:
For it is al one matter, whether that the Instrument be divided into degrees,
or parts of points: and that same may be done by plain lines of opposition,
without any Instrument or circle, which I do omyt at this time to speak of.
And although gentle readers, that it seems not unto you, to be learned like
done, yet notwithstanding it is possible, that there is some thing that is not
common in those books that are extant, that may do you pleasure. For the
learned sorts of books (it may be) are not most necessary to be common, and
yet it would do well, that the common sort of people should have some
instructions.

FOr that it is sufficiently declared in diverse books now extant in our
English tongue, wherefore I do think it superfluous for to show what a
Prick is, or what a lyne is, or what a Plat or Superficial is, or what Angles
be, and what a sholded body is, as it is sufficiently declared in all these
books: as in Euclides Elements, and in M. Thomas Dygges book called
Pantometay, and also in M. Leonarde Dygges book called Tectonicon. c. A
Circle. A Centre. A Circumference. A Diametre
A Circle is that which is drawn round with a pair of Compasses, a Centre
is the middle prick, Circumference is the compass, Diameter is the breadth of
a Circle. c.

And furthermore, for that in this first part there is the conclusions of the
Scall, and the Cross staff, showing by them howe for to know the distance
unto any place assigned: Therefore it is very necessary for to know the
parts of measure, as it is not unknown unto all men, what a foot is, and
that.12. inches makes a foot, so.3. foot is a yard, and.5. A Foot. A
Yard. A pace Geometrical.
foot is a pace Geometrical: but some persons have been of that opinion,
that.3. foot is a pace, which is a yard, but it is but a simple steppe, A
simple stop of yard.
and few men are able to endure to pace a yard any long time together: but
any person may endure to steppe two foot and a half, all a day long
together. Therefore a pace Geometrical, is two reasonable steppes, and that is
five foot: and so any man may endure all a day together, A race is two
stepp^s.
and twelve pases makes a score, 12. pases is a score, that is, 20. yards. A
mile is a 1000. pases, that is.5000. foot, or 1666. yards, and 3. A Rod
is.16. foot.2. of land measure, and 18. foot is a Rod of wood measure.6.
foot is a fadome, and.833 fadome is a mile.
and that is twenty yards, and that makes.60. foot: and a mile
conteyneth.1000. Geometrical pases, and that is.5000. foot, and that makes
1666. yards.. and that is.2. foot, and that conteyneth 83. score.. and that
is.20. foot. c. and a Rod is.16. foot and a half, of land measure, and.18.
foot is a Rod of wood measure, according to our English account: and.303.
Rod and.1/33. that is half a foot, is a mile of land measure, and.277.
Rod, and.7/9. that is.14. foot of wood measure, is a mile, and a fadome
is.6. foot, and that is.2. yards: and.10. fadome is a score, and a mile
conteyneth.833. fadome, and.. part, that is 2. foot. c.

And thus much have I said as touching our English account, as concerning
the measuring of the length, or the distances unto any place assigned. c.

The first Chapter of the first book conteynyng the making of the Quadrant
with the Skall, whereby you may know the height or lowenesse of any thing. c.
Now begins the first part of this book, called A Treasure for Travailers,
showing the conclusions of the Skall, whereby you may know the height of any
Tower, Steeple, or Wall, or the height of a Hill, and the distances unto any
mark assigned by the Conclusions of the Skall. And also in this first part
there is the Conclusions of the Cross staff: showing howe to know the length
of the Corten of a wall, and the distance thereof, or any Town more playner
then is showed in M. Leonarde Dygges book called Tectonicon. And also there is
the making and the use of an Instrument, that may be called an Horizontal
Sphere, to draw the plat of any Country set out upon the face of the whole
earth: and howe to know howe to place the longitude and the latitude of any
Town, with other necessary things. c. very necessary and profitable for al
travellers and seruit^urs, either by sea, or by land, as Gonners and
Captains, and leaders of men.

And now shall follow the making of a Quadrant, The ma^ng of the Quadrant,
with the Skal
with the Skal divided but into.xii-partes, although some will have it divided
into.60. parts, and some into 48. parts, and some into more parts, and some
into less parts, according unto the fantasy of sundry Authors. But I do
think it b^ to be divided into.12. parts: for that diverse people are desirous
to know the use of the Skall, that are not seen in Arithmetike, and yet the
use of the Skal is very necessary and profitable for them to know, and the
Skal divided but into.12. parts, any reasonable man may have the use thereof.
But if it be divided into.48. or.60. parts, then it doth require Arithmetike,
which is not in many persons: Wherefore I do think the Skall that is divided
into.12. parts, to be most necessary and profitable for al sorts of people.
And although that M. Thomas Dygges in his book called Pantometria, hath
written thereof generally, yet I do think it very necessary, to write of it
particularly. c

And now for the marking of the Quadrant, do this: first take a piece of well
seasoned wood, that is bard, and fine grayned, as Box, or such other like, or
else you may make it in metal, as in Brass, or Latin. c. and then being well
playned or polished, and the larger, the better.

For in a small Instrument you may commit an error, sooner then in a large:
then be sure that one of the corners have a square or right angle, and then
there set the one of the feet of your compases, and with the other foot of
the compases make a quarter of a circle, for that it is called a Quadrant, it
is the.4. part of a Circle, and no.4. cornered thing. And that being done,
then divide the edge thereof into.9. equal parts: and every one of those parts
divide into.10. equal parts: so that then there will be in al.90. equal parts:
and every one of those divisions or parts, are called a degre. a degree is no
other thing but a whole circle divided into.360. equal parts, and then at
every.10. or.5. degrees you may make them, as thus.5. and.10. and.15. and.20.
or else as this.10. The use of the degrees.
and.20.30. and so forth unto.90. for that the quadrants is divided into ^90.
equal parts, and the use of these divisions or parts called degrees, is to
know the height of the sun, or any star above the horizon, whereby they may
know the altitude or height of the pole of the world above the horizon, as I
do more at large declare in my book that is extant in prynt called The
Regiment for the sea. c. and also the degrees are very necessary for gunners,
to know what ground that any piece of exdenace doth cast or covey the shot at
the mont of every degre, as I do more at large declare in my book called the
Art of shooting in great ordenance. c. And now furthermore, for the making of
the Scale upon the Quadrant, do this, at the right angle or corner make a square
in such sort, that the other corner right against it doth stand just upon.45.
degrees, loke that it be a right or square angule in like manner, and so from
that to the two sides there will be.4. square or right angule, and then divide
two of those sides, that is to say, the two sides that is from the corner where
that the Plummet shall hang towards the parts of the degrees, divide each of
them into.12. equal parts, and then mark.12. at.45. degrees, and then make
two sights upon one of the sides of the Quadrant: and those divisions, or
parts of that, or next unto the two sights, are the parts of right shadow,
and then the other divisions are the parts of contrary shadow. And here doth
follow the demonstration of the Quadrant, with the Seal. c.



The use of the Skal is very necessary and profitable in diverse respects, as
to know the height of Hills and Steeples, The use of the Skal.
or Towns, or Walls, and by the laying of the Skal flat, to know the
distance unto any thing, as unto Ships riding at the ancore in the sea, or in
any haven, or harborow. c. But in my opinion, the Seal of the backside of the
Astrolobe, is the better: for with the Quadrant you can not serve the sights
with your eye, and see howe the Plummet doth hang, and all at once: but you
may set the Alydeday or Rule with the two sights, upon what part you list, and
so stand fast, vntyl you have observed it. c. Now follows the form of the
backside of the Astrolobe. c.
But you must be sure that your Astrolobe hang upright as you may prove it by
a perpendiculer or plume lyne from the turret of your Astrolobe.E. down by the
lyne to F. then if your Plumme lyne be just with the lyne. E. and.F. then it
hangs upright: if that it do not agree, then it hangs not upright.

The second Chapter is of upright shadow, that is to say, to know the heyghte
of al things taken within the length of the thing.
Now follow the conclusions of the Scall, both of the Quadrant, and also of
the Astrolobe, but the Astrolobe is the better. And first, for line of level
called of Gonners the point blank, turn the other side C. right with the lyne
of level G. and H. then put your thombe thorough the ridge D. then hold up your
hand that you may look thorough both the sight A. and B. the al things that you
se thorough is level with the sight of your eye, neither higher nor lower. Now if
that you will know, the height of any Town or upright wall, do thus turn the
Athelida C. to the corner of the Scall, and set it upon the part 12. What to
observe in taking of height with the Skall.
then go forwards or backwards, till that you do see the top of the wall
thorough the two sights A. and B. then measure how many foot it is from the
middle of your foot to the hard wall, so many foot the wall is high. and as
much as it is from your eye, down to your feet, and that you must add to in
all your heightes, look that the ground be level, and be sure that you stand
upright, and wink with the one eye. Now furthermore being an upright wall,
set the Athelida C. upon the part one, of upright shadow: Upright shadow at on
station.
then doing as before is rehearsed, than mete the ground to the wall.12 times
the measure shall be the height of the wall, then the Athelida upon the part 2.
then six times the measure to the wall, shall be the height of the wall the
Athelida upon the part 3. then 4. times the measure shall be the height of the
wall. then upon the part 4. then 3. times the height shall be the measure of
the height of the wall, the Athelida upon the part 6. the mete to the wall double,
the mesure shall be the height of the wall. Always provided, that you ad to the
measure the length of your body, from your eye to your feet, now shall you have
a way to get the height of a steeple or wall that hath a ditch: but then you
must have two standings: and still for upright shadow, set your Athelida upon
the part 12. then looking thorough the sights, holding it upon your thombe as
before is rehearsed, then with the middle of your foot set a mark, then turn
the Athelida to the part 6. of upright shadow, and there make an other mark,
then mete how many feet it is, betwixt the 2. standings, then double that
measure shall be the height of the steeple or wall, the first standing upon the
part 12. then turn the Athelida to the part 8. of right shadow, then measure
the ground 3. times: that distance shall be the height of the steeple or wall,
the first upon the part 12. and the second upon the part 9. then 4. times the
measure shall be the height of the steeple, the first standing upon the part
12. the next on the part 10. then the measure between the two stadings shall
be the 6. part of the height, the first standing on the part 12. the next on
the part 11. the mesure between the standings shall be the 12. part of the
height. yet furthermore for upright shadow, first set the Athelida upon the
part 9. of right shadow, then doing as before is said, set a mark with the
middle of your feet: then turn the Athelida to the part 3. of right shadow,
and there set a mark, then measure those two standings, and then double that
mesure that shall be the height of the Steeple or wall, or the first standing
upon the part 8. the next upon the part 4. the doyng as before is said, 3. times
the mesure shall be the height of the steeple or wall, and the first standing upon
the part 10. and the next upon the part 6. of upright shadow, then doyng as
before is said measuring the distances 3. times, that measure shall be the height
of the steeple or wall. Or the first standing upon the part 7. the next upon the
part 6. of upright shadow, then doyng as before is rehearsed mesuring the
distance 12. times, that measure shall be the height of the wall. Or the first
stading upon the part 7. the next upon the part 5. the measure the distance 6.
times: that measure shall be the height of the wall. Thus much have I said for
upright shadow, upright shadow is this, all things whose height is taken within
the compass of the length of any thing mesured, as for ensample this, by the
figure following. By a Tower or Steeple being 65. Ensample.
foot high of all those questions of upright shadow before rehearsed the first
was the Athelida upon the part 12. and to the wall the measure of the ground
was 60. foot, the from mine eye to the ground was 5. foot: so that 60. foot and
5. foot, make, 65. foot. So I conclude the whole height of the Tower to be 65.
foot. The next is the Athelida upon the part 1. and the ground to the wall 5.
foot, so 12. times 5. is 60. then the next was upon the part 2. and the
measure 10 foot, and six times 10 is 60. the next upon the part 3. and the
measure to the wall 15. foot, then 4 times 15. is 60. the next was upon the
part 4. and to the wall 20. foot, and three times 20. is 60. the last upon the
part 6. and to the wall 30. foot, and 2. times 30. is 60.

Ensamples of two fashions or standinges.
Now all the other have two stations or standinges, therefore you do not
measure to the wall, but the measure between the 2. standyngs, the first
standing upon the part 12. the next upon the part 6 and the measure between
the 2. standyngs is 30. foot, then 2. times 30. is 60. then between the part
12. and the part 8. was 20. foot, and 3. times 20. is 60. then between the
part 12. and the part 9. was 15. foot. and 4. times 15. is 60. then between
the part 12. and the part 10. was 10. foot. and 6. times 10. is 60. then
between the part 12. and the part 11. was 5. foot. and 12. times.5. is 60.
And now furthermore where you could not go so far back as the part 12. the
one standing upon the part 9. and the other upon the part 3. the measure of
ground was 30. foot. then 2. times 30. is 60. the one standing upon the part
8. and the other upon the part 4. the measure was 20. foot. and 3 times 20. is
60, then the one upon the part 10. and the next upon the part 6. the measure
was 20 foot. and 3. times 20. is 60. then the first standing upon the part 7.
and the next upon the part 6. the ground between the 2. standings was 5.
foot. and 12. times 5. is 60. the one standing upon the part 7. and the other
upon the part 5. the measure between the 2. standinges was 10. foot. then 6.
times 10. is 60 So you may se that every way the whole height to be 65. foot.
adding unto it as before is said the length of your body being 5. foot, thus
much have I said of upright shadow, and now follows contrary shadow.

The 3. Chapter shows howe to know the height of any thing with the Scall by
contrary shadow (that is to say) without the length of any thing so taken.
NOw follows contrary shadow, contrary shadow is this, that when soever any
height is taken without the height or length of any thing, as follows: first,
doing as before is said, in al points, putting his thumb thorough the ring of the
Astrolobe, set the Athelida unto the part 12. then with the middle of your foot,
make a mark, the turn the Athelida to the part 6. of contrary shadow: the go
bakwards till you may se the top of the steple or tower thorough both the sights
of your Astrolobe, being sure that it is hanging plube upright. The at the
middle of your foot there make another mark, then measure how many foot there
is between your.2. stadings, so many foot is the height of the Steeple or
Tower. The in like manner at the first standing, the Athelida upon the part.6.
then turn the Athelida to the part.4. of contrary shadow. The meeting the
ground between the.2. standings, it shall be the height of the Steeple or
Tower. Then in like manner the Athelida at the one standing upon the part.4.
and the other upon the part.3. and then measuring the ground between the.2.
standinges, shall be the height of the Steeple or Tower, then at the one standing
the Athelida at the part.3. and the other standing the Athelida upon the
part.2. then measuring the ground between the.2. standings, half that
measure shall be the height of the Tower, Steeple, or Wall.

Furthermore the one standing the Athelida on the part.2. the next standing,
the Althelida upon the part one: then measure howe many pases or foot was
between the two stadings: the.6. part of that measure shall be the height of the
steple or tower, but you must be sure that the ground be plain level, or else
it may err. Now for your better ensample, by this figure here under made, by a
Steeple that is from the top down to the ground.120. Ensample o^ contrary
shadow.
foot hyth from the foot to the top of the shaft or spear, and now by
the height is known the distance, as you shall know by all the questions
before rehearsed. First the Athelida at the first standing was on the part.12.
and at the next standing, at the part.6. and the measure between the.2.
standings was.120. foot. Now I do conclude that the height of the said
Steeple is.120. foot from the ground to the top, and the distance to the
said Steeple is.240. foot, that is.48. pases: the height of the Steeple.24.
pace. Then fro the part.6. to the part.4. in like manner once the height of the
Steeple, and the distance to the Steeple, is.3. times the height, that is.360.
foot to the Steeple, that is.72. pace: then from the part.4. to the part.3. is
once the height of the Steeple: and the distance to the Steeple is.4. times the
height, that is.480. foot to the Steeple, that is.96. pace. Then from the
part.3. to the part.2. is twice the height of the Steeple, and the distance to
the Steeple is.720. foot, that is in pace.144. pace. Then from the part.2. to
the part.1. the distance of ground is between the.2. standings.720. foot,
that is.6. times the height of the Steeple: and the whole distance to the
Steeple is.12. times the whole height of the wall, that is.1440. foot. The
sum of the whole distance from the part one, to the Steeple, and that same in
pace is.288. which makes.24. score: and at the part.2. the distance of
scores is.12. then at the part.3. it is to the Steeple.8. score, at the part.4.
it is to the Steeple.6. score: at the part.6. it is to the Steeple.4. score,
then at the part.12. it is the just height of the Steeple, being.120. foot,
that is.2. score, adding as before is said, so much to the height of the
Steeple, as from your eye to your feet, which you shall do in this sort. And
specially if the distance be far from the Steeple at every station, if you
will work exactly, when you have taken the height, ^urne your Astrolobe (the
Athelida standing as before) not removing your foot fro that standing, then
looking thorough the sights, turning your face directly from the Steeple, then
whereas your eye doth rest, there set a mark: then there is no doubts but
that you shall take the true height and distance, doing this at every
standing, your ground being plain and level.

The fourth Chapter shows howe for to take the part of any height as the
length of a wyndow or such like.
NOw furthermore to take the part of a height, you may in like manner, doyng as
before is rehearsed in all points, and also you may with the Scale of the
Astrolobe take the length of a pinnacle or a window or windows, the one above
the other, you may take the measure between them as thus. Set your Athelida to
the part.12. then go backewardes or forwards, till that your sights do
agree with that thing that you would take measure of, letting your Athelida
stand still at the part.12. Then in like manner take the other end of that
thing whose length you do mean to take, then take your sight agreeing with
the other end of the pinnacle, then measure the ground between the.2.
standings: that shall be the length of the pinnacle, window, or cross, as by
this figure it may more plainly appear, as for ensample this. First I did set
the Athelida upon the part.12. and doyng as before is said: and took the
vpperside of the window, and at my foot made a mark, Ens^mple in the taking
of the point of a height.
then I went nearer the Steeple, and took the lower end of the window as you
may see at the letter. A. then I measured the ground between the.2. standings,
and found it 20. foot, so I do conclude the window to be.20. foot long. The
in like manner I took the Pinnacle, doing as before is rehearsed, first at the
top, and then at the foot, the Athelida standing still on the part.12. and
found the measure between the.2. standings.15. foot, the just length of the
pinnacle, as by the.2. lines B* it doth appear, then between the.2. crosses,
doing as before is said, and found the distance between the.2.
standings.10. foot; the length between the.2. standings as by the.2. lines C,
it doth appear, and so do by all other small parts.

The fifth Chapter sh^weth howe to know the distance of many things that is
from you, and also whether any other tower be higher or lower then the tower
that you be upon.
YEt furthermore by the Scale of the Astrolobe, you may know when you be on the
top of a Tower, or top of a Castle, howe far many things be from you,
and in like manner the height of an other Tower that shall stand near unto
you. And also howe much that one Tower is higher then another, with diverse
profitable things more, as this: First if you know not the height of the Tower
that you be on, then take a lyne, hanging a Plomet of lead or some other such
thing, then let it down over the wall to the ground. The by the length of the
lyne you shall know the height of the Tower or wall that you be upon, then when
you know the true height of the wall or Tower, then take your Astrolobe,
hanging it upon your thombe by the ring, as before is declared, then looking
thorough the sights in order, as before is rehearsed. So shall you find the
distance, as this: first, at the part.12. How to know distance by the shadow.
look what the height of the wall is from the ground, so far it is to the
mark that you do see thorough the sights of the Athelida, turning your
astrolobe that the sights may go downewardes, then the Athelida on the
part.6. of contrary shadow, the thing that you shall see thorough the syghtes
shall be.2. times the height of the Tower or wall: then on the part.4. of
contrary shadow, that thing that you do see thorough the sights shallbe 3.
times the height of the Tower of Castle, then on the part.3. i^ shall be.4. times
the height of the wall to that thing that you shall see thorough the sights.
Then on the part.2. that thing that you shall see thorough the sights, shall be.6.
times the whole height of the Tower or Wall. Then the Athelida on the part one,
that thing that you shall see thorough the syghtes, the distance will be 12.
times the whole height of the Tower or Castle, or wall, as for an ensample by
this figure following. By a Tower being found to be.60. foot high, at the
part 12. the shadow to run downewardes, it is.60. foot of, An ensample.
at the part.6. the sights did show you that thing that was 120. foot of,
that is.2. score, at the part.4, 180. foot of, that is.3. score, at the
part.3. the sights show you.240. foot of, that is 4. score, at the part.2.
all things seem from the top of the Tower thorough the syghtes, as.360.
foot of, that is, 6. score of. Then at the part one, all things seen
thorough the sights from the top of the Tower shall be.12. times so far
from the wall, as the wall or Tower is in heyghte, that is.720. foot from the
Wall, and that makes.12. score. Now if that there were another Tower or Wall
near unto you, you may know howe many foot that it is higher then that
which you be on, as thus. First doing as before is declared, you shall know
how many foot that the Tower is high, thus by this before rehearsed, you shall
know howe far that the other is from you. Then set your Athelida to the lyne
of Level, so shall you see whether that the other Tower be higher then that
which you be on, then to know how much that the other Tower is higher then
that you be on, do this: First look howe many parts that there is from the
foot or base of that Tower that you would know howe much that the one is
higher then the other, to the right lyne called the lyne of Level, then turn
the Athelida till that you do see the top agree with the.2. sights, holding
the Astrolobe by the ring upon your thombe, as before is rehearsed, as this:
The foot of the next Tower seen thorough the sights at the part.12. To know
how much the one Tower is higher or lower than another.
then you shall deuyde that height of the Tower that you be on, into.12.
parts. Then look howe many feet that there comes unto a part, then turn
your Athelida till that you may see the top of the next Tower, and look
howe many that comes unto, add so many foot of the measure of your own
Tower, to the other Tower. Then at the part.10. if you do see the foot of
the next Tower, divide the height of the Tower that you be on, into.10.
parts, then look howe many parts, that the other Tower is higher then yours,
add so many foot more to the height of the other Tower as the parts of
feet doth answer of your own Tower, then in like manner, if you see the
foot of the Tower at the part.6. divide the height of your own Tower into.6.
equal parts: then look howe many parts that the other Tower is higher then
yours that you be on, add so many foot to the height as those parts doth
come unto: and if you do see the foot of the other Tower, at the part.3.
then divide the height of that Tower that you be on into.3. equal parts.
Then look howe many parts that the other Tower is higher then your Tower,
add so many foot as those parts doth come unto the other Tower, as this
for an ensample, by a Tower that is 60. foot high. Then I took my Astrolobe
and turned the Athelida to the part.4. Then I did see the base or foot of the
other Tower, then that Tower that I was on, the top being.60. foot high, I
did divide it into.4. equal parts, and that did answer to.15. foot a part:
for this I am assured of, that when I did set the Athelida to the lyne of
Level, that it was just the height of my Tower, that place which I did see
upon the other Castle. Then I did turn the Athelida styll about, Ensamples.
seeking where I might see the top of the Castle: then at the part one and
a half, I might see it justly with both the sights, then did I add.15.
foot and a half.15. that is.7. and a half, and those.2. sums make.22.
foot and a half, and then put.22. foot and a half, to.60. foot, makes.82.
foot, and.. the whole height of the other Tower or Castle. Yet for more
playnenesse, lye another Tower of.50. foot high which I was upon, I took my
Astrolobe, and did as before is said, and I saw the base or foot of the other
Tower at the part.10. then I did deui^e the height of the Tower that I was on,
into.10. equal parts, being.50. foot high, and every one of those parts
came to.5. foot. Then I did take the Astrolobe and turned the Athelida, till
that I could see the very top of the other Tower thorough both the sights:
and then at the part.4. I saw that it was true. Then I did add.4. of those
parts, which was, 5. foot, to a part, and that came to.20. foot. So that
the one Tower was higher then the other by.20. foot: so I did add.20. foot
to.50. foot, which makes.70. foot. So I do conclude the whole height of the
higher Tower to be.70. foot just. Yet another emsample of.2. Towers: first,
that Tower that I was on to be.40. foot high, and I saw the base or foot
of the other Tower at the part.2. of contrary shadow. Then I did divide that
Tower that I was on, into.2. equal parts, and that did answer to.20. foot
a part. Then I turned my Astrolobe, and removed the Athelida to the part
one. Then I saw the top of the other Tower thorough the.2. syghtes. Then did
I add one of these parts being.20. foot, to the height of the other Tower,
which makes in all.60. foot high, the true height of the other Tower, as by
these.2. figures you may perceive. Now furthermore in like manner, if you be on
the higher Tower, To know how much any Tower is lower then that you be on.
you may know how much the lower Tower is shorter then the other. As this:
first, knowing the height of your Tower that you be ^n: then take the foot,
or base of the shorter Tower with your Astrolobe (as before is said,) then
look how many parts it comes unto, divide the height of your Tower that you
be ^n, as you did before: then turn the Athelida, till that you may see the
top of the shorter Tower, then look at what part you may see the top of the
shorter Tower: take so much away from the height of your own Tower, as the
parts do come unto: then that which shall remain, shall be the height of
the shorter Tower, as for ensample thus: By a Tower that you were on, being 63.
foot hye, Ensampl^*
and you saw the foot of the other Tower, thorough the sights at the part 9. of
contrary shadow, then divide the whole height of your Tower that you be on,
into 9. equal parts, and every one of these parts comes to 7. foot. Then
turn the Athelida, till you may see the top of the shorter Tower agree with
both the sights, then at the part 2. you did see them, the one of those parts
being 7. then 2. times 7. makes 14. So that the lower Tower is 14. foot
shorter then the other. Then pull 14. out of 63. foot, there remains but 49.
foot, so you may see the whole height of the lower Tower to be 49. foot, and
thus do by all other Towers, Castles, Steeples, or Walls.

The 6. Chapter shows how for to know the height of a Hill, and also the
distance unto the top of any Hill with the Scall.
NOw furthermore, by the Scall of the Astrolobe, you may take the height of any
Hill, and also of the distance unto the top of the Hill, by the Lyne
Hypothenasall, as though there were a Lyne made fast to the top of the Hill, as
hereafter follows. First that Hill that you do require to know the height of
it, or to know the number of the pace, or feet, that is above the ground that
you be on: then seek a plain ground near about the hill, there where you
may see the top of the hill, then doing thus. First turn your Athelida, till
that you may see the top of the hill thorough both the sights, your Astrolobe
hanging upright, the Ring being upon your thumb, then look at what part that
the Athelida stands on, then accordingly as you did see before, by the taking
of the height of Steeples, Towers, or Walls, meeting the ground between the 2.
standinges, to be the height of the hill, as you may know by this ensample.

To know the height of a hill.
First I seeking out my ground meet for my purpose, to be as plain as I can
find it, first, at the part 6. I set the Athelida, and so did I see the top of
the hill, for nearer I could not see it: then I did turn the Athelida too the
part 4. and then where I saw it agree with the sights of the Astrolobe, there
I began for to mete how many pace, that it was between the part 6. and the
part 4. the measure of ground was 100. pace: so I did conclude that the height
of the hill was 100 pace hye, that is 500, foot. and then I must needs say,
that from the part 4. to the Center or top of the hyl, if there were a
perpendiculer lyne let down as low thorough the middle of the hill till that it
were level with the sight of mine eye, then it were to the end of the
perpendiculer Lyne 300. pace just. Then for to know the just distance to the
top of the hill, by a right Lyne, as though there were a Lyne stretched from
the top of the hill to mine eye, which is the Lyne hypothenusall: Then must I
be perfect in the second part of Arithmetyke, To know the length of the
Hipothenusall Lyne by the extracting of the root.
(that is to say) the extraction of roots, and there will I do thus: I must
multiply the whole distance in it self, which is 300. times 300 pace, and of
that multiplycation comes 90000. Then in like manner I multiply the height in
it self, which is 100. times 100. and of that multiplication comes 10000:
then I do add both those numbers together, that makes in number 100000. then
this being done, I do extract the square root of both these numbers added
together (that is to say) 100000, and then there will stand in the quantytie
Lyne.316. and will remain 144. which is 18/79. Therefore I do conclude that
the Lyne should be stretched from the top of the hill down tyo the sights
of mine eye which is the Lyne Hypothenusal, to be 316 pace, and one foot and
better, the just length of the hypothenusall Lyne, as by this Ensample it doth
more plainly appear.



So by this Hill you may see that the height of the Hill was above the ground,
that it was taken upon 100. pace: that is 500. foot, and that makes 8. score,
and 20. foot: the distance to the Center, or perpendiculer, or plumb Lyne
imagined into the Hill to be 300. pace, that is 1500. foot, which makes 25
score, and the Hipothenusall Lyne, from the top of the Hill to the standing, at
the part 4. is 316. pace, near 2. foot, which is in feet 1582. and in
scores, 26. and 22. foot, as the figure before made doth represent. And thus
do by all other hills, whether that it be a part of a Hill or a whole Hill,
all is one matter.

The 7. Chapter shows you by the Skall of the Astrolobe, to know the true
wydenesse of any water, or how far that any ship is of from you, or to take
any great distance by laying the Astrolobe flat before you with the Scall
upwards.
YEt furthermore, by the Scall of the Astrolobe you may know the wideness of
Waters, and the distance from place too place all along the water side, and
also how far that any Ship doth ride from the shore side, and also how
far the Ship is from you: whereby you may make a perfect shot, very
profytable for Gonners to have the use of, as hereafter follows. To know
the wideness of waters.
First, take your Astrolobe, and set the same upon some steady thing,
laying that flat with the Scall upwards: Then turn the Astrolobe till that
the Lyne of level doth stand as the shore side, as those that you should
set the Athelida with the line of Level, to look al alongest the waters side:
then shall the plumb lyne of the Astrolobe stand directly cross the water,
then al things seen right with that line to be right over the water: then
your Astrolobe lying still, turn the Athelida to the part 12. then look what
mark or bank that you see hard to the waters side, through the sight of the
Athelida, mark it: then take your Astrolobe going directly by the waters side,
till you come directly right against the mark taken upon the other side of the
water, setting your Astrolobe as before is rehearsed. Then if the perpendiculer
lyne do directly point to the mark before taken, then the measure between the
two standinges, shall be the true breadth of the water.

Furthermore, the Astrolobe standing as before is rehearsed, setting the
Athelida upon the part.6. of the right shadow, then double that measure
between the.2. standinges, that shall be the breadth of the water, then the
Athelida upon the part.4. of right shadow, the Astrolobe set as before is
rehearsed, then the measure between the.2. standinges, shall be the.3. part of
the breadth of the water, and so forth to the part.3. to the mark right over
the water, shall be the one quarter of the breadth of the water, then.4. times
the whole measure shall be the breadth of the water: for to take the breadth of
waters with the Skal of the Astrolobe, is no other thing in the doing of it,
but as you do take the height of Walls or Towers in al points, saving that
in the taking of heigthes, you do hang your Astrolobe by the Ring upon your
Thumb: and for to take the breadth of waters, you must lay your Astrolobe
steedy before you, and the line of Level to stand al along the waters side, as
circumspectly as you may or can: then you must make your measure al alongest by
the waters side, as by this ensample following, of a water that is measured, and
is.36. score over it.



An ensample.
First I take my Astrolobe, and come to the waters side, and lay my Astrolobe
upon some steedye thing, and lay the lyne of Level all alongest by the waters
side, then the thwart lyne of the Astrolobe pointed just thwart or cross the
waters side, near to the Church end: then I turned the Athelida to the
part.12. so I saw a polled tree through the sights: Then I took up my
Astrolobe, and began to go, measuring the ground by pace, two steppes to a
pace, and that made.5. foot, which is a Geometrical pace: and.12. of those
pases make a score: And then I came right against the tree, proving it with my
Astrolobe, and found that the measure was from my first standing, till I came
right against it, 432. pases, and that makes.36. score. So I did conclude the
breadth of the water to be.36. score, from bank to bank.

Then furthermore I turned the Athelida to the part.6. and then I saw a
polled tree at the house end: then I went measuring the ground, and found
that the ground was.216. pases, and then I was right against the mark, and
that was.18. score: then two times.18. is.36. Then I turned the Athelida to the
part.4. of right shadow, and measured the ground, till I came right against
the mark taken through the sights of the Athelida, and found the measure
between the first standing, and the next, one hundred forty and four pases,
that is, twelve score: then three times twelve score, is thirty six score.
Then the Athelida standing upon the part.3. I measured the ground between
the two standinges, and found it to be.80. pases, that is.9. score, and the
fourth part of the breadth of the water, for four times 9. is.36. Then the
Athelida upon the part.2. Always provided that you do as before is
rehearsed, measuring the ground till you come directly against the mark
taken, shall be three score and twelve pases, that is, six score: then six
times six, is.36. For upon the part.2. the ground between both the
standinges, is but the sixth part of the wydenesse of the water. Then at the
part one, the ground between the two standinges, shall be but the twelfth part
of the breadth of the water, that is.36. pases, and that makes three score:
then.12. times three, is.36.

Now furthermore, if you will know the length of any of the Hypothenusal or
slope lines, then extracting the root, To know the length of the slope lyne,
by the extract of the Root.
the length of that lyne shall appear: so that with the Skal of the Astrolobe,
you may know any distance, being sure that you do make a square Angle, by
laying the Astrolobe flat before you, even according unto the Conclusions,
when that you do hang the Astrolobe.

And also you may take a greater distance, and also a larger station, whereby
you may work more exactly, by laying it, then by hanging of it. For that
there is seeldome any ground, but that it is higher or lower in one place, then
it is in another, that may breed a notable error, if it be not well
considered of. But if you do lay the Skall flat before you, considering well
the conclusions, you may commit no great error, being sure, that in your
remouyng, you do make a square Angle, and then measure the distance of ground
truly, for thence are many fold notable conclusions to be donne with the
Skal, as by this you may know howe far of that any Ship doth ride at an
ancore in the Sea, or in any Bay, or River: you may know certainly howe
far she is from you, so that she be not moveable: And also you being
besieged in a Town, may know howe far any thing is from you: And also if
you be without any Town, you may know by the S^al of the Quadrant or
Astrolobe, howe far any Tower, Balwarke, or Steeple is of from you. c.

The eight Chapter shows unto you, if that you do know the dystance, then
you may know whether that it be higher ground or lower ground then the place
that you are upon, and howe much, both By the parts of the Scale, and by the
degrees: and also you may know whether that one ship be higher then an other
c.
And furthermore, you knowing the dystance unto any place assigned, then you
may know the height of any Hyl or Steple or Tower, or the deepenesse of any
valley by the parts of the Scale, as this: The dystance being known, if that it
be higher or lower by one of the parts the Scall to be divided 12. To know howe
much any place is higher or lower then the places it you are on, whether that
it be on Tower, Steeple, ^l, Clyffe, of valley. c.
parts: then the thing is higher or lower by the.12. parts of the distance,
if it be higher or lower by two of those parts, then the thing is higher or
lower then the place that you do stand upon by the sixth part of the distance.
And if the thing be higher or lower by.3. of those parts, then the thing so
taken, shall he higher or lower by the.4. part of the dystance: and if that it
be higher or lower by the.4. part, then the thing shall be higher or lower by the
third part of the distance: and if that the thing be higher or lower by the.6.
part of the Scale, then the Hyl or valley shall be higher or lower by half the
distance. c. As for an insample this: I laying the Skall flat, toke a mark
upon the top of a Hill, or in the botome of a valley: and so working as is
declared in the Chapter going before, and found the dystance to be.24. score
from me, and then I desire to know howe much that the Hyl was higher ground, or
the valey lower ground, then the place that I stood upon. And then I took the
Astrolobe and hung it upon my thombe, and so I saw that the Hill was higher by
the one part. Therefore I did conclude that it was.2. score higher, that
is.120. foot higher ground then the place that I stood upon, for that the
dystance is.24. score: and the.12. An ensample.
part of 24. is.2. Wherefore if that it were a valley, then it were.120. foot
lower then the ground that I stood upon. c. And then if that it were higher or
lower by the.2. part of the Skall, then it should be higher or lower then the
place that you stood upon, by the.6. part of the distance, that is.4. score,
and that makes.240. foot. And furthermore, if that it were higher or lower
by.3. of the parts of the scall: then the ground should be higher or lower by
a quarter of the distance, that is.6. score: and that contains 360. foot.
And furthermore, if that it were higher or lower by.4. of the parts of the
Scale, then it should be higher or lower by the third part of the distance, that
is.8. score: and that contains.480. foot, c. And this I do take to be
sufficient for an ensample. And now furthermore, if that the dystaunce were
very far, and also the Scale divided but into.12. parts, yet you might know
the height of a Hill, or the deepnesse of a valey, To know howe much any place
is higher, or lower by degrees.

An ensample of shyps on the water.


by the degrees of your Astrolobe, or Quadrat, as this: the distance being
known unto any mark upon a Hill, or in any valley, if that it were one degree
higher or lower then the place that you do stand upon, then the thing should
be higher or lower ground by the.60. part of the distance. If.2. degrees, then
it should be higher or lower by the.30. part of the dystance: if.3. degres,
higher or lower, then the ground should be higher or lower by the.20. part of
the distance: if.4. degres, then the ground should be higher or lower by
the.15. parts of the dystance: if.5. degrees, then the ground should be higher
or lower by the.12. part of the distance: and thus far the degrees will serve
exactly yenough, but not unto many more degrees, for that they be the diuisor of
a circle. But unto.5. or.6. degrees they will serve the the turn very well. And
now for your better understanding, I will make an ensample unto.5. degrees
according unto the dystance before rehearsed, An ensample.
that is, at, 24. score from you, the ground being higher or lower by one
degree, the thing is higher or lower by the.60. part of the dystance, that
is.24. foot, whether that it be any mark upon a Hill or valley, or the height
of any Tower or Steeple. c. If that it be.2. degrees higher or lower, then the
mark shall be higher or lower then the ground that you do stand upon, by
the.30. part of the distance: and the distance being.28. score, the Mark
shall be higher or lower by.48. foot.

And Furthermore, if that the mark be higher or lower by. 3. degrees, then
the thing shall be higher or lower then the ground that you do stand upon,
by the.20. part of the distance: that is.72. foot. And Furthermore, if that
the mark be higher or lower by.4. degrees, then the thing shall be higher or
lower by the.5. part of the dystance, that is.96. foot. And further more, if
the thing be higher or lower by.5. degrees, then the thing so taken, shall be
higher or lower then the ground that you stand upon by the.12. part of the
distance: that is.120. foot. c.

And furthermore, by this means or order, you may know the distance unto any
ship upon the sea, or Riding in any Haven or Harborowe you knowing the hight
of any Tower or Clyffe, or any Hill upon the sea Cost, howe many foot that is
higher then the water: and you may know it either by the parts of the Skall,
or else by the degrees, as for an ensample, the Tower or Hill, or Clyffe to
be.60. foot higher then the superficial of the water, and the.60. foot is
one score.

An ensample of shyps on the water.
And if you do se the ship at one degree lower then the horizon then it shall
be.60. score unto the ship: and if at.2. degrees, then it shallbe.30. score
unto the ship, if at.3. degrees, then it shall be.20. score unto the ship, if
at.4 degrees, then it shall be.15 score unto the ship: if.5. degrees then it
shall be.12. score unto the ship: if.6. degrees, then it shall be.10. score
unto the ship: but if the ship be nearer, the degrees will serve no turn,
but will be erroneous. Wherefore you must use the parts of the Scall, as.5.
degrees and the part one is all of like dystance: for the hight of the Tower,
Clyffe, or hill being.60. foot in hight above the ship, that is just one
score: at.5. degrees, the dystance unto the ship is.12. score. And also at
the part one, the distance is.12. score in like manner c. and at the part.2.
the dystance unto the ship is.6. score: and at the part.3. the dystance unto
the ship shall be.4. score: and at the part.6. but.2. score: and at the
part.12. the dystance from the foot of the Clyffe or Tower, unto the ship,
shall be but one score, that is just the height of the Tower or Clyffe. c.

Furthermore you may know, if that you be on the sea, whither that one ship
be higher or lower of board, To know whether my ship be higher or lower of
board, then another, and whether the one doth ouertop the other, and howe.
then the other ship, and howe much: and also whither the one ship does
overtop the other ship, you may know howe much: so that she be not above
a mile from you, as this, by the lyne of the horizon lack, what place so ever
that you do see just with the horizon, is equal in height with your eye,
neither higher nor lower, whither that you be one the Sea, or upon the land:
and then you being in a ship on the Sea, and you do desire for too know
whither that the other ship be higher or lower of board then that ship that
you are in, then look Upon the other shpppe, at what place that the horizon
quoteth: and if you do see the horizon over the other ship, then your ship
is higher of board then the other ship: and if that you would know howe
much, then go too a lower place in your own ship, until such time that
you do see the Horizon just with that part that you do desire to know the
height of, and then standing still, look what part of your own ship that the
Horizon quoateth, that part of the ship is just equal with the other ship,
neither higher nor lower: then to know whether that the other ships top of
her Mast be higher or lower then your ships, then go up, or send one to the
top, and if that the other ships top be higher then the Horizon, then the other
ships top is higher by so much as you do see above the Horizon: but if that
you do see the Horizon over the top of the other ship, then your ship is the
higher: and then to know howe much, come down lower, until you do bring the
other ships top unto the Horizon, then at the just height of your eye, is the
true height of the other ships top, neither higher nor lower: and then look
howe much it is higher then your eye unto the top, so much your top is higher
then the other ships top. c.

And also you being on the land, you may know whether one ship be higher of
board then the other, and also whether the one ship doth ouertop the other
ship, as this, by the quoting of the Horizon upon both the ships, as this, If
you be either in a Tower, or any high house, near the sea coast, or else at the
foot of any hyl either.

Then if that you desire for to know which of the ships be the higher of
board, or else the higher topped, then ascend or descend, until that you do
see the horizon just with the higher part of the ship, and then look upon the
other ship, and then if that the other ship be higher then the Horizon, then
that ship is so much higher of board from the quotyng of the Horizon upwards,
and then if that you would know how many foot, then ascend upwards until that
you do see the upper part of the ship just with the horizon, then look how
many foot and inches that you were higher then you were before, and so many
foot the Ship is higher then the other ship just. To know howe much one house,
ship, tower, or hyl is higher then the other.
And by this order you may know howe much one ship is higher topped then the
other.

And by this order you may know whether one Tower is higher then another, or
one house higher then an other: And also whether that one hyl be higher then
another. c.

And furthermore, by this means you do know whether that one ship doth
ouertop the other: then you may know how many foot it is from the top of any
ship, unto the water, by the height of your own ships top, and the height
being known, then you may know the distance unto any ship sailing on the sea,
so that she be not too far of, by the parts of the Skal, and also by the
degrees, as before is rehearsed, going so lowe as you can in your own ship,
and then to consider howe much that you are above the water, c. And thus I do
end the conclusion of the Scale, and now doth follow the conclusion of the
Cross staff.

The nienth Chapter shows the making of the Cross staff, that in some cases
is better then the Skall of the Astrolobe, or Quadrant. c.
Now furthermore as concerning the making of a Cross staff, that serves the
Town in diverse respects, much better then the Skal of the backside of the
Astrolobe, and specially for to take the length of the Cortane of the wall of a
Town, or the distance between two Towns, or any two marks standing directly
against them, very profitable for al servitors, or other, for to have the use
of. And now follows the making of a Cross staff, as much as shall serve
landmens turns. First take a piece of good, fine, and well seasoned wood, and
let it be well playned, and very straight, of ^ue foot long, and then let it be
divided into.60. equal parts or inches, and then you may grave in it.1.2.3.
and.4* and so till you do come to the end at.60. And be sure that you make
every inch or part note, the one to be bigger or lesser then the other. Then
if you will, you may make at the end of every.12. inches, a roundel or circle,
and at the end of every.6. inches, half a circle: The ma^ing of the Cross
staff.
then at every.3. inches, s^me mark or cross, and then your long staff is
finished. The in like manner you shall make an other short staff, called a
Transuastorie, of two foot long, and in the very middle of it you shall make a
square hole, such a one as shall go close to the longer staff without any
swaruing, and then shall you make.2. wings or plates of brass, one for the one
end, and the other for the other end, then shall you make a chase or rygall on
the one side of the Saffe, that the wings may be rem^ued at your discretion:
then at.6. inches from both the ends you shall make a mark: And then there
will be.12. inches between the 2. marks. Then in like manner, you shall
make.2. other marks 9. inches from both the ends, and there will be.6.
inches beetwene the.2. marks.

And then in like manner, you shall divide the rest of the middle of the
Transuastorie into inches equal parts, and then it is finished, saving that in
the middle of the Transuastory you shall put a little piece of brass into the
hole or socket that the longer Staff doth go thorough, and then you shall make
a little vice or worm, to the end that you may make the Transuastory to stand
fast at your discretion: as these.2. figures do represent both the staff and
the Transuastorie, and the uppermost, the longest staff



The tenth Chapter shows howe for to use the Cross staff, for to know the
length of any Wall, or the distance between any two marks, and also the
distance from you, unto any Wall or Mark.
Now when so ever you list for to take the length of any cortaine of a Wall,
or the widenes between two marks, or any other thing what soever it be, then
shall you take the longer staff, set out with equal parts, and put the
Transuastorie upon it, through the hole in the middle of the Transuastorie:
and then if you would know the wydenesse between any two Marks, or the
length of the cortaine of any Wall, How to use the Cross staff to take the
widnes and the distance of any thing.
and the distance unto them: then shall you do thus: First, set the end of
the longer Staff, harde vnde^ one of your eyes, wynkyng with the other eye.

Than your Transuastorie standing at.24. inches from the end of your long
Staff, which is the whole length of your Transuastorie: Then go forewards
or backewardes, standing upright with your body, and head, and both your
feet together: then go forwards or backewardes, looking toward your Mark,
till both the ends of your Transuastorye do agree with your two Marks justly.
If it be a Wall, measure the ground just to the middle of the Wall, and that
shall be the true length of the Wall.

But if there be a Ditch between you and the Wall, then remove your
Transuastorie at the second standing, his whole length further forewards,
that is, two foot: and then go backwardes, till that you may see again, both
the ends of the wall agree with the two ends of the Transuastorie. Then
measure the ground between the two standinges, and that shall be the just
length of the wall. And then the distance unto the wall, shall be twice the length
of the wall. Then if that the distance be further then the Transitory will
take, and the wall too short: then remove the Plattes or wings of the
Transitory, to the marks, six inches from both the ends of the Transitory:
and then the two Plattes or ryngs will be but twelve inches asunder.

Then take the wydenesse between the two marks, or the two ends of any wall
justly with the outsydes of the two Plattes or Rings: then with the middle of
your foot, there make a mark: then remove your Transitory forewards or
backewardes, the length that the Plattes or Rings be asunder, as you have
ground: and then go forewards and backewardes, till that your two Plattes or
Rings do agree again with both the ends of the wall: and then there make an
other mark at your feet. Then measuring the gr^unde between the two
standinges, it shall be the length of the wall.

And then for to know the distance unto the wall, you shall do thus: Look
howe many times that the Transitory is from the end next towards you, and
especially the distance between the two Plattes or rings: so many times the
length of the wall, shall be the distance unto the mark: as for ensample thus,
By the wall of a Cortaine of a town between two Turrettes, and my desire is to
know the length of the Cortaine of the wall: and then I having the Transitory
upon the long Staff, I could not come so near the town as I would. Then I
removed the Plates or wings of the Transitory, to the division of six
inches from both ends, that was, twelve inches asunder: then I going
foreward, till that I did see both the Turrettes with the two Plates or wings
of the Transitory: and then at my feet I made a mark, and then in like
manner I removed my Transitory twelve inches foreward, and then I went
backewardes, till ^hat the two ends of the wall did agree again with the two
Plates or wings of the Transitory, and there is made an other Mark.

Then I measured the ground between the two standings, and found it ten
score: then I did conclude, that the length of the Cortayne of the wall, was
ten score from the one tower to the other. And now I knowing the length of
the wall, I may easily know the distance unto the wall, as thus: Now I do
look howe many times twelve inches that the Transitory was from the end
next unto me, and it was four and a half: that is, 54. inches.

And now, because that the Plates or wings of the Transitory were twelve
inches asunder, and.54. makes four times and a half twelve, and the length
of the wall, ten score. Therefore I do conclude, the distance unto the wall,
from the place of the last standing, to be four times and a half ten
score: that is, forty and five score: as by the ensample of the figure
following it is declared.



Now furthermore, if the distance be further, then the two Plates or wings
may be removed nyene inches from the two ends, that is, but six inches
asunder: Then in like manner if that be too wide, you may remove the two plates
or wings ten inches from both the ends, and that is but four inches asunder.
Then in like manner, if that the distance be very far of, and the length
of the wall be short, then may you remove the Plates or wings of the
Transuastorie, eleven inches from both the ends: that is, but two inches
asunder: And then, doing as before is rehearsed, to take two standynges, that
shall be the mydenesse between any two marks.

Provided always, that you remove the Transuastorie at the second standing,
either forewards or backewardes, so many inches, as the two Plates or wings
be asunder, justly, and no more, and then you shall know the distance unto
any Mark or wall.

When you do know the length of the wall, (and that is known, as before is
said, by the measure between the two standinges) then look howe many inches
that the Transuastorie is from the end of the long Staff next to your eye:
then look howe many inches that the Plates or wings of the Transuastorie are
asunder, so many times the length of the wall shall be the distance unto the wall.

As for ensample thus: By the Cortaine of the wall before named, being ten score
long, the Transuastorie to be set at.48. An other ensample.
inches from the end. First, the two wings stood at the very utter end of
the Transuastorie, that is.24. inches asunder: then the measure unto the wall,
shall be twice ten score, and that makes.20. score, because there is twice.24.
in.48. Then in like manner the Plates or wings were set.12. inches asunder, and
the Trasuastorie.48. inches from the end. Then there is four times.12. in.48.
then you may conclude, that that is four times ten score unto the wall of the
town, that makes.40. score. Then in like manner the Plates or wings being
set but six inches asunder, then there is eight times six in.48. which makes
eight times ten score: that is.80. score. Furthermore, if that the wings were
but four inches asunder, the Transitory being.48. inches from the end, there
is.12. times four in.48. So the distance unto the wall is.12. times.10. score.
that is.120. score. Then furthermore, the wings standing but.2. inches a
sunder, but then it is an hard matter for to take it perfect: then there is.24.
times.2. in.48. so that makes.24. times.10 score: which makes.240. score. Now
furthermore, in like manner if that it fa^ not right just measure, then if that
there be but half the measure between the wings, then for that, take half
the length of the wall, and add it unto the rest of the measure: and if that it
be three quarters, then three quarters of the measure, and for a quarter, one
quarter. c.

The eleventh Chapter shows you howe for to take the length of a wall, when
that you have not ground large yenough for your two stations or standynges.
Now furthermore, if that you have not ground for to go forewards or
backewardes, so much as that the quantity of the wydenes of the Cortaine, or
the distace between any two marks shall come unto, there is a remedy for that,
as this: Look at what length you have set the distance between the two Plates
or wings: then remove the Tranceuastory of the long staff, but half the
length between the two Plates or wings, at the second standing, and then the
ground between the two standings shall be but half the length of the wall, or
distance between your two marks: then double the measure that shall be the
length of the wall: then having not so much ground, remove the Transitory but
the third part of the measure between the two wings of the Transitory, and
then the ground between the two standings, shall be but the third part of the
length of the wall, and three times that measure, shall be the whole length of
the Cortaine of the wall.

Then having not so much ground, then remove the Transitory but one quarter of
the measure of 2. plates or wings, and then the measure between the 2.
standynges shall be but one quarter of the length of the Wall: and then 4.
times that measure shall be the whole length. The in like manner you may remove
the Transatory but the 6. part of the measure there Transitory the between the
2. standyngs shall be but the 6. part of the length of the Wall: and so forth
to the 12. part or more, as you have Ground or room.

But here is one thing by the way, never take a short station between the 2.
marks, as lunge as you may have a large: for that a little error often times
multyplyed, becomes a great and miraculous error in the end, yea an
untolerable fault. Ensample.
And now for your better Ensample of all those questions before rehearsed of the
length of a Brickwall 12. score lunge, first I took my cross Staff, and
sought out my grownde right against the middle of the Wall: and because I
could not come so near as I would, I removed the 2. plattes or wings 6.
inches from the 2. ends of the transatorye that was 12. inches asunder, and
set the transatorye 36. inches from me: and then there where the 2. Plates or
Wings did agree with the two ends of the Wall, there at my feet I made a
mark: then I had not ground enough neither for to go forwards nor
backwardes: therefore I removed my Transitory but 6. inches forwards, that is
at 42. inches, and then I went backwardes till that the 2. plattes or wings
did agree again with the end of the Wall, and there I made another mark.
Then I measured the ground between the 2. standynges, and found it but 6.
score: then that being half the length of the Wall, 2. times 6. score makes
12. score.

Then I having not so much ground, removed the Transitory the third part but
4. inches forward, that is, at 40. inches. Then measurynge the ground
between the 2. Standynges, was 4. score: then three times 4. score makes 12.
score: then having not so much ground, remove the Transitory but one quarter
forwards, that is 3. inches forwards, that makes 39. inches: and then the
ground between your two standynges shall be but three score: and four times
three score makes twelve score. Then in like case if that you have not so much
ground, you may remove the Transuastorye but the sixth part of the measure
between the two Plates or Wings, that is two inches forwards, and that
makes.38. inches: then the measure between the two standynges is but two
score: and six times two score makes twelve score, and so forth to the
twelfe part of the measure between the two Plates or Wings of the
Transuastorye, as by this Example.



The 12. Chapter shows you how to know the distance unto any two marks, or
to the two ends of any wall by the extracting of the square root.
Now furthermore, whenever you have taken the wydenesse between any two
marks, then you do know the just wideness, but not the true distance,
except it were a Wall, you do know the true distance unto the middle, but not
to the end. To know the distance unto any two marks by the extracting of the
square root.


Now therefore whenever you would know the distance unto the ends of any
Wall, or unto a Church, and a Tree, or whatsoever that you have taken the
wydenesse between them, then how far so ever that they be asunder, divide
the measure into 2. equal parts. Then take the Lyne of the distance unto the
middle of the mark, and first multiply the distance in it self: then in
like manner multyplye the half wideness in it self: then part both the
numbers of the multiplycation, and add them both together: then extract the
root of both the numbers, and it shall be the distance of both the ends of
the Wall, or any other 2. marks, as now for example thus: by a Church and a
Bulwark. And my desire is to know the wydenesse between them, and first I
take my cross Staff and set the Tranceuastorye 24. inches from the end: and
the 2. plats or wings stood at the harde end: and then I took my first
standing, as before is declared, holding the lunge Staff hard under the side
of mine eye, and then I seeing the Bulwark the church agreeing with the 2. ends
of the tracevastory, there at my first standing I made a mark, and then I
removed the Tranceuastory 24. inches forwards, and that makes 48. inches, and
there where the two marks did agree again at the 2. ends of the
Tranceuastorye going backwardes, there I made an other mark, and then I
measured the ground between the 2. standyngs, and found it 24. score.

Then I did conclude the wydenesse between the Church and the bulwark,
was.24. score: then it must needs be said, that the distance to the middle
way between the Bulwark and the Church at the first standing to be.24.
score: because that the Transitory was once his whole length from the end
next unto me, and then at the second standing the distance must needs be
48. score, because that the Transitory was twice his whole length from the end
next unto me, being.24. inches. And now for to know the distance unto
either the Bulwark or the Church, then shall you do this: and for the
nearest standing, when that the Transitory was once his whole length from the
end, and the distance unto the middle.24. score, then I did multiply.24.
times.24. and that makes.576. And then from the middle between the Bulwark
and the Church, was.12. score to the bulwark, and.12. score to the Church.
And then.12. score multiply squarely, that is to say, 12 times.12. and that
makes.144* Then add both your numbers together, that is to say, 576.
and.144. and that makes.720. Then extract the root of the number, and then
there will stand in the quantity lyne.26. and.44. will remain over. So that
you may conclude, that from the nearest standing, to the Bulwark or to the
Church, it is.26. score, and 11/13. part of a score, that is more near.51.
foot: and now from the furthest standing, and the distance unto the
middle.48. score. Now multiply.48. times.48. and that makes.2304. Then
multiply.12. times.12. for the half wydenesse, that is.144. and that added
unto.2304. makes.2448. so extracting the root, there will stand in the
quantity lyne.49. and then will remain over.4. which makes.47/98. part,
that is, near half a score, being.29. foot. So I do conclude, that from the
further standing to either the Church or Bulwark, it is.49. score, and near
29. foot.



The thirtienth Chapter shows howe to know the distance unto any mark with
the cross staff, without the extracting of the root, and also howe to take
the height of any thing with the cross staff.
Now furthermore for your more ease, whenever that you would know howe
far it were to any mark or place by the help of two marks, To know the
distance unto any mark with ye Cross staff without the extracting of the
root.
with not knowing the length of the slope lyne, then shall you do thus: First,
stand right against the mark that you do desire to know the distance unto,
then seek out your mark, and be sure that the other mark make a square Angle
unto that mark that you desire for to know the just distance unto: then
remove one of the plates or wings of the Transuastorie to the very middle of
the Transuastorye: then when soever you list to know the distance, first at
your first standing, then make a mark: then for your next standing, remove the
Transuastorye, but so much as the dystaunce is between the.2. plates or
wings, being sure that you take the mark that you do desire the distance
unto, with that plate or wyng of the middle of the Transuastorye: then (as
before is declared) look howe many inches that the.2. plates or wings be the
one from the other, so many times the measure that the distance is between
the.2. marks, shall be the dystance unto that thing that you have taken with
the middle of the Transuastorie. And so forth in al points as before is
rehearsed: as for ensample thus, by a tower that I do require the distance
unto, An ensample.
and then I standing with my face right against the tower, then I sought a tree
that stood right beside the tower, that made a perfect square Angle to the
tower and unto me: then because that the dystance was somewhat far of, and
the tree somewhat near unto the tower, therefore I set one of the plates or
wings.6. inches from the end, and the other wing right with the middle of the
Transuastorie. Then I set the end of the long staff harde under one of mine
eyes, and took the measure true between the tree and the tower, with the
plates or wings of the Transuastorie, the Transuastorie standing.48. inches fom
the end. And then I removed the Transuastorie.6. inches forwards, because
that the.2. plates or wings were but.6. inches asunder, and that made.54.
inches: and then I went backwardes and made my second standing, and then I
measured the ground between the.2. standings, and found the ground.4.
score, then I knew that the tree was.4. score from the tower.

And then I looked howe many inches that the Transitory was from the end,
and found it.54: then in like manner I looked howe many times.6. there was
in.54. and found.9. times.6. Then I must needs conclude, the distance unto
the Tower to be.9. times.4. score, that is, 36. score: as by ensample of these
figures following.



The whole distance unto the Tower is.36. score. Now furthermore, you may
take the height of any wall, or Tower, or Steeple, or any other thing, so that
you set one of your plates or wings with the very middle of your Transitory,
As touching the taking of heightes with the crossestaffe.
with the middle plate be sure to take the foot or base of the Tower, Steeple,
Wall, or tree: or else you may commit error. And by the staff you may know
the wydenesse of waters, with diverse other most necessary things, as this:
When that you be in a town, for to know the distance of any place whose
length or wydenesse that you do know, as by the length of a pike, or the
wydenesse or distance between.2. Bushes or.2. stones, or any other thing,
being sure that you take your sight true upon your marks holding your hands
steedie till you may see your.2. marks, end with your 2. plates or.2. ends
of your Transitory, setting the end of your long staff close to the utter
part of your eye, winking with your other eye, standing upright with your
neck and head: and this doing, you shall not fail of the truth. For if that
you err, the fault shall be in your self, for that you have not taken it
truly. Therefore that is very good to have a rest to lay your long staff on,
for to take a hey ^u^, you mu^t turn the Transuastorie one end upwards, and
the other end downewardes, and then you must hold the end of the long staff
close to the corner of your eye.

The fourteenth Chapter shows unto you, how that you shall know the
di^taunce of any ship from you, and you being in another ship, and both the
ships under sail, and going by the Cross staff. c.
ANd furthermore, by the Cross staff you may know the distance unto any
ship sailing on the Sea, very exactly, you being in another ship sailing
after them, or before them, or beside them: although that diverse men are not of
that opinion, for that both the marks are moveable, whereby they cannot get
any certain station or standing, as this is declared in the eight Chapter
going before, how to know whether that one ship doth over top the other,
by the sending of one up unto the top of the ship, to look how the Horizon
cutteth upon the top of the other ship: and by that he doth know whether
that the other ship doth overtop or vndertoppe the ship that he is in:
and then you knowing how many foot that your own ships top is in height
from the top down unto the water, then you may know by that howe many foot
the other ships top is in height in like manner from the water very exactly.
As touching the knowing the height of any ships top.
But if that you do not know the just height of your own ships top unto
the water, then you may know it thus, by send^g one up unto the top, with a
lead or a Plomet made fast unto a lyne, and so let down unto the superficial
part of the water: and then measuring the lyne, you may see the height of the
ships top that you are in, down unto the water: and then by the height of
your own ships top, you may justly know the true height of the other. c.
And now to know the distance unto the other ship with the Cross staff,
you must do this: How to know the d^stance unto any ship.
take your Cross staff, and remove the two plates or wings of the
Transuastorie unto the middle of the staff, and set them at a known distance
between the two wings or plates, as at an inch or half an inch a sunder at
your discretion, and that being done, then set the long staff harde unto the
corner of your eye, wynking with your other eye, then removing the
Transuastorie forwards or backwardes vnt^ll that you may see and serve it
truly, the top of the ship just with the upper plate, and the lower part
^f the ship harde unto the water with the edge of the lower winge or plate:
and that done, then look howe many times the wydenesse between the two
plates that the transuastorie is from the end next unto your eye, so many times
the height of the top down unto the water as that comes unto, shall be
the true distance between the two ships: which you shall work in this
manner: First, the number of feet that the other ship is from the top unto
the water being known, then look howe many times the distance of the two
wings or plates be a sunder, then look how many times that quantity the
Transuastorie is from the end next unto your eye, then do thus multiply the
number of feet from the top unto the water, by the number of the distance
between the two plates or wings from the end next your eye: and then look
what that number comes unto, and then divide that by.60. and so many scores
the two ships be a sunder justly. An ensample.
As for an ensample thus: by a ship that was found by the order before
rehearsed, to be.65. foot from the top of the top Matte unto the water,
and the two wings or plates were set just an inch asunder. And then in the
observing the Transuastorie was remouyng forwards and backwardes vntyl that he
dye see the top of the Mast, and the lower part of the ship harde unto
the two plates or wings: and that done, then he looke^ how many inches the
Transuastorie was from the end next unto his eye, and found it.54. inches
just. Wherefore he multiplied.65. by.54. for that.65. foot was the height of
the top unto the water, and the plates or wings were just one inch
asunder, and the Transuastorie.54. inches from the e^e^ and of that
multiplication there comes 3510. Wherefore divide that.3510. by.60. and that
will show unto you the number of scores, and that.3510. divided by.60. there
will stand in the quantiue lyne.58. and.30. remains over. So that you may
conclude, the distance between the two ships to be just 58. score and.. and
by this order you may know the true distance between any two ships. c. And
yet for your better understanding, I will give a second ensample more easier to
be understood, Another ensample.
by a ship that was just.60. foot from the top unto the water, that being
a just score and no more, the two wings or plates being just one inch a
sunder, and the ship being observed and was found to be where as the two
plates did agree with the top and the lower part, that the Transuastorie
was.40. inches from the end. Therefore they may conclude that the distance
between the two ships was just.40. score, for that the top of the mast
unto the water was just one score: that is.60. foot, and the two plates or
wings just one inch a sunder, and the Transuasitorie.40. inches from the
end. c. And also by this order you may know the distance of any ship from
the land. c. And thus I do end the conclusions of the Cross staff. c.

The fifteenth Chapter shows unto you, howe you shall make an instrument whereby
you may describe a Region or Country, which you may call an Horizontall
Sphere: and also howe to take the plat of any ground. c.
Now furthermore, I think it convenient to show unto you the making of an
instrument, whereby you may describe a whole Country at sundry stations or
standings: which is very meet and necessary for all men that do service to
their Country, and principally for Generals and Captains, and especially
for all them that take ^harge t^ ^ee leaders of men. The instrument is much
like ^o the backside of an Astrolobe, but that it hath no Scale, and yo^ shall
make it in this manner. First, take a piece of well seasoned bordes end of a
foot square, The making of an instrument to describe a Country.
the make it round: or else you may make it in metal, the larger the better,
making it perf^t round. And then divide the circumference or edge into.360.
degrees or equal parts: and then in like manner divide it into.32. equal
parts, name them as you do the.32. points of a sea mans Compass, and then
make a hole in the center of the instrument, and the make an Athelida with.2.
sights, such a one as an Astrolobe hath in all points, and there make it fast
with a pin to the middle hole of the instrument, and then in one of the sides
either to the North or South point, place a needle, such a one as a Dial hath,
and this instrument is finished. As by this figure following is represented.
Now follows the use of this instrument, which is, for to describe a Region or
Country, and for to know the distaunces from one place to an other: very
meet for Cherography or Topography, to make a Card or Map for any Country,
or to know the dystaunce from one Town to an other, and also to know towards
what part the Town or Village doth bear from the one to the other, by the
help of two stations or standings, made upon some high ground, as some Hill
or some high Tower, where that you may see all the cost of the Country round
about you, as thus: First, take the instrument and go up unto some high Hill
or Tower, where that you may see all the Country round about you, and then
draw into a piece of paper a Circle with a pair of Compasses, and then draw a
Meridian Lyne, and then divide the Circle into 32. equal parts as the
instrument is, and then lay the instrument upon some stool or thing flat
before you, and then set it with the needle due North and South, and so let the
instrument stand without any removing: then turn the Athelida or Rule with
the two sights, to such Towns or Villages or hills, or Churches, as are within
the Argle of sight, and look thorough both the sights of the Athelida, and see
what Town or mark that you do see.

Then resort to your Paper, and look upon the instrument at what point and
degree the Athelida is standing on, then upon the point and degree of the
Circle write the name of the town, or Village, or Hill, then turn the
Athelida to the next mark: and so forth, till you have taken all the towns
and Villages round about the Country or Coasts that be within the Angle of
sight, and write the names of all those towns at the point and degree that
the Athelida doth stand upon, at the time of the taking of them with the 2.
sights.

And furthermore, write in the paper the 4. principal winds, as east, west,
north, and southe. Even as the coast of the country doth stand: and then
draw right lines from the Center of the Circle too the Circumference, to the
place where the names of the towns were written, and so passing right to the
edge of the Paper.

And thus do by every town written on the edge of the Circle, and then that
station is finished. And then furthermore, look to what place that you do
mean for to go unto for to make your second station, being one of those
that you have observed before. For the first observation is to no purpose: so
that you must of force have 2. And then upon that Lyne that the name of the
town or Hill that you do mean to go unto, set one of the feet of the
compasses, and with the other foot of the compasses make an other circle in
like manner: then draw an other Meridian Lyne, and be sure that both the
Meridian Lines do agree the one with the other, and so divide that circle into
32. equal parts, as the other was in all points: and then go up unto some
high place that was the mark before, and then lay your instrument before you
again, setting it by the needle due South and North, and so let the instrument
stand.

The second observation.
And then turning the Athelida to such towns as were taken before, looking
thorough both the sights were where the Athelida doth stand, and write the names
of those towns again upon the edge of that circle at the point and degree
that the Athelida doth stand upon: and do thus till that you have taken all
the towns that were observed at the first standings: and then draw right
lines from the Center of that Circle, by the edge of the Circle, to the names
of those Towns that were written, and so the lines for to run right to the
sides of the Paper. Then look where that the lines do cross, there make a
mark: for there stands the Town or place that you have observed.

And now in like manner, if you list, you may know the distance from one Town
to an other, as thus: first, you must measure the distace between any one town
to another: that ground being measured, To know the distance unto any place.
you must make a Scale or tronke of mesure on the side of the paper, and then
measure the distance between those 2. Towns in the paper: then according to
that proportion of measure make your miles in the Scall or tronke of the Card
or Map: and that being done, you may know the distance with a pair of
Compasses between any one Town or Towns to the other, by the Scall of the
Card: and then this being done, you may make that fair in an other thing
without lines, and bewtyfye that at your pleasure, as for example thus, by the
parts or country about Grauesende.

First, I took the Instrument, and then in like manner I made a Circle in a
sheet of paper: then I drew a Meridian lyne, An Ensample.
that is to say, a lyne from the South to the North: and I divided the Circle
into 52. equal parts, and then I wrote the 4. principal winds in the four
sides of the paper: that is to say, the East, West, North, and South: and then
I went up to a Hill that stands beside Grauesende, called Ruggon Hill, and
there beside the Mile I made my first standing: and then I observed al those
Towns and places following: First Clyffe Church, and that I took Northeast and
by East, and the sixth part of a point to the Eastwarde: the next was West
Tilbrye Church, North, and. of a point to the Eastwardes, and then I took the
Bulwark of West Tilbrye, North, and. of a point to the Westwardes: and then I
took Brauesende Church steeple, North and by West, and. parts of a point to
the Westward: and then I took little Thurrock, Norwest and by North, and the
6. part of a point to the Westward: then I took Grayes Thurrock Northwest,
and the 6. part of a point to the Westward: then I took Saint Clements
Church, West, Northwest, and. to the Northwardes: then I took North fleet
Church, West and ^/4;. parts of a point to the Northwards: then I took
Swankam Church, due West: then in like manner I took the Vinyard Mill, West,
Northwest, and. part of a point to the Westwardes: then I took Mappam Church
Southwest, and. part of a point to the Westwardes: then I took Cobbam Church,
Southea^t, and by South, and. part of a point to the Southwardes: then I
took Shorn Mile, East, and by South, and. parts of a point to the
Southwarde: Then I took Chaulke Church, East, and. of a point to the
Southwardes: and so I make an end of that standing.

And now I chose out for my second stading, West Tillary church, I did draw a
Lyne fro the Center of the Circle to the Circumference of the Circle, to the
title of Tilberye Church being North, and. of a point to the Eastwarde. the
Lyne passing right to the edge of the paper. And then I took a pair of
compasses, and set the one foot of the compasses upon that Line, and with the
other foot I made a Circle: and then I made an other Meridian lyne by the
other in the other Circle, so that the one did agree with the other: and then I
divided the Circle into 32. equal parts, and then I went over the water to
West Tilbery Church, and then I laid my instrument before me, and set it due
North and South, and there I observed al the towns and places before named: as
Cliffe, East and 1/^. part to the North: Shorn Mile, and Chalk Church, South
East by South, and. parts to the Southward. Cobbam Church, South and by East,
and. part to the Southwards.

Ruggon Hill, the Mill South, ^. to the Westwards. Mepham Church, South and by
West, and. to the Westward. Tilberye Bulwark and Grauesend, South, Southwest,
and. to the Southwardes. North Fleet Church: Southwest, and. to the South.
Swanskam Church, Southwest, and. to the Westward. Saint Clements church,
west, and by South, and. part to the West. Grayes thurrock, West, and. parts
to the South. Little Thurock, West, and. parts to the Southwarde. The Vineyard
Mill, West, and. part to the Southwarde. And so I make an end. And then I drew
lines from the Center of the Circle to the Circumference, to the title of the
names of the Towns, and so I passed by the right lines to the furthest parts
of the paper, first upon the one Circle, then upon the other, till that I had
drawn so many Lines as that there were Towns in both Circles: and there where
that the Lines did cross the one the other, I made a mark: For there stands
the Town, as by this Ensample it doth appear.



The.16. chapter shows you how for to make a Trouke or skalle of measure in a
map or Card, whereby you may know the distance in miles that it is from one
town to an other.
Now this being done, you may know the distance from any one town to an other.
For as many towns as you have observed, and if you list you may go from place
to place, till that you have observed and taken all the Towns in a whole
region or country, as thus: first measure the distance in miles fro any one
town to another, then that distance being known, make a Tronke or Skall of
measure with a pare of compasses, according to the distance taken with the
compasses between those.2. How to make a tronck or Skal of measure to know the
distance fro any one town unto another.
towns in the paper. Then that being truly divided into miles and half miles,
and quarters of miles, then you may know the distance from one town to an
other thorough all a whole region or country, by the replying it with a pair
of compasses, as you may perceive by the rule or Skall made upon the other
side of the paper: and the roundles with the pricks in the middle, be miles:
and the pricks measured between them, is one quarter of a mile: as ensample,
for the making of a Tronke or Skall. First, I measured the distance between
Northfleete Church Grauesend Church, found the measure upon the right lyne a
mile and half a quarter: and then I made a Tronke of Skall in the card, as
thus: then I toke a pair of compasses, and measured the distance from the
crossing of the.2. lines of the.2. circles of the Title of Grauesende, and the
Title of Northefleete: and then I finding the measure to be a mile and.. parts
of a mile, I did rebate the.8. part of a mile: and then that which did remain
was just a mile: and then according to that proportion of measure, I made a
Skall or Tronke of measure on the side of the.2. Circles, and divided it
into.4. equal parts, and every one of these parts to be one quarter of a
mile, as by the demonstration before made, it doth appear. Now whenever that
you do desire for to know the distance from any one town to an other, An
ensample how to reply a pair of compasses to know the distance unto any town
assigned in any card or Map.
then take your compasses, and open the compasses to the wideness between
the.2. towns, that the one foot might stand upon the one Town and the other
upon the other. Then set your compasses to the Skall or Tronke of measure:
there shall you see the distance of miles open with half miles and quarters of
miles: as for ensample this, by certain places before named, which is (Clyffe
Church, and the vinyarde mylle,) and the third to be Grauesende. And the
vinearde mill, and Clyffe church, the one bears from the other by a right
lyne East west. Clyffe Church a quarter and half a point to the North of the
East, and the vinyard mill a quarter of a point to the South, of the west, and
the distance between them by a right lyne, over the water and the land.8. miles
and.. parts of a mile: and Clyffe Church bears from Grauesende, East,
Northeast, and to the North: and the distance over the water and the land by a
right lyne, 4. miles and. part of a mile. Then the vinyarde mill bare from
Grauesende, West and by North, and part of a point to the North: and the
distance to the mill from Grauesend.4. mile and.. parts of a mile: as by this
ensample it doth appear. And now you knowing the distance unto any place
assigned, you may know the height of any hill, or the deepnesse of any valley,
by the order declared in the Chapter there by the Scall, or else by the degrees.

The vinyard mile.


The.17. Chapter shows unto you how you may make a card or map for any
country, placing in it the true Longitude and the true Latitude: And also how
for to know the true longitude and the true latitude.
NOw furthermore, if that you list, you may make a card, bewtify it at your
pleasure, make it fairer, you may draw the longitude and the latitude of every
place, as thus: first, you may take the distance of every Town and Village,
and Hill, or any other notable mark whatsoever it be, and then make a mark
for the name of such a Town, according to the observation that you have
observed before: both the distance, and towards what cost of the country the
Town doth decline, according to the crossing of the.2. lines, placing in it
the principal ryuers or waters: and then in the very middle of the map or
card make a Meridian lyne, to the intent for to rule al the rest of the work.
And then in the margent of the card, from the South to the North, How to make a
card or pl^ Tipograph^e and to place the longitude and the latitude in it.
upon both of the edges of the map or card, place the latitude of the
country, (that is to say) at how many degrees that the pole Arctic is lifted
above your Horizon, as you may know it by your Astrolobe, by the altitude of
the same upon the Merydian lyne, knowing what declination, the Sun hath upon
that day of the month that you take the height of the Sun. How to take the
latitude of any place.
And then if that the Sun hath North declination, you must substract or pull
away the Suns declination with degrees and minutes: if South declination, you
must add or put to the Suns declination with degrees and minutes: and then
that which shall remain shall be the altitude of the Equinoctial. Then pull
that sum out of.90. degrees, with degrees and minutes: the remainder shall be the
height of the North pole Arctic above the Horizon.

And furthermore, you may know the latitude of any Town or Country by the
stars of the South, or stars of the North, knowing there just declination
from the Equinoctial, doing by them as you do by the Suns declination in
all points. And then if that they be Northern Stars, you mu^t know the
distance from the pole, and then if that the star be above the pole then you
must pull that sum away with degrees and minutes. And if the stars at the
time of your taking of them, be under the North pole, then put to that which is
the distance of the star from the pole, unto the height of the star: and
that in like manner shall show unto you the true height of the North pole
Arctic above the Horizon. And then in the margin of the map of the East side
and of the weast side, you may write the latitude directly, in that East and
west lyne of that place which you have observed the latitude of the North pole:
and then that being truly known, you may know the true latitude of all the
towns in a whole country or Region, knowing the distance to every town or
place, as thus. Every.60. miles going directly South and North, doth answer
unto one degree.

And then further, if that you would place the longitude, and that you cannot
get without a globe, or else a Card Cosmographye, or else you must follow
some author who hath written thereof, and because you cannot get the longitude
with no instrument, for that the whole frame of the firmament with all the
lights thereof be carried round about in 24. hours, so that there remains no
mark nor light that stands still, but only the two poles of the world:
therefore I will show unto you how that you may get the longitude with a globe
or Card Cosmographye, so that it be truly placed in it.

How to know the longitude.
First you must measure the longitude from the Meridian of the Canary Lands,
or other wise called the fortunate Lands, and so take the number of degrees
from that place unto any other that hath that same Meridian that your Town or
place hath: and that shall be the number of the degrees for your place.

And then you having one place true, you may find the just longitude in a
whole region or country.

But there is one special thing to be noted, and that is this: The degrees of
longitude be not so many miles in length as the degrees of latitude. For as
those places that be to the south parts of this side or under the Equinoctial
be as lunge as the degrees of latitude, so that to any of the 2. poles shorter
shorter, as I have declared in the.16. Chapter of my book called the Regement
for the Sea, as by this Ensample it doth appear, by the Realm of Englande.



Now whenever that you do desire to know the longitude and the latitude of
any town or place in a card, after that the Map or Card is drawn, then
do this: First, by the ensample before made, hold a lyne or a string, How to
know the longitude the latitude in a Card or Map.
the Map lying flat plain upon a table before you. And first for the latitude,
hold the lyne East and West right over the town and place, then by the
ensample before made, you do see the latitudes be upon the East side, and upon
the West side: then by the lyne you shall know how many degrees and parts of
degrees, the Pole is raised above the Horizon. And then in like manner for to
know the longitude of any town in a Map or Card, then hold the lyne due
South and North right over the town or place whose longitude you do desire
for to know: and for to hold it due South and North, which is called your
Meridian lyne, you must do this: For that the degrees be shorter to the North
parts, then they be to the Southe side or parts of the Map or Card,
therefore you must seek the number of degrees both at the South side and at
the North side all at one time: holding the lyne proportionable right over the
town: that is to say, half degree for half degree, and quarter for quarter,
and so forth to the least part of a degree.

The eighteenth Chapter shows unto you how you may place all the principal
rivers or waters truly in any Card or Map.
NOw furthermore, as it is sufficiently declared before, how for to describe or
draw a Map or Card, for a whole region or Country, and also how to find the
distance from one Town to an other: therefore for that it is one of the
special matters, in like manner to draw or describe the principal ryuers or
waters within a Region or Country into a Map or Card: therefore after that
you have observed all the notable Towns and places worthy of memory, then if
you canne take a Boat and so go all the whole length of the water or river in
the very middle between both the lands, and then with a Mariners Compass you
may see how that the river doth trent or turn: then you having the
observation about you, then you may know how long that the water doth trent by
that point, or wind by the marks of the land, How to place the rivers or
waters in a Card or Map
which you have before observed: and then so often as the water doth turn or
Compass about, you shall see by your Sea mans Compass, and howe much: and
still you shall know the length by the mark upon the shore.

And then you must draw a crooked lyne into the Paper that you have noted those
Towns and places, in the Region where that the principal places be, according
to the crossing of the 2. lines, in every place the crooked Lyne to be made
according to the trentinge of the River or Water, and every treminge to be
according unto that point or Wind that the Compass did show to you: and this
being done, you may know the wydenesse of the Water by the observation before
taken, and then you may draw your Plates, and so bewtifye it at your pleasure,
taking the crooked Lyne from the very middle of the Water.

The Argument of the second Book, of the Treasure for Travellers.
The second book of the Treasure for Travailers, showing howe by the longitude
and latitude of any City, Town or place, for to know the distance in miles
unto them, and also by what point or wind of the compass they be from you.
And also there is showed in this book, how divers notable Cities, Towns or
places, do bear from the City of London, both in Europe, Africa, Asia and
America, with sundry principal Lands in the sea, both by what distance they
be in miles from London, and what wind or point of the compass they are fro
London, also their longest day, the diversity aspect, that is to say, howe much
the Moon shall change rather or later, then it doth at the City of London:
being very necessary for all sorts of traualers either by Sea or by Land:
Written by william Bourne.

To the courteous Reader.
Friendly Reader, there is contained in this second Book, how by the
longitude and the Latitude, to know the distance unto what quarter of the
world that any place assigned is from you: that is to say how many miles,
(according unto our english account) and by what point of the Compass any
City or Town, or any other notable Place is from you wheresoever you be,
upon the face of the whole Earth.

And for that the City of LONDON is the most notable, the famousest place
here in ENGLANDE, therefore I have thought it good, to assign the City of
London to be the place appointed, how far sundry notable Cities and Towns,
and other places worthy of memory are from the city of London, both their
distance in miles, unto what quarter of the world they do bear from the City
of London, according to their longitude and latirude, accordingly as sundry
authors have set down their longitude and latitude: and also there is
contained in this second Book, the diversity aspect, that is to say, how
much that the Moon shall change rather or later, then it doth at London,
according unto the Longitude of the places that are mentioned in this second
Book: and also the length of the longest Summer day at the places named in
this second Book, according unto the latitudes of the places set down in
this second Book. And for that there is no person that hath travailed
generally through the face of the whole earth, therefore they must needs of
force follow such authors, as have written thereof, whether they be true or
not: and therefore you must needs take the as they be, for otherwise I know not
how it is possible for to do it, but only to follow the best and most Learned
authors that have written in those causes. And yet the learned men that have
been before time, must of force follow those that have given unto them the notes
of the longitude and the Latitudes of any places that they have not been at
them selves, whether they be true or not. And there be a number of persons,
who if they do find but a small fault in any Book, then by that means they
will go about to discredit the whole matter, often repeatinge the matter, if
they do find any error in it: as who should say, what a cunning man he is,
although in all the rest of the whole book, he is not able to say any thing
thereunto. And it may be possible, that he may have no judgment in the rest
of the causes how necessary so ever the rest of the substance of the matter
is.

Wherefore (gentle Readers) if you do find any fault in this Book, then
gently give me warning thereof: and if you do amend the faults therein
contained, then I shall be the more beholding unto you c. For as touching the
longitude and the latitude of places, men must credit those that have been
there, for the truth of the matter: and yet every man that hath been at any
place, cannot do it, for the.100. person that hath travailed unto places, is
not able to take the true latitude, but much less the longitude of any place.
And furthermore, as touching the true distance unto any place assigned, that
cannot be by any one point of the Compass, as is declared in this Book. c.
And thus (gentle Readers) I betake you unto the almighty God for evermore.

The second book of the treasure for Travailers.
The first Chapter of the Second book, showing you how for to know the
distance unto any Town upon the face of the earth, and what is to be
considered in the doing thereof. c.
Now begins the second book, showing by longitude and by latitude the
dystance unto any Town, or City, or place upon the face of the earth, keeping
one point or wind over the Sea and LAND, although that it be not the very
nearest way, for the very nearest way over the Sea and Land can not be by one
point of the Compass, except it be upon the Meridian lyne, that is, due South
or due North from you: or being under the Equinoctial, to be due East or West.
But if it be in any other place from under the Equinoctial, although it be due
East or West, The nearest way over the Sea and Land is not by any one point of
the compass.
both the places to be under one Parallel: yet in the going due East and West,
is not the nearest way over the Sea and Land, but the next way over the Sea and
Land is, by diverse wyndes or points of the compass: and the further fro the
Equinoctial to either of the two poles, the greater changing of the points of
the compass. For the next way over the Sea and the Land, unto any place, is to
go by the great circle which is equal unto the Equinoctial or the Meridian
circle, which will not be according unto any one point of the compass, but
unto divers: as for proof thereof you shall have this for an ensample thus: An
ensample.
that in the latitude of.60. degrees that there were two Towns or places in
that parallel, the one being opposite or right against the other, that is.180.
degrees, and a degree in that parallel doth contain.30. miles. And now to go
just East or West in that parallel, to come unto the place assigned, it is.5400
miles: as for proof thereof, multiply.180. times.30. but that is not the next
way unto the place assigned: but the next way is to go by the Merydian lyne,
that is to say, to go due North, until you do come right under the pole, and
then to go by that Merydian, due South, till you have that latitude again:
and then it is but.3600. miles, as you may know by plain multiplycation, as
it is from the latitude of.90. degrees, unto the pole, to go due North.30.
degrees, and from the pole, Southward again, other.30. degrees, that is in
all.60. degrees: and then to multyply.60. times.60. it shows the true
dystance, which is but.3600. miles. And to go by the parallel lyne, that is
due East or West, then it is.5400. miles, that is half so much more, as by
plain proof you may know. But if the two places be both vnderneth one
parallel, be shorter the 180. degrees asuder, the it requires to go by diverse
points of the compass, and not by the Meridian, The greatest compass of the
earth, 21600 miles
according unto the passing of the great circle, which doth contain in
circumference 21600. miles, which is the greatest compass of the earth, and
not according unto more paralels then one, which is the Equinoctial, nether unto
no one point of the compass: for any point of the Compass will bring you unto
the poles of the world, or very near, except those that be pararel, which
is East or West, Al the points of the compass will bring you unto the pole of
the world except the East or West.
as all right lines draw being extended, exceptynge lines parallel, will
Cross the other in the end: so all the points of the Compass do wind
vntyl they do come unto the poles or very near the poles of the world, as
they be all Hilicall or Spherall lines.

Wherefore there is no one point or wind, that can be prescribed to be the
next way by that point unto any place assigned, but only the Meridyan lyne or
lines: and to go East and West, then to be under the Equinoctial, for the
next way else is by sundry points of the compass c.

Wherefore I omit to say any more thereof, but only to show unto you, how
for to know the dystance unto any Town or place situated upon the lace of the
whole earth, by any one assigned point of the compass, then for to know the
true distance over the Sea and the land. And I do show it this way, You
cannot pass the nearest way for it is thorough the frozen zones.
for two causes, the first is this, for that it is not possible to pass the
next way, by the means of the frozen Zone. Wherefore it is supposed, that it is
not navigable in those Seas, neither passageable by land in those Countries:
and the second cause is this, as before is declared, in the going the next
way, it doth require to go by sundry points of the compass, which would
be but a confused matter, for the most part of those persons that do desire to
know the distance unto any place assigned, neither shall he know so readily
which way it stands, or bears from him.

A confused matter to say a place doth stand by diverse points of the
compass.
And furthermore, in the knowing the distance unto any place assigned, and by
what point of the compass it bears, this is to be considered, that the
Longitude doth begin at the Meridian of the Cannary Island, and so to follow
unto the Eastwardes, and so ending at.360. again at the Cannary Ilandes, as I
do show in my book called the Regiment for the Sea.

The second Chapter shows unto you, howe you may know the distance unto any
Town situate upon the face of the whole earth, so that you do^ know the true
Longitude and the true Latitude of them.
NOw furthermore, if that you do know the Longitude and the Latitude of any
town or towns, situate upon the earth, you may know the distance unto them,
as before is declared, as thus: If that the town be just East or West from
you, that is to say, that your town or place is under the Parallel that the
other town is, To know the distance of any town from you, if that both the
places are in one Parallel.
that is to say, that the Pole artike of that town or place is so many
degrees above the Horizon as your town is, both in degrees and minutes: then
shall you seek how many degrees of Longitude, the other town doth differ fro
yours: then you shall seek how many miles that one degree shall answer unto
it, in that parallel, and then you shall multiply the one by the other, that is
to say, the degrees by the miles: and that sum which comes of that
multiplication, shall be the distance between the two towns: as for ensample,
thus: by the City of London Answerpe in Brabant, which differs but.4. An
ensampl^.
minutes in Latitude: for at London, the Pole is raised.51. degrees.32.
minutes, and at the City of Antwerpe, the Pole is raised.51. degrees.28.
minutes, therefore we be both under one parallel. Now the Longitude of London is
from the Cannarie Ilandes.19. degrees, and.54. minutes, and Antwerpes Longitude
is.26. degrees.36. minutes, so that Antwerpe stands East from London.6.
degrees.42. minutes. Now must I know how many miles a degree contains in that
parallel, (and of that I do make mention in my book called The Regiment for
the Sea, in the.16. Chapter) and that I do find to be.37. miles to one
degree. The I multiply.6. times.37. because that it is.6. degrees.37. miles to
one degree: and of that multiplication there comes.222. Then there is.42.
minutes more, and that.42. minutes contains near.26. miles: so that the
whole sum of miles from London to Antwerpe, by a right East line over the
Sea, and the land, is.248. miles. Now furthermore, if that town or place have
that Longitude that your town hath, and hath another Latitude, To know the
distance if that both the places are in one Merydian.
that is to say, that it doth stand due South or North from you, having all
one Meridian lyne, then must you look howe many degrees the other town is
Southe or North from your town: and then you knowing that, you may know the
distance to any Town or place that stands underneath your Meridian,
allowing.60. miles for every degree of Latitude, as for ensample thus: by the
City of London, and Roane in Normandie, An ensample.
which hath in manner all one Longitude, as the City of London hath.19.
degrees.54. minutes of Longitude, as before is declared: so hath the Town of
Roane.20. degrees.3. minutes, which differs 6. miles to the Eastwardes of the
Meridian of the City of London, and as it is before rehearsed, that the
latitude of London is.51. degrees and.32. minutes, the Latitude of Roane is 49.
degrees and.10. minutes: so that Roane stands.2. degrees.22. minutes to the
Southwardes of the City of London.

And then multiply.2. times.60 which makes.120. and then there is.22. minutes
more, then that comes to.22. miles, so that.120. miles, and.22. miles, makes
in al.142. miles, the distance between the City of London and Roane, ^uer the
sea land, by a right lyne between them. Now furthermore, if so be that any
town or country hath an other longitude and an other latitude, then yours
hath, then to knew the distance between the, you must work thus: First,
look what latitude that your town hath, and then look the latitude of the
other town that you would know the distance unto, Howe to know the distance,
if that both the places doth differ both in longitude and in latitude, that is
to say, yt is neither under your parallel nor Meridian.
then that being known, you must seek the longitude of the other town howe
much it doth differ from yours: then look howe many miles of the latitude
will answer to one degree: then that number being multiplied, the number of
degrees by the miles, and that shows howe many miles that it is from the
Meridian of your town to the Meridian of the other town. Then the other town
hath an other latitude then yours hath, and if the town be to the Northwardes
of your town, then the degrees of that parallel, shall be shorter then the
degrees of your parallel, and if the latitude of the town be to the South
parts of your town, then shall the degrees of the parallel be longer then the
degrees of the parallel of your town. Then in like manner as you have
multiplied the number of miles by the degrees of your town, so in like manner
you shall seek howe many miles will annsweare unto one degree in that
parallel: Then multiply the degrees by the miles, and it will show unto you
the distance of miles from the other town too the Meridian of your town:
then the distance of the Southernmost town, from the Meridian, is more miles
then the other town is.

Therefore you shall add or pull both your nubers together, and then take half
that for your East and West line, then shall you multyply the number of miles
in it self, and keep it in memory: then you knowing the number of miles of
Latitude, that the one Town doth differ from the other, then in like manner you
shall multyply that number in it self, then the multiplycation of both the
numbers you shall add together, then you shall by extraction of Roots, seek
the square Root ^ that being known, shall be the just distance by that
point or right Lyne over the Sea and the Land, from the one Town to the
other: as for ensample thus:

By the City of London, An Ensample by Hierusalem and the City of London.
and the City of Hierusalem now being destroyed, which was sometime the most
famous City on earth, and the Latitude of London, as before is declared, being
51. degrees 32. minutes, and every degree of our parallel is 37. miles: and the
Latitude of Hierusalem is 31. degrees, and 22. minutes, then for every degree
in that parallel, shall be 51. miles. Then I knowing the Longtitude of the
City of London for to be 19. degrees and 54. minutes, then I do seek the
Langtitude of Hierusalem, and I find it for to be 65. degrees, and 45.
mynutes. Then I do pull away 19 degrees 54. minutes, out of 65. degrees 45.
minutes, and then remains 45. degrees 51. mynutes, and so many degrees and
minutes is Hierusalem East from the City of London. Then first I do multiply
the miles in a degree of our parallel, as this: being 45. degrees and 37.
miles to one degree. Therefore I do multiply the one by the other, that is 45.
times 37. and of that multiplycation comes 1665. then 51. minutes more, and
that comes near unto 32. miles: then put 32. unto 1665. that makes 1697.
and so many miles it is from the City of London unto the Meridian lyne of
Hierusalem.

And now you must multiply the number of degrees into miles for the latitude
of Hierusalem, which is 51. miles to one degree in that parallel, and the
degrees be in number 45. degrees 51. minutes: Therefore I do multyplye 45. by
51. and of that multyplycation there comes 2295. Then there is 51. minutes
more, and that comes near unto 44. miles: and put 44. unto 2295. and that
makes 2339. and so many miles it is between Hierusalem and the Meridian lyne
of the City of London. Then this being done, I do add both the numbers
together, that is to say, the number of miles in the parallel of London between
both the Meridians, the one being.1697. and the other for to be 2339. then
adding both these numbers together, makes 4036. then take half that number
for your true East and West lyne, which will be 2018. miles: then I do seek
the diversity beeweene the 2. paralels as thus.

The pole arctic of London is raised 51. degrees and 32. mynutes, and the pole
arctic of Hierusalem is raised 31. degrees and 22. minutes. Then I do
substract 31. degrees 22. mynutes, out of 51. degrees 32. minutes, the
remainder is 20. degrees 10. minutes: then I do multiply the number of
degrees by miles, 60. miles to one degree, because that they be degrees of
Latitude, thus.20. times 60. of that multiplication comes.1200. and then
there is 10. mynutes more, and those 10. minutes comes to 10. miles: so that
the whole sum of miles from the parallel of London to the parallel of
Hierusalem, is 1210. miles. And now for to find the true distance over the Sea
and the land by a point or lyne: you must do thus by the exctactions of
roots. First, you must multiply the Longitude and the number of miles in it
self, as it is before rehearsed: the half of the miles of the distance
between the 2. Meridians of both the Latitudes added together, that is to
say, as before is rehearsed.2018. times 2018. and of that there comes
4072324. Then multiply the distance between the 2. paralels in it self,
that is to say, 1210. times 1210. of that multyplycation there
comes.1264100. Then I must add or put both these nubers together, and these
2. numbers being both together, From Hierus^lem unto London 2352. miles. and 25
26.
are 5536424. This being done, you must extract the square root of this
number, and the square root of 5536424. makes 2352. And 4520/4704. part, and
that doth contain in miles from Hierusalem to London by a right lyne over the
Sea and the Land 2352 miles, and near 25/26. parts of a mile, the just
distance between Hierusalem and the City of London. A second Ensample by
Venice and London.
So that the longitudes and the latituds be true.

Yet furthermore, for your better Ensample, by the City of Venice, as the
longitude of London is 19. degrees and 54. minutes, the longitude of Venice is
35. degrees 30. minutes. Therefore substract or draw 19 degrees 54. minutes out
of 35. degrees.30. minutes, the residue shall be 15. degrees, 36. minutes. Then
Venice is 15. degrees.36. minutes, to the Eastwarde of London, then the
latitude of London being 51. degrees and 32. minutes, the latitude of Venice is
44. degrees and 45. minutes. Then take 44. degrees 45. minutes out of 51.
degrees 32. minutes, the remnant shall be 6. degrees 47. minutes. So that
Venice is 6. degrees 47. minutes to the South part of London. Then you shall
multiply the number of degrees of longitude into miles, and first for the
parallel of London, as before is declared.37. miles to one degree: and the
degrees of longitude being.15. degrees.36. mynutes, you shall multiply 15.
times 37. and that comes to 555. Then there is 36. minutes more, and that
comes to 22. miles more. Then put.22. unto.555. and that makes.577. miles,
the distance between London, and the Meridian of Venice. Then you must seek
how many miles will answer to one degree in the parallel of Venice, that comes
to 43. miles to a degree. Then multiply the degres of longitude by the number
of miles in that parallel, that is 15. times 43. and that comes to 645 then
the 36 minutes more comes unto near 26. miles.

Then put.26. unto.645. and that makes.671. so that it is.671. miles from
Venice unto the Meridian of London. Then put both these numbers together, that
is to say, the distance between the Meridian of London and the Meridian of
Venice, in the parallel of London, and the parallel of Venice, the one being
577. miles, and the other 671. miles: and those 2. numbers being both together,
makes 1246.

Then take half that number for your East and West line, that comes unto
623. And now I do conclude, that Venice is East from London 623. miles. Then
you must multiply the degrees of latitude into miles 60. miles to one degree,
and the Latitude of Venice being 6. degrees to the South part of London:
therefore I multiply.6. times.60. and that comes unto.360, then there is 47.
minutes more, and that makes.47. miles: then put 47. unto 360. then it will be
407.

This being done, multiply the miles of longitude in it self, as 623. times
623. and that comes unto 388129. Then multyplye the latitude in it self,
that is to say, 407. times 407. and that comes unto 165649. then add or put
both these numbers together, that is to say, 388129. and 165649. and that
makes 553778. And now you must seek the square root of both these nubers
added together by extracting of roots, that will be 744 ^2/744. part, and that
it is near. part of a mile. So I do conclude that the distance from Venice
to London, by a right lyne over the Sea and Land, is 744. miles, and. part of
a mile: so that the longitude and the latitude be truly taken.

And thus may you do by all other Towns and places situate upon the face of
the whole earth, whether that the distance be much or little: so that you may
know the true longitude and the true latitude, and so resort to the true
length of the Parallel as before is declared.

The third Chapter shows how for to know unto what quarter of the World any
place doth stand from you, that is to say, by what point of the Compass,
you knowing the true Longitude and the true Latitude c.
ANd furthermore, you knowing the true longitude and the true latitude of any
Town upon the face of the whole earth, then you may know unto what quarter of
the world it doth bear or stand from you: that is to say, by what point of
the Compass, as this: If athat any two places have both one longitude, that is
to say, one Meridyan line, hath an other latitude, that is to say, that the
North pole is raised more degrees then yours is, then it is North from you: if
few degrees, then that bears South from you.

And also if that it hath your longitude, and have the South pole, North or
South.
above the Horizon, then in like manner the place is due South from you c. And
furthermore, if any two places have all one latitude, and hath another
longitude, being both in one parallel, and if that it have more degrees in
longitude, then your town hath, then that City, town or place, is unto the
Eastwardes of you. If fewer degrees in longitude, then your Town hath, East or
West.
then it is West, from your City, Town, or place, as in the Chapter going
before is declared. If that it be more degrees in longitude then your City,
Town, or place hath, by.180. degrees, then that place is West from you,
although both the places have one latitude, that is to say, in one parallel.
And then to know how many miles, you must first note the degrees of longitude
that it hath from the Meridian of the Canary Land: Note.
and then rebate that out of.360. and then add or put unto that number of the
longitude of your own place: and so multiply the number of miles in that
parallel, that shall show unto you the number of miles, that the City, Town, or
place is unto the Westward of your place, and the reason thereof is this, for
that the circumference of the earth is to go from the East unto the West,
is.360. degrees: and half that number is.180. degrees. And then if that it be
more degrees then it is Westwardes from you, 360. degrees is the Compass of
the earth.
and if that it be but just 180. degrees, then it is opposyte or right against
your place that is neither East nor West, nor no point of the compass else, if
that both the places were under the Equinoctial, or else if that the one have
the North pole, and the other have the South pole, both of one altitude, or
height above the Horizon. For then the one should be Antipodies the one unto
the other, that is to say, What Antipedies are, that go foot unto foot*
the one to go foot unto the foot of the other, the one of the one side of
earth, and the other on the other side of the whole earth, to have the whole
thickness of the earth between them. c. And furthermore for to know by what
other point or wind of the Compass that any place doth bears, then that is
thus known: the two towns or places to differ both in longitude and in
latitude, then as in the Chapter going before is declared, it is known, by
this order following. If that it have fewer degrees in longitude then your
place hath, and fewer degrees in latitude in like manner, then it is according
unto the degrees, and especially unto the number of miles, as thus: If the
place be short in longitude, and also in latitude, and both in like quantity,
that is to say, in the just number of miles, that it be no more miles from the
Meridyan of the two places then that it is from the parallel of the two places,
In the Southwest quarter.
then that place is Southwest from you just. And furthermore, if that the
distance in miles between the two paralelles be.5. times the distance between
the two Meridians, then that place is South and by West. And furthermore if the
distance in miles, between the two paralelles of any place assigned, be two
times a half so many miles, that is to say,. part of the distace between the
two Meridians, the that place is Southwest fro your places. And if that the
distance between the two Meridians be.3. quarters of the nubers of miles
between the two paralelles, then that place is Southwest by South from your
place. And if that the distance between the two paralels, be but.3. quarters of
the number of miles between the two Meridias, the that place is Southwest by
West from your place. c. And furthermore, if that the number of miles between
the two paralelles be but.. parts of the number of miles between the two
Meridians, than that place is West Southwest fro your place. And furthermore,
if the distance between the two paralels of any place assigned, be but the.5.
part of the number of miles between the two Meridians, that is to say, that the
number of miles be.5. times that number of miles between the two paralelles, the
that place is West by South from your place. c.

And furthermore, if that any Cities, towns, or places, be more degrees in
longitude the your Cities towns or place is, fewer degrees in latitude, the al
those places shall be in the Southeast corner, as al the other before rehearsed,
were in the Southwest corner, In the Southeast quarts.
as thus: The degrees multiplied into miles, both the longitude the latitude,
as in the chapter going before is rehearsed, then if that the number of miles of
the distance between the two parallels be equal unto the number of miles between
the two Meridians, the that place shall be just Southeast fro your place. And
furthermore, if that the distace of miles between the two Meridias, be but
the.5. part of the number of miles between the two paralelles, then that place
is South by East fro your city, town, or place. c. And if to.5. parts, that
is to say, that the number of miles between the two paralelles is more then the
number of miles between the two Meridians, by double half so much more, the
that place is South, Southeast fro your place. c. And furthermore, if that the
number of miles between the two Meridians be but.3. quarters of the number of
miles between the two paralelles, the that place is Southeast by South fro your
place. c. But if that the number of miles between the two paralelles be but.3.
quarters of the number of miles between the two Meridians, the that place is
Southeast by East fro your place. c. And if that the number of miles between
the two paralelles be but.. parts of the number of miles between the two
Meridias, the that place is east, Southeast fro your City, town, or place: c.
If but.. part of the number of miles between the two Meridians, then that place
is East and by South from your place. c. And furthermore, if that any place be
more degrees in longitude, also in latitude, then your place is, then those
Cities towns or places are in the Northeast quarter. In the Northeast quarter.
And (as before is rehearsed) if that the nubers of miles, be equal both
between the two paralelles, the two Meridians, the that place is Northeast
from you. And also if that the number of miles between the two Meridians be but
the.5. part of the number of miles between the two paralelles, then that place
is North by East: if. parts, then North Northeast: if. then Northeast by North.
c. And if the number of miles between the two Meridians be more then the
number of miles between the two paralelles, that is to say, the number of miles
to be but.. part, then that place is East and by North: if.. parts, then East
Northeast: if.. then Northeast and by East from your place. c. And furthermore,
if any place hath more degrees in latitude and fewer degrees in longitude then
your place, then those places be in the Northwest quarter. In the Northwest
quarter,
And (as before is rehearsed) if the number of miles be equal both between
the Merydians and the parallelles, then that is but Northwest: and if the
number of miles be less between the Meridians, then it is between the
paralelles, then (as before is said) if it be but.. part, then it is North
and by West: if.. parts, North Northwest. If.^/4. parts, Northwest and by
North. But if it be not so many miles between the two paralelles, as it is
between the two Meridians, if.. parts, that place is West and by North: if..
parts, West Northwest: if. An ensample by Rome and London.
then Northwest and by West fro your place. c. And for your better instruction,
you shall have ensample by the City of London and Rome: and as before is
declared, in the Chapter going before, that the latitude of London is.51.
degrees.32. minutes, and the longitude.19. degrees.54. minutes, and the
latitude of Rome 42 degrees just, and the longitude.36. degrees.40 minutes. And
(as in the Chapter going before is showed) in the knowing of the distance is
to rebate the less from the more: wherefore ^ebate the longitude of London out
to of the longitude of Rome, as thus: Rome being.36. degrees 40 minutes, in
longitude: so London is.19. degrees.54. minutes. So that there is.16.
degrees.46. minutes, between the Meridians of Rome and London. c. And the
latitude of London being.51. degrees.32. minutes; the latitude of Rome is.42.
degrees just. Wherefore rebate.42. degrees just, from.51. degrees.32. minutes:
then.9. degrees.32. minutes remains: so that there is just.9. degrees.32.
minutes between the two paralelles. And now to know by what point of the
Compass, do this: Rome is to the East wards of London.16. degrees.46. mi.
for that it is more degrees in longitude. Wherefore you most seek howe many
miles that it is, first in your parallel, and here at London.37. miles doth
answer unto one degree: therefore multiply.16. times.37. and that comes
unto.592. and then there is.46. minutes more, and that comes unto.28. miles,
and better. Then put.28. unto.592. and that makes.620. so that you may
conclude that it is.620. miles from London unto the Meridian of Rome in the
parallel of London. And now the latitude of Rome is.42. degrees, and then.44.
miles makes a degree in that parallel. Wherefore multiply.16. times.44. and
that makes.704. and then there is.46. minutes more, and that makes.33. miles
and better. Wherefore add.33. unto.704. there it will be.737. so that you may
conclude that it is from Rome unto the Meridian of London.737. miles. Wherefore
add or put both these two numbers toge^her, that is to say, 620. and.737. and
that makes.1357. And now take half this number, and that will show unto you
howe many miles that Rome is to the Eastwardes of London, and that is.678.
miles and a half: and now there is.9. degrees.32. minutes between the two
paralelles, and 60 miles make a degree. Therefore multiply.9. times.60. and
that makes.540. and then take.32. miles more for the.32. minutes,.32* put
unto.540. makes.572. so that Rome is.572. miles unto the Southwardes of
London, and now for that Rome is more degrees in longitude then London, and
fewer degrees in latitude then London, therefore then Rome must needs be in
the Southeast quarter: and to know just by what point, then look what both
the numbers be, as thus: Rome is unto the Eastwards of London 678. miles and.
and unto the Southwardes of London.572 miles, then viewing the two numbers.572.
is more then. of 678. Therefore you may conclude, that Rome doth stand from
London, Southeast and by East, and somewhat declining or leaning more unto the
Southwardes: and if that the numbers had been equal, then it had been due
Southeast. c. And to know howe many miles by that point of the Compass, that
is showed in the Chapter going before, and by this order you shall kn^w by what
point of the Compass that any place doth bear from you. c.

The fourth Chapter shows the Longitude and the Latitude, and by what point
of the Compass, that sundry places within England and Scotland, and Ireland,
and also of certain Ilandes, near unto them, doth bear from the City of
London, and what distance of miles that they are from London, by the point of
the Compass over the water and over the land. And also there is showed howe
much that the Moon shall change, rather or later then it doth at London,
and also it doth show the length of the longest Summers day, for as many
places as be named.
Now furthermore, in so much as I have showed unto you how by the longitude
and by the latitude, you may know by what point of the Compass that any
place assigned bears from you, and also at any place assigned for to know
the distance by that point of the compass, that is to say, howe many miles
that it is from you: so in like manner I think it good for to show the
longitude and the latitude of sundry principal places upon the face of the
whole earth, according unto diverse Authors that have written thereof, and also
for that the City of London is the principal and most famous place here in
England, London is the principallest and the most famous place of England.
I will declare or show unto you, by what point of the Compass that any of
those places do bear or decline unto, from the City of London, and also howe
many miles by that point over the Sea and London by that right lyne or point of
the compass. And also I do think it good for to show unto you the
diversity aspect of all those places by the City of London, The diversity
aspect at London.
that is to say, howe much that the Moon shall change rather or later then
that it shall do at the City of London, whereby may be known the time of
any Eclipse either of the Moon or Sun, and also the aspects of the Moon
with the other planets, you knowing at what hour or time that it will happen
or be at London.

And also I do think it good for to show unto you the length of the longest
Summer day in all those places that shall be named according unto the longitude
and latitude, The length of the day.
and then the length of the shortest Winter day is soon known: and the day
is meant to be, from the Sun rising unto the Sun setting. For the latitude
of places doth alter the length of the day, and the longitude doth alter the
times of the Eclipses either of the Sun or of the Moon, with all the other
aspects, that the Moon hath with the Sun or any other of the Planets. c.

And now shall follow the longitude and latitude and the other things before
rehearsed, of certain places, and first for England, and Scotlande, and
Ireland, with some Ilandes belonging thereunto.

And for that London is the assigned place the longitude thereof from the
Canary Land being 19 degrees 54. minutes, London the assigned place.

The tenth Chapter is as touching certain things in the knowing of the
distance unto any place assigned by Longitude and by Latitude. c.
AND furthermore, insomuch as the shortest distance unto any place assigned,
cannot be by any one point of the Compass, as is before declared in the first
Chapter of this second book, wherefore if that you do desire for to know
the distance over the Sea and Land, the next way, and the shortest
distance, If that you do desire to know the shortest distance unto any place,
then you must do it with a Globe.
then you must prepare a Globe terrestrial, and that the longitude, and the
latitude of the Towns and Cities, and other notable places, to be truly
placed on the Globe: and then take a pair of Compasses, and then look those
two places in the Globe, that you do desire for to know the true distance
unto, and then open your Compasses, and set the one foot on the one place, and
the other on the other place assigned, justly: and that done, then your
Compasses standing styffe and not removed, set them unto the Equinoctial
circle on the Globe, and that done, then look howe many degrees that it is
justly between the two feet of the Compasses, How to know the true distance
unto any place by the Globe.
and that being known, then multiply the number of degrees by 60. and that
shall show unto you the true number of miles, between any two places
assigned, and this being done precisely, taking the true number of degrees,
the parts thereof, you shall not fail of the truth, so that the Longitude and
Latitude of the places be truly set upon the Globe: and then 60. miles doth
answer unto one degree both under the Equinoctial, and the Meridians. The
whole compass of the earth is 28600 miles, no place can be no further distance
from you th^ 10800. miles.
And in every great Circle on the Globe of the Earth, whose whole circumference
or compass is 21600. miles, so that no two places assigned, cannot be further
distance asunder then 10800. miles, and then the one must be opposite, or right
against the other, being Antipodes, going feet unto the feet of the other,
and then as before is declared, it is neither East nor West, nor no point of
the Compass else, for which way soever that you do go by any right lyne,
the distance is all one, but if that any two places be not directly
Antipodes the one unto the other, then that is nearer one way, then that it is
another way: and yet it shall not be by any one point of the Compass, but by
diverse points of the Compass, as before is rehearsed, except that the two
places be both under one Meridian, or else under the Equinoctial. c.

A Table of the Contents of the chapters of the second part of this Book
called a treasure for Travellers.
FIrst to the Reader of this second part.

The first Chapter of the second part shows you how for to know the
distance unto any town upon the face of the earth, and what is to be
considered in the dooynge thereof.

The Second Chapter shows unto you, howe you may know the distance unto any
Town situate upon the face of the whole earth, so that you do know the true
longitude and the true latitude of them.

any place doth stand from you, that is to say, by what point of the
Compass, you knowing the true longitude and the true latitude.

The Fourth Chapter shows the longitude and the latitude, and by what point
of the compass that sundry places within England and Scotland and Irelande,
and also of certain Ilandes near, unto them doth bear from the City of
London, and what distance of miles they are from London, by the point of the
Compass over the water and the land: and also there is showed how much the
moon shall change rather or later then it doth at London, and also it doth
show the length of the longest Summer day, for as many places as are named.

Finis.
The Argument of the third Book, of the treasure for Travellers.
The third Book of the Treasure for Travellers, containing some matters for
the measuring of superfycialles, as Land, Board, Pavement, or Glass, and also
some matters as touching Solled bodies, as Timber, Stone, or such otherlyke:
and also howe to alter the Tonnage, burden, or bygnesse of ships, and to
keep that mold and proportion with other necessary things belonging
thereunto. c. Being very necessary for all sorts of people that travail
either by Sea or Land, written by William Bourne.

To the Reader of this third Book.
GEntle Reader, although Master Leonard Dygges in his Book called Tictonicon,
and also Master Thomas Dygges his Son in another Book, called Pantometry,
hath showed how for to measure al Superfycialles, as Land, Board, Glass,
Pavement or any such other like, also how to measure al manner of Solled bodies,
as Timber, Stone, such other like, yet notwithstanding I have written in this
third Book, a little brief note as touching those causes, and also how to
build ships for to make them of what tonnage or burden that you list, and
to keep any form in the mould or proportion that you list, whereby that any
Mechanical workmen by following the order in the Book prescribed, may make
any ship the one like the other, and to make them of what bygnesse or
smallness he list, and to keep that form and fashion in an points, both in
the mold that is under the water, and also in the fashion aloft, above the
water. And also there is contained in this third part, howe for to know the
bygnesse of Ropes, whether that it be as byg again, or three times so big
more or less, at your discretion, which in my opinion is very necessary to be
known, both unto Naupegers or ship Carpenters, and also unto all sorts of
Sea men: and also there is other necessary matters contained in this third
Book.

The third Book of the treasure for Travailers.
The first Chapter of the third Book, shows you howe for to caste the
contents of land by Arithmetic, and also by the husbands rule which is by
the account of money. c.
Now begins the third Book, for that it is necessary for to know how to
measure all manner of plat forms and bodies, both their superficial
contents, and also there masey contents. Therefore as briefly as I may I will
show unto you: yet there hath famous and wise men written thereof in our
English tongue as M. Leonard Dygges, and M. Thomas Dygges, his son, other
notable men seen in the Mathematical Sciences. Therefore I do intend to
treat the less thereof, and especially of those things that those have
written of, I will not meddle withal at this time, for that they have
sufficiently declared it, as this: for to know the contents of Land, to be
measured in Triangles, being sure for to make a square angle and so forth, as
M. Dygges doth declare in his Tictonicon, and for to cast the contents
thereof, you shall do this: To know the cotentes of account of any piece of
ground by Arithmetike.
When you have found a length and a breadth of any piece of ground, whose
contents in Acres you do desire for to know, you shall do it by Arithmetike,
as thus. You shall multiply the length with the breadth, then that number that
comes of that multiplication, you shall divide by.160. and that shall show
unto you the true numbers of Acres, then if there be any half rods or
quarters of roods, if that they be in breadth, you shall add then to the
length, and if that they be in length, you shall account them in the breadth,
and so forth. Now I do know that every man hath not Arithmetike, therefore
you shall make your account by this means, for to know the true contents of
the measure of any piece of Land, when you do know the length and the breadth
thereof, as thus: by the account of money, every mark for to conteyne one
Acre, To know howe many acres there is in any piece of ground by the account of
money.
as thus, by the account of money, every noble of money to conteyne half an
Acre, and every 3. shillings and 4. pence, to conteyne a rood or a quarter of
an Acre, and every groat or 4. pence to conteyne a days work, and every
penny to conteyne a pearche, or as some term it a rood, and for to cast the
contents of Land, do this, as by ensample of a piece of Land that is 30.
pearches long, and 24. pearches broad, the 24. pence is 2. shillings, then
being.30. roods long, that is 2. times.30. shillings, that makes in money 3.
pound, and 3. pound is.4. mark, and a noble, so that the piece of Land that
is.30. roods long, and 24. broad, doth conteyne 4. Acres and a half. Yet
furthermore for your better understanding, where there is half pearches and
quarter of pearches, both in the length and in the breadth, then you shall do
thus, by a piece of Land that is 53. roods long, and a half, and of breadth
42. and a quarter, then 42. pence makes 3. shillings and 6. pence: lay down
3. times 53. shillings, and that will be.7. pound and.19. shillings, and
then there is 6. pence more, in the breadth: and 53. half shillings makes 26.
shillings and 6. pence, then lay that to the other sum, and then it makes
9. pound 5. shillings and 6. pence, then there is in the length half a rood
more, therefore you must account it in the breadth, and 42. half pence makes
21. pence. Then lay that to the sum, then there is in the same breadth a
quarter of a rood more, and that you must reckon in the length: and 53.
farthings makes 13. pence farthing, then lay the same to the rest, and it
will make in money 9. pound 8. shillings and 4. pence ob. and that answers
to, in measure.14. Acres and 5. dares work, and about half a pearche, for
that you may know that.9. pound is 13. marks and a noble, and there is 8.
shillings, that is more then a noble by 4. grotes. Then put that noble to the
other noble, then that makes 14. marks, then the 4. grotes, put to the other
4. pence, makes 5. grotes, and so that piece of land which is 53. roods long
and a half, and 42. roods broad and a quarter, shall be in measure 14. Acres
5. days work, near half a perch. And by this account of money, you may know
the contents of any piece of land, better then you may know by any manner of
table or tables, and this serves both for the learned, and the unlearned, and
is generally called the husbandman's rule, for that he may as soon learn this
or sooner, then he shall understand the tables of measures, and that serves
but for a quantity of measure, and this serves generally for all manner of
measures, be it never so big or small, being sure for to cast the money right.

The second Chapter shows how to measure board and Glass, and to cast the
contents thereof, with other necesary things belonging thereunto.
NOw furthermore in like manner, for the measuring of board or Glass or any
such other like, for that it is sufficiently declared in tables, in Master
Digs his Tictonicon: yet notwithstanding thus you may know the contents
without any tables, as thus.

Look at what length your board is, multiply the number of feet into inches
12. inches to the foot, then that being done, multyplye the breadth with the
length, that is to say, the number of inches of the length, with the number of
inches of the breadth, divide that number by 144. and that shall show unto you
the number of feet: then if that there remain any thing, every 72. inches
makes half a foot, and then every 36. shall make. part of a foot, and for
that every man hath not Arethmetick for to cast it by, yet this is a ready way
that many Carpenters do use, and is exact ynouth, as thus.

If that the Board be more then a foot broad, then they do look how many
foot long the Board is: then ^hey account that that there is so many foot of
Board as the length of the board is, and then for the odd inches and parts,
they mete in the bredthe how much it is, and then with the rule, as often times
as there is foot long in the Board they do measure or set it down, and then
they do measure how many foot lunge it comes unto, and then they do say
that it is so many foot of board more then the length of the board is: and
that is true without any fail, as for ensample thus, by a board of 10. foot
lunge, and 14. inches and a half broad. Now for that the Board is 10. foot
lunge, then at twelve inches broad, there is 10. foot of board, and then
there is two inches and an half more in the breadth, and for that with the
inch rule that is laid down 10. times, for that the board is 10. foot
lunge, and that being measured howe long it reaches, it will be 25. inches
lunge, that is.2. foot and 1. inch, the that 2. foot put unto the 10. foot,
it makes.12. foot, so that you may conclude that a board of 10. foot lunge,
and.14. inches and. broad, that there is 12. foot and 1.12. part of a foot
of a board, without any fail, and thus you may do, howe broad or narrow so
ever that any board or Planck is.

A note of measure.
And furthermore, at one inch broad, then 12. foot long makes a foot of
board, at 2. inches broad, 6. foot long to a foot: at 3. inches broad 4.
foot lunge to a foot, at 4. inches broad 3. foot long to a foot, then at 5.
inches broad 2. foot and 5. inches long to a foot of board: at 6. inches broad
2. foot lunge to a foot of board, at 7. inches broad 1. foot and 8. inches
and a half to 1. foot of board, at 8. inches broad, one foot and 6. inches
lunge to one foot of board: at 9. inches broad 16. inches long to one foot of
board: at 10. inches broad 14. inches lunge and. to one foot of board, at 11.
inches broad 13. inches long and 1.11. part of an inch to 1. foot of board:
at 12. inches broad 12. inches long to one foot of board, at 13. inches broad
11. inches long and 1.13 part to one foot of board, at 14. inches broad 10.
inches and 2/7. parts of an inch lunge to one foot of board: at 15. inches
broad 9. inches and 9.15. parts of an inch long to one foot of board: at 16.
inches broad 9. inches long to one foot of board, at.17. inches broad 8.
inches and 1.2. long, to one foot of board, at.18. inches broad 8. inches
lunge to one foot of board, and for that there is no como bords sawne above
18. inches broad, therefore I leave of to proceed any further, if it chance for
to be brother the any of the measure before named: then you shall take one of
these measures before, that is half the breadth, and then you shall take half
the length for the true contents of the measure, and so forth at your
discretion.

And furthermore, You may know by Arithmetic how many inches in length will
make a foot of board whatsoever the bredthe is.
you may know how many inches long will make one foot of board whenever you
do know the breadth, as this. First look howe many inches that the board is
broad, then divide the breadth out of 144. and that shall show unto you the true
contents of inches, of length in one foot of board, with parts of inches
adding the remainder unto the breadth. And furthermore in like manner, for to
know the contents howe many feet there doth contain in any great quantytie,
as Pavement or Glass, or Chamber flowers, then multiply the length with the
breadth, By Arithmetic you may know how many foot there is in any great
quantyty.
and that shows unto you the true contents of the number of feet. Thus much
have I said for the measuring of all manner of plate forms, for that the
common people fall into such a number of errors for lack of Geometry
Arithmetic, as thus. Some will hold opinion that if any Square or Circle be as
much in measure more, they will say that it is but as big again, where that
it must needs of force be 4. times so big, as for ensaple by a Pavement that
is but 12. foot square every way, and an other Pavement (in like manner) 24.
foot square every way, now that Pavement being 12. foot square, contains
144. foot, and the other being 24. foot square every way, contains.576.
foot, that is 4. times so big as the other that is but 12. inches square, as
by this Ensample it doth appear. the one of these squares to be 12. foot
square, and the other 24. foot square: for if that you would have a square the
one to be as big again as the other, then if that it be a square root as
these 2. figures before made: Then look how many foot it is from corner to
corner, right against it, passing by the Center of the square, the length of
that Lyne from corner to corner, shall make an other square upon the four
sides as big again as the other from corner to corner: as for ensample thus.

By the square before made of 12. foot square every way, and the slope Lyne
from corner to corner, is 17. foot, lacking 1.33. part of a foot, which is
16. foot and 32.33. part of a foot. For as the square root of 12. is 144.
so the square root of.17. is 289. swhich is more by one foot, then the double
of 144. as by the enample before made it doth appear. And for your better
ensample, behold this Figure with the square root of.12. is cut from the
one corner to the other corner, and the length of that lyne from the one corner
to the other is 17. foot lacking 1.33. part of a foot, and yet for the more
plains, you shall have this ensample by the square before made of.12. foot
every way, and so being cut from corner to corner, it is 17. foot lacking
1.33. part: and when you have done, you shall put the 2. parts so cut a
sunder, together, laying the side 12. unto 12. and then it will make a Tryangle
as big as the square: then adding so much more unto it, will make a square
root just as big again, as by this ensample it doth appear.



Now furthermore, the square root of.17. lacking one 33. part, will be
corner to corner 24. foot, and it is a square root just as big again, as
that of sixteen foot and a 23. part of 33.

And now furthermore for Circles or lunge squares, all is one matter, as for an
ensample thus by a Circle of 12. foot broad, and the Compass shall be 37.
foot and 8. inches and better, for this is general for ever look how many
times 7. is in the Diameter, so many times 22. shall be the circumference. Or
now contrariwise: Look howe many times 22. you have in the Circumference so
many times 7. shall be the Diameter.

Now to the purpose: An ensample in Circles.
a Circle as much more in breadth or in Compass, shall make a Circle four
times so big in measure as the other, and for to measure a Circle truly, do
thus. First, knowing the Circumference and the Diameter, multiply^ the one by
the other, that is to say, the compass with the breadth, and then take the
fourth part of the measure, for the true contents of the Circle, or else take
half the Compass, and half the breadth: then multiply the one by the other,
that being done, it shows the just contents of the Circle, as for ensample
thus.

By the Circle of 12. foot broad, and the Compass 37. and 9. inches, and
half 12. is 6. and half 37. foot and eight inches is 18. foot and 10.
inches, and it being multiplied together, makes 113. foot, the true contents
of that Circle before named. And now there is an other Circle that is 24. foot
broad, and that comes unto in Compass 75. foot and 4. inches. And then
take half the Compass which is 37. foot and 8. inches and half the breadth,
and that is.12. foot, and then multyplye the half Compass with the half
breadth, and that makes.452. as by the ensample of these 2. Circles it doth
appear.



Now furthermore, if that you would have an other Circle to be just as big
again, or else in like manner the other being known, I would have a Circle
half so big, then bring your circle into a square root, not reckoning the
compassed part, and the length of the square shall make the Diameter of a
Circle just half so big, and that being doubled, it will make a Circle just
as big again as the other Circle, as by this ensample of a Circle of 24.
foot broad, and the roundness being cut a way, Ensamples of Circles.
it will make a square root of 17. foot square, lacking 1.33. part of a
foot: and then you may know what a Circle of 17. foot of Diameter lacking
1.33. part of a foot, will make an other Circle half so big as a Circle
of.24. foot of breadth, and as big again as a Circle of 12. foot broad: and
so forth in all points whether that they be Circles or squares, as by the
ensample of a lunge square of 12. foot lunge and 6. foot broad, and there is
an other square of 24. foot lunge and 12. foot broad.

Now the square of 12. foot lunge and 6. foot broad, An ensample of long
square^
contains but 72. foot, and the other of 24. foot long 12 foot broad,
contains in feet.288. which is four times so big as the lunge square 12.
foot lunge and 6. foot broad.

And for to make an other square as big again as that of 12. one way and 6.
an other way, that lunge square shall be 17. foot long, lacking 1.33. parts
of a foot, and of bredthe 8. foot and 16.33. part of a foot: as by these 3.
figures it doth appear: the one 12. foot long and 6. foot broad, and the
second.24. foot long and 12. foot broad, and the third 16. foot and 32.33.
long, and 8. foot and.16.33. broad. And the length of the ship lines from
corner to corner of that which is 10. foot lunge and 6. foot broad, is 13.
foot and 11.26. part of a foot: and that of 24. foot lunge and 12. foot
broad, shall be 26. foot and 11.13. part of a foot, the length of the
Hipothenusal lyne from the one corner to the other corner, and also the lunge
square of seventeen foot long lacks 1.33. part and near 8. inches and
1.2. broad, the slope Lyne from corner to corner, shall be nineteen foot
lunge lacking 1.36. part of a foot, which is 18. foot and 35.36. part of a
foot: and as it hath been often declared in this work, howe too know the
length of the slope Lines from the one corner to the other corner, being sure
for to make a square Angle.

And then by extracting of the root, as before is declared, you may know the
length of the Hipothenusall or slope Lines, as by this ensample: if that your
square do level, then you must be sure to make it square to your ground
lyne, as by this ensample is doth appear, by these 2. figures, and the pricked
lines do make the leuelles a just square Angle, both the sharpe Angle, and the
broad Angle, as you may see by these.2. figures before made. And furthermore,
for to know the proportio, how much the one is bigger then the other of any
superficial, whether that it be circles or square roots, if that you do know
the contents of the one, and would know howe much that the other is bigger or
lesser, then you knowing the contents of it already, then multiply them both
squarely, that done, How to know the quantytie or proportion of any Circle or
square what the one is biger then the other.
then if that you do know the contents of the lesser, and would seek the
contents of the bigger, then multiply the bigger number by the contents of
the lesser, and look what that comes unto, then divide that same by the
number of the lesser, and that will show you justly, what proportion that the
bigger is in quantity more then the lesser. Now contrariwise if that you do
know the contents of the bigger: and to know the contents of the lesser,
then multiply the contents of the bigger, with the number of the lesser, and
then divide that same by the number of the bigger, and that will show unto you
the proportion of the lesser, and by this order you may know the proportion
of any Triangles or lunge square, or what form soever that it hath, as it is
more plainelye hereafter showed in the 8. Chapter by the proportion of ropes.

The third Chapter doth show howe for to measure Timber, and to bring it to
a square, as well without Arithmetike as otherwise, and also howe for to know
the true contents of any piece of Timber.
NOw furthermore, for the measuring of all manner of bodies, as Timber or
stone, or any such other like, Master Dygges in his Book named Tectonicon,
hath made Tables of the squares of it: yet notwithstanding I will show unto
you, how that you shall know how many inches long will make a foot of any
portion of measure, as thus: first knowing the breadth and the thickenesse, and
you would know how many inches lunge will make a foot, then look howe many
inches that the breadth of the Timber is the brother way, and then in like
manner look howe many inches that it is in th^cke^sse the narrowest way, then
multiply the broader side, with the narrow side, then that number that comes
of that multiplication, How to know (...) many inches long in Timber will make
a foot what square s^nes that it hath by Arithmetike.
you must divide that sum out of.1728. then that sum that stands before
the quanti^ie lyne, shall be the number of inches in length of one foot of
Timber or stone: and then if there remains any thing, then if that number
which was the deuider if that it be half the number, then it is half an inch
more: if a quarter of the number, then one quarter of an inch: and if.3.
quarters of the sum, then 3.4. parts, and so forth to any part or parts
of the remainder. And then according to that, the proportion shall be so many
parts of an inch, as the remainder doth show, and thus you may know howe
many inches long will make one foot of Timber or Stone, without any squaring
of the Timber. And as Master Dygges in his Book called Tectonicon, hath made
Tables of the squares, that you may do by extractions of the root, as before
is declared in this work. And now for because that every person that
destreth for to know howe for to measure Timber, or any other thing, have not
all manner of Arithmetyke, therefore you shall have a Table of the squares of
Timber, The length of a foot of Timber according unto the square.
howe many feet and inches will make one foot lunge of Timber from one inch
square, and so from inch to inch, till that you come to.36 inches square, as
by this ensample it doth appear, and the uppermost row of this table is the
number of inches of the squarenesse. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17

1 3 7 1 1 3 13 11 3 15 1 The second, how many foot long will make one foot
of Timber, the third is inch, the 4. is parts of an inch, to be added 19 20

1 1 3 5 7 9 5 0 3 1 3 3 1 7 3 11 9 1 7 5 unto the number of feet, or inches,
as by these 2. Tables it doth appear. And now for the measuring of Timber or
Stone, look what that it comes unto in square number, then these tables
before made do show unto you, howe many inches and parts of inches will make
a foot lunge of that squares: and for because that every piece of Timber that
is to be measured, is not equally square, I will show unto you howe that you
may square it without extracting of the root, for that I know every person
hath not that kind of Arithmetike.

And furthermore, for to make Tables thereof, it were but superfluous, for that
Master Dygges in his Tectonicon, hath made Tables exact yenough for that
purpose.

And furthermore this I am assured of, that the reason how for to square their
timber, may be as soon beaten into the common peoples heads, and sooner, then
they will by instructions learn to understand the tables of squares. And now
to instruct them howe for to square their timber whenever that the Timber is
brother one way, then that it is another way, then do thus. First look howe
many inches that the Timber is the brother way, and then look howe many inches
that it is the narrow way, then when that you have done, How to square
Timber without ^rithmetike or tables.
reckon howe many inches that it is, more then the perfyte square, then take
that number of inches and put it into 2. equal parts: then that being done,
you shall lack a certain quantity for to fulfil one of the corners, and
that quantity you shall rebate upon the.2. sides, concluding thus, that it is
thus many inches square, lacking so much as the quantity in the corner did
show unto you, upon the 2. sides. And for your better instructions I will
give unto you certain ensamples, An ensample.
as thus, for the fi^st ensample is by a piece of Timber of 13. inches one way,
and 11. inches another way, and now you do see that the brother side is.2.
inches more then the narrow side: then divide the.2. inches into 2. equal
parts, and that is one inch to a part, and then you do see that it is.12.
inches one way, and.12. inches the other way, saving that it lacks one inch
at one of the corners, and that one inch will rebate upon the 2. sides of 12.
which is 24. inches, a.1.24. part of an inch, as by this figure it is
declared. And now I do conclude that this piece of timber 13. inches one way,
and 11. inches another way, doth make in square Timber 11. inches and 23.24.
parts of an inch, which is.12. inches, lacking 1.24. The second ensample.
part of an inch. And now to the second ensample by a piece of Timber, that is
12. inches one way, and 20. the other way. Now you do see that the brother
side is 8. inches more then the narrow side: therefore I do divide the 8.
inches into 2. equal parts, and that is 4. inches to a part, and then lay 4.
inches more to 12. inches, upon the 2. sides, that makes 16. inches square,
then their lacks.4. inches square at one of the corners, then multiply 4.
times 4. and that is 16. and then the piece of Timber being added unto the 2.
sides 4. inches unto 12. it makes 16. and 2. times 16. and that makes 32.
then that 16. inches that lacks in the corner being rebated from 32. will
rebate half an inch, for.16. whole inches will make.32. half inches.
Therefore I do conclude that the piece of Timber that is 20. inches one way
and 12. inches the other way, will make in square Timber 15. inches, and. the
true square thereof. The third ensample.
Now furthermore to the third ensample by such a piece of Timber that is.23.
inches one way, and but.7. inches the other way, then the broader square, is
more then the narrower by 1^ ^nches: then as before is declared, divide 16. into
3. equal par^, and it will be 8. to every part, and then put 8. inches in
breadth upon the two sides unto 7. it will make 15. so that it would make a
square 15. inches every way, saving that it lacks a great match in one of
the corners, then multiplying 8. times 8. it makes 64 then you must rebate 64.
inches out of the 2. sides of 15. inches, and 2. tunes 15. is 30. inches, and
the the square is but 14. inches: then 2 times 24. is 28. and when there is 30
pulled out of 64. then is there but 34. left: the rebate 28. inches more from
the 2. sides, then the square is but.13. inches square, and then.30. and.28.
being taken out of 64. then there rests but.6. and then at the.2. corners, as
first at 30. and then at 28. you shall rebate one inch at each of the corners,
one and 2. times one is 2 then put that 2. unto the 6 and it makes 8. and then
the square Timber is but 13. inches, and.2. times 13. is but.26. and yet there
is.8. inches to be rebated of from.26. and it comes unto 4.13. part of one
inch, so much the timber is less then.13. inches square: therefore you may
conclude that the piece of Timber.23. inches one way, and but 7. inches the
other way, shall make in square Timber 12. inches, and 9.13. part of one inch
just, and this is true, and thus may you square any piece of Timber,
whatsoever that it be, without any tables or extractyng of the root. And thus
I make an end of the ensamples, thinking this sufficient yenough for
instructions: and for to measure round Timber, or Timber that hath many square
sides, Master Digs hath sufficienly declared in his Tectonicon, saving that
for the measuring of round Timber, you must allow as I have declared in this
Book: that is to say, every Diameter of.7. inches, hath the circumference 22.
inches: and then to measure round Timber, take half the circumference, called
the compass, and half the Diameter, called the breadth, or thyckenesse: then
squaring that, it shall show unto you the true square of that Timber, without
any fail.

The fourth Chapter shows howe for too measure all manner of bodies, as
Timber, or stone, cubes, or globes: and to know what proportion of measure or
weight the one hath unto the other.
Now furthermore, for the measuring of al manner of bodies, that lacks part
of their form, and other that be more then their form, and other that be
mixed bodies, being in one place more then their form, and in an other place
lacks part of their form, in the measuring of them, you shall do thus. And
as it is declared before, in the measuring of Timber or Stone, or any such
other like, if so be that it be equally square or partilye square, all is one
matter, or round, or many squares, Master Dygges hath sufficiently declared
thereof, as touching the measuring of it, How to measure any thing that lacks
part of hi^ form.
for that it is a body properly of it self. The furthermore, there be bodies
that lack part of their form, as thus, there is is a piece of Timber either
round or square, that may be hollow in the core or middle, or else it may be
hollow like a Trough or with hollow natches into it, as by these ensamples it
doth appear, and the black doth sygnifye the hollow: and for to measure
them truly, do thus.



First measure the Massy bodies contents, and so cast it in that form, then
measure the hollow or concave place, as though it were Timber. Then cast the
contents thereof, and pull that su^e away fro the whole contents, that which
doth remain, shall be the true contetes of that piece of timber, or stone, so
forth. How to measure any thing that is more then his form.
And now for superfluous bodies as Timber or stone, or any other thing, which
is more the their proper form, as by these ensaples it doth appear. Then
shall you first measure the principal body by it self: that being done,
then measure the superfluous part or parts, by themselves, then add or put
all those numbers together, and that will show unto you the just contents of
that body.

How to measure mixed bodies.
And now furthermore for the measuring of mixed bodies, as a mixed body is
that which is hollow in one place or places, and more then a body in another
place or places, as these figures doth show. And for the measuring of these
bodies as before is declared, first measuring the principal body, and then
next measuring the superfluous part or parts, and put all those together,
and then measure the hollow part or parts, as before is declared, then cast
the contents of the hollow Timber or mettle by it self, then pull that
sum out of the other sums, and then that which doth remain, shall be the
true measure of the body that you have measured, and so forth.

And now furthermore, for the measuring of all bodies, as Cubes or Globes, as
for ensample thus, for the measuring of Globes or Cubes, as a shot or a
Bullet being a perfyte Globe, that all bodies as Cubes or Globes, or any other
form either round or square, if that it be as much more in measure every way.
As I do know the opinion of some people, Error in the common people as by
ensample
that will say that is but as big again, where it must needs of force be
8. times so big, as for Ensample thus.

By a piece of Timber or of Stone, being a foot square every way like unto a
Dye. And there is an other cube of Timber or Stone of two foot square every
way like a Dye in form. Now that cube of one foot square, is but one foot of
Timber or Stone: and the other cube of two foot square every way like unto a
Dye, is eight foot of Timber or Stone, as these two figures do represent.



Now you do see this to be true: and if that the measure of any thing being
as much more in length, bredthe and thickness, that it is 8. times so big,
whether that it be cubes or Globes, lunge Timber or Raske, or what soever it
be.

And furthermore, as it is before rehearsed, if that you have a piece of Timber,
Ensample of large Timber.
if that it be in squarenesse as long more and as thyck or broad more, that it
is 8. times as big, whether that it be round or square all is one matter,
as for ensample thus. By a piece of Timber of 10. foot lunge, and.12. inches
square, that piece of timber shall be 10. foot of timber: if that you have an
other piece of timber, that is 24. inches square and.20. foot lunge, that
piece of timber shall be 80. foot of timber, as by these 2. figures it is
showed.



And furthermore, if that you would have an other piece of timber just as
big again, as that of 10. foot lunge, and one foot square, being just
10. foot of Timber, and to be of that proportion in length and in squarenesse,
that is declared hereafter in the 7. chapter.

And furthermore whether that it be in Cubes or Globes, and if that you do
know the contents of the one, and would know how much the one is bigger then
the other: then shall you do it thus. You must triple the proportio of the
sides of the cubes or Globes, and then multiply them together, To know the
proportion of Cubes or Globes, the one by the other.
as you do in fractions: then look what that number comes unto. Then if
that you do know the contents of the lesser, and would know the conte^tes of
the bigger, then multyplye the contents of the lesser cube or Globe, with the
number of the bigger: and look what that number comes unto: then divide that
sum with the number of the lesser cube or Globe, and that number that stands
in the quantitye Lyne, shall be the contents of the bigger cube or Globe, as
for Ensample thus (...), by a Bullet of Iron of.5. inches in height, or
Diameter, and suppose it to weigh 16. pound. And you have an other Globe or
Bullet of that stuff of 9. inches in Diameter, how many pound shall that way?
you shall know it thus.

triple the proportion of them both, set the down thus.555.999: Then multiply
thus.5. times 5. is.25. and then.5. times.25. makes 125.

An ensample of Globes.
And now to the bigger Globe, 9. times 9. is 81. and then.9. times 81. makes
729, and now the lesser Bullet wayinge.16. pound therefore multyplye.729.
by.16. and that will make.11664. and now divide this number by 125. and then
there will stand in the quantytie Lyne 93. then there remains over 39. so as
you may conclude, that the bigger Bullet doth way 93. pound, and.39.125.
which is near 5. ounces, the true wayght of the bigger Globe. And now
contrarywyse, you knowing the contents or weight of the bigger cube or Globe:
then you must multyplye the contents by the number of the lesser, and then
divide it again by the number of the bigger.

And for more playnnesse, by the Bullet before rehearsed of.5. inches high, The
second ensample.
to way 16. pound. Now I have a lesser that is but 4. inches in his Diameter,
what shall it way: you shall know it thus 444.555. first multyply 4. times 4.
and that is 16. and then 4. times 16. is 64. Then multiply 64. by the weight of
the bigger Bullet, and that is 16. times 64. and that makes 1024. and then
divide the number by 125. and then there will stand in the quantytie Lyne 8.
24. will remain over. So that ye may conclude, that the lesser Globe or Bullet
doth weigh 8 pound 3. ounces. And so by this order you may know the
proportion of all manner of other bodies, what form so ever that it hath: by
multiplyinge the length, breadth and thickness, and then doyng as before is
rehearsed, the contents shall appear.

The fifth Chapter shows how for to measure Globes, and to know the contents
in inches or feet.
ANd furthermore, for the measuring of Globes by proportion, how much that the
one is bigger then the other, it is no otherwise then the proportion of any
other body, as by ensaple of the measuring of cubes, as before it is declared.
For this is general for ever in the measuringe of all solled bodies, as Timber
and Stone, or Raske, or any other thing what so ever that it be, if that the
proportion of measure be as 1. unto 2. the body contents as 8. unto one, that
is to say, that if a shot or Globe of Iron of.2. inches height do weigh one
pound, then shall a shot or Globe of Iron of 4. inches height, weigh 8.
pound, and so forth as before is rehearsed. And also this is a very good way
to know the contents of a Bullet or Globe, a cube of.4. inches, will go very
near to make a Globe of.5. inches in Diameter: and for Ensample of this matter
before rehearsed, they do use for to measure Globes or Bullets in this sort,
to know their contents. First thus. The measuring of Globes.
The Circumference bring known, as 7. unto 22. the Diameter is found.

Then multyply the half Circumference w^th the half Diameter, and that being
done, look what number that comes unto. Then multyply that by the Diameter
again, and look what that number rises unto: then take. parts of that
number, and that shall be the contents of the Globe or Bullet, Ensample thus.

By a Globe of 12. inches high in the Diameter. Now to know the Circumference:
then multiply 12. by 22. and that comes unto 264. and then divide 264. by 7.
and that shall show unto you the Circumference: so that comes unto.37.
and.5.7. the true compass of the Circle. Then take the half of both the
Circumference, and the half Diameter, that is to say, half 37. and.5.7. and
that makes 18. and 6.7. pa^tes and half 12. and that is.6. Then multiply
18.6.7. times.6. and that comes unto.113. and then multiply that number by
the whole Diameter again, and that comes unto 1356. that is like unto the end
of a pillar: Then for that take. parts of the number, and that will be.905.
the true contents of the number of inches in that Globe, and by this order you
may measure the contents of all Globes how big or small soever they be. But
now if you would know the contents of the superficial, that is to say, what
number of inches would cover the Globe or Bullet: then you must do thus:
multiply the Circumference with the Diameter, and that number shall be the
contents of the ^n^yden^ the Globe or Bullet. c.

And furthermore, ^o know the true contents of a Globe, how many inches it
doth contain, this is the easyest may that may be devised.

Take the true Diameter of the Globe, and multiply it cubitly, and then
multiply thathy 11. and then divide that by.21. and tha^ shall show unto you
the true contents of the number of inches in that Globe, as for ensample thus:
by the Globe before rehearsed of 12. inches in Diameter or height, and 12.
times 12 is.144. and then 12. times 144, makes 1728. and then that multyplyed
by 11. 19008
and then it makes 19991. and then that being divided by.21. and then there
will stand in the quantytye lyne 905. and 3. will remain over: So that you
may conclude that the Globe of 12. inches in height or Diameter, doth contain
905. inches and 1. of.7. part of an inch.

To measure the plain of a Circle.
And furthermore, to know the contents of a plain Circle how many inches or
feet that it doth contain: then multyplye it by the Diameter squarely, and
then multiply it again by.11. then divide that number by 14. that shall show
unto you the true: contents of the platform of that Circle. Ensample by a
plain Circle of 12. foot broad or over, and to know how many feet that it
doth contain: Then multyplye 12. times 12. and that makes 144. and then
multyply 144. by 11. and that makes.1584. and then divide 1584. by 14. and
then there will stand in the quantytie lyne 113. and 2. will remain over: so
that you may conclude, that the contents of that Circle that is 12. foot
broad, that the platform of that Circle doth contain 113. foot, and 1/7.
part of a foot.

The syxt Chapter shows howe for to build Shyps by proportion, that is to
say, if that you have one Ship for an ensample, if you would have an other as
big again, more or less: this Chapter doth show unto you howe you may do
it, keeping that mold and proportion in all points, that is to say, by
extractinge of the cubike root.
AND furthermore, I do think it convenient, for that I do know that many
that are Naupegers or Ship carpenters, have not the exact knowledge in these
causes, that is to say, that when they have builded any Ship or Boat, and
the tonnage then known unto them, Of the bending of Sh^ps.
if that you would have an other Ship or Boat of that mould and of that
proportion in all points, to be double that tonnage or burden that the other
is: I do know that there is but few Naupegers or Ship carpenters that can do
it: for that they d^ look for the ^st part of them the extractions of C^thicke
roots for otherwise it is not possible for it to be done: for no man may keep
just proportion in all points without the extracting of Cubes, they may well
keep the tonnage or but then, but not the proportion and mold in all
points. For according as it is before declared, by the measuringe of Cubes or
Globes or any massy bodies, if that they should double the measure, then it
were 8. times so big.

Therefore whenever that you have builded any ship or Boat, or any other
craft, whatsoever it be, How to alter the bigness of a ship and ^e^ to keep
the proportion mould, and fashion.
then if that you would have an other of that self some mold in all points,
and would have the other as big again, or twice or thrice so big again,
or half so big again, or any other quantity more or less, then shall you do
thus.

First for the length of the Reel, you shall multiply it cubitely, and then in
like manner every beam: the mydshippe beam and all the rest of the Beams, to
multiply them cubitelye, and also the rackinge of the Ship both the Stem and
the Sterne post, to multiply the cubitely, and also the principal tymbers that
doth mold the Ship, to multiply them cubitely, and also the depth that the
Ship is in hold, to multyplye it cubitely, and so consequently every place
or places with the Ship that doth lead any work, to multyply it cubitely.

Then that being done, if that you would have the other Ship or Boat as big
again, then double that number that you have before multiplied: Then
extractinge the Cubit root thereof, then according unto the number make your
Reel, your timbers, your Beams, and so consequently all the rest of your
things, according unto the Cubit root so extracted, and that being done,
you shall make her of that mold and proportion, and of double burden,
without any fail, otherwise it is not to be done.

And furthermore, if that you would have one thrice so big, then 3. fouled
your number, and so forth: then if that you would have her but half so
great, then take half the number so multyplyed, and the Cubit root so
extracted, shall make a Ship or Boat, but half the burden: and thus you may
make a Ship or Boat of what proportion so ever you lyst^, and also to be of
that self same mold that the other was.

Provided also, for the squarenesse of your Beams, and your Tymbers, and also
the thyckenesse of the Plank, that you do observe this order before
mentioned, or else in otherwise doing, you ma^ put more Timber or less Timber,
then the proportion of the burden doth come unto, and so by that means you
may commy^te error. As for Ensample thus briefly.

By a ship that was.44. foot long by the Reel, and.20. foot broad upon
the mydshippe beam, and did rack it with the stem forwards 13. foot, and
the Sterne post did rack 7. An ensample of the altering of the burden of a
ship, and to keep the mold and proportion.
foot offwardes, and the ship was 9. foot deep in hold. Now this ship
was.100. tonnes, my desire is to have a ship of that self same mold, in
all points, to be of just double burden, that is.200. tunes. Then first
multiply the length of the keele cubitely, and that is 44. foot: therefore
multiply.44 times.44. and that makes 1936. and then again by 44. that
makes.85184. so it is multiplied cubietly. Now double the number, and that
makes 170368. and now extract the cubit root, and that will be 55. foot
and.3993.9075. part, which makes in inches.5. and.. parts of an inch, so
that you may conclude, that the ship must be.55. foot, and.5. inches, and
near.32. quarters in length by the keele. And now for the breadth of the
beam, and that is 20. foot, and.20. times.20. is.400. and that multiplied
by.20. makes.8000. and this double is.16000. then extract the cubit root,
and that is.25. and.375.1875. and that makes in inches 2. and.. parts of an
inch, so that you may conclude that the ship must be.25. foot and.2. inches,
and near a half inch upon the beam, for the breadth of the ship. And now
for the racking of the Stem, that is.13. times.13. and that comes to.169. and
now cubitely, and that makes 2197. Now this number double, makes.4394. Now
extracting the cubit root it will be.16. and.298.768. and that comes unto.4
inches and 4/7. parts: so that you may conclude, that the ship must rack
forwards with the Stem.16. foot,.4. inches near. parts. And now for the
sterne post, and that is.7. foot, therefore.7. times.7. is.49. and that
multiplied again by 7. and that makes.343. then it being double.686. then
extract the cubit root, and that is.8. and 174.1.92. and that comes
unto.10. inches, and.7.8. part, so that you may conclude that the ship must
rack with the sterne post 8. foot and.10. inches, and.7.8. parts of an
inch. And now for the depth in the whole, that being 9. foot, 9. times.9.
is.81. and that multiplied cubitely, makes 729. and that being doubled, then
it is.1458. and then the cubit ^oote being extracted, is.11. foot 127. of
363. part, that comes unto in inches.4. 4. of 5. parts, so that you may
conclude that the ship must be in deepenesse in hold, 11. foot and 4.
inches, and 4. of 5. parts of an inch just. And now the ship of 100.
tonnes, did draw 12. foot, when that she was Laden. Wherefore you must keep
a proportion, in all the parts of the work, as is before declared unto you:
then shall the ship of 200. tonnes, draw or go into the water by this
aforesaid means, 15. foot, and one inch and a half: and by this means
which is the extracting of the cubicke root, you may make a ship or boat or
any other craft, of what burden soever you ^yst^* and to keep that ^ulde and
proportion that the other was made of, in all points. And by this means and
order, you may know the quantity of any manner of Cask, and to make it by
proportion howe big or little soever you will have it.

The seventh Chapter doth show in like manner the making of ships by
proportion, saving that the cubike root is extracted already with an easy way
howe to make them, of what tonnage or burden, you list, and of that mold
and proportion in al points.
ANd now for that I do know the most part of men cannot extract the cubike
root, for that kind of Arithmetic is very harde, and not easy too be
learned, therefore I mean to make a little easy note* for that they shall not
altogether leese their time, in reading of this, but that they shall have some
help for the doubling of cubes, although it be nothing in the respect of them
that have the use of the second part of Arithmeticks, as the extracting of
roots and cubes, and cubike numbers. c.

F^rst thus: if so be that you have a cube or globe, and would have an other
as big again, or but one quarter more, Of Cubes.
then put the side of the cube, that you have for ensample, into 4. equal
parts, and if that you would have that one quarter bigger, then make the
bigger cube of 4. of those parts and 1. of 3. To make a cube a quarter bigger.
part, and then have you your desire. And if that you would have it half so
big more, still putting the side of that Cube that you have for ensample,
into 4. equal parts, then make the side of the other cube of 4. of those
parts, and 2. 3. parts more, and that shall make an other cube as big, and
half so big again, as the other.

And furthermore, To double a Cube or globe.
if that you would have a Cube to be two times the bigness of the Cube that
you have for ensample, that is double measure, then put your Cube into 4.
equal parts, and make the other Cube of 5. of those parts, and 1 of 25.
parts more, and that shall make a Cubs big again: To make a Cube 3. times
so big.
and to have a Cube three times so big, then make the Cube of 5. of those
parts, and 8. of 9. parts more, and that shall make a Cube.3. times so big.

And furthermore, for to have a Cube 4. times so big, then make the Cube of
6. of those parts and 5. of 14. parts. And furthermore, to make a Cube 5.
times so big, then make the Cube of 6. of those parts and 6. of 7. parts
more: If a Cube or Globe be double measure, the that is 8. times ^o big.
then to make a cube 6. times so big, then make the cube of 7. of those parts
and 1. of 6. part more, if you would have a cube 7. times so big, the make
that cube of 7. of those parts, 13. of 18. parts more: the if you would have a
cube.8. times so big, then double the measure, and that is just 8. times so
big without any fail, as before it is declared, the one being 4. and the
other being.8. then your measure is doubled. Now this short note or
remembrance, you may according unto the Chapter going before, you having a
ship or boat that you would have an other of that mold and proportion in
all points, and would have her as big again, more or less, you may do^ it
by this ^o^e before written: as thus: if you would have her as byg again, Then
put the length of the Keele of the ship that you would have an other made
by, and to keep that mold and proportion in all points, into.4. equal
parts, and then make the bigger of 5. of those parts, and.1.25. howe large or
short soever that it be, and do this also by every beam and every principal
Timber: and every other thing that leads any work, and you shall not fail
of the truth, for so much as this doth show, which is nothing in the
comparison of them that can extract the cubit root, it makes not matter howe
big or small soever the proportion is. And this note is but till the root is
increased to.8. times his bygnesse, and so much as this doth show, you shall
find it reasonable exact enough.

And yet furthermore, this is an easier way to build any ship or boat by
proportion. An easy way to make ships by proportion.
And first this: if you do mean to be one quarter bigger, that is to say, if
that you would have a ship of 4. score tonnes, and (...) have an other.100.
tonnes: then for every 12. foot or inches, that the ship that you have for
an ensample, is, in length, breadth, and deepenesse, and so consequently every
part that leads any work, make the bigger of 13. foot or inches, and you
shall have your desire.

And f^rther, if that you would have her half so big more, that is to say,
your ship that you have for ensample, being.80. tonnes, and to have the other
120. tonnes, then for every 6. foot or inches, make the other of 7. foot or
inches. And furthermore if that you would have her full as big again: then
shall that be for every 50. inches, make the bigger 63. inches, and then that
Ship shall be of.160. tons, that is, double burden. And then to be three
times so big, then for every.36. inches, make the bigger of.53. inches. And
then if that the lesser ship be.80. tonnes, the bigger shall be 240. tonnes:
and if that you would be 4. times so big: then for every 56. inches, make
the bigger of 89. inches, and then have you your desire, the one being 80.
tonnes, the other shall be 320. tonnes.

And further, if that you would have be 5. times so big, then for every 7.
foot or inches make the bigger of 12. foot or inches, and then the one being
80. tonnes, the other shall be 400. tonnes, and if that you would have the
bigger to be.6. times so big, then for every.24. inches make the bigger
of.43. inches, and then the one being.80. tons, the other shall be 480. tons,
and then to be.7. times so big, for every.72. inches, make the bigger.139.
inches: and then the bigger ship shall be, 7. times so big: the lesser
being.80. tons, the bigger shall be.560. tons: and then as before is declared,
if that the measure be double, then the bigger is.8. times so big: that
is.640. tonnes.

The eight Chapter shows howe much that one rope is bigger then an other:
and if that you have a rope of any syse, then you may know howe to have
another of what syse you list: and also if that you do know the weight of one
rope: you may know the weight of any rope by proportion.
YEt furthermore, I do think it convenient for diverse considerations, for
that I do do know that there is but very few Sea men, that hath the use of the
extracting of the square root: and without that they cannot know howe for to
fit a ship with ropes, but that they must of force, many times put too big
or too small a rope in diverse places, not meet for that rome, How to a^e^ the
bigness of ropes how to double the syse
until they do see it by common experience, and afterwards amend it.
Wherefore I will make a little brief note, for the doubling of ropes by
proportion. And first by a rope of.3. inches compass: and to have another as
big again, some will hold an opinion, that it must be.6. inches compass, but
then it is 4. times so big: therefore to have it as big again, it must be
in compass.4. inches, and 1. of 4. parts, and then to have a rope of.3. times
so big as the rope of.3. inches compass, then that rope must be of 5.
inches,.1. of 5. part, in copas: then to be 4. times so big, then that must
be double measure: that is 6. inches compass. Then too have a rope.5. times
so big: then that must be in compass.6. inches and.3. of.4. part of an
inch: then to be 6. times so big, then it must be in compass.7. inches
and.5. of 14. part: and then.7. times so big to be in compass.8. inches,
lacking 1. of.16. part* then to be 8. times so big, to be in compass.8.
inches.1. of 2. part: then.9. times so big, to be in compass, just 9.
inches: then being 10. times so big: then it must be in compass.9. inches,
and 9. of 20. part: then 11. times so big, to be in copmasse.9. inches, and
9. of 11. parts: and then to be 12. times so big, to be in compass 10.
inches 2. of 5. parts: then.13. times so big, to be in compass.10. inches:
and 17. of 20. part: then to be 14. times so big, as the rope of.3. inches
compass: therefore that must be 11. inches, and 5. of 22. parts in compass:
then to be 15. times so big, then to be in compass 11. inches, and 7. of 11.
parts: then 16. times so big, in compass just 12. inches. And then to be 17.
times so big, the to be in compass.12. inches, 3. of 8. parts: the to be 18.
times so big, then it will be in compass 12. inches, 9. of 12. part: 19. times so
big, then it will be in compass 13. inches, 1. of 13. Then being.20. times so
big, the it will be in compass 13. inches 11. of 26. part: and then to be.21.
times so big, it must be in compass.13. inches 10. of 13. parts. Then to be
22. times so big: then it will be in compass 14. inches and.1. of.14. parts:
then to be.23. times so big, it wylbe in compass 14. inches, and 11. of 28.
part: then too be.24. times so big, it will be in compass 14. inches, and.10.
of 14. parts: then 25. times so big, too be in compass just 15. inches: and
then too be 26. times so big: then it will be in compass 15. inches, 3. of 10.
parts then to be 27. times so big, it will be in compass 15. inches, 3. of 5.
parts: and then too be 28. times so big, that wylbee in compass 15.
inches, and 9. of 10. parts: then 29. times so big too be in compass 16.
inches, and 5. of 32. parts. Then too be 30. times so big to be in compass
16. inches, and 7. of 16. part: and then to be 31. times so big, to be in
compass 16. inches, and 23. of 32. part: then to be 32. times so big, must
be in compass 17 inches, lacking 1. of 34. part: and then to be 33. times so
big, that will be in compass 17. inches, and 4. of 17. part: and then to be
34. times so big, it will be in compass 17. inches, and 1. of 2. part: and
then to be 35 times so big, that will be in compass 17. inches, and 13. of.17.
part: and then to be 36. times so big, it will be in compass just. 18. inches.
And then to be 37. times so big, then too be in compass 18. inches, and 1. of
4 part: then 38. times so big, to be in compass 18. inches, and 1. of 2.
part, and then to be 39. times so big, it wylbe in compass 18. inches, and 3.
of 4. part: then to be 40. times so big, it will be in compass 19. inches,
lacking 1. of 38. part. And now by this little note, you may know howe big
or small that one rope is by another, so that the ropes be all of one kind of
stuff, and also of like hardenes in the woorekmanshippe, or laying.

And yet furthermore, I do think it convenient, for to compare one rope by
another, of the bigger sort: Of doubling of the bigness of of ropes.
for that which goes before, they be all compared but unto one rope of 3.
inches compass. And first by a rope of 6. inches compass: and to have another as
big again, that must be in compass 8. inches, and 1. of 2. part: and to have
a rope 3. times so big as that of.6. inches compass, that must be in compass
10. inches, 2. of 5 parts: and then to be 4. times so big, as before is
declared, that must be double measure 12. inches compass. And you have another,
of 7. inches compass, and would have another as big again, it must be in
compass, 9 inches, and 17. of 18 parts: and to have another 3. times so big,
must be in compass.12. inches, and 1. of 8. part: and 4 times so big, is 14.
inches compass: then you having a rope or cable of 8. inches copas, would have
another, as big again, then that must be in compass.11. inches, and 7. of 22.
parts: and to be 3. times so big, that must be in compass 13. inches, and 23.
of 26. parts: and 4. times so big, double measure, that is 16. inches.

And then you having a rope or cable of 9. inches compass, and too have an
other cable as big again, must be in compass 12. inches, 3. of 4. parts: and
then to be 3. times so big, must be in compass.15. inches, and 3. of 5.
parts: and then to be.4. times so big, that is double measure.18. inches.
Now you having a cable of.10. inches, and would have another, as big
again, that must be in compass.14. inches, and.1. of 7. part: and to be.3.
times so big, must be in compass.17. inches, and.11. of.34. parts: and to
be.4. times so big, to be.20. inches. Now you having a cable of.11. inches,
and to have another as big again, that must be.15. inches, and.17. of 30.
parts: and to be 3. times so big, must be in compass.19. inches, and 1.
of.19. part. Then to be 4. times so big, to be double measure, that is, 22.
inches. Then you having a cable of.12. inches compass. And to have another as
big again, that must be in compass 17. inches, lacking.1. of 33. parts: and
to be.3. times so big, must be.20. inches, and.4. of 5. parts: and to be.4.
times so big double measure, that is, 24 inches in compass, and then
furthermore, if that you have a cable of.13. inches, and would have another as
big again, then that must be in compass.18. inches, and 7. of 18. parts,
and to be.3. times so big, must be in compass 22. inches, 23. of.44.
parts: and then you having a cable of.14. inches, and would have another as
big again, then shall that be in compass.19. inches, 31. of.38. parts. The
you having a cable of.15. inches compass, and to have an other, as big
again, then shall that cable be in compass.21. inches, and 3. of 14. parts.
Now I do think this sufficient yenough, for to know the proportion of ropes,
the one by the other, and also by this little note they may fit any ship
with a mast, doing, even as you do by the proportion of ropes, in all
points: for if that you should double the measure of any mast, that Mast
shall be.4. times the bigness of the other, so that by the order of the
proportion of ropes or cables, they may know the proportion of the mastes
without any fail.

And furthermore, I do think it convenient to show unto you, how to double
any rope or Mast: and that you shall do thus: Howe to double any rope or mast,
by extractio of the square root.
Take the Compass of that rope that you have for ensample, and that being
known: then multiply that number in it self: then that being done, look
what quantitye you would have the other bigger: then increase that number unto
that bigness, then extract the square root thereof, and that rope shall be in
compass your desired purpose. As for ensample thus, by a rope of 5 inches
compass, I would have an other rope as big again, you must do that in this
manner. First multyplye that rope in it self number, that is to say, 5. times
5. and that makes 25: then double that number, and then that is double 50. and
then the square root of.50. is 7. 1. of 14. so that you may conclude that the
rope of 7. inches compass, and 1. of 14. part, is as big again as that
rope of.5. inches compass: and by this order you may double any rope as often
as you list.

And now furthermore, in like manner, Ensample
if that you do know the weight of the fadome of one rope, you may easily
know the wayght of a fadome of an other rope, how big or small soever that
it be, as thus: double the proportion of the 2. ropes, and multiply them as you
do in fractions: suppose it as thus. I have a cable of 13. inches compass,
and that waigheth 16. pound every fadome: Now what shall a fadome of that
cable, waigh^ both of one kind of that stuff, that is 16. inches compass?
First multiply.10. times 10. and that is 100. and then multyplye.16. times
16. and that makes 256. and then multiply the number of the bigger rope by
the weight of the lesser, that is to say.256. times 16. and that makes 4096.
and now divide this number by the number of the lesser rope, and that is 100.
and then there will stand in the quantytie Lyne 40. and 96. will remain over:
so that you may see the cable of 16. inches compass, that a fadoe thereof doth
weigh near 41. poude, by this order you may know the weight of any rope or
cable, and if that you would know the weight of a lesser rope; you knowing the
weight of his bigger, then multyply as before is said, and then shall you
multiply the weight of the bigger with the number of the lesser, and then
deuid^ that sum by the number of the bigger, and so shall you know how many
pound that a fadome of the lesser rope waieth. As for Ensample thus, by the
cable before mentioned, of 10. inches compass, and a fadome did weigh.16. pound,
what shall a fadome of a rope of 8. inches in compass weigh: Now as before is
declared.10. times.10. is.100. and.8. times.8. is 64. therefore multiply 64.
by 16. and that makes 1024. and then divide that by 100. and then there will
stand in the quantitye Lyne 10. and 24. will remain over: so that you may
conclude that the rope of 8, inches, that every fadome doth way 10. pound and
near a quarter, and this is true without any fail, and by this order you may
know the weight of all manner of ropes. c.

The ninth Chapter is as touching the mould of Ships, to have good
qualities.
ANd furthermore, in as much as I have showed how for ^o double or alter the
tonnage or the burden of Ships too what bigness you list at your
discretion, and also to keep that mold and proportion in all points:
therefore I do think it necessary and convenient to say somewhat in this
point, that is to say, what manner of form or fashion that the mould of a Ship
should be, that should go or fail well, and to have good qualities in the
Sea. And although that it is possible that some will think that I do meddle
with those matters that I have no skill in for that I am neither Naupager or
ship carpeter, neither usual Sea man: therefore it is possible tha^ I may be
disliked, for that I do meddle in this matter or causes. Yet not with standing
you that do read this, use not to condemn any thing before that you have
perused it well: and so wayinge it in a pair of indifferent balances, that
affection doth not lead you, it is possible that it is not altogether untrue,
but that there is some matter in it that is good to be considered of in the
building or the making of ships: and those matters that you do know by
experience to be untrue, the you need not make any account thereof. c.

And first thus, Of Ships that sail well with the wiend.
as concerning the making of the mold of any ships, this is to be noted, that
those ships that are of easy draft, that is to say, not to go to deep in the
Sea or water, and will bear a good sail, and doth stere well, that is to say,
that it will feel the Ruther as soon as the Helm or Tyller is put to or fro,
and those ships do go or sail well beeringe or before the wind, that is to
say, the wind to be large or to come right after them, all those ships do
sail well and close by the wind, that is to say, the Bowline to be haled
harde or close, and the ship to stand or come as near the wind as may be:
those Ships must draw a reasonable draft of water: and also to be a
reasonable good length, and these ships will go well a head the sea, Of Ships
that sail well by the Bowlyne to be harde pulled or also to sail well a head
the Sea.
that is to say, the Ship to stand close by the wind in such places as the
grating of the tide doth cause the sea to come against the head or bows of the
Ship. Then those ships that have a reasonable length and well breasted or bowed,
and not the buttocks or sterne of the ship to be to big or to full quartered
behind, but to be reasonable lancke at the Sterne, those ships do go or
sail well a head the Sea, so that they will bear a good sail, Of ships that
ride well or ill at ancor.
and not over held, that is to say, not to go to much on the one side, but
if that any ship be too fat buttocked or broad behind at the sterne, the bows
or breast of the ship before be to slender or narrow, those Ships will never
go or sail well a head the sea, but will fall or beat into the sea, that it
will let or hinder the way or going of the Ship. And also those Ships will
ride very ill at rode or ancor in the Sea, for that the broadnesse of the
buttocks of the Ship doth so thrust down the head of the Ship into the
Sea, and especially if that the bows of the Ship he to narrow or slender, that
the Sea shall fly into the ship or quite over her, as well at an ancor or
sailing, or going a head the sea: which is a very ill property in a ship in a
number of causes. And all those ships that doth draw or go a good deepenes into
the water; as before is said, do sail well by the wind, also will lie a hold
well in the sea, that is to say, the ship having no sail abroad, will not seele
in roll so much, neither in like manner it will not go so much unto lewards,
that is to say, that the wind nor the sea shall not drive it so fast back
again, as it will do a Ship that doth draw or go but a little way into the
Water: and also those Ships that do draw but a little water, be very ill in
two causes, if that they do lye a hold in the sea, that is to say, to have
no sail abroad, for they will seel or roll in such sort that it will put al
in danger, besides the driving to lewardes with the sea wind. Therefore
these Ships must have always sails abroad, if they be loose at the sea, and
also those kind of Shyps will ride ill at an ancker, at such time as the tide
doth go unto the wyndewardes, for lying thwart, it will seel or roll so much.
But the wind and tide to be al one, that the Ships head to be right upon
the Sea, and as before is said, the Ship well bowed, and the Sterne not to full
quartered, then it will ride very well at an anchor at that time. c.

Of Ships that ^ere well and do hear a good Sail.
And now furthermore, as touching the building or making of Ships for to stere
well, and also to bear a good sail, which is two of the best qualities that
is or may be in a Ship: and except that it be a very chance those Ships do
always sail very well, if that the mold of them be any thing well ordered in
the form thereof. c. And although that the mold of a Ship be never so
finely made, and if it do not stere well, then it can never sail well. And
also if the mould of the Ship be never so well made, and if it will bear no
sail but over held, that is to say, to lay down the side in the water, then
it can never go well, how fine so ever the mold is, for it is ill shapen to
go, when al the one side is down in the water, and the other side all out of
the water, and then it cannot abide the force of the wind to drive it: whereas
the Ship that is able to bear a good sail, must needs go well, for that the
force of the wind must needs draw it, for that it is able to bear sail, and
then the wind must needs force it to go. c. And first thus, as touching
the cause that any Ship doth stere well, is this: that the quick water of the
way of the Ship doth come unto the Ruther being put either the one way or the
other way, that must needs, cause the Ship to cast or turn accordingly and
the faster that the ship goes, the nimbler or quicker the ship steereth or
turne^h.

Therefore when soever that they do build or make any Ships, then it is
good for to let them make the mold of a Ship to have a sufficient tucke
or run, which tucke or run must be in length the third part of the
length of the Reel, and in height, by the stern post, three quarters of that
depth that the Ship goes into the Water, A thing to be noted.
and so to grow narrower and narrower forwards: for it is the sufficientnesse
of the tucke or run that makes a Ship to stere well. For if that be not
well made, then it requires to have the brother Ruther, and that is euell in
two respects: the one is this: the Helm being put over, and if that the
Ship will not feel the Ruther quickly, then the Ruther lies cross the
Stern of the Ship: and the Ruther being broad, then it must needs hinder
or let the going or way of the Ship very much: Whereas a Ship that
hath but a narrow Ruther, and yet is yare or quick of sterrage, then the
Ruther cannot hinder the going or way of the Ship: c.

And also it is evil in an other respect to have a broad Ruther, and that is
this: for a Ship being at Sea in foul weather, a broad Ruther the Sea doth
beat it one way and an other way, by the means of the labouring of the Ship
to and fro, that it is apt to break the tyller or the head of the Ruther
Ruther Irons: and besides that, it is uneasy for the Ship in like manner. c.

And thus I do omit the rest of the proportion of the mold of the Ship
unto the discretion of the Naupeger or Ship Carpenter, as touching the fore
way and the flowringe of the Ship, and the leading of all the rest of the
work c. The cause that a Ship doth bear a good sail.
And furthermore, as touching this point to cause a Ship to have a stiff
side to bear a good sail, then this must be considered in the building or
making thereof: and first thus: that commonly those Ships that have a
sufficient breadth according unto their biggnesse and length, will bear a
reasonable good sail, for that the breadth doth bear it up.

But commonly those be not the best, and finest Sailors, neither are they of
the best qualities, in diverse respects. Yet notwithstanding, in my opinion,
this is the principallest point to observe in the building of ships, to have
them to bear a good sail, and that is this, for to lay the breadth of the
Ship above the water, a foot, or a foot and a half, more or less,
according unto the bigness of the ship, and to hang well of, that is to say,
to be 4. or 6. inches on a side brother then it is just at the edge of the
water, and to be more or less, according unto the bigness of the Ship: and
then upwards the work may be housed inwards, that is too say, narrower and
narrower upwards, which will do well, both for the ease of the Ship in the
Sea, and less charge of Timber bathe in wayght, and otherwise: and in so
doing, the Ship will bear a good Sail, what length so ever it have, howe
fine so ever the mould is, so that it have quarters proportionally unto it. c.

And the cause thereof is this: the breadth of the Ship being above the water
in such sort, as if the Ship come unto heelding, that the same brother place
doth come into the water: then the Nadry or Reel of the ship, doth grow
the further of, by the means of the hanging ofwardes of the side or work of
the Ship.

And for that the ballast or the lading of the Ship, the waightiest part
lies downewardes towards the Reel, therefore it makes the ship the loather
to held a tosyde, for that the side hangs outwardes, and then the water doth
support it up, for that the bigger or brother part is out of the water, as the
reason thereof more plainly shall appear in the fourth Book of the
property of Water in weight, called Statick, wherein you shall see the reason
thereof more manifestly c. Whereas those Ships that have an upright side,
must needs held much the sooner, for that the Water doth not support the
side, not until it do held very much.

Wherefore thus much I have said as touching the mold of Ships, as
concerning their qualities, as thus: Note
a Ship that hath Tucke or Run enough, will steer well: a Ship that doth
hang well of on the nail above the water, will bear a good sail: a Ship
that doth draw a reasonable good draft of Water, and well weighed forwards,
will sail well by the wind: and being well bowed and not to fat buttocked,
will go well a head the sea, and also ride well at rode, and also will hold
well at the Sea loose. and floty Ships that s^eere well and will bear a good
sail, will sail well, the ^ynde being large. c. And thus I do end this
third Book. c.

FINIS.
A Table of the Contents of the Chapters of the third book, called a
rteasure for Travellers.
The first Chapter of the third Book, shows you howe to caste the contents
of land by Arithmetic, and also by the husband mans rule, which is by the
account of money. c.

The second Chapter shows how to measure board and Glass, and too caste the
contents thereof, with other necessary things belonging thereunto.

The third Chapter doth show howe for too measure Timber, and to bring it
too a square, as well without Artihmetike as otherwise, and also howe for too
know the true contents of any piece of Timber.

The fourth Chapter shows howe for to measure all manner of bodies, as
Timber, or stone, Cubes, or Globes: and too know what proportion of measure or
weight the one hath unto the other.

The fyfthe Chapter shows howe for to measure Globes, and to know their
contents in inches or feet.

The syxt Chapter shows howe for too build Ships by proportion, that is to
say, if that you have one Ship for an ensample, if you would have an other
as big again, more or less this Chapter doth show unto you howe you may
do it, keeping that mold and proportion in all points, that is too say, by
extractynge of the Cubicke root.

The seventh Chapter doth show in like manner the making of ships by
proportion, saving that the Cubike root is extracted already: with an easy
way howe to make them of what tonnage or burden you list. and of that mold
and proportion in al points.

The eight Chapter shows howe much that one rope is bigger then another: and
if that you have a rope of any syse, that you may know how for to have
another, of what syse that you list, and also if that you do know the weight
of one rope, you may know the weight of any rope by proportion. c.

The nynth Chapter is, as touching the mold of Ships, to have good
qualities.

FINIS.
The fourth Book of the treasure for travailers.
Wherein is touched the art of Staticke or weight, showing unto you howe you
may know the weight of any Ship that swymmeth upon the water, with al her
ladyng, and al the rest of her furniture. And also howe you may know the weight
of any mettle that is sunk in the water, to know what it weighs in the water,
and also how you may measure any strange form, such as Geometry cannot give
you any order for the measuring thereof, and also howe for too lift or way any
thing sin^e into the water, with other necessary matters belonging thereunto,
very necessary for al land men, and seam^n. c.

Written by William Bourne.

To the Reader of this fourth Book.
GEntle Readers, it is possible that you will marvel, that I should take
upon me too deal in these causes, that is to say, to teach any new Art,
and Science, that hath not been as hytheretoo, written in any language or
tongue, the which Art or Science, called Staticke, doth show the heaviness
or lightness of any thing.

Wherefore there is contained in this fourth Book, howe too know the weight
of any thing swymmyng in the water, as the weight of any ship, with all her
lodyng, and all her furniture: as Ordinance, Anchors, Cabels, Mastes, Sails,
with al other Implements in them, and also it doth show the weight of any
thing sunk into the water, what it weighs, to be lifted from the bottom, till
the appearing of it above the superficies of the water: with divers other
necessary matters that are contained in this fourth Book, and not before this
time mentioned by any other, but only by that famous and learned man Master
Iohn Dee, who hath made mention thereof in his Mathematical preface, wherein I
have had my principal instructions, as touching that Art or Science.

Wherefore Gentle Reader, bear with my rudeness, that I being utterly
unlearned, should enterprise too take upon me too be so bold, too give the
first attempt, to employ that Art or Science unto any purpose: for I do know
the nature of most people, is to dislike al things that are not done by them
selves, whether it be good or evil: and as I have known many times by
experience, that those persons that have learned any thing at any mans hand,
when he doth understand it, then he will not be known where he learned it,
but that he knew that before or ever he showed it unto him, which is a manifest
robbery of any man, to learn any thing at any mans hand, then afterwards to
deny it, to say, that he knew it before he told it him: as I do know a
number of persons, that when they are ignorant in matters, then they will use
diligence till they have atteyned it, and then when they have a little
instructions to serve their turns, then they will seem too be very cunning,
and that they never learned any thing at any man hand, which is a great
point of ingratitude, too offer that person that he hath learned of, such a
great injury: but yet notwithstanding the earth is greatly infected, with such
manner of persons.

The fourth book, of the treasure for travellers.
The first Chapter of the fourth Book, shows you by the proportion of a Ship
swimming in the water, for to know the true weight of any Ship, with all her
tackle, ordinance, and lading. c.
FOR that I have said somewhat heretofore as touching the making of Ships by
proportion and otherwise: Therefore I do think it necessary and convenient to
treat partly of this, as touching the nature and qualytie of water, for the
sinkinge or swimming of things in it, and according unto the simple opinion of
the common people, Of things that do swim.
who think that things in the water do swim or syncke, for that it is Wood,
Iron, or Stone: but the only cause of things that do swim, is this, that
it is lighter then the proportion in quantity, then the water is. For this is
general for ever: Look how much of any Timber or any other thing that is
hid, or in lownes even with the water, as just of weight as of so much water,
as the true quantity of that part that is from the edge of the water
downewardes into the water neither heavier nor lighter, and then that part
that is above the water doth show justly what diuersytie of weight is between
the water and the wood, or any other stuff that is put into the water. For
any thing swimming in the water, the half being above the water, and the other
half underneath the water, that thing that swims in that form, is just
half the weight of so much water: and if in the swimming.3. quarters be buried
in the water, that thing is just 3. quarters of the weight of so much water,
and so forth, to any other proportion, and then adding so much in wait, to
make it of the just weight of the water: then that thing being in the water,
shall swim even with the edge of the water neither higher nor lower. But if
it be any thing heavier then the proportion of so much water, then it sinks
unto the bottom: and then look how much in weight it is heuier the the
proportio of so much water: so much it waieth in the water the lighter, Of
things that synke.
as the weight of the water comes unto. For if any thing in the water, be
double the weight of the water, proportio for proportio, then shall that thing
weigh just half the quantytie of that weight, till it be lifted from the bottom
unto the very edge of the water, and then if that the thing do weigh but
half the weight more then the quantity of so much water: then shall that
thing in the water to be weighed, weigh but one third part of his weight that
it would weigh, if that it were out of the water, and so forth to any other
weight or waightes, having proportion in bigness, according to the quantity
of the water, whether it be Brass, Stone, or Iron, or any other stuff what
soever it be. And also things that do swim, as wood, or any other stuff.
Wherefore this is to be noted by the way, the perfect weight of any ship with
all her ladyng, Ordinance, Mastes, Sails, and Tackle, with all other
implements in her, may be easily known by her only swimming, as thus:

Look what quantity of the Ship is buried in the water, that is to say, from
the edge of the water downwards: then if there were a vessel or great thing
made of the proportion of the mold of a Ship, as much as is buried in the
water, if that were filled with that water that the ship were in, the water
should be of just equal weight, that the Ship were of, with all her tackle
and implements in her. And now this being true, as it is most certain, then
the weight of the water being known, any vessel or body is to be measured by
Geometrycall means. c.

And furthermore, here is one special thing to be noted, and that is this, Al
water is not of like weight.
all waters are not of like weight, for the finest water is lightest: therefore
if that any Ship be in the lightest water, then doth she swim the deeper,
according unto the weight of the Ship, and the weight of the water, quantity
for quantity, and in like manner any Ship being in the heavier water, then
shall not the Ship swim so deep, for that the water of his own force, will
lift the Ship out of the water, until there be that just quantity and
proportion, according unto the just wayght of the water and weight of the
Ship: for this is seen daily by common experience, amongst Sea men and
mariners, that if you do lade any Ship in a fresh water or river very deep,
Salt water is the heaviest water.
then when she is in the Sea, and specially in the Occient Sea, that the
Ship shall be lifted up higher by.3. or.4. inches out of the water wards: And
then when the Ship is come again into a fresh water river, then she shall be
as low laden as she was before. Wherefore in the building of Ships, the one of
the principal poynt^s is this, the flowering and quartering of them: for there
may.2. ships be made both of one length, and of one breadth, and of one
deepenesse in the water, and yet the one may be ^eare as big again as the
other, for if that the one be full quartered, and a broad flat flower, (as
the Hulks be commonly) it must needs be of a greater burden, then a sharpe
Ship that hath neither flower nor quarters, as commonly the Spanish building
is: for the water cannot bear it before it be deep yenough into the water:
therefore these kinds of Shyps draw very much water be but of small burden,
for a sharpe Ship must have very much ballast, or else she will bear no
sail: and especially if they be very high builded or larged above the
water. c.

The second Chapter shows how for to measure the proportion of the mould of
any Ship, whereby is known the weight of any Ship with all her ladynge and
furniture.
FOR to know howe to measure the proportion of the mold of a Ship whereby
may be known her weight, with all her ladinge, it is somewhat tedious, and
asks long work, and must be precisely handled, for that it keeps no
form long together: therefore it must be measured in many parts.

Howe to measure the mould of a Ship.
And for to measure the mold of a Ship, the Ship must be brought a
ground, and then begin at the broadest place of the Ship in this manner:
First measure the breadthe of the Ship from outsyde unto outsyde, at that
very place of the upper edge that the Ship doth swim in deepenesse into
the water: then that being known, measure the true deepenesse that the Ship
doth swim into the water, at that place of the broadest part of the Ship:
then that being known, take the true contents of half the breadth of the
Ship, and then with a rod or pole lay the end of the rod or pole that is
just the length of half the breadth of the Ship, unto just the half Keele
in breadth at that place before spoken of, and then with an other rod or pole
of the just length that the Shppe doth swim in deepenesse into the water,
lay the end of that rod or pole at that place that the upper edge of the
water doth touche: and then let both the other ends of the two rods or poles
touch just together, and so will they make a square Angle: and then measuring or
trying between the Ship and the 2. rods or poles as you do in the
measuringe of superficial or plat forms, so shall you know the contents of
that part that is within the insyde of the Ship, by subtractynge or taking
away of that measure between the two rods or poles with the outsyde of the
Ship, for that you must consider that it is a square enclosed from the middle
of the insyde of the Ship, unto the deepenesse that the Ship doth swim in
the water, and unto the two rods or poles, and hath four square or right
Angles or corners: and then if that you do multyply it according unto the
breadth of the ship and the deepenesse that the Ship doth go into the water,
as you would do if that it were a plat form: then pulling away the contents
of that same being doubled that the measure is between the Ship side, and
the two rods or poles, then that which doth remain shall be the true
contents of that part which is within the insyde of the Ship as though it
were a plat form: and then look how many foot lunge it runs in that
form and proportion in breadth and roundenesse of the side: then according
unto the length multytiply the one by the other, ^hat is to say, the contents
of the measure before taken of the insyde of the Ship, and the length that
the mold doth keep in one proportion, and then cast the contets thereof. And
that being done, do as before is rehearsed, according unto the breadth of the
Ship in an other place: then according unto the deepenes that the Ship doth
swim in the water, and then doyng with the two rods or poles as before is
rehearsed, and so trying between the Shyps side, and the two rods or poles,
and casting the contents in all points as before is rehearsed: and thus you
must do in as many places and as often times as the proportion of the mold
doth alter: and then adding them altogether, you must see howe many foot that
the Shypp doth contain, if it were all one whole piece of Timber, and not
hollow within.

And now this being done exactly as it may be done with precise diligence, you
knowing the true contents howe many foot the soled body of the mold of the
Ship doth contain as much as is buried into the water, you may know
justly the whole weight of that ship that you have so mesured, with al her
ladyng, ordinance, tackle, anchor, and cables, with al other implements in her,
as thus: Take of that water that the ship swims in, and make a cube of
mettle or wood of just.12. inches square, and deep: for that 12. inches
square every way, makes a foot, and then weigh the water justly howe many
pounds and part of a pound the water doth contain in weight, and that shall
show you justly how many pound and parts of a pound every foot square of
the mold of the Ship doth weigh justly, and then if that you do multiply
the contents of the number of feet, that the mold is, and the weight that
one foot of the water doth weigh in pounds and parts, then according unto
that number, the Ship with all her ladyng, doth weigh justly without any
fail: so that you have measured the mold of the Ship truly, and also
weighed justly the contents of one foot of the water: and then by that number
you may say justly, it contains so many Tons in weight, as thus: by
dividing the number of the weight of the Ship by.2240. for that a Tun
conteyneth 20. hundredth weight, and every.100. weight, to contain 112. pounds.

And furthermore, you may measure the mold of a Ship in this manner, with such
a thing as the Ship Carpenters do take the mold of a Ship, and that they
do call a mold, or lynck gin, and that is made of many pieces, of a foot
long, or there about, and it is clenched together with roff and clenche, that
the joining will be put to and fro at your pleasure, and will stand stiff as
you do leave it.

And now with this instrument, you may work more easily then before is
rehearsed: for to know the contents or quantity of the mold of any Ship in
this manner: Take at every place the half of the true breadth of the ship, and
then in like manner the true deepenesse that the ship doth go into the water,
at every place that you do measure the Ship at, for that all ships do draw
more water at the Sterne, then they do at the head: and then you may put three
pins of wood into the ground, the one pin to be at the middle of the ship,
and the other to be for the outsyde of the ship, and the third to be for the
middle of the Keele of the Ship, and to set them truly in distance, according
unto the half breadth of the ship, and the other unto the true deepnesse
that that ship doth go into the water, and so shall that pin for the middle
of the Ship, make a square Angle unto the pin, for the side and the keele of
the ship, and then with the instrument lay that unto the side of the ship,
and put it in and out as the ship doth round from the place of the upper edge
of the water unto the Keele, and then laying that mold of the Ship unto the
two pins, that is to say, to that pin for the side, and the pin for the
Keele of the Ship: and then measuring that in closer, as you do a platform,
the truth of the contents shall appear, and then doubling that number, it will
show you the contets of the whole breadth of the Ship, and then to multiply so
much in length, as doth keep one proportion: And thus doyng as often times as
the proportion of the mold doth alter, and then adding al your numbers
together, and casting the contents in all points, as before is rehearsed, the
truth of the solid body of the mold of the Ship shall appear, and so taking
the true weight of one foot of that water, as before is expressed in all
points. And thus I do make an end of the measuring of the mold of Ships,
for that there wants or lacks nothing, but to show how to measure plat
forms, and as for those matters, there are diverse books extant, sufficient
enough for that purpose, as Master Leonarde Digs in his book called
Tectonicon, and Master Thomas Digs his book called Pantometria, with other.

The third Chapter shows you an easier way then before rehearsed, by the
Art Saticall, to know the true weight of any Ship, with al her lading, and
all the rest of her furniture.
AND furthermore, for that it is somewhat tedious and asks lunge work,
beesydes diverse other incombraunces that must be used to measure the true
proportion of the mold of a Ship, I will show unto you a more pleasanter
and easier way (by the Art Scaticall) both very true and exact, for to know
the true weighty of any Ship, with all her ladynge, Mastes, Sails, Ancors,
Cables, and Ordynaunce, with all other implements in her.

And any Noble manne, or Gentleman may do it at home in his Chamber, that hath
any knowledge in the Mathematical Sciences, as thus:

An easier way to know the weight of a Ship.
First cause the Carpenter that doth build the Ship, or otherwise, if that
you desire to know it by any other Ship that is builded already, if that
Ship have any occasion for to come a ground: then get some cunning
Carpenter to take the true mold of that Ship, as though that he should
build an other of that mold and proportion in all points, as much as is
buried into the water, when the Ship is load unto her lode mark, that being
exactly done, then cause him for to make the true mold and proportion, then
cause the Carpenter for to cut out of a piece of Timber the true proportion of
the mold of the Ship in all points, as thus.

For every foot long, make the mold in Timber in length, an inch: and for
the breadth in like manner, for every foot make the other an inch, and also
for every foot in deepenesse, that the Ship swymmeth into the water, make the
mold in Timber one inch, and so consequently every part and place both of
the roune, and way, and floor, with the quarters of the Ship, to cut the
mold for every foot, and part of a foot, an inch, with those parts, even
as the work or mold of the Ship doth run, in all points: and that
being exactly done, then let there be made in some kind of mettle, as Lead
or Tynne, the true proportion of the mold, hollow, and thight, that it may
hold water, as the mold in wood will show or lead them howe to do it
very truly: and then that being done, then cause an other square vessel too
be made of mettle in Cubicke wise, such a one as you may measure the hollow
thereof as easily as you may measure a square piece of Timber, and if that
there were lines or pricks at every inch in deepenesse, it were all the
better.

And then this being done, then fill that vessel, that is made for the
mold of the Ship, with that water that the Ship doth swim in, and that
being exactly filled, then put that water into the other vessel, and look
that there be none of the water shed, then you may know justly howe many
inches square that the water is, by measuring the water with an inch rule: and
that being known, then you do know howe many foot that the solled body of
the mold of the Ship doth conteyne. And then weighing instlye one foot
square every way of that water, and then you knowing howe many pounds, and
parts of a pound, that one foot square of water doth way, then multiply
the number of feet of the Ship, with that you have found before, by pouring
the water into the square vessel: and then for every inch, the Ship is a
foot, and so by that number multiplied by the number of the wayght of the
pounds, and parts of pounds, the true wayght of the Ship shall appear: and if
you do commit any error, the fault shall be in not weighing, and measuring of
it truly.

The ensample of the knowing the weight of a ship.
And for your better understanding hereof, you shall have an ensample of that
matter before rehearsed, by a ship of.100. tonnes, and the length of the mold
of the Ship, to be 50. foot long, and the broadest place of the mold to
be.20. foot broad, and the deepenesse that the Ship goes into the water,
to be.12. foot: and I first caused the Carpenter to take the true mold of
the Ship, and also to cat the mold in wood, according unto the length,
breadth, and deepenesse, that is to say, for the.50. foot long, to be 50.
inches, and for the 20. foot broad, to be 20. inches: and for the 12. foot
deep, to be 12. inches, with al the other proportion of the mold of the
Ship, to be one inch for a foot: And that done, there was caused too be made
a mold in Lead, agreeable in all points, to the mold of the shp, as Lead,
will mark easily yenough: and then there was made the other vessel in Lead of
12. inches square, and.48. inches deep, and then the mold for the Ship was
filled with water, and that being justly, and equally filled, the water was put
into the square vessel, and then the deepnes of the water was exactly
measured, was found to be 42. inches in deepnes, the for that the vessel was 12.
inches square, 12. times 12. is 144. so many inches there is at 1. inch deep:
and then for that it is.42. inches in deepenesse, multiply.144. by.42. that
makes.6048. so that you may conclude, that the mold of the Ship, as much as
is under the water, if that it were not hollow within, that it would
conteyne.6048. foot of Timber. And now suppose that the water was of our
water, here at Grauesende, and that is not of the lightest sort, neither of the
heaviest sort, and a foot square of that water weighs.55. pound, most
commonly, although that it may waygh sometime less, and sometimes more, it
weighs less, after much rain, and neape Tides: it weighs more in spring Tides
at a full Sea, upon some cause of winds, but it alters no great matter within
a pound under or over. Wherefore multiply 6048. by.55. and that makes.332640.
so then you may conclude, that the ship waigheth.332640. pound: And then as
is declared in the Chapter going before, for to know howe many tonnes that the
ship doth waygh, divide that by.2240. and then there will stand in the
quantity line.148. and there will remain over.11209. so that you may conclude,
that the whole ship with all her ladyng, and al other furniture, and
implements in her, doth waygh.148. tonnes, and a half of a tonne. And by
this order, you may know the true wayght of any ship, howe graat or small
soever that it be, or Boat, or any other thing that swymmeth.

And furthermore, you may know by this Art Statical, Another way to know the
weight of a ship, with al her furniture.
the true weight of any ship, without putting of water into the square
vessel, although that you do not know the contents, howe many foot square
that there is in the Ship, as thus: the mold of the Ship being taken, as
before is declared, and the proportion of the mold, made in mettle hollow,
as before is rehearsed.

And furthermore, you may make the mold lesser then before is rehearsed, that
is to say, you may make the proportion of the mold, for every foot that the
Ship is in length, breadth, and deepenesse, you may make it but half an
inch, or but a quarter of an inch, at your discretion: and then filling that
with water, and then wayghyng the water truly, look howe many times the
length of that mold that is filled with water, is in the length of the
Ship, multiply the wayght of the water with that number Cubickely, and that
shall show unto you the true wayght of the Ship, with al her ladyng. As for
ensample by that ship, before rehearsed, that was.50. foot long, and, 20.
foot broad, and.12. foot in deepenesse.

And now I caused the mold too be made for every foot, A ensample.
but a quarter of an inch, so that for the.50. foot long, the mould was
made.12. inches, and a half: and for.20. foot broad, but 5. inches: and
for.12. foot deep, but.3. inches: that being filled with water, the water
being wayghed, did conteyne in wayght 3. pound, 2. of.73. parts of a pound,
and that is scante half an ounce, and the true contents of the wayght of the
water: and then for that you do see that the proportion of the length of the
mold, is but twelve inches, and one of 2. part: that is, but the.48. part
of the length of the Ship: therefore multiply it in this manner 48. times 48.
and that makes 2304. and then to multiply it by 48. again, and then it makes
110592. wherefore now multiply.110592. by the wayght of the water, that is too
say 110592. times 3. and 2. of 73. parts: and that makes 334620. so that you
may conclude, that the Ship weighs 334640. pounds.

And now to know howe many tu^nes that the Ship doth way, as before is
declared by deuyding that number by 2240. and so further, as before is
rehearsed. And furthermore, you may cause in the proportion of the mould of
Lead or Tynne, to be certain Parallel lines, to be made but a quarter of an
inch asunder, as many as you list, and then you may know by those lines what
wayght that the Ship is of, when that she is not laden. And also if that you
list, you may know howe many tons more in weight, will load the Ship, as
often times as you do know howe many foot or inches the Ship doth lack
of her load mark.

And yet furthermore, you may know, howe for too know the wayght of any
Ship with all her loadyng, although that you have not made the hollow mold
of the Ship, as thus: by that mold that the Ship Carpenter hath made,
Another ensample howe to know the weight of any ship.
the wood being not so heavy as the water, then make certain holes in the
mold metal, then at those holes, put in Lead, vntyl such time as the mold
is heavier then the water, and then stop the holes again, that no water may
go into them, and cut of that part that there is more then the mold of
the Ship: and that done, then in some small thing or vessel put in water
unto some certain mark, and then put into that water, the mold for that
Ship which you do desire for too know the weight of, and be sure that the
water doth cover al the mold: and then take out all that water very
precyselye, that is fed by that means of the mold for the Ship, until such
time that the water be just in that height that it was before, that the
mold was put in: and then weighing that water truly, you doing as before is
rehearsed* to multiply the length of the mold of the Ship according as
before is declared, Cubickely, and then the wayght of that water that is hyghed
more then it was before that the mold was put into the water, and the wayght
of that water being perfectly known too be multiplied by that Cubicke number,
shall show justly the true wayght of the Ship, as before is declared in all
points.

And by all these rules or order, you may know the just wayght of any thing
that sooymmeth in the water, saving that you must have consyderation, that any
mold made of wood, when it is dry, doth receive or drink up water, and
when it is wet, it swelled the bigger with the water.

The fourth Chapter shows by the Art Statical, the wayght of any mettle or
stone, howe much, or what wayght that it doth wayghe in the water, to be
lifted or weighed from the bottom, unto the brim of the water.
Now for that I have said somewhat for too know the wayght of things
sooymmyng on the water, I think it convenient too treat partly by the Art
Statical, to know the weight of any thing that synketh into the water: and to
know truclye howe much that it waygheth more then the wayght of the water,
proportion for proportion, whereby you may know what it waygheth justly, being
sunk into the water: and also you may know by this means, howe for to
measure such things, whose form, whether that it be mettle or stone, that
for the strangeness of the for me is not to be measured, as branches of
mettle, or pillars that be inbowed or hollow in one place, and boils out in
another, or any such other strange form, which is to de done by that means,
that Archimedes found the deceit of the Kings crown of gold. And first for
to know the true wayght of any Mettle that is sunk in the water, whether
that it be brass, iron, or stone, you knowing the wayght thereof before that it
was sunk: then make a cube, or any other square, of that kind of Mettle that
you would know what it waygheth in the water, and waygh that Mettle truly,
and that being known howe many pounds, and parts that it waygheth, then take
of that water, that the Mettle is sunken into: and then if you do make a
Cube, or any other square hollow, in form like unto the massy Cube or square,
neither bigger nor lesser, then that you have made in Mettle, and weighed. And
then fill that hollow cube with the water, and then waygh the water truly, and
that done, look what that water waygheth, pull that sum truly away from
the weight of the massy Cube or square, and that which doth remain, shall be
the true weight that the massy Cube doth waygh in the water: and so by that
Cube you may know the weight of the greater portion that is sunk, as thus:
The wayght of the sunken mettle being known, look howe many times the wayght
of the small Cube is in the greater quantity, that is sunk, so many times
multiply the weight of the water in the hollow Cube, and that done, subtract
or take away so much in wayght from the sunken Mettle, and that which doth
remain, shall be the true wayght of the sunken Mettle in the water to be
wayghed, till that it doth begin to appear above the water: Or otherwise, you
may do it in this manner, by the small Cube, before rehearsed, being iusty
wayghed, and the wayght known unto you, take of that sort of water that the
Mettle is sunk into, and put it into some vessel, fytte for your purpose:
and that done, then mark the edge of the water justly upon both the sides,
then put your massy Cube into the water, that it be covered with water, and
then take out, as much of the water as is risen above the marked places, and
then waygh that water truly.

And now the true weight of the water being known unto you, then as before is
rehearsed, subtract or take away the wayght of the water fro the weight of the
cube in mettle, then that which doth remain, shall be the true wayght of the
Cube in Mettle, when it is sunk to the bottom of the water, and then by the
small is known, the wayght of the greater portion, as before is declared, by
knowing howe many times, that the greater quantitye is more then the lesser,
and then multiplying the wayght of the water so many times as the quantitye
doth show, and then subtracting or pulling away that wayght, then that which
doth remain, shall be the true wayght of the Mettle in the water, as for
ensample thus:

By a piece of ordinance of brass, that is sunk, that is to be wayged out of
the water, and the wayght is known to be.7000. weight, for that it is a double
Cannon, that is sunk, and I do desire for to know the true wayght, what it
doth waygh in the water.

Wherefore I do take another piece of that sort of Mettle, that waygheth.100.
wayght, it makes no matter, what form that it hath, so that it be of that
sort, or of that kind of Mettle, for whereas I spake of a Cube before, that
was to no other end, but to make the thing the more playner, as hereafter it
shall more plainly appear: and then take of that water, that the piece of
ordinance was sunk into, for that al waters are not of one wayght, and then
put that water intoo some convenient vessel, meet for your purpose, and then
mark the water very precisely, round about, even at the very edge of the the
water, then put the piece of mettle into the water, then having some convenient
vessel already wayghed, and then take out, without any shedding of the water,
all that water that is above the place marked before, neither more, nor less,
nor higher, nor lower, and that being done truly, then take the weight of the
water, and by supposition, it is found to be.14. pound just, and the brass,
that is put into the water, being one hundredth weight, that is.112. pound.

Therefore I do conclude, that the wayght of the water, is but the.8. part of
the wayght of the Brass or mettle, so that I do conclude, that the piece of
Brass or mettle doth waygh in the water.7. of.8. parts of his own proper
wayght, that is, but.98. pound.

And now for to know the wayght of the sunken Rannon, do thus: Look howe
many hundred wayght that you have in.7000 wayght, and that is.70. hundred
wayght. Wherefore multiply.14. by.70. and that comes unto.980. pounds, which
makes 800 wayght, and 3. of.4. part: And this sum being pulled away from
7000. weight, which is.7840. pounds, then there remains.6860. pounds, and
that is.6100. and.28. pounds in weight: and every.100. weight, to contain.112.
pound. Al thing in the water, is lighter then his own proper wa^ght by the
quantity of the water in weight that it occupies, and out of the water, it
waigheth his own proper weight.
And now by this order you may know the true weight of any sunken mettle,
what it waygheth in the water, to be weighed from the ground, unto the
appearing of any part thereof above the superficial of the water: and then
too be wayghed above, out of the water, then it hath his own natural wayght,
what kind of mettle soever it be, as Silver, and Gold, Copper, Lead Tin,
Iron, Steel, or Stone, or whatsoever it be that synketh into the water, you
may know the true wayght of it, in the water, by the order before rehearsed,
by putting into that kind of water, any piece or lompe, what form soever it
hath, it makes no matter, so that it be of that sort of Mettle or stone,
being truly and exactlye wayghed, and then to take out so much of that water,
as by the means of that mettle or stone is hyghed more then it was before the
putting in of the mettle or stone: And that water truly weighed, and the
wayght thereof known unto you, then rebate that weight from the wayght of the
mettle or stone truly, and then that which doth remain, shall be the true
weight of the mettle or stone, being sank into the water. And by that means
you may know the true wayght of any great quantitye that is sunk into the
water, by knowing how many times the great quantitye is more then the lesser,
and then to multiply the weight of the water, so many times as the weight of
the greater is more then the lesser, then that which doth remain, shall be
the true weight of the greater quantity of mettle, or stone, that is sonke
into the water.

The fifth Chapter shows how to know the true measure in the inches or
feet, of any strange form, such as Geometry can give no ordering for the
measuring thereof, as to measure a branch in mettle, or a pillar that is
enbowed and full of hollowness in diverse places, and boils out in diverse places:
and also how to know the diversity of the weight of mettle, or the diuersytie
between the weight of Stone and mettle.
AND furthermore, by this means you know the true measure in inches or feet,
of any strange form, what shape soever it hath, such shapes that no Art by
any capacity are not to be measured, whether it be in mettle, stone, wood, or
in wax, or gommes, or what soever it be, or a Crown, or Crowns, or a
branch, or branches, or a pillar, or pyllers, or things that be inbowed in
one place, and boils out in an other, or a Cup, or bowl, or a Pot or
Pots that keep not in thickness one quantity, but it is thicker in one
place then in an other, as there be diverse other forms not beer spoken of,
that no man by Art is able to measure them, for that they keep in no place
one proportion.

Wherefore I do think it convenient, to treat partly hereof, and to know the
true contents of any form what soever it be, in inches or feet, then do
thus: Cause to be made some hollow Cube or Square, in such form that you may
measure it with an inch rule with ease, and to know the true contents thereof,
or any part thereof at your pleasure, within the hollow part, and then you
having of diverse sorts of these hollow cubes or squares, some that do
contain more, and some that do conteyne less, as near as shall require: and
then take some convenient vessel mete for your purpose, and put water into it,
and that done, then take that thing which you do require too know the true
contents of the number of inches or feet, the before you do put that into
the water, mark the side of that thing or vessel roude about by the very edge
of the water very precisely, that you do not commit error by that means:
and that being truly done, the put that mettle or thing into the water, that
it be covered: and that done, take out as much of the water as is risen by the
means of the thing of mettle put into the water, until the water do stand
just at the mark that it was before: then put that water into the hollow cube
or square, without any of the water shed or spylled by, for that may cause
some error: then with an inch rule measure the true deepenes of the water in
the cube or square, and so shall you know justly, how many inches or feet of
mettle there is, by the multiplying of the length, breadth, and deepenes of
the water: As for ensample thus: by a branch, or candlestick (to hang in a
house) of Latin or Brass, my desire is to know, how many inches of mettle
there is contained in it: and then I did first put in water into a tub or
vessel, that I had appointed for that purpose, and then I marked the water in
the tubbe or vessel round about at the very edge of the water: and then I put
the brauach or candlestick into the water, and that sunk unto the bottom,
and then I took out all that water that was did by the means of the branch
or candlestick of Latin, then I did put that water into a little cube of 6.
inches square every way, like unto a dee, did it precisely shed none of the
water, neither took I out any more or less of the water, but in I unto the
mark upon the tub or vessel side, then I measured the true deepenes of the
water in the little cube, found it to be 5. inches,. parts of an inch, that is
to say, that it was 5. inches a half half a quarter the I did multiply it in
this manner, for that cube was 6. inches square.6. times.6. and that was.36. and
then that being multiplied again, by.5.. parts: that makes.202. and.. part
so that I did conclude, that the branch or candlestick in latin or brass,
was.202. inches and a half in mettle, and so by this means you may know the
true contents of any form, whatsoever it be: It is also very good, to try
the parts of a globe, or globes, or you may double any cube what soever it be,
you may do it very exactly, by this order, having this consideration, that you
do mark the water truly, and shed or spil none of the water, and that you
do measure the water truly, the deepenesse, and that must be done with some
fine styffe wire, for if that you do put in any big rule, then that will
swell, or high the water somewhat, according unto the bigness of the rule or
thing. Wherefore it is very good for to have the cube or square to be marked
with inches, and parts of inches, within the insyde round about with parallel
liens at every inch end, and also it is not good to have your square vessel
too broad, for the narower that it is, the more certain: and also you may not
shift your water into to many things, and especially if it be wood, for that
same water will hang upon it, and also wood will receive, or drink water. And
al these may be causes that may hinder the exact truth: and also this order of
measuring is very good, to know if any thing be made in gold, for that it is a
very heavy mettle, and no other mettle so heavy as it is, if there were made
any vessel in gold, and any deceit in it, then putting that vessel into
water, then mark how high the water doth rise, than take out of that water
the vessel again, then take that weight of gold, and put it into the water,
and if the vessel did raise the water higher then the gold, then there is
deceit in the vessel, but if the water be at both the times of one like
height, then there is no deceit in it, as this was the very way, that
Archimedes found the deceit of the Crown of gold, also this art or order of
mesuring doth not altogether show the contents of inches or feet, but also you
may know the diversity of weight of every several sorts of mettle, how much
the ^ne sort is heavier then the other, as thus: you having of 2 sorts of
mettle, the water being first marked, then weighing the mettle before you do
put it into the water, the mark the water how hie it rises, and then mark it
there again, then take that mettle out of the water, and then put in of the
other mettle so much in quantity, till that it raise the water, unto that
just height that it was before: and it makes no matter, although it be of many
pieces, so that it be al of one sort of mettle, and then take out the mettle,
and weigh it justly, and so shall you see certainly how much in weight it doth
differ quantity for quantity, or otherwise: you may know the diversity of
the weight of metals, by wayghing two sorts of mettle, and let them be both
of one weight just, and then the water being marked, put in the one sort of
mettle first, and then take out that water, as much as is risen by the means
of the mettle unto the first marked place, and put that into the hollow Cube,
as before is rehearsed, and then cast the contents how many inches it
contains justly: and that done, then take that mettle out of the water, and
put in the water that is in the hollow Cube or square, again, into the
vessel, that the water may stand at the first appointed mark justly again:
and then put in the other sort of mettle, that is of the just weight the other
was before, and then take all that water out, and put it into the Cube, and if
that the water in the Cube be fewer number of inches then it was before, then
that mettle is heavier then the first mettle, as the proportion of the number
of inches will show you justly: and if there be more water at the later time
then there was at the first time, then that mettle is lighter then the first
mettle, and the number of inches will show you the true quantity, by
multiplying them, as before is rehearsed.

And if the water at both the times be of one height, or measure in the little
cube, then both the metals are of one weight. And by this means, or Art
Statical, you may know the diversity between the weight of Stone and mettle,
or the diversity of weight of one kind of Stone and an other, for that all
sorts of Stone, is not of one kind of weight, as all sorts of metals are
not of one weight. And also by this Art Staticall, you may know the diuersytie
of the weight of wood and stone, or any other kind of mettle, although the
one sort doth swim, and the other sort sinks, and that you must do in
this manner.

All those kind of woods that do swim, and if their form be such, that
you may measure them, then the matter is of no opportunity, to know the
contents thereof, for that it requires no other thing, but to measure the
contents in inches, to weigh them how many pound they do both contain: and if
the form in wood be such, that you cannot easily measure it, by such order as
before is declared, you may know the contents of the wood, by putting it down
into the water by some slight, although it would swim, to synke it, you
weighing it before it comes into the water, to know how many pound it
contains. And as touching all these matters before rehearsed, it is a very
easy matter to know how many inches, and parts of an inch, will make a
pound weight of any kind or sorts of mettle, or water, or wood, as thus:

You knowing how many inches, that any stuff doth contain, whether it be
Gold, Silver, Copper, Lead, Tin, Iron, stone, wood, or water: the weight
being known^, then divide the contents of the number of inches, by the number
of pounds, and that will show you the true contents, how many inches and
parts of an inch, will make a pound weight,

The syxt Chapter shows by Art Staticall to know the weight of any Ship,
that is sunk into the Sea, or any other river, too know how many tun will
weigh her up again.
AND furthermore, insomuch as I have declared heretofore, how to know the true
weight of any kind of mettle, that is sunk into the Water* now I think it
convenient, too show unto you, how too give a near guess, or an estimation, if
any Ship by any misfortune should be sunk, either in the Sea, or in a haven,
or river, to know how many tons would weigh her up again, that is to say, to
know how many tun in weight she doth weigh in the water, being sunk, which
is to be done in this manner: first they must know what kind of goods the
Ship is laden withal, that is sunk, and to set down a remembrance or note of
every sort, how much of every sort of the said goods, also to set down a
remembrance or note of the contets of the weight of her ordinance, ankors: also
if it be such goods as do require knitlege or ballast, you must know how many
tuns there may be thereof, also what kind of ballast it is, whether it be sand,
or stones, or earth: al these being known, then according as the kind of
goods is, then try how many tons every sort of that goods may weigh in the
water, as thus: if it be Copper, Lead, Tin, Iron, Steel, or stone, or such
other like, that do not penetrate, or do not drink, or suck in any liquor,
or water: and the weight thereof known, then for al those matters, by the rules
before rehearsed, do show unto you the truth of the matter. Then if the lading,
or part of the lading, be Wax, Pytche, or Tar, or Honey, or such like,
Gummes, or what soever it be that is heavier then the water, the consideration
of the rule Staticall before rehearsed, will show unto you the truth of the
matter, accordingly as is bfore rehearsed in al points, and if the ladyng or
any part thereof be such things as do penetrate, or do receive or drink in
liquor or water, upon that matter there may grow some error. But to take away
some part of that error, you shall have this remedy or help, and that is
this.

If it be Wool, or Woollen cloth, or Cotton, Sylke, Flax, Hemp, or Lynnen
cloth, or any such other like, then shall you make your proof in this manner,
as before is rehearsed in the Chapters going before, and that is thus: Fill
some vessel with that kind of water, that the Ship is sunk into, then mark
the edge of the water, and that being done, if there be any great quantity
of that kind of goods or merchandise, then take of that sort dry, as the
goods were before it was laden, whether it be Wool, or woollen Cloth, or
Cotton. c. And then that being dry, weigh it, and then open it loosely, that
the water may drink into it, and that being soked, by imagination as the goods
is or may be, then take out so much of the water as is risen by that means of
the wool or woollen cloth, or what soever it be, and then the weight of the
water being known, pull the weight of the water from the weight of such
things as you have made proof thereof, and that weight which doth remain,
shall be the weight that the said goods doth waygh in the Water. And
furthermore, if the ladyng of the Ship be such, Some kind of goods is of
that nature that it weighs no weight in the water.
as doth requrie kintlege or ballast, if it be wines, or oils, and such other
like, for that kind of goods is of no weight in the water, for it is rather
lighter then the water: then you must make account of the Kintledge or Ballast,
and if it be stones, then the order or Art Staticall doth show you what it may
contain in wayght very well, by making your proof as before is rehearsed. Some
sort of goods must have kintledge or ballast.
But if the Ballast be earth or Sand, then put the Sand or earth into the
water, then let the earth or sand settle unto the bottom: that being done,
you shall see the water will be clear aloft: and then take out of the water,
until the water be of that height that it was before, the weigh the water, the
pulling the true weight of the water fro the weight of the earth or sand, then
that weight which doth remain, shall be that weight that so much earth or sad
shall weigh in the water. And the doing as before is rehearsed, by the weight of
a little, by the proportion of the weight of a greater, is known what it doth
weigh in the water. And furthermore, there is some kind of goods, although it
be heavier then the water, yet in remaining long in the water, it will consume,
that is sugar or salt. c. But most kind of goods, the longer it remains in
the water, the heuier it is, for that the water soketh into it thoroughly. And
also any ship being long sunk, there grows diverse, accidets to make it the
heuier, that is, by the means there will settle both sand owes into her, also the
dry timber that is a loft in a ship, will beco heuier by the soking of the
water: for this is to be noted, that a ship would not sink unto the bottom,
but by the means of the ballast or such other like heavy goods: therefore for
the very hold of the Ship, as much as is Timber, a very small allowance
will serve for the wayght of it in the water. For although it besoked, yet it
is but little more then the weight of the water, for the Tackle or ropes will
weigh more in the water, then the hold of the Ship will, for they be much
the heavier, for the pitch and tar that is upon them. Wherefore, you must
take a note, what number of Cables, and other ropes may be in her, and their
weight being known, then make your proof, as before is rehearsed, by the Art
Staticall. But if that any part of the loding be oil, or Wine, or Tallow, or
such other like, it is not heavier then the water: all such kind of goods is
of no wayght in the water, but will rather help then hinder. And also if any
part of the ladyng be of Timber, as Mastes, or Spares, Deals. or Wainscot,
or such other like, all such kind of goods will rather help it to swim,
then hinder any thing. And now this being done, and you knowing what kind of
goods there is in the Ship, and how much of every sort, and your proof being
made by this Art Staticall, and you knowing the weight of every particular
thing, what it doth contain in the water, as well the weight of the
Ordinance, Cables, Anchors, Ropes, and the Ballast. c. And then adding all your
numbers together, then shall you see very near what all the whole wayght of
the Ship with her ladyng doth waygh in the water, and that being known, then
you do know what number of Tons will waygh the Ship up again, and that
being known, then the matter is the more easier to know how to make provision
for to weigh her up again.

The seventh Chapter shows howe to waygh a Ship that is sunk, where it
doth ebb and flow. c.
Now you knowing the wayght of any Ship that is sunk, if you would waygh
her up again, then when you do make your provision for to waygh her, take as
many Ships, Hoyes, or Lyghters, as will bear that number of tons, that the
sunk Ship doth weigh in the water, and in every.40. or 50. tons, take.10.
tons more, for that it is better to have too much, then any thing too little:
And look that you have good Ropes that are able to bear so much in wayght, as
the sunken Ship doth waygh in the water, and the when you have made your
Cables, hawseres, ropes fast upon the sunken Ship, you must take such
order in the making fast of your Cables, or Ropes, that every Ship Hoye, or
Lyter may waygh or lift up the wayght of her proper burden, for else you may be
deceived, for that I have seen by experience, that the Ship which hath been
sunk in the water, hath not wayghed.40. tons, and the Hoyes or Lyters would
carry more then.60. tons, and yet they were not able to waygh the said Ship,
but were driven to let go their fastes or Cables, and ropes again, or else they
should have ben sunk, and that was but for lack of knowledge in that matter,
for the Ships, Hoyes, or Lyters will waygh or lift most from the bottom,
when they have no lading, and yet notwithstanding they will waygh or lift the
lesser, if they do use that matter as I have seen, for that they do make
fast their Cables ropes some unto the side of the Ships, Hoyes, or Lyters,
and some unto the head, and so forth.

And now the Ships, Hoyes, or Lyters, are not able to waygh or lift, not one
quarter of their proper burden, and they lift or weigh much the les, for that
they have no lading within: for if they do make fast their Cables or Ropes
unto the side, then it will not lift the.10. part of their proper burden, for
that the side will soon go down. And if they do make fast their Cables and
Ropes unto the head, (for there it will waygh or lift most) yet it will not
waygh or lift one third part of their burden, for having no lodyng, the
head will soon go down into the water. Wherefore whenever they do mean
for to waygh any Ship that is sunk: How to use the lighters to make them lift
or waygh their own proper burden.
then they must prepare long, strong, and great Timber, or strong Mastes, and
let them be laid cross the Ships, Hoyes, or Lyters, over both the sides,
and to match.2. and.2. together of equal burden, as near as you can, and let
the long Timber or Mastes lye cross both the Shyps, Hoyes, or Lyghters, and
over both the sides, and then bring your Cables or ropes that are fast unto the
sunk Ship, over the long Timber or masts, and then make the ropes fast within
the Ships, or Lyghters: and this done, then the ships, Hoyes, or Lyghters
will weigh or lift, their own proper burden, otherwise they will not. And then
it stands you in hand to get such Timber that will not break for that
burden, for if the Timber doth break, it will put al in hassard of synking
again. Also it is very good to weigh a ship with kaske, and every hogeshead,
pipe, or butte, will waygh or lift as much in weight, as it would waygh, if
it were full of that water, excepting the proper wayght of the vessel or kaske,
so that the Kaske be made thight, that no water may come into it. And then when
you do mean for to waygh or lift up any Ship, that is sunk, your Ropes,
or Cables being fast unto the sunken Ship, then you having al your things in a
readiness, your Ships, Hoyes, or Lyghters, and the great Timber or Mastes
laid cross over both the sides of them, and two and two of them, and also
your kaske, then make fast your ropes and Cables unto the Ships or Lighters,
at a lowe water, the flood being in hand. Provided always, that you bring the
ropes or cables over the Timber, you must make your ropes fast at a low water,
the flood being in hand.
that lies cross the Hoyes or Lyghters, and also then to make fast the Kaske
unto your ropes or Cables. And then as the flood rises, so shall the sunken
Ship rise from the bottom: and then as the water doth rise or high, so go
towards the land, or shore, till it be a full Sea, and then the sunken Ship
will rest upon the ground again. And then at the next lowe water: they
shortening or making fast their cables or ropes again, then the next full Sea,
they may bring the sunken Ship, nearer unto the land or shore. And thus
they may bring the sunken Ship unto the land or shore, until such time as
the sunken Ship shall be laid upon dry ground at a lowe water. For you may
know in howe many Tides that you may waygh her, and lay her upon dry
ground, at a lowe water, as thus: Sound, How to know in how many Tides you
may weigh a ship.
or look howe many fadome, the sunken Ship lies in at a lowe water, and
then look how many fadome the water hygheth, or flows till it be a full
Sea, and then consider howe deep that your Shyps, Hoyes, or Lyghters, will go
into the water, before they are able to lift the sunken Ship from the
bottom: and then consider howe much, or howe many fadome or feet, the water
will rise afterwards: and so shall you see in howe many Tides that you shall
bring her to be dry at a lowe water. As for ensample thus: Suppose that any
Ship or Hoye is sunk at eight fadome at a lowe water, and the water doth
rise or high two fadome and a half from the lowe water unto a full sea: An
ensample of the w^ght of a Ship.
and then the Hoyes or Lyters will not be able to lift or waygh the sunken
Ship from the bottom, not vntyl they be laden down two foot, and better.
So that you may conclude, that the water will not rise or high little more then
two fadome, after that the sunken Ship is lifted or wayghed from the bottom:
and then going unto the Land or Shore, till that it was a full Sea.

And then the sunken Ship did rest upon the ground again at.6. fadome, at
a lowe water, and then at the next lowe water the Cables and Ropes were made
fast again, and when it was flowed two foot and better, the sunk Ship was
lifted from the ground again.

And then going unto the land or shore, till it was a full Sea, then the
sunken Ship did rest at.4. fadome at a lowe water: then at the next lowe
water, the Cables and ropes being made fast again, when it was flowed.2.
foot, and better, the sunk Ship was lifted from the bottom, and so going
in unto the land or shore till it was a full Sea: then the sunk Ship did
rest again, at.2. fadome at a lowe water: and then the Cables or ropes, being
shortened, and made fast again, then going unto the land or shore, vntyl that
it was a full Sea, and then resting, the sunk Ship shall be dry at a lowe
water: so that you may conclude, that the Ship that was sunk at.8. fadome
at a lowe water: and the water rise or did flow.2. fadome and a half, from
the lowe water unto the full Sea, and the Hoyes and Lyters would waygh or lift
the sunk Ship from the bottom, by that time they were title more then.2.
foot buried or settled into the water, and then in four Tides the sunk Ship
wylbe laid upon dry ground, at a lowe water.

And by this order you may know in howe many Tides that any Shyppemaye he
wayghed, and laid on dry ground at a lowe water, you knowing howe deep that
the Ship lies at a lowe water, and howe much it doth flow in any place
where it doth ebb or flow.

The eight Chapter shows howe to waygh a Ship, where it doth not ebb and
flow.
ANd furthermore, if that any Ship or any other vessel be sunk in such
places, where that it doth neither ebb, nor flow, that is too say, where
the water doth not high and lowe, there is some matter, and asks great
charges, and labour for to waygh or lift any great weighty from the bottom:
yet this way it is to be done, the wayght of the sunken Ship or vessel
being known, what that it doth waygh in the water, as before is rehearsed.

Then the number of tons being known, As touching the weighing of shyps,
whereas it doth not ebb and flow.
prepare so many Ships, Hoyes, or Lyghters, as will carry six or eight
times the wayght, that it doth waygh in the water, and then let them be near
half laden every one of them, with some handsome ballast that is wayghty, and
good to be removed too and fro.

And then when you have made your Ropes, and Cables fast unto the sunken Ship
or vessel, then bring your Hoyes, and Lyghters unto the sunk Vessel, and let
all that Ballast be thrown into one end of all the Hoyes and Lyghters, and
then make fast your Ropes and Cables unto that end that hath the ladyng or
ballast: Then your ropes and Cables being made fast, throw or carry all the
ballast or ladyng unto the other end, and then it will waygh or lift the
sunken Ship from the bottom.

Wherefore you must have double so many as is able too lift or waygh it:
Not^th^ point.
for when that all the ladyng is thrown unto the other end: then whylest that
the one hath lifted or wayghed it, the other Hoyes or Lyghters must make fast
their Ropes and Cables unto the laden ends again. And thus they must do as
often times as the lading is thrown unto the further end, they must have as
many Lyghters as are able too lift or waygh it, whyllest that the other
Lyghters do hang or turn the laden end, and to be made fast unto the Ropes,
and Cables again.

And thus in time, they shall waygh or lift the sunken thyp or vessel, unto
the drymme of the water, and then they may carry the sunken vessel unto the
land or shore. And by this order or means, they may waygh any Ship or
vessel up unto the brymme of the water, in such places whereas it doth
neither ebb nor flow.

The nyenth Chapter shows how to bring in any ship over a shulde or bar,
and to make the Ship bear Sail, when al the ballast is out: and also if
need require, how to lift the Ship higher out of the waterwardes, to the
intent to bring her in. c.
ANd now, insomuch that I have showed how to waygh any Ship that is sunk, as
well in such places whereas it doth not ebb and flow, and also ebb and flow.
In like manner, I do think it convenient too show unto you, how for to bring
a Ship in over a bar or Shulde, whereas there is not sufficientnesse of
deepth of water to come into any haven or River, and if that all the ballast is
out, and if there is not sufficientnesse of deepth of water: Then howe to lift
her higher out of the waterwards, vntyl the ship is sufficiently out of the
water, to bring her in over the shulde or bar. c.

And first thus, if that any Ship be come intoo any Haven or harborowe, and
by the means of a shulde or bar, that she hath not deepth of water yenough,
and yet the Ship is but in her ballast: Then do thus: Prepare two great
Hoyes or Lyghters, and also strong haulsers or Cables, and then bring the one
of the Hoyes or Lyghters, on the one side, and the other, on the other side,
and that done, then make fast the head, and the sterne of both the Hoyes or
Lyghters, with strong Ropes or Haulsers, and make them fast, as high in the
Ship, as you can conveniently, and then heave all the ballast out of the
Ship into the two Hoyes, or Lighters: And that done, the Ropes and Haulsers
being fast unto the head and sterne of the Lyghters or Hoyes, and unto the
Ship, the Ship cannot overthrow, although al the Takle, and Mastes are
standing: for look when the ship would shield, then it cannot do it, except
that it should lift the furdest Lighter or Hoye out of the water, which is not
possible for to do, as long as the Ropes, or Cables do hold: and then if
that it do offer to hold the other way, then that lighter that is on the
other side, will not suffer it, as long as the ropes or fastes do hold:
Wherefore the ship may bear sail, although al the ballast were out, c.

But if that there be not sufficientnesse of deepth of water upon the shulde
or bar, to bring the Ship in over it, when al the ballast is out: yet
notwithstanding you may make such provision, that you may lift her higher up
out of the water, vntyl such time as the Ship may be able to come in, as
thus: you having provided two such Lyghters, meet for the purpose, as before
is declared, then prepare long and strong great Timber or Mastes, that may be
of such sufficient length, that will reach the breadth of the Ship, and the
breadth of both the Lyghters all at once.

And then the Lyghters being made fast, as before is rehearsed, and al the
ballast heued or thrown out of the Ship into the two Lyghters, then the
Lyghters being laden with the ballast, then make holles thorough both the sides
of the Ship in sundry places, and then put the long and strong great Timber
thorough both the sides of the Ship, that it may be ouerthwarte cross over
both the sides of the Lyghters, and in such sort, that the Ship may rest or
hang upon the long and strong great Timber or Mastes, and rest or lye upon
the two sides of both the Lyghters. And then having out all the ballast out of
both the Lyghters, the two Lyghters will heave up out of the waterwardes, as
much in weighty as their own proper Tonnage or burden comes unto, c. And
by this means you may lift any Ship out of the water, unto what proportion
you list: and also you knowing the wayght of the Ship, as you may know it,
as it doth appear in the second and third Chapters going before: Then
accordingly you may make your provision of the two Lyghters, to lift such
sufficient quantitye of the Ship that shall be able to serve your turn, and
also if that it should happen, so that the Ship should be a ground upon
the should or bar, and yet the place that the Ship is a ground on, doth
neither ebb nor flow, yet notwithstanding you have this remedy to help it,
then lade both the Lyghters again, and let the Ship rest upon the ground, and
then you may bolster ^t up by some provision between the two Lyghters sides,
and the long Timber or Mastes, until that it be sufficient to serve your
turn: and then discharging the Lyghters, they shall lift up the Ship higher
again: And by this means you may bring in any ship, higher again over any
should or bar, so that the water be sufficient deep, that the Lyghters being
laden, may pass in over the bar or should. c.

The tenth Chapter doth show unto you, how for to come unto the Keel of any
Ship, without the grounding of her, whereby you may collect any ship, and make
her thight unto the Keel, which is called carriyng of them. c.
AND for that our Country of Englande, is environed round about with the Sea,
so that no other Nation, or Country can come unto us, neither we unto them,
but only by sea, Scotlande only excepted: Therefore it stands us most
principally in hand too be most skilful in shipping, for that it is our
most principal force, and for that it is a very necessary matter for to know
how to cauke a Ship, or to stop a leake, and to make her thight down unto
the Keel of the Ship, in such places whereas it doth not ebb and flow water
in, for to ground any ship, then they must use such means as those do that
are in the leuat sea, that is, the sea called Mare Mediterraneum, as the
Genewayes Vemsians Rogosones, with a number of other, that have shipping in
that Sea, that I do omyt, that have great ships, and yet never do ground
them, but only do bring them over on the one side, which is called carriyng of
them, and many people that have heard thereof, have thought that they have
wound them over by force: and some have judged one way, and some an other way,
but few or none of them have judged the truth of the matter, although that
diverse Englishmen have been there, and have seen the thing done: yet as far
as ever I could perceive at their hands, they could never understand the
truth of the matter, and the cause thereof was, that they were never in the
Ship where she was a karrenyng, and yet for to karren a ship, it is a great
deal more ease for the Ship, then it is to be grounded in diverse respects,
and also they shall have more time and leisure both to search the Ship, and
caulke her, and to mark her thight, then they shall have in the grounding of a
Ship, and also they shall the better perceive where any leake is in the
karrenyng of them, then in the grounding of them.

And as touching the karrenyng of a Ship, this is too be done, first thus,
Cauke the sides of the Ship thight above the water, and especially that side
that you do mean to bring her over on, and also caulke the deck and ports,
and the sperkettes thight, and that done, then prepare labourers ynowe, and
bring the Ship reasonable light, that she may have little more ballast, then
she may bear her self well. And that done, her ordinance, and every loose
thing taken out of the Ship, then let the labourers heave the ballast over,
unto that side that you do mean to bring her over upon, and so heaving the
ballast over, the Ship will go over unto what proportion you list, and by
that means you may come unto the Keel of any ship, and mark her thight at
your pleasure, But diverse people have made argument and said, that the ship
will not rise upright again, and some have said, that lying a to^e side, it
would overthrow, and other would think that the ballast would slyp, but the
truth is this: as soon as ever the ballast is thrown or heaved backwards
again, the ship will begin to rise, and so in the end become to be upright
again.

Wherefore it is a strange matter, to see the strange opinion of some people
in the world that seems to be wise, and for that generally the most part of
men have thought that in the karrening of Ships, that they have been wound
down with caxslienes, and gearres, tackles by great force, and therefore they
have made fast the ballast by some provision, also have made raftes of masts, to
the end that they might lay the side of the Ship upon them, to help to bear
up the ship. And see the simple opinion of them that should be wise, to
think that the same should do any good, for Mastes being massy, and not
hollow, are but little lighter then water, so that.20. tons weight of them,
will not support up two tons, therefore that can do no great good at al. And
what a vain folly is it for them to make fast the ballast, that it should not
slyppe, for.20. tons of ballast, being made fast at the bottom of the
Ship, must require the force of 20. tuns to wind it down over: and then the
ballast, for that it is made fast, and the Ship wound down by force, the
Ship is forced down with more then forty Tons, for that the Ballast doth
hang over one way towards the Keelwardes, and the Ship is wound down the
contrary way on the one side, which must of force be in such sort, as a
thing that lies in a colepresse, and doth charge the Ship with a double
weight or burden, to preasse it into the waterwardes: and then what can the
quantity of the supporting of any thing that cannot lift a tun or two tun
weight thereof, do them any pleasure, besides the great cumber that they shall
have in those causes, to get such a number of Mastes, and also to make them
fast, or to frappe them together: and also in deed the ballast would slyppe,
the Ship being wound down by force, for when that the ship hath her
Ballast into the end, to make her to swym upright, and then to be wound down
by force, then the ballast doth hang towards the Keele, and the ship being
wound down to the side, then it must needs slyppe, as before is said,
except that it be made fast, for that the Ballast doth hang over one way, and
the Ship is wound down the other way, and then it is not possible to come
unto the keele, so well as they shall do, when the Ballast is but thrown or
heaved over unto the one side, for that it hath then no more then his own
proper wayght, where as otherwise the Ship is charged with double wayght, for
if she should have but forte tons of Ballast, the Ship is charged with
more then eyghtie tons in wayght, and also it is very hurtful and uneasy for
the ship. c.

And furthermore, as before is declared in this fourth book, called Staticke,
that no kind of thing doth enter no further into the water, then the quantity
or body or any thing that waigheth so much in weight, as the proportion in
bygnesse of so much water. Therefore any thing that is in the water, howe light
soever it is, can enter no further into the water, then the proportion of such
a magnitude of water. For if the thing be not the.xx. part of the weight of the
water, then the one of twenty part of the body doth enter into the water: and
19. of.20. parts shall be above the superficies of the water, c.

And furthermore, for that the water is an Element ponderous or heavy, and yet
thynne: therefore it is the nature and quality of water, to support or bear
up a thing that is lighter then it self: and yet it doth give any thing place
or leave to turn it self in the water, so that it shall swim with the
heauyest part downward, as by experience is seen of any thing that is put
into the water, as thus: Take a Raske, as a Pipe or Hogshead, or a Barrel, and
put it into the water, the thing being thyght, the tenth part of the bygnesse
or magnitude doth not go into the water, for that it is so light. And yet
notwithstanding, if any one part of the kaske be heauyer then the other, that
same part will turn downwards. And if you do turn it upwards, as soon as
ever you do let it go, it presently turns of it self downewardes again.
So that experience doth show this to be true, that the heauyest part of any
thing that is in the water, doth always turn, and seeks downewardes.
Therefore we may perfectly conclude thus of any ship, if the ballast be cast or
heaved over unto the side of any ship, that the ship doth turn over
accordingly, always to have the heauyest part downewardes.

Wherefore, contrary unto the vain opinions of a number of persons that should
be wise, that if the ballast be thrown over unto the side, that the ship shall
swim upon the side, and yet the ballast shall never slyppe, for that always
the ship doth turn of itself, to bring it unto the level, except it be let
by some cause, which is, either by making it fast, or else by some other
accidental matter, or else it will follow accordingly. c. And some people have
been of that opinion, that no Ship doth swim upright, but that there is as
much weight or more below in the water, as is above the water: but that is
untrue, as before it doth appear, by the ensample of a Raske or Barrel. For
you do see that it will swim, and the hea^yest part will turn downwards: if
that it be not one quarter of a pound heavier on the one side, then it is on
the other, that part will turn downewardes: and yet for all that, that part
that is in the water, will not waygh the.10. part of that which is above the
water.

Therefore you may conclude, that if the ballast do lye all upon the one side
of the Ship, the Ship shall swim upon that side, and the Keel shall come out
of the water. And if that the ship side be ^hight, there is no more danger in
her swimming on the one side, than if she were upright in the water. And also
the Ship doth not swim so deep into the water, lying on the one side, as she
doth swim when she is upright, for that the Ship is more lancker, or
slenderer, or sharper: that is to say, not so full and round, by the means of
her Tuck and Run, and the Foreway, as the side is round and full. Therefore
it cannot go so deep into the water, for as before is said, that nothing can
go no further into the water then the proportion of so much water in weight.
Wherefore the side being round and full, it is the more boyenter a great deal,
c. And also it is very good to bring a Ship in over a bar or shulde, for
lying upon the side, it doth draw much less water, then when it doth swim
upright c. But notwithstanding it is not so good for to Karrene the Queenes
majesties Ships, as it is the Merchants Ships, for two special caves, and
the first is this: the Queenes highness Ships have always as much ballast
in them, as they do usually go to the Sea withal, to be fast to bear a
sail, which is no small quantity in her bigger sort of Ships: and then
what a charge is it to take the greatest part of the ballast out of them, and
too take it in again, for they must take more then.3. quarters of the Ballast
out, when they do Karren them: whereas the Merchants Ships do deliver all
the ballast out when they do lade their ships: therefore the Merchants shall not
occupy the 20. part of the charges that the Queenes Ships must. And the
second cause is this, that in the Queenes Ships, the ballast is always
fyrme and harde, by the means that it is seeldome or never stirred, and also
the Cooke room is made up with brick upon the ballast, and also there is set
up in the Cooke room with Brycke work the furnases, to boyle their beef, and
other provision, that is made for the dressing of men's vittailes, as Quens and
hatches c. which were no small charge to remove and make up again, whereas in
the grounding of them all, these two great charges are saved, that Merchants
shyps in their karrening shall not need to be at. c. And thus I end the
fourth Book.

A Table of the Contents of the Chapters of the fourth book called a Treasure
for Travellers.
The first Chapter of the fourth Book, shows you by the proportion of a
Ship swimming in the water, for to know the true weight of any Ship, with
al her tackle, ordinance, furniture, and lading, c.

The second Chapter shows how for to measure the proportion of the mould of
any Ship, whereby is known the weight of any Ship, with all her ladynge and
furniture.

The third Chapter shows you an easier way, then before rehearsed, by the
Art Statical, to know the true weight of any Ship, with al her lading, and
all the rest of her furniture.

The fourth Chapter shows by the Art Statical, the wayght of any mettle or
stone, howe much, or what wayght that it doth waygh in the water, to be
lifted or weighed from the bottom, unto the brim of the water.

The fifth Chapter shows howe too know the true measure in inches or feet,
of any strange form, such as Geometry can give no order for the measuring
thereof, as to measure a branch in mettle, or a pillar that is enbowed and
full of hollowness in diverse places, and boils out in some places: and also
how to know the diversity of the weight of mettle, or the diversity between
the weight of Stone, and mettle.

The syxt Chapter shows by the Art Statical, to know the weight of any ship,
that is sunk into the Sea, or any river, too know howe many tun will weigh
her up again.

The seventh Chapter shows how to weigh a Ship that is sunk, where it doth
ebb and flow, c.

The eight Chapter shows howe to weigh a Ship, where it doth not ebb and
flow, c.

The nynth Chapter shows howe to bring in any ship over a shulde or bar,
and to make the Ship bear Sail, when al the ballast is out: and also if need
should require, how to lift the ship higher out of the waterwards to the
intent to bring her in, c.

The tenth Chapter doth show unto you, howe for to come unto the Keele of
any Ship, without the grounding of her, whereby you may collect any Ship,
and make her thight unto the Keele, which is called carenning of them. c.

Wherein is showed the cause of divers things that are to be seen on the Sea,
and the Sea Coasts, and the cause of Rocks and sands in the Sea, and the
cause of the ebbyng and flowing of the water, and the cause of currantes in the
Sea, with such other like matters. c.

To the Reader.
GEntle Reader, it is possible that some will think that I have taken upon me
to meddle with those causes, that are past my capacity, for that this fifth and
last book is as concerning the natural causes of Sands in the Sea and rivers,
and the cause of marish ground, and Cliffs by the sea Coasts, and rocks in
the Sea, and also the cause that the sea doth ebb and flow, and the cause
that the water in the Sea is salt, and the cause of Earth quakes, with other
matters. And for that my opinion doth differ from some of the ancient writers
in natural Philosophy, it is possible that it may be utterly disliked of and
condemned to be no truth. But yet notwithstanding they may give such credit
unto it, as the sequel of the reasons shall support unto them, for that they
be but my simple opinions: wherefore they may believe them as they lift.
Therefore gentle Readers, I desire you to bear with me, for that I am so bold
to show my simple opinion unto the world, for it is possible, that some people
may malice me, for that I am so bold to deal in these causes, considering
what a great number of so excellent learned men there are in Englande, both
in the Vniuersyties, and in diverse other places in this Land.

The fifth Book of the treasure for travellers.
The first Chapter of the fifth Book shows the natural causes, how Sands
and Banks are engendered or made, both in the Sea and Rivers.
NOw begins the fifth Book which is concerning the natural causes of
sundry things that are to be seen in traueilyng upon the face of the earth.
And although there be nothing that happens, but the providence of almighty
God, doth bring it to pass: yet notwithstanding it hath a natural cause why
it is so, although it seems supernatural or unpossible for that God doth
work all things by a means, and yet doth come to pass by some natural
cause.

And first of the natural cause of Sands and Banks in the Sea and ryuers, my
opinion is this: that whereas a great number of Sands and Banks are many times
seen at the mouths and entrance of many great rivers both into the Sea, and
also up into the river, that it happneth by this means, by the shalownesse of
those seas, and the great indraught of the River. And then by the means of the
soil of the Country in the rivers, being a good distance from the sea, and
especially after any great rain, doth bring down the soil, for all the
land water doth always run down towards the sea, where as it doth ebb
and flow, and sometime the water overflows the banks, and then the swiftness
of the running of the water doth fret away the banks, and sometime it
happens in the winter after a great frost. And such other like causes,
sometime from sandye ground, sometime from clay ground, sometime stony
ground: other good mold doth fall into the River, and so is myxed and
tumbled too and fro with the water, and is always carried towards the sea by
the violence of the stream, for that always, where it doth not ebb flow, the
stream runs towards the sea: whereas it doth ebb flow, there the ebb doth
run both swifter longer then the floods do, so by that means, it is always
carried towards the sea, also any thing is apter to roll, or run down the
hill, rather then against the hill. And thus the soil of the country being
tumbled too fro in the water, is washed and soked in such sort, that the water
is made thycke therewith, and the fat or clammye substance, become owes, but
the greety or sandy, or grauelly substance doth always keep towards the
bottom, for that it is more poderous or heavier then the fatty or clammy
substance, and then this grauelly or sandye substance, being driven down
towards the sea, by the violence of the stream, going by the bottom, then
where it doth find any place to staye at by the way, there it rests, and so
grows more and more, and so becomes a sand, and then the Tide, by the
means of ebbing and flowing, doth make or scour out a chanel, or pasadge
between one sand or bank, and another. And always this happens, whereas
the Sea is but shalowe, and the River or haven hath a great indraught, that is
to say, to run a great distace into the land, whereby there is much soil
brought down by the means before rehearsed. And then the Sea being but
shallow, it hath no great descent to run down the hill. And then by the
means of the floods, the bellows of the Sea, doth cause it to be stayed,
although that sometime it happens, that one sand or bank doth decrease,
and wear away, and another doth increase and wax bigger, and many times the
channels do alter, sometimes deeper, and sometimes shallower: and sometimes
whereas a chanel was, becomes a sand, sometime whereas a sand was, is
become a chanel, as experience hath many times showed, which happens many
times by some storms or great wyndes, sometimes from one quarter of the world,
and sometime from another quarter. And by that means the greatness of the
bellows of the Sea, doth beat, or wash away the sand from one place, and
so doth rest upon another place: and then the Tide or stream doth scour or
fret a new Channel, between one sand and another. c. As we may see by
experience in divers places, as the mould of the River of Thames, and Humber,
and the River of Roane, and such other like places, which I do omit at
this time.

The second Chapter shows the natural cause of Marish ground, and other
plain meadows or ground by the sides of Ryuers. c.
AND furthermore, as touching the natural cause of Maryshes or Marish ground,
and other plain and level ground, that is by the sides of great Ryuers. c.
and in such other like places: mine opinion is this, as in the Chapter before
is expressed, by the bringing down of the soil of the country, which is
ground or earth, of al kind of sorts, which is fallen into the water, and
brought down by the stream.

And as before is rehearsed, the grauelly or sandye substance doth drive with
the stream, Of the soil of the Country.
by the bottom, but the fatty or clammy substance is mingled with the water:
for although you should take any earth or substance, and wash it and tumble
it in water never so much: yet notwithstanding it cannot be consumed all away,
but if you do let it stand styll, then it will settle it self unto the
bottom, and you shall find the substance again. So although the earth is
mingled with water, by the means of the fretting of the stream and the Tide,
and also the soussyngs of the bellows in great winds, tossing it to fro in
stormy weather, yet notwithstanding in fair and calm weather, in such places,
whersas there doth not run a great Tide or stream, then that earthye
substance doth settle it self again on such places as are defended by some
Naase or point, and in some Bay or place, that the grating of the Tide or
stream doth not greatly trouble it, is then called Owes, or as the common
people that be not near dwellers unto such Ryuers, do call it Dirt, Mire, or
Mud. And then in such places where it doth ebb or stowe, being settled, now a
little and then a little, the wind and the Sun do something harden it, until
at the last, How Marish groude is engendered.
through the settling now some and then some, and styll dried with the wind
and the Sun, that it is as high as the common foul Seas: and then it will
begin to bear some green thing, and so it will become Marishe ground in
time, and so is overflowed in the spring tides, but in the Neape Tides, it is
bare at a full Sea. And then many times it happens, that those that are the
dwellers there abouts, or else the Lords of those soils, do Inn that same
ground, and make the walls for the defence thereof. And in process of time,
it becomes maine land, and by this means comes all your plain and
leveled grounds near unto Rivers sides: And this kind of ground must
needs be very fertile and rich, so that it be not overflowed with salt
water, for that all the stony and sandy substance is washed out thereof, and it
must needs be plain and level, for that it is braught to be level with the
water at a full Sea. c.

And furthermore, it happens diverse times, Marish ground is fertile, if the
salt water come not at it,
as in the Chapter before is rehearsed, by great wyndes and storms in sundry
ages of the world, that the Channel^ do alter by the washing or fretting away
of some point or firm land or Naase, and then that which hath been many
years before, mayne ground, may be fretted away, and be ouerflowen again.

And the substance of the ground may be landed in some other place, as by
experience in many places hath been seen, so that, that place that hath
been before meayne ground, hath become Sea and water, How land hath been sea,
and sea hath been land.
and that place that hath been before sea and water, hath become dry land.
And these things have happened in pracesse of time, by the means of the
changing of the channels, which do alter the setting of the Tides in Ryuers
and Havens, whose principal cause hath happened, as before is rehearsed, by
frettyng away some Naase or point, and then some Naase or point hath turned
the Tide some other way, and so worn or fretted a new channel: so that
whereas the Tide or stream hath run most swiftest, hath become an eady, and
so in process of time, ground in like manner. c.

The third Chapter shows the natural causes of the high cliffs by the Sea
coasts. c.
AND furthermore, as touching the natural causes of cliffs that are by the
Sea coasts, as we may see some of harde stone, and some of Chaulke, and of a
monstrous height, and some of Clay, and other of earth. c.

My opinion is this, as the age of the world is of no small time, so in
process of time the often sufferynges of the bellows of the Seas have beaten
away the feet of those hills, that are by the sea coasts.

And so vndermyning it, although it were of harde stone, yet the wayght of that
which was undermined hanging over, in rainy whether, or after great frost, must
needs fall down into the Sea. Of Cliffs by Sea Coast.
And then that sail or substance that fell down, in process of time was
beaten or washed away again, by the often soussing of the bellows of the sea,
in the time of great wyndes and storms. And then the stuff so fallen down,
being washed and consumed away, the sea doth begin to undermine it again, by
little and little, till at the length by the means before rehearsed, there
falls down an other portion of the said substance, or stuff from the
hill, so that in the end, they become such monstrous Cliffs, as we may see
by experience, are on the sea coasts in a number of places: And thus they do
were away by little and little, until that an other place is become aforelande,
without that land, that is to say, an other Naase or head land to stand
further out into the sea, then that doth, and then that Clyffe will stay
without falling down any more, of the substance or stuff of long time, by
the means of some beach, or shingle, or sand, or stones that shall be
brought thither, by the cossing to and fro of the bellows of the sea, and that
shall lye there, and defend the foot of the sand cliffe, as by experience we
may see in a number of places by the sea coasts, and then doth we are away an
other Cliffe, in some other place of the sea coasts: for it happens many
times, in sundry ages, that at one time, one place doth were away, and an
other doth increase again: and in an other age again, that which did
increase, shall wear away, and the other shall stay, or perhaps increase again,
by the means there is some head land, or Naase without that, which doth
break away the fretting or gratyng of the tide: For many times it happens
upon the sea Coasts, through some great and huge storm, that makes a breach
by the monstrousness of the great bellows, that tears away some great
quantity of ground, from some one place in short time, and the bellows of the
sea shall drive or bring it, or land it in some other place, yea even in a
short space, as experience hath many times showed it, and as it many times
happens, that in one age of the world, that the great huge winds or stormed
do happen sometime in one quarter of the World, and at an other time, in an
other quarter.

In four years the great storms are in one quarter of the world, and an other
year in an other quarter.
For as we may see, that in some years, the most great winds and storms do
blow in the East quarter of the world, and in other years, in the West
quarter of the world, and in other years, in the South quarter of the world,
and in other years, in the North quarter of the world. c. By which means it
frets at one time away the substance or stuff from one place, and then the
bellows of the sea do drive or force it to land in an other place: and so it
continues for a certain time, until such time that the great winds or
storms do blow in a contrary quarter of the world: and then the stuff or
subtaunce is beaten by the bellows of the Sea, and driven and forced from that
place, and so is landed in an other place: And it is possible to be forced or
landed at the place that it first came from, although it may be 20. or 40.
miles distance asunder. And thus those that are near dwellers unto the sea
coasts, do see the great and mighty works of God, wrought by his greatness
and almighty power, the great or huge bellows or waives or knots of the sea, in
great winds and storms or tempests, For even those things that show or seem
unpossible, he brings to pass, as by experience hath been seen at sundry
times. c.

The fourth Chapter shows the natural cause, why that the beach, and the
great bolder stones, on the sea coasts, are become round and smooth, without
any edges or corners.
NOw furthermore, as touching the natural causes, why that the Beach, and the
great bolder stones in the sea, and the other small shingle are all smooth and
round, without corners or sharpe edges, and yet they be of all kinds and
luites of stones, The shingle beach or the bolder stone is of the substance of
the nature of the Cliffs ne'er unto them
as Marble stone, and Flint, and other hard stone. c. For they be of those
substance natures, as the Cliffs that are near unto those parts, as in the
Chapter going before is declared, by vnderminyng of the hills or banks, with
the bellows of the Sea, the substance falls down into the Sea, what soever
manner of stuff it be, according unto the mineralles of those grounds or
hills that falls into the Sea, whether it be hard stone, or Marble stone, or
Flint, or what stuff else soever it be, according unto the veins of the
mineralles in the ground, that so by that means before rehearsed, do fall
into the sea. Then when it is forced or brought to land upon any place of the
Sea coast, it is all smooth, without any corners or sharpe edges. The cause
thereof comes to pass by this means, for when it doth first fall out of the
Cliffe into the sea, then it hath the fashion and form as those have that are
dug forth of the ground: The cause or reason that the beach and the great
bolder stone is round without any sharp edges.
but after it is fallen into the sea, hath had any continuance there, so tossed
to fro by the waives and bellows of the sea, a great number of them together,
the one doth so fret and rub or grind against the other, that it must needs
rub or fret away al the sharpe edges of those stones, how hard soever the
stone is, for the soussing of the bellows of the sea doth never forget it self
to stand still, neither is ever weary, nor desires rest, but is always
labouring and tossing that is in it to and fro, according unto the bigness of
the wind. c. as by experience upon the sea coast may be seen, the great and
mighty force of the bellows, in the soussings and forcing of the Beach a shore
in the time of any great winds or storms, amongst the Beach shingle: The
force of the Sea.
for you shall hear the soussing of the bellows of the sea amongst the
Beach, as though it weee the pouring down of a thousand Carte load at once:

So that you may hear it two or three miles from the place where as it is, yea
and sometimes after a Storm, you may see Stones that waygh a pound wayght,
thrown from the full sea mark, into the landewardes two or three rods, by the
very means of the soussing of the bellows or waives of the sea, as those that
do occupy the sea coasts, do see by experience. c.

The fifth Chapter shows the natural cause of the Rocks in the Sea. c.
AND yet furthermore, as concerning the natural causes of Rocks and pinnacles
that do stand in the sea very strangely unto such as do behold and see
the same in sundry places in the sea, and some on the sea Coasts, and some in
Havens, harborows that are adjoining unto the sea. And this is general for
ever, that look whereas there is any great store of rocks, it is a token of a
deep sea, it is a token of a shallow Sea, that hath many sands. And the cause
of rocks in the sea, in mine opinion is this, as it is known unto all persons,
that the age of the world is of no small time: so that I am of that opinion,
that the Rocks that are now standing in the sea, have been parcel of the
maynelande, or at the least, some Ilandes standing in the sea of long time
ago, although there be no mention made of any such Ilandes standing in the
seas, in those days. The cause thereof might be this: for that they that were
of long time ago, made no account of any small Ilandes, that were towards
our West Occian. For these west parts, in those days were scant peopled, as
Ireland, and Englande, and Scotlande, and Brytayne, the west part of France.
For it is no long time ago, that Irelande hath been thoroughly well peopled,
although it be a long time ago, since the first entrance of Brute, yet it
was long since the Incarnation of Christ, before that this Country became
thoroughly peopled, as it doth appear both by the Chronicles, and other
ancient histories.

And also in those days, Navigation not much used in the West Occian.
Navigation was not so much used in these our West Occian Seas, for the Sea was
little used in these our parts, except it were by small Botes, to go a
fishing, and to transport people from place to place, as we do see by
experience. Yet in these days, those that do inhabit, and dwell upon the
Coast of Afryca, to the West Occian, do occupy no shipping unto the Sea,
except small Cannoses, to go on fishing, and such other like, as al Barbary
and Ginny, which were countries well people before these Northwest parts were
peopled as it doth appear by Histories.

And furthermore, in the old time, those people that were the dwellers in
these Northwest parts, were very simple and ignorant, as touching the drawing
of Plats and Cards, whether they were Cards Geography, or Hidrographie. c.
Although that Pitholomias made Tables, as touching the description of the
Countries, yet he did not manyfestly or plainly show the Ilandes in the sea,
not to this west Occian, as they be now well known. And furthermore, it is
but a very short time ago since that English men did much occupy the sea,
to travail on long voyages, neither did few or none know or understand the
use of their Sea plats, called Cards Hydrography, for within these three score
or four score years, it hath been thought a great long voyage, for to go
into Spayre, and then when they did go into Spain, Now Englishmen are as
suff^tient to travail a long voyage, as any other nation.
they went al along by the coast of France, and so to the coast of Byskey. c.

But thanks be unto God, now in these days, Englishmen are as sufficient to
travail in long voyages, as any other nations be. But now to return to our
former matter, as concerning the causes of Rocks in the sea, and as I have
said before, that the Rocks have been parcel of the mayne land, or else some
Land long agone, by the often soussing of the bellows or waives of the Sea,
that never stands styll, the other substance or stuff is beaten and
consumed away, through the great deepenesse of the sea: the other substance or
stuff is tumbled to the bottom, and is no more seen. And as the mynerals in
the ground be of diverse kinds of substances, as some earth, and some sand,
and some stones: to conclude, of a hundred several sorts, so that all those
loose substances, that would be mollysted with the water, are beaten and
washed away, so that there doth remain nothing but the harde mine of stone:
and so he doth stand in the sea, as a pynacle or Rock, The cause of Rocks in
the Sea.
as by experience is seen in a number of places to the west Occian, as the
West part of Englande, and the West part of Brittayne on the Coast of France,
and such other like places, whereas there be innumerable companies of Rocks,
some being of a great height above the water, other some do show themselves just
with the water, and other some are sunken Rocks being rounded with the water,
some deeper then other some, which would not be known, but only by the
breaking of the sea over them. c.

And this is my opinion as concerning Rocks in the sea, that have been of long
time agone parcel of the mayne land, though they be now Rocks in the sea.
Then it may be said, that the land is much lesser then it hath been before
time, and so it is. And yet it is but a trifle in respect of any great
quantytie or bigness, as it may be compared unto the ragged edges of a piece of
cloth, and yet the ragged edges thereof being pared away, the thing hath not
much changed his fashion or form, neither in respect is become little the
worse. c.

The syxt Chapter shows the natural cause of the ebbing and flowing of the
Sea, and the ebbyng and the flowing of the Havens and Ryuers.
AND furthermore, as concerning the ebbing and flowing of the sea and other
rivers, we do see by common experience, that the Moon doth always govern
the same. Wherefore it may be supposed, that the waters do seek and repair,
The waters are drawn by the power of the Moon.
or most specially are drawn by the power of the Moon, that when the Moon
is in the midst of the sky, that is to say, upon the Meridian, then the waters
are deepest or thickest, and also in like manner, in the opposite part, or else
it would ebb and flow but once in.24. hours and 4/^. parts, according unto
the daily motion of the Moon, which we do se by experience, that it doth ebb
flow but once in 12. hours. part of an hour, and then by this reason it
should flow or be a full sea in all places at a South Moon, and a North
Moon: so as the Moon passes unto the Westwardes to be a full sea in those
parts, and so to go with the diurnal or daily motion of the heavens, which
we see by experience is contrary, for we do see by daily experience, that upon
the Coast of Spain, and all those parts that are upon the West Occian Seas,
that the Moon in the Southwest doth make a full sea, which is 3. hours after
the Moon is upon the Meridian: and yet notwithstanding it would be a full
sea always where as the Moon is upon their Meridian, and so to follow the
daily motion of the moon, as the moon is carried with primu Mobile: so that it
were not let by this great accidece that this West Occian Sea, is shot in
between the firm land of Ameryca, on the West part, and the mayne land of
Afryca, and Europe, on the East side, by which means the waters cannot follow
to be a full Sea, according unto the Moons course, as she doth go in her
daily motion, according unto the Moons coming unto the Meridian.

Wherefore it is to be supposed, that if there were no such accidence in the
Sea, to be let by the land, that then it would follow orderly, that the waters
in the Sea would go round, according unto the Moons course in.24. hours,
and so the streme or currant, to go from the East into the West, and so round
about. c.

But now we see that the waters, in the ebbing and flowing, are let by this
great impediment: for Ameryca doth enclose the West part, The Moon doth
govern the ebbing and flowing of the water, in two great and notable causes.
and Europe and Afryca the East part, and yet we do see by experience, that
the Moon doth govern the ebbyng the flowing of the waters of the Sea in two
great and notable respects. The one is this, as it is daily seen in every
place, whereas it doth ebb and flow, that the Moon in one quarter of the Sky
doth make a full sea for ever, in that place, or haven, or harborow. And the
other great effect of the Moon is this: as it is always seen, that at the
full of the Moon, and also at the change of the Moon, how that the waters
are quickened, and do raise or lift them selves much higher then they do at
any other times, and also doth descend much lower, where by it makes the tide
or streme to run much the swifter, as it is seen by daily experience, in
such places whereas it doth ebb flow, at which times it is called in the time
of the full Moon, and the change of the Moon, spring tides, or spring
stremes: in the quarters of the Moon, it is called Nepe tides, or Nepe
stremes, for that the waters do not lift them selves, or flow so high as they
do at any other time, neither do they descend, or ebb so low, as they do
at any other times of the Moon, and by that means the streme doth not run
so swift as it doth at other times, for as in spring tides it doth flow or
lift it self higher, and descend or ebb lower, then of custom.

So in neape Tides it doth lift or flow less in height, also ebb or descend
less in deepenesse, then it doth of custom, as it is seen daily by common
experience. c.

But yet furthermore, The var^etie of being a full sea in one River.
as touching the ebbyng and flowing of the water, both in the Sea, and also in
Havens and Ryuers, and although that it doth keep an order or methode in any
one assigned place, yet is there great varietye in places harde by: yea in one
River, it shall be a full Sea in one part of the River, and in that River, and
at that instant, a lowe water, as the proof thereof may be manyfestly seen
here in the River of Thames, as it is not unknown, that the Moon in the South
doth make a full Sea on the lands end, at the entrance of the River of
Thames, and the Moon in the Southwest, doth make a full Sea at London, and
then it is half ebbed on the lands end: But in Rychmonde above London, there
the Moon in the West, doth make a full Sea, and then on the lands end, there
it is a lowe water, as it is manifestly to be seen. c.

And furthermore, as touching the ebbyng and flowing vpppon the Coast of the
Occient Sea, for that it flows generally a Southwest Moon, so mine opinion
is this, A full sea and a lowe water act at one instant in the River of Thames.
by the means of the shutting or inclosyng of the Sea between America, and
Europe, and Africa, that it comes to pass thus, for the water cannot follow
the course of the Moon, for after that the Moon is past the Meridian in the
Bay of America, commonly called the Bay of Mexico, that then the waters can no
longer follow the course of the Moon, for that it is letten by the mayne
land. And then when the Moon doth come round about, unto the Southeast,
then the powers of the Moon do tract or draw the waters unto the Eastwardes,
by which means the waters having a great course or swaye unto the Eastwardes,
are drawn so vehemently by the powers of the Moon, until such time, as the
Moon doth come unto the Meridian, that it cannot suddenly reverse, although
the Moon be paste the Meridian to the Westward, as we may see many times
by common experience, that any thing forced to move violently, is not
presently stayed, but that it must have a time in the staying, as the force of
the dryfte doth decay, which must be by little and little. c. And so by that
means the Moan is in the Southwest before the waters wylbe descended: and for
proof thereof, if that you do put water in any broad or long vessel, and
stir the water in such sort, The cause of the ebbing flowing in Havens, and
Rivers.
that it may swaye from one end unto the other, and after that it hath begun
to sway from end unto end, it will be a long time before it will stand styll:
for you cannot make it to staye upon the sudden, but it will sway too and
fro, until that it doth stay it self by little and little. c.

And furthermore, as touching the ebbyng and flowing in the other inferior
Seas, and Havens, and Ryuers, that happens by this means, as it is a full
Sea in all the places upon the West part towards the Occian Sea, so that
when it door find the water of our inferior Sea, lower then that which doth
come out of the Occian Sea, then it runs in until that it comes to be
level. For the property of water is always to run unto the lower parts,
and so by that means, and also the sway that it hath, it runs and flows
into al Havens, and Harbours, and Rivers, as long as it finds any place lower
or inferior in hight unto it self. And then as soon as it finds the water
behind it, lower then it is before it, then it stays, and begins to run
back again, for as is said before, the property of waters is always to
run to the lower parts: and by this means it flows into al ryuers,
Havens, and Crickes upon the Sea coast, and in some place it doth higher
flow more water upright, The c^ that the water doth rise and flow higher in
one place then it doth in another
and doth ebb more water in like manner down right, then that it doth in
some other places, and that happens by this means, and if any place have a
wide entrance, and then afterwards is shut up into a narow room, having some
distance to reverse back again, then the water doth rise and flow very
high, for that th^ water comes in with a great sway, and will not upon the
sudden reverse back again, as by ensample it may be seen in Seuern, that
comes up to Bristow and as before is said by the River of Thames, that it is
not a full Sea in all places at one instant. For when that it is entered in at
the mouth, and hath taken his sway withal, then it runs in by the means
that the water is lower within, then it is with out at the Sea, for that it is
a quarter flood, and more at the Sea, before that the flood enters into the
River, and so flows upwards, for it must have a time, before that it can
high so much water at the mouth or entrance to be higher then it is within up
into the River: for it is three parts flood upon the lands end, before that it
be any flood at London, for that the distance is a great way in, the River
very crooked and narrow, and many points, and Naases that do let and stay the
Tide, but afterwards, when it is in, and hath taken his sway, then it cannot
so soon reverse back, until that the water is well descended or ebbed
behind it too the Seawardes, as it doth manifestly appear by experience. And
by this order it flows into all Havens and Ryuers, according unto the
indraught.

The seventh Chapter shows the cause of Currantes or streams, that runs
in the Sea, in such places, where it doth not ebb, and flow, and of
Currantes or streams in the Sea, there are three several sorts, as in the
Chapter it doth appear. c.
AND furthermore, as touching the Currantes, or the stream in many places in
the Sea, whereas it doth not ebb and flow, as that is perceived in many
places, as by experience is seen and known in the Sea. And to let you
understand what those Currantes or Strames be, that it is a continual
running of the water in the Sea always one way, and not reuersyng or coming
back wards to and fro, as it doth in such places where it doth ebb and
flow, but that the water always in those Seas or parts doth ^unne continually
one way, 3. sorts of Currates.
or else at the least a long time, according unto the natural cause of that
currant. And of these currantes I do find three several sorts, that do
come of three several causes, and the cause of every one of them is contrary
unto the nature of the other.

And first concerning the natural cause of the principallest Currantes, as by
experience of them is seen in diverse places, by those that have travailed into
those parts by the Sea, as thus: The currant runs forcibly, and continually
from the East unto the West, The principal and chief Currant of the sea.
at the Cap bone speraunce, the Southernmost Cap of Africa, or Ethiopia, and
so reboundeth upon the Coast of America, which is drawn by the powers of the
Moon by ber daily motion, as in the Chapter next before is rehearsed, as it
doth appear by the ensample of ebbyng and flowing, and so rebounding upon
the Coast of America, by that impediment, that it cannot get passage that way,
according unto the daily motion, then it is forced to seek other passages, so
that part thereof doth seek, and doth go thorough the strayghtes of
Magelen^s into the South Sea, and there the currant doth go continually from
the East, into the West. But that straight or passage being unsufficient, for
that it is so narrow, the currant is forced to seek some other way.
Wherefore partly it doth divide it self, and so doth run up unto the
Coast of Brasyll, towards the Equinoctial by Cap Crucis, and Saint
D^myngs, The reuersing back of the currant.
and so into the great Bay of Amerrica or Bay of Mexico, and so reuerseth back
again, and so thorough the Cannel or Channel of Bayhaina, between the Cap of
Terra Florriday, the great Land of Coba, going from the West into the East,
which is the cause that those that do go into the West Indies, do first go
to the Canaries, and so to the Westwardes, to the intent to have the currant
to the Westwardes, into the Bay of Mexico, and then when they do return home,
then they do go by the North part of the Bay of Mexico through the chanel of
Baphamea, for that the currant doth reverse back from the West into the East,
so that they have the currant or stream to help them back home again. c. And
the in like manner, partly the currant that comes about Cape bone sperance,
being beaten by the mayne land of America, as is said before, part runs or
goes thorough the straight of Magalenus, and partly thorough the great Golfe or
Bay of Mexico, as before is rehearsed, and part doth reverse or go back
alongest the coast of the South land that lies on the South side of the
straightes of Magalenus, where the South pole or pole Anterticke is raised more
the.50. degrees, and so goes back from the West into the East, alongest the
South Coast, vntyl it doth come into the East Occian sea again. c.

And this is the principallest currant, The second sort of currants or
streams.
as those that do occupy those parts by sea, do know, and these currantes
are well known to run continually always one way. c. The second sort of
currantes or streams, is this, as it is seen in divers places, that they
shall have a currant or stream, where it doth not ebb flow, that always
doth go unto the windewards. But that never happens but in the time of great
wind, and the cause thereof is this, that the sea being wrought or troubled
with great storms of wynd, doth raise great bellows or waives, or great
knots in the sea, and that runs rolling with the wind, and doth cause
the water too be vnleuell or uneven, as it is the nature of water to seek to
the lower parts till that it doth come unto his level: The cause that it doth
not ebb and flow in some seas.
so by that means as the wind bears the water in the sea, with great waives
or bellows, so the currant in the water doth go against the wynd, to come
unto his level again: as the experience thereof is seen in divers places,
where it doth not ebb and flow, as in the middle earth sea, or leuant seas,
and within the Soud, that is to say, within Elson Nor that hath narrow
enterances, and yet is great seas within, which doth take away the effect of
ebbing and flowing, for that the straight is not sufficient to let in water
ye^ugh, for to cause it too ebb and flow. And this effect in like manner is
many times seen, sometime on the coast of Barbary, and in such other like
places, where it doth not ebb and flow. c. The third sort of streams or
currantes.
The third sort of currants or streams that runs in the Sea, where it
doth not ebb and flow, as by experience is seen in diverse places, is caused
by the sailing into the Sea of some great and mighty River, that the land
water coming forcibly down the River, and so emptyeth or runs into the
Sea, doth cause a currant to go in the sea, against the mouth of the River,
as it is seen in the middle earth Sea, against the mouth of Nilus, and also it
is many times seen in the North parts, at the spring of the year, when the
Snow and the Ise is melted or consumed into water. And then against the
mouths of such Ryuers, as do empty them into those seas, doth cause a great
currant to run a great distance from the land, in such places as this effect
happens in those seas. c.

The eight Chapter shows the cause that the waters of the Sea are salt, c.
AND furthermore, as touching the natural cause that the water of the Sea is
salt, whereas the opinion of some Authors is, as Aristotle, other, that it is
made salt by the powers of the Sun, by the drawing of the fine substance of
the water, up into the air, the Sea is made salt by that means. Then if that
were the whole cause, the the water of the Sea should be most saltest under,
or near the Equinoctial. For that the Sun hath a greater force by the
means of the direction of the shadow of the Sun, whereby the Sun should
draw or distil it more faster, then it doth in any of the other Clymates.

Yet notwithstanding, it is seen by experience, that the water of the Sea is
as salt in the Latitude of.60. degrees, The sea is salt very far to ye
Fro^th parts.
in the Occian Sea, as it is under the Equinoctial. And as some have said, it
is as salt in Iselande, and at the North Cap, which is within the Poll or
Circle, near five degrees. And there the Sun cannot have any great power,
for that the Sun hath but a very glaunsyng shadow in June. And in the Winter
part of the year, the Sun will not appear or rise unto them, in the space
of ten Weeks.

And furthermore, if the water of the sea were made salt only by the powers
of the Sun, then those seas must needs become fresh, by another great
cause, and that is this: For in the Spring of the year, in the melting of the
Snow and the Ise, there falls such abundance of fresh water, that it would
make it fresh, and yet the water is very salt, insomuch that in divers places
in the North part, they do make salt of the sea water, although that it is
not made by the heate or powers of the Sun, as it is made in Spain and in
France, for that they do make it in Scotlande with the heate of the fire,
Salt is made of the sea water in Scotland in Rosy.
so as some have said, it is made in Rosy, not far from Saint Nicolas. And
furthermore, as it may be proved, the water is not made salt by the power of
the Sun, for that the head of the great River Nylus that comes from the
Mountains of the Moon, hath Latitude beyond the Equinoctial twelve degrees:
And so in sundry places, stands in sundry great pooles, Fresh water in seas
or pooles under the Equinoctial.
not far from the Equinoctial, and so passes from under the Equinoctial,
unto the Northwards, and doth empty it self in the middle earth sea: and yet
that water is fresh, and not salt. So that it is manifest that the powers of
the Sun, are not altogether the cause that the water of the sea is salt.
Wherefore in mine opinion, the water of the sea is become salt by the Minerals
or substance of the nature of the ground, which is salt properly of it self,
and so mollified or soked, that it turns unto water, having any moisture or
liquor to come unto it.

As for an ensample, that in sundry places, it is known that there is Salt
found and dug out of the ground, and is perfect Salt, and occupied for Salt,
after they have made it clean, and beat it small. And as it hath been credybly
reported unto me, there is a hill or Mountain in Barbary in Africa, Salt
mines.
that Salt is dug out thereof, and is a great distance from the sea. And the
like is reported to be in the kingdoe of Hungary, here in Europ, that there is
salt dug out thereof, and is sold and bought into divers places, as into
Polonia, and into some places of Germanye.

The sea made salt, by the substance of the ground.
Then it is a plain case, that there be such wynes or mineralles in the
ground, which makes the thing to be most manifest, that the Sea is made Salt
by the mineralles or substance of salt in the ground.

And yet for further proof thereof, here in England, at the Wyches in
Chesseshyre, there is in sundry places, a water or Brine that they do make
Salt of, and is a good distance from any Sea. And some have made argument, that
it may come from the Sea, thorough the Veins or Coues in the ground, which is
most contrary, by this means: for if that it come from the Sea, thorough the
ground, then it could not be salter then the water of the Sea, for that at
the Wyches, is much salter then the Sea water. For if that it come from the
Sea, then it must be somewhat fresher then the Sea water, by the means of the
scouring it self thorough the earth, and by meeting of some fresh waters, as
the earth is not without fresh water. c.

And furthermore, as concerning the saying of the Philosopher Plato, in his
Dialogues of Tymeus, and Crecia, and also is written by Marcellius Ficius, that
in the old time, there was an Land in the Sea, over against Africa, bigger
then Africa and Asia, which Land was called Atlantyda, and that the Kings of
this Land did govern a great part of Africa and Europa, and as Marcellius
Ficius, and Plato say, by the means of a great earthqake, and a great rain,
this Land sunk, and the people thereof were drowned: and after the sinkyng
of this great Land, the Sea Atlanticus was so full of mud by the means of
the sinckng thereof, that the sea Atlanticus could not be sailed with ships in
a great time after. Now if this be true, Of the great Land called Atlantica
that sunk.
that there was any such Land, that did so sink, that the Sea was so full
of mud, then after that the mud is settled unto the bottom, as it will do
in process of time, then the sea must needs be a very shallow sea, for such a
great mass of earthy substance being sunk with water, must needs make a very
shallow Sea: and yet it is seen and known almost generally unto all me, that
it is a deep sea, yea no man can tel of what depth, for that they cannot find
any ground: for that sea is greatly occupied with Ships, and that Land
lay ^ast from Spain and Barbary, which is most occupied with Ships, of any
sea: for all the great trade of shipping is now in these days used out of
Europe. And then what place can be greater occupied, then into our west Occian
sea, called in old time, the sea Atlanticus, as it is the whole trade from
Englande, France, and the lowe Country, and Denmark, and such like places of
Europe, into Spain, and Portugall, and Barbary, and into the middle earth Sea,
and into Ginny, and into the Carnarie Ilandes, the Madera Ilandes, and the
Ilandes called the Syrtes, and to the West Indyes: so that it is the greatest
occupied sea with shipping in the whole world: so that the same sea is not
unknown, but that it is a great deep sea: therefore it is to be supposed,
that the fundamental nature or stubstaunce, or ground thereof was of Salt, and
so soked or moyllfied with the water, that the superficies thereof might be
sunk under the water, and so in process of time to soak the mineral of the
Salt, that the stony and earthye substance is now settled down so low, that
it seems unto the simple people, that it hath no bottom: for otherwise such
a huge mass of earthy substance could not be so lost, as it doth appear by
that great Island called Atlantida, that Maccellius Ficius, Plato, and Proclus,
with other Authors, doth make mention of. c.

The nienth Chapter is as touching the cause of Earthquakes.
AND furthermore, as touching Earthquakes, and the synking both of the mayne
Land, and also of Ilandes in the Sea, and also of the drying up of Waters, as
great Pooles Rivers, and also of the casting up of Ground both in the sea, as
well as upon the mayne Land, although it be the providence of almighty God,
to bring it so to pass, for the punishment of the people, When god doth plague
the earth, he doth punish both good bad.
that are upon the face of the Earth: and as well the godly do perish, as
the wicked, when these things happen, which are the scourge of the wrath of
God, for that he will have his divine glory known: yet he doth nothing but
that it is done by a mean, hath a natural cause of the coming of it so to
pass, although the thing it self be supernatural.

And furthermore, although I am simple and utterly unlearned, neither to the
judgment of the people to have any great experience in these causes, yet
notwithstanding being as one more bold then wise, to show mine opinion unto
the World, and also it is possible that in some points my opinion doth not
agree with some of the ancient Writers, that have written of sundry things in
their Books of natural Philosophy. Yet notwithstanding I am so bold to
show my opinion, although it be possible that it may differ from the truth.
Wherefore they may use such credit unto the matter, as the reasons in these
matters shall support unto them, for if that by reason my opinyon be not to be
liked, then they may the less regard it. c.

And this first, as concerning the sinking of ground as experience hath
showed, that it hath happened in sundry places, and in sundry ages of the
world, my opinion is this, as in the Chapter before is showed, that in those
places that it hath happened, that the substance of the ground in that place
is Salt underneath, The cause of the sinking ^ the ground.
and so being soked or mollified with water, in process of time, it is turned
unto water, and then the earthy substance that is a aloof upon it being
ponderous and heavy, and not supported or borne up with any harde thing, then
it must needs settle it self down and sink into the water: and so by that
means the water stands above the superfycies thereof, as it is showed in the
Chapter going before, by the sinking of the great Island called Atlantyda, c.

And furthermore, as concerning some kind of earthquakes, that happens in
such sort that it rents and lyfteth and shakes the ground, and possible
lyfteth the ground higher then that it was before, and so remains and
stands styll afterwards, with out any settling afterwards. c.

My opinion is this, by the means before rehearsed, Of Earthquakes.
that there may be some veins in the ground that may be of the substance of
salt, as before is rehearsed, and yet may be enclosed with other mines round
about it, as we may see by experience, howe often that the veins of the ground
may alter, and in a small circuit, as in some place may be hard stone, and in
another place chalk, and in another place, clay, or sand, or the our of
diverse kinds of mettalles, with a number of sundry sorts of substances that I
do emyt. c. Now this mine or substance of salt being enclosed round about
with other substances or stuff, as before is said, Water cannot d^part from
any place, until the air, or some other substance doth occupy the round
and the springes of water in the ground coming unto it, both soak it
molifyeth it, that it is turned unto water: then being water it is apt to run
in the veins of the ground, yet it can not depart to go from that place, vntyl
that it doth draw air thither. And look as the air doth find ^ent thorough the
powers in the ground, doth repair unto that place, so the water doth decrease
runs in the veins of the ground unto other places: thus in process of time the
substance of salt being turned unto water, shall be diminished or gon and the
room thereof filled full of air, and yet the ground aloft shall stand fyrme
and fast, for that it is borne up or supported by rocky or stony substance. c.

Now it is possible, that some will make argument, and say, how should air
come thither, for that it is so low in the ground, and that there is no place
open unto the air, whereby it may come thither? But they do not consider this,
that no place can be vacant, but that it is furnished with somewhat, either
with earthy substance, or water, or air, or Fire, every one of the is finer in
substance then the other, as the earthy substance is gross and harde, so the
watery substance is thinner, and yet ponderous and heavy: so that there can be
no place hollow or concave in the earth, but it is filled with water or air.
For the water by his ponderousnes doth descend and seek to the lower parts.
And then look where as the water is not sufficient to fill the hollow place,
then air doth repair thither to fulfil the rest, taking his place next
above him, as we may see by experience, that if we do dig in the ground,
we shall meet with Sprynges of water: as by the ensample of the digging of
Wels in the ground, that when they have dug so low, and have found but a
small spring, then letting it stand a certain time, thither will repair a
great quatitie of Water afterwards. And then this being true, that the water
doth find passage through the veins in the ground, then it is a plain
case, that air must the rather find passage, for that it is an Element more
thinner and subtyller then water, and will soak through any small thing sooner.
For the nature of air is to descend very deep into the earth, if it be not
filled with other substances. So in like manner water, although it be
ponderous and heavy, will ascend upwards, if the air cannot come thither by
the means of the closeness or thightnesse of the thing that the water is
enclosed aloft or over it, and also the water will not descend or fall down
sodaynlye, although the air be under it being enclosed in it, that the water
by his ^underousnesse or weight, doth cause the air to seek through the
water, which will be a long time, except the water and the air be be styred
by some accidental cause.

And now to return to the cause of Earthquakes, The cause of Earthquakes.
my simple opinion is this. The air being enclosed in the bowels of the earth,
which hath happened by the means before rehearsed, or by diverse other means,
which I am not able to rehearse, that the air may be enclosed in the ground
or earth, and then when it shall please almighty God to bring it so to pass,
for God is the worker of all things, either by one mean or another, that the
waters may arise and increase in the ground, and especially after any great
and continual rain, and the water being ponderous and heavy, doth seek into
the earth, expelling or thrusting out the air that is near the superficial
part of the earth, and so by his ponderousness settles it self lower and
lower, and then the great and continual rain doth lode the superficial face
of the earth with water, and doth cause the earth to swell and shut it self
close aloft on the upper part of the earth, and that water in the earth, by
setlyng it self lower and lower, and the earth by his closeness will not
suffer the air to depart out of the earth, so that there is no room in the
earth to hold or contain both the Air and the water, but that the air in
the earth is forced to rent the earth to have room sufficient. And also at
that time the earth is more apter to seperate it self, then it is at any other
time, for that the earth is soked and made soft by the great moisture that is
in it.

And by this means, in such places whereas this cause doth happen that the
ground doth quake and tremble, Of the shaking of the earth.
and the buildings that are near thereabout, until such time as the air doth
find passage to get out of the ground, and if that it cannot find passage,
then it doth split and rent the ground, casting al things that are over it,
or in the way of the air, that breaks so out of the ground over it, and
possible to turn the buildings underneath the earth or ground to the great
and marvelous destruction both of the people and buildings where this
happens. c.

And by this means those places, that have been Land, may become Water,
being near unto the Sea or any great River.

And in like manner whereas there have been any Pooles or Ryuers may be dried
up, as clean as though there had never been any Poole, or River, or water
there, by this means: for after that the air in the earth hath rent the earth
to seek passage out, then this thing happening there or near unto the water,
may run or descend into that place whereas the air was before, and also in the
turning up or splitting of the ground, there may be some hills or cliffs
standing up much higher then the ground was before. And so by this means the
places that have been dry land, may become sea and water, and in like manner
that place that hath been water, may become dry land. c.

And furthermore, in like manner there may by this means before rehearsed, be
Ilandes cast up in the sea, by the means of the air breaking out of the
earth. c. for that is the property of air, to run and to seek into all
places, that is not occupied or furnished with some of the elemental
substances, so that rather then any hollow or concave place in the earth shall
be vacant, air will seek thither, if it were in the very Center of the
earth. For as is said before, if water be able to seek passage through the
veins in the earth, then much rather the air shall do it, for that it is
much thinner, subtler then water, although that air will give place unto
water, by his ponderousnes or weight. c.

The tenth Chapter shows the reason, howe America, and all the Ilandes and
new found Countries, and Lands, became peopled, and of what posterity they be
come of. c.
AND furthermore, as touching the vain arguments and opinions of some
people, as touching the discovering of a number of Lands and Ilandes, that
have not been found nor known but within little more then.100. years, as all
America, and a number of Countries, and great and small Ilandes more, none of
them of any quantity or bigness, for that they are peopled: and for that they
are peopled, I have harde some vain and foolish arguments thereof, why there
should be people there, for that these Countries or places were never known
before, except there were any more Adams then one, or any more ^oyes the one.
So we may see by experience, how apt a number of people are to fall into errors,
using most vain and contentious arguments in those matters that are past
their capacity, which is a great offence before God, and also to the eui^l
Ensample unto the world, unto such as do hear of the same. For it is no small
error for us to fall into, for to think that there was an^more Adams in the
world then one, for that it is utterly against all the Canonycall Scriptures:
and also it is as great an error to say that there were saved any more people
after the deluge or flood, more then N^y and his famyly, that was in the Arc
with him, as it is manyfestly declared in Genesis. c. Wherefore I think it not
hurtful to show my opinion as concerning how all America became peopled, with
all the other new found lands and Ilandes, lying in the sea, wheresoever they
be. c.

First thus my opinyon is, that America is part of the great Land called
Atlantida, as it is further declared in the eight Chapter going before, How all
the new found Countries became peopled, as all America, and all other Ilandes.
that the Kings of the Land did govern a great part of Europe and Africa,
and according unto some Authors, that the Kings of that Land were the sons
of Neptunus, then that doth sygnifye that there was a trade or occupying of
Shipping between these known parts and that great Land, and then when that
great Land did synke, as before is declared, the Sea Atlanticus was so full
of mud, All the great Island called Atlant^da, did not synk, but part
remained.
that it could not be sailed in lunge time afterwards. And by the Ensample
of America, that all the Land did not synke, but the Westermost part did
remain still. Although this happened long before the coming of Christ, and
as before is declared, the great store of mud and filth that did remain in the
Sea, was the only cause that did let the Traffic and passage between us in
these known parts, and them that were unknown unto us in all this long time
of this mud remaining in the Sea: so long time, that those men that were the
Sea men in those days, were of long time dead before the Sea was clear of the
mud. And also those sea men, Old sea men being gone, the other did never
attempt to seek any thing
as it is to be gathered, that were in the Land, did perish by the means of
the sinking of the East side of that great Land. Wherefore it is to be
gathered, that those that were in these parts, did never attempt to seek any
Land that ways to the Westwardes, neither those that were remaining upon that
part of the Land that did not synke, did never attempt to seek any Land
unto the Eastwardes.

And in like manner, they could not so conveniently do it, for that they had
no Shipping to go unto the Sea, but small Boats called Cannouses, which be
occupied to no other purpose or use, but only to go on fyshing, or else to
transport themselves from Land unto Land, near unto the mayne. c. And yet
it is possible that some people might pass out of these parts by shipping
although they never made any return again, but might tarry there, and
inhabit in those parts.

And now insomuch that it is known, that they had boats, and did transport
them selves from place unto place, and from Island unto Island, before the
finding of the mayne land of America. So it is not to be marveled at, why al
the Lands in the sea, that are of any quantity, have people in them,
considering that they had in al those parts, the use of Boats from the
beginning after No, The Indians had Boats asoone as we here in these parts.
or what time we had Boats. c. And now furthermore, as touching the great
fyrme land that lies to the Southe^wards beyond the Equinoctial about.50.
degrees, is extended unto the South parts, no man in these parts doth know,
and it is peopled too, and the people thereof may come out of America, for
there is nothing to let them, but a narrow ^a, called the straight of
Magalenus, and they having the use of Boats, howe easily is it to be passed?
So that there can be no I^and, lying in the sea, near unto America, that is of
any bygnesse, but that it is peopled, whether it be to the Eastwardes towards
us, or to the West parts in the South Sea, or the East Ocean Sea. c.

And furthermore, as it doth appear in the Scriptures, that No had three
sons, that is to say, Sem, Ham, and Iaphet, and that Sem, the eldest son of
Noye, did inhabit the parts of Africa, and Cham or Ham, the second son of
No, did inhabit the parts of Asia: and Iaphet the youngest son of No, did
inhabit Europe, and the Ilandes in the sea, as the great. Land Atlantida,
now called America, and that the Kings of that great Land, were the sons
of Neptunus, and the people, the posterity of Iaphet, the youngest son of
No. c.
