A SHORT DISCOVERY OF THE VNOBSERVED DANGERS OF several sorts of ignorant and
vnconsiderate Practisers of Physic in England: Profitable not only for the
deceived multitude, and easy for their mean capacities, but raising reformed
and more advised thoughts in the best understandings: With Direction for the
safest election of a Physician in necessity: BY IOHN COTTA of Northampton
Doctor in Physic.

LONDON, Imprinted for WILLIAM IONES, and RICHARD BOYLE dwelling in the
Blacke-Friers. 1612.

TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE, RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL AND WORTHY Gentlemen, my desired
friends and deserving Patients of Northamptonshire, honour, health and
happiness of life.
RIght noble and renowned Gentlemen, it is now the tenth years since the
singular favours, love, merit and tried worth of my thrice Sir William Tate.
honoured friend hath first here detained me in the eye of your use. In this
short space of quick time, as my public office hath been truly devoted unto
you all the common right, so many your noble peculiar deserts have worthily
challenged their special claim. In pledge therefore of my love and duty unto
you all, and in memory of my travels amongst you* (when former vows shall
happily hence re^all me) what my time here passed hath brought forth, most rare
or worthy unto choice observation, I freely publish, and reciprocally here
present unto the countries good, and together with general caution and rule
for safe and wholesome medication, repay and dedicate. The matter and subject
it self, unto common reading, is of a virgin fresh and as yet vndiuulged
view, and no less of necessary and serious use. The stile can neither be so
far in love with it self as to forget the matter, nor altogether savours
of his oft interrupted unsettled leisure; and brevity doth not suffer the
reading to be any burden. The pains and loss of secured safety Namque
tacere Tutum semper erit. Scalig. Constare gratis quin silentium possit.

in silence are mine own, and the opportunity every mans that lusts to
censure, or to satisfy any other more honest end: I have thus freely exposed
my self in a proposed hope, that the hence derived good of many may make good
my good desire unto all. Since the this small sacrifice of my self to all your
happy healths (a mite answerable to my might) doth therewith include a needful
use unto a common good, that after succeeding participation may enlarge the
benefit unto all, or at least my poor pains awake more ample merit in some
others worth, vouchsafe my free honest labour in your friendly acceptance,
shrouded by the true splendour of your generose and noble worthes, may dazzle the
narrow sight of base obtrectation. Thus shall your ever deserving loves and now
desired patronages, make both so much more deserved love your desirous servant,
and religiously ever oblige my self in all true rights unto your daigned
favours, perpetual solicitor of humble, officious and thankful memory.

IOHN COTTA.

that love thy life, and for thy life thy health, take counsel of a Physician
without a fee. So many and so infinitely do the numbers of barbarous and
unlearned counsellours of health at this time overspread all corners of this
kingdom, that their confused swarms do not only every where cover and
eclipse the Sun-shine of all true learning understanding but generally darken
and extinguish the very light of common sense and reason. It is every mans
office to do good for goodness sake, and both my general duty unto a common
good, and my special bond unto my friends, do earnestly solicit me hereto,
since no man (that as yet I hear) hath hitherto undertaken this task. For
their sakes therefore, for whose harms by unskilful hands I have oft
heretofore sorrowed, and for their loves, whose life and health I wish
heareafter preserved, and for their good who will take pains to know it, I
here commend (leaving the common mischief to the common care) unto every
particular for himself this needful detection of harmful Cui malus est

more distractedly miserable in hard choice of good) in so common and confused
multitudes of ill. For the meanest readers sake (whom in this whole work I
labour equally to observe) I have suited the plains and simplicity of a
familiar style: and for facility of common reading have also smoothed and
cleared the stream and current of this little volume, from the stops and
interruptions of unusual sounds and language (as far as the subject will
permit) refreshing only the learned in the margin. Neither have I esteemed it
any indecorum for the meanest understanding sake, together with general
cautions and rules to insert particular cases and reports, which may be both an
inducement to read, and an enticement to continue, example being neither least
pleasing nor least profitable unto the vulgar. There shall appear in this
following treatise described, first, such insufficient workmen and
practitioners, as this time doth generally set forth, with their several
manners, defects and dangers: and after shall succeed a plain pattern of that
sufficient Artist, unto whom with judgment and better satisfaction unto thy
own understanding, thou may commend thy health, and whom the Ancients, right
reason, and experience have ever allowed. I labour not in this plain
discovery with words to feast prodigality, nor hope altogether for want of
correspondence unto satisfaction to macerate frugal satiety. Few words do

only briefly point the common forgetfulness by bare advertisement to better
memory, which after may better thence guide it self to more large and
accurate consideration. This plain endeavour begotten of succisiue hours by
good desire, thy proposed benefit (deserving Reader) hath here brought forth
into this common light. Enjoy therefore therein what seems liking, or of use:
the rest thy wiser thoughts may either in reading, abstract, or thy ingenuous
mind compare with that is better, or by it self censure as a cipher. Farewell.

Thy weale-aduising friend, IOHN COTTA.

THE FIRST BOOK.
CHAP. I.
The Introduction.
THE dignity and worth of Physics skill consists not (as is imagined
commonly) in the excellence and pre-eminence of remedies, but in their wise and
prudent use. It is an ancient true saying, that wholesome medicines by the
hands of the judicious dispenser, are as Remedia si ab indoctis Medicis
vsurpentur sunt venena, si vero a doctis exercitatis, Deorum sunt auxiliares
manus. Herophil.
Angels of God sent for the good of men; but in the hands of the unlearned, are
messengers of death unto their farther evil. Good medicines are in themselves
excellent instruments of health and life, but require a learned workman
judiciously to guide them unto their destined end. It is order and not
confusion, that is ever safe and happy; and knowledge (which works by
election, and (...). Aristot:

time, is loss of labour and of time. Ignorant slowness doth come too late,
and rash haste doth stumble: he that knows not the danger, doth easily run
upon the rock. Thus is it easy for the unlearned to err, and those that want
understanding to fall into the snare. If then all enterprises prosper by wise
advice, it is wisdom in matters of meanest moment to consult with a wise and
judicious friend, in cases of health and life certainly every man is not a
sufficient counsellor. He that considers the multitude of causes in diseases,
their infinite kinds, manners, and natures, the variety of accidents, their
sudden and variable mutations, the soon lost occasions, and hardly gained

causes of diseases, what varying differences arise in the manner, quantity,
quality, and times of remedies: every one requiring a separate and distinct
respect and dispensation, even in the same disease and person? The immediate
cause from the mediate, the antecedent from the continent, the necessary from
the casual and contingent, require both a diverse handling, and also a
distinction in order of handling: neither is there a like consideration of the
external and internal, the positive, the priuatiue, the material, the
immaterial, those that are single and alone, and those that are jointly and
with others. Sometimes many causes are coincident in one effect, sometimes many
diseases from one cause. Sometimes the same cause receives a difference from
it self, and exacts an exact difference in his own remedies. Sometime the
same cause is so far unlike it self that it seems not it self, being
either more then it self in quantity, or a monster to Accessu qualitatis

it self in malignant quality. As causes diseases (according to their causes:)
so no less material are accidents to be distinctly known and considered.

idle: some iudicate the constitution of the sick, some the humour, some the
diseased part, some the disease it self, and some the issue. Sometimes
diseases are discovered by no signs at all, but by an exact and exquisite Haec

benefit of the sick, facility of cure, and security of after health.
Diseases, their causes and circumstances wisely distinguished and known, do
point a discreet knowing workman to a more certain issue; without which as
the beginning of cure must necessarily be rash, so must the end be doubtlessly
uncertain. Hence it must needs be apparent, that by the common neglect and
ignorance herein, the monopolizing of cures unto the prerogative of this or
that secret, and thereby the contempt of the due permutation of medicines,
according to requisite circumstances and necessities, and the omission
reiection of the wholesome administratio of the general Quemadmodum duae sunt

remedies (without which the particular are vain and preposterous) do commonly
turn to the common perdition of most valetudinary men. From hence also it doth
come to pass, that many disea^es, beyond their own nature, and besides the
constitution of the sick, grow so commonly, so easily rooted, and vnobseruedly
confirmed in men's bodies, that oft they can never have end, which by due
ordering should never have had beginning. Hence grow so frequent the multitude
of strange and unnatural changes, and new fashions of fits, even through the
too common use of wholesome remedies in vulgar and profane hands. For through
this presumption, either by idle trifling and vain flattery of ease, dangerous
diseases quickly in short time grow too proud for any medication: or else in

(...). Hippoc. Aphor. l. 2.
and so metamorphize themselves into wild and unaccustomed shapes. Hence
likewise it comes to pass, that diseases in their own kind easy and of
small continuance, by the wrong and injury of remedies (without advice admitted
and celebrated) are not only extended, to a lingering age of many days: but
from days to weeks, from weeks to years, yea oft unto a longer life then
the sick himself, after him inheriting his children and posterity. It is a
verified and true saying, Worse are the bad after-consequences of ill applied
medicines, then diseases themselves. Although this be often apparent, even unto
the common sense of vulgar sight, yet much more infinite are the impeachments
and ruins of health by the learned seen and discovered daily, whereof a
common eye is not (...). Non est cuiusuis malum in initio exo^iens dignoscere.

insensibly enter with vnpriuiledged remedies, and by some present benefit or
ease for a time, gaining credit and entertainment, by little and little secretly
undermine the very frame and foundation of life. We may instance in Tobacco:
with what high fame and great renown was it at his first arrival here in
England entertained as an incomparable jewel of health, and an universal
antidote and supersedes against the force, and capias of all diseases, every
man with the smoke thereof in his nostrils, breathing the prayles and
excellencies thereof in his mouth? But now hath not time and many a mans woeful
experience given testimony to right reason and judgment, from the first
suspecting, and until this proving time suspending the too great name thereof?
Is not now this high blazed remedy manifestly discovered* through intemperance
and custom, to be a monster of many diseases? Since the riotous use of this
strange Indian, let it be noted how many strange before unknown diseases have
crept in unnaturally, besides the former custom and nature of the nation,
proving now natural and customary to the follies of the nation. Is it not
apparent that the air of this vapor and smoke by the subtility thereof, doth
suddenly search all parts with a general distress oft times to nature? And is
it not thence probable, that by advantage in the weakest, it may oft leave
behind it (especially where it is any time used) such impression and print,
besides painful distention through his enclosed vapour, that no time of life,
no remedies, oft times, are ever after able to blot A vaporosae aereae

into some weak parts, such seed of future poison, as having given them for a
time supposed pleasing ease, doth for time to come secretly and unfelt settle
in their bones and solid parts, a never dying disease (while they live.) How
many famous patrons and admirers of this simple, have senselesly died in the
very time of the idle use thereof, while it yet smoked in their teeth? and
others living in the immoderate I condemn not a plentiful and liberal use
thereof when any necessity or need with reason and judgment conduct thereto,
but the ordinary, fond and needless custom thereof, led by no persuasion of
any foreseen good or benefit, must needs fall into the common errors and
harms of vseles and needless actions.

their age in health, especially who thoroughly knew the siluer-salue in their
youth. Hence toward declining age (if not before) some fall into consumptions
and marasmes, some lose their teeth, some have the palate of the mouth rotted,
some the very bones of their head eaten, some by conuulsions their mouths and
faces set awry. And it is ordinary with most of this sort, long before harvest
to leave no grass grow upon their paved tops. I do not altogether condene
these smokes, but fear their fire, and with the Ancients sparingly commend
their kind of remedies, knowing their pernicious danger in their ignorant and
rash ouervse, with their singular service in some rare exigents, God and nature
happily leaving a sting and poison in them, for their too common vicious need
and custom. I might here yet farther insist in all other diseases, how the use
of the most excellent, proper, and apt remedies being unaptly applied, either
too little or too Quot sunt qui solo victu competenti citra vllum discrimen ab

any time, or in any manner, bring in corrigible and helpeles harms, being in

harmeles, but in their unskilful use pernicious and mortal. It is apparent
in all mysteries and faculties whatsoever, that the excellency of the tool
without the excellency of the workman, doth not bring forth excellency in
the workmanship. Hence it must needs come to pass, that medicines though
wholesome in themselves, and of a saving and sovereign power, without any
touch of harmful quality at all, yet being ignorantly or indiscreetly out of
time or place disposed or dispensed, must likewise bring forth mischief, in
stead of expected good. And although many hardened by custom unto a boldness
of trasgressing in this kind, provoke oft revenge of their folly, (for a time
without harm or punishment) yet do they not always escape: for though hap

bathing and the like, reason and experience daily give demonstration, that oft
in the same body, and the same disease, they are variablie, sometime necessary,
sometimes profitable not necessary, sometimes neither profitable nor necessary,
but accursed. Sometimes bleeding doth ventilate and refresh the spirits above,
and beyond all other remedies, and is the only key unto health; sometimes
again it doth exhaust and spend their vigour, sometime being both profitable
and necessary, yet used out of time or quantity doth no good, or used

infinite danger in error and ignorant dispensation, so is there unspeakable
good in the prudent prescription according to the nature, quality and seat of

allay, sometimes to hasten, sometimes to moderate their effects, discreet
stays oft making more speedy journeys. Aph. 18. lib. 4. Aph. 17. lib. 4.
Vomits in some diseases are altogether banished and not admitted, and in some
contrariwise they have only privilege. The like may be said of outward
remedies, plasters, unguents, cereclothes, fomentations, and baths, which also
according to wise and discreet administration, or a rash and heedless abuse,
are good or evil. And this is the reason, that so many famous and renowned
remedies now adays bring forth effects unworthy themselves; for (being with
such dissolute licenciousnesse every where and in all places permitted to
break forth, out of the prudent awe of understandings guidance) how shall they
choose but become wild and irregular in the hands of unskilful rains that
want true art, and the methode of their right dispensation? There is no place
nor person ignorant with what confusion of good order (either by abuse of
immunities, or impunity, ill provision, or ill execution of good laws)
through all parts of this kingdom, all sorts of vile people and unskilful
persons without restraint, make gainful traffic by botching in physic;
and hereby (besides many wicked practises, iuglings, cousinages impostures,
which mask unespied under the colour and pretence of medicining) numbers of
vnwotting innocents daily in thrall, and betray themselves, their lives and
safety, to sustain the riot, lusts and lawless living of their enemies
common homicides. It is a world to see what swarms abound in this kind, not
only of Taylors, Shoemakers, Weavers, Midwives, Cooks, and Priests, but
Witches, Conjurers, Jugglers, and Fortune-tellers. It were a wrong to exempt any
that want wit or honesty in a whole country, yea and many that have too much
of either, must be privileged by an old proverb, to be Physicians, because it
is no manners to call them fools. And hereby not only the simple and
unlettered, but oft times men of better sort and quality, casting their eyes
upon some attempts of these barbarous medicine-mongers, (good oft in their
event) and not considering the dangerousnesse of such habit and custom,
desirously oft times entertain the messengers and ministers of unrecoverable
Perdere quos vult Iupiter, hos dementat. Senec.
misery unto their after life. For as in military designs, oft times a bold
and foole-hardy enterprise above and besides reason, and beyond expectation,
produces an excellent and admired good in the happy issue, yet is it not
commended, or in any case permitted (as being very dangerous) in ordinary
practise or custom of warfare: so likewise diverse events of medicines prove
good, whose bold use and rash prescription is dangerous and unskilful. I do
not only herein pity the mean capacity, but wonder also at the madness of
men in their wits, who in other kinds of knowledge reverend, yet herein, with
desire of life, seem oft to have so little care of their lives. It is strange
to observe how few in these days know, and how none almost labour to know with
election and according to reason, or reasonable likelihood, to bestow in cases
of their lives the trust and care of their crazed healths, but for the most
part wanting a right notice of a judicious choice, take counsel either of
common report which is a common lier, or of private commendations, which are
ever partial. The vnmindfulnesse hereof, and the more mind of mindless
things, do steal from men the minds of men. Hence every where preposterous
intrusion doth disorder the right and propriety of every thing, and the
general forgetfulness of that which to every one is most pertinent, doth beget
an itching business in that which to every one is most impertinent; and self
conceited and presuming ignorance doth prick forward rash spirits to become
more bold busy, then modesty doth permit discreet minds, soberly limited
within their own bounds. This is the cause, that vnwottingly to the poor
patient, unwittingly to the unskilful workman, and generally for the most
part vnobserued of all, is the thread of many a mans life ordinarily, by
unskilful hands entangled in such inextricable knots of sickness, pains and
death, as no time nor art are ever able to unfold. Vnproper remedies are for
the most part worse then diseases, and unlearned Physicians of all bad causes
of diseases themselves the worst. That therefore men continue not in this
general confusion (through voluntary ignorance, ever ignorantly unfortunate)
it is not a needless learning, more studiously to know and discern (...),

good from ill, and ill from good, beginning with the last first.

and by consequent as blind in their intention, so likely to be foolish in
their issue and execution. For there must needs be in all actions want of much
more necessary knowledge then sense and experience canne advance unto: and
experience must needs witness against it self, that the longest age of
experience doth nothing so fully furnish and instruct in many things, as much
more speedily doth prudent invention; which though occasioned and helped by
books and reading, which are both keys unto all knowledge, and also rich
storehouses of experiences, not only of one age and country, but of all times
nations; yet do they only glut the sense with stories of experiences past, but
reason and judgment truly enrich the mind, and give daily new increase and
light in before untried unexperienced truths. Indeed particular experience, if

and right reason (which is the touchstone of truth and right in nature)
establishes and confirms knowledge; but if experience be no more but

were constantly continually, as in his best health, manifest, strong, equal,
in good order, with full distentio unto all the dimesions. In the same parts
where the pulses on the other side seemed dead, all other faculties perfectly
lived in natural heate, color, vigour, sense motion. This was the witnessed by
certain honourable gentle women present, who well understanding more then

with extreme pains of her stomach (giving no rest nor intermission) adding
fear and sorrow; the substance also of her urine continually troubled,
confusedly thick, the colour altogether resembling the strained juice of the
grenest herb. In the terror of her abortion my endeavour proved unto her
speedily happy and successful. Afterward according unto the second indication
from the iaundies (necessity urging, and her strength then favouring the work)
I commanded her to bleed in the arm; which done with good ease and felicity,

extraordinarily diverse days pained in the belly an inch distant from the

an ell, suddenly at two distant places did eat themselves a passage through
the skin of her belly; and so came forth and gave her ease. A gentlewoman my
late patient, and now dwelling in Northampton, reports unto me fro her own
sight with many other eye witnesses; that among her own children a male child,
being then five weeks of age, a fortnight together had the breasts full of
milk, as readily plentifully flowing and spouting out milk as the breasts of
a suck-giuing nurse. These few instances are sufficient to prove the like
contingence of other the like, which other times in other manner, may and do
oft bring forth. Neither is ever nature so great a niggard (though not to every
eye alike bountiful) but every day almost may pose bare and naked experience.

fall out seeming like, yet have no affinity; and again in show the same, yet
indeed contrary. Contraries have oft in many things likeness, and likeness

no small moment or consequence for a Physician truly by a discerning eye to put
just difference. This he that cannot do, must either through the
deceiuablenesse of likenesses confound repugnant remedies, (which cannot be
without great harm and hazard of life and health) or by mistaking parities for
imparities disioyne helps better united, which cannot be without both
hinderance and hurt unto the sick, their safety and security. Many diseases

imprisoned for an untimely death. It is now the sixth year since I was
solicited for a woman by the opinion of the dysenterie or abrasion of her guts,
miserably held for the space almost of a quarter of an year unto the
continual use of eueryday-glysters and other astringent medicines, until it
was my fortune coming unto her, by good reason to discover the supposed
membranous deiections to be nothing else but skins of worms, which first
dead, after putrified dissolved into small parcels descended with some torment
in the similitude of little skins. The skins being found it was an easy
matter by a new warrant to fetch the skinners, whose thereto appearance
confessed the evidence, gave the suspicion of the dysentery for ever after free

conceive many more without number, which therefore as unnecessary and

sense of his own experience, how shall he do otherwise, but oft and
continually mistake manifoldly much more? And thus we have briefly discovered
the Empiric in matters requiring extraordinary counsel, ignorant, in cases
of his best experienced knowledge yet unto some circumstances unfurnished, in
many matters of substance altogether unexpert, in rare accidents and before
unseen at a maze, in true right discerning wanting the eye of right reason, in
confounding things differing, in separating things in their own nature
inseparable, dagerous. Now as we have pointed out the Empiric himself, so it
remains that with him and in him, we note all that by institution, educatio,
tradition, instruction, or stolen obseruatio derive their rule, example custom
from him. In this number are all that usually profess themselves in confidence
of their choice secrets and excellent medicines, commanders masters of all
diseases. Such also are they who in all places proclaim open defiance against
all maladies, with vehement remedies upon every light occasision needelesly,
vnprouoked (if diseases presently cannot away) either fire them out or pull
their hold about their ears, with the fall of the disease needelesly hazarding
the diseased. Oft times a good event may authoritse it for skill, their
friendly offer call it good will; but their kind care is too oft seen and
proved a keen weapon to wound their friend, and the sick are nor seldom
oppressed with being so loved. I would it were a slander in these days, that
good will and excellent medicines put to death more lives then open murder.
For as the most complete armour, engines, and forts of war, the excellent
munition and rich provision unto a man without knowledge to manage them, are
but instruments without life, until some better skill put life into them: so
good medicines being the Physicians instruments and weapons, either defensive
for nature, or offensive against the forces of diseases, in other hands then
his must needs prove as but dead in themselves, so ofttimes deadly unto
others. To square and leuill their right use requires more understanding then
is to be found in reasonless medicines, or yet their senseless masters. For
as in all other affairs, where knowledge, prudence, and discretion Sapientis
consilium vnum multorum manus superat. Gal. in Suasor. ad Arts.
have prerogative, the attempt is commendable, and the issue likely to be
happy; so also in cases of health, wherein wise judicious dispensation, or in
rash erroneous, the virtue and efficacy of medicines doth live, or die in use
and power. It is strange notwithstanding in these days to behold, with what
senseless madness, men are become worshippers of medicines: and so great
ofttimes is their idolatrous folly herein, that (as if they had gotten some
rare good in a box, I mean some rare secret) they presently inflamed with the
fury and opinion thereof, dare upon the consused notice of a disease commend
with as sacred secrecy and intolerable usurped titles of infallible, absolute,
and irresistible virtue force, as if any particular excellency were able to

remedies against the common causes of diseases ordained, except first rightly
administered, shall continually and necessarily forestall and hinder the good
and benefit from any particular. There are no material diseases wherein the
common remedies are not requisite. Such are phlebotomy, purgation, vomit, and
the like. And wheresoever these are requisite, if they be not rightly
administered, all other medicines be they never so excellent and incomparable,
must needs lose their excellent and incomparable use. And none can rightly
dispense the general remedies, but those that are more generally learned then
the best acquaintance and familiarity which particular medicines can afford.
From hence it cannot but be manifest, how infinitely blind good will and zeal
do herein daily err to the destruction of many. It were happy if at length the
common inconvenience and public scandal might beget a law, and law bring
forth restraint. For illustration of that which hath bin said, it were
indifferent to instance in any disease, but I will make choice of some few
only, to satisfy for all. It is an ordinary custom in those days with
women to give medicines for the green sickness; other stoppages in young
women. In which practise if it so happen that no inward impediment frustrate
the endeavour, they casually ofttimes do seeming present good, and blaze the
excellency of their medicine: but if ofttimes (which they cannot distinguish
or observe) the general cause of the obstruction be not first by the general
remedy removed or diminished, or the immediate cause settled within the stopped
parts, be not first fitted and prepared to yield, all their medicines of never
so great force, yea though commonly as strong as steel or iron, do not only
no good or small good, but ofttimes incorrigible hurt and mischiefs never
after able to be reformed, or by the most learned counsel to be redressed;
while from the plenty or ill disposition of humours in the body these searching
and piercing medicines carry with them into the stopped parts either more or
worse matter then was before, and thereby there leave a disease which shall
never after die except by exchange for a more pernicious. In the common known
disease of the stone likewise many and famous medicines are at this day in many
common hands, and perhaps truly celebrated; yet if sometimes bleeding Si metus

medicines whatsoever for the stone do not only in vain exasperate the
disease, but hazard the party much more then the omission of means. Likewise

after, all other good means are frustrate. And at another time if there be
any bleeding at all, it is hazard, danger, and death it self. There are no
medicines so commonly well known as such as are every where in use, and at
every mans hand provided for the pains and diseases of the stomach, and for
that use happily special good; yet ofttimes we see how long and vainly those
means without benefit are applied, until the true cause by a general remedy
be happily removed, and that remedy perhaps the most unlikely in a common
judgment, and seldom in common practise, prescript or custom used for that
purpose. When all other trials are waste and lost in this case, and pain doth
nothing stoup, sometime the opening only of a vein Mulier in vehementissimo

Many and innumerable more might instances by, but these may suffice for light
and illustration to all the rest, as also for sufficient caveat for putting any
trust or confidence in the excellency of any particular remedies without
advice, for right dispensation of the general. And here by may be judged and
discovered the indiscreet thoughts of light brains and understandings in
these days, of men, that so preposterously divulge in all places so many
books and paper-Apothecary-shoppes of secrets and medicines, better judgment
and learned soath teaching the wise and discreet, that things without reason
in themselves are by reason and wisdom to be guided and ordered; lest in
ignorant handling and vnwotting abuse their fair promising seemings prove
gilded poisons. If any man want wit to see or know this or knowing will not
consider, let the danger prove it self unto him, and let such experience be
ever the mother of fools. And for those that herein make mercy and
commiseration apology for their rash violating the rules of wisdom,
sobriety and safe discretion in ignorant intermedling, I wish them consider
how dangerous are the harms and consequences of good intentions, and
charitable indeauors, where they run before knowledge and propriety in the
agent. Every honest function is not every honest mans, but unto every man is
distributed and allorted the action of his own calling: which also must be
made his and appropriate, not only by approved sufficiency in himself, but
authorized approbation in others: whereby the action being good in it self,
lawful in the doer, fitting and accommodate unto the circumstance, it is
blessed of God, commended of men, seasonable in it self, harmelesly
profitable, and every way without reproach.

Among those that are wise, a good conscience doth stay all rash commission: and
confirmation of all necessary offices by such as are learned, doth prevent the
accusation of careless omission: and in this mean for the unlearned to
consist, is only harmless piety. Between the vnconsiderate hast of abundant
affection, and the lame and careless pace of want of love and duty: between
too busy meddling, and too curious forbearance, are conspicuous the excellent
virtues of prudence, discretion and knowledge, upon which are safely founded
wise moderation and temperate use of means, unto which ever and only God hath
blessed all actions, their ends and issues. In whom therefore these are not,
how unwarranted are their actions unto their own hearts, and how dangerous also
must they be to others harms? If women then profess no arts, nor as masters
of sciences can prove their rules, let them with sobriety govern the great
rule of themselves, and so shall they be most harmelesly happy in being freed
from the unhappiness of having their hands so commonly in others mishaps, unto
the dishonour of womanhood, Historiae.
A gentlewoman lately falling grievously sick, through the frights of
bloud-letting (wherewith women's counsel by many ill reports thereof had
confounded her) refused the only safe rescue of her life thereby. Whereupon
very shortly after, her blood grew so furious, that breaking the wonted bounds
and limits of her veins, with violence it gushed out not only at her mouth
and nose with diverse other passages of her body besides, but also made a
diruption in the veins of one of her legs, from whence issuing in great
abundance it speedily dispatched her, even unto the end and last breath still
making her choice, that rather her blood should thus kill her then she consent
to part with any part thereof otherwise. Thus she miserably died. Cotrariwise

in the year 1602. and of her age the 74. (as she her self numbered) vexed
many years with a continual issue of blood, after she had been long left in
hopeless care despair, required and expected of me her last doom. I found (oft
observing her pulse) a manifest, equal and constant magnitude, altitude, and
vehemence, the habit of her body well liking; and by these assured my self as
of the cause of her disease, so also of the strength of nature. Many other
remedies before in vain iterated and varied, and none prevailing or profiting,
contrary to the judgment of some former Physicians, as also her own liking in
regard of her age and supposed weakness, and contrary to the general
disclaim and wonderment of her friends, her Distinguendae vires grauatae

in the arm; whereupon without any farther other help she immediately
recovered her strength, and was freed the space of eight years together from
the issue, which had continually vexed her many years before. I deliver these
familiar examples of mine own for better satisfaction, whereby unto the
meanest eye and simple understanding it is apparent, that bloud-letting or not
bloud-letting (as all other remedies) are either good or evil, or neither good
nor evil, in several seasons and circumstances; whereby the persuasion or
dissuasion thereof by such as want judgment, In decrepita aetate sanguine
mittit Rhazes vrgente valde necessitate.
is ever casually also good or evil in it self, but ever vniustifiable in the
ignorant counsellor. The just will not herein offend, but the fool will be
babbling, whereof to beware unto many had been saving physic, that now are
dead. Many times have many by persuading without reason or judgment drawn
their friend unto death, contrary to their better meaning, troubling them with
fear of death in the remedy, while they run themselves to death for want of
remedy. Ill counsel for the most part produces ill event. Ignorant counsel
is never good counsel. And therefore it is honest for it self, and safe for
the sick, that ignorance be ever silent, or never presumptuous. It is oft
occasion of mirth to see, how even after sick men are sometime perfectly
recovered, the very ill opinion of remedies past (laboured into the conceit by
the waving of idle tongues) holds them still needlessly sick, until their
wiser thoughts draw their minds to forget their imagination, or to remember
themselves: and thus unawares they sometime ease themselves of their own
imposition, which was first the vain supposition of a friend. Such friendship
is oft simplicity, and happily sometimes knavery; but let the patient that
desires his own good, be impatient of such folly, and not enlarge his kind
heart unto so unkind hurt unto himself, remembering (though it be humanity to
hear a friendly voice) that the attendant of wisdom is slow belief. Oft and
much babbling inculcation in the weak brains of the sick may easily preuaile
with them, to forget both that which their own good hath taught them, and also
by a borrowed opinion from others indiscreet words, to corrupt their own
sense. It is the common custom of most common people thus ordinarily to molest
and trouble the sick. Their presence therefore is dangerous, carefully to be
either prohibited, or better governed. Common vulgar mouths easily incline
scandalously to prejudice the things they know not. Hence it is in these days
a customary work to dissuade physic, while me not making right choice of
their Physician, or perue^ting good counsel by their own peevish frowardness,
and thereby multiplying unto themselves continual occasion of complaint,
unjustly therefore accuse art, which they never duly sought, nor found, nor
used, therefore never knew. The offences that men justly take, are the faults,
the blots, the staines of imperfect workmen, not of art; whereof art is as
guiltless as they are void of art. Many because they may happily observe some
others by the too much immoderate use of physic, sometime too hardly to keep
under their own strength, sometime happily to tire nature, or too continually to
interrupt perturb her quiet fruition of herself, the true sense of her own
power streght in her self; therefore in the other extreme they also with a

use thereof, denying unto God nature their care, duty to themselves,
restraining nature from the privilege of remedies which God hath given unto
her, and injuriously suffering her to live within them imprisoned, oppressed,
and oft needlessly ruined. Physic it self is honoured by the mouth and mention
of God himself, and in it self hath demonstration of it self, unto them
whose understanding doth give them eyes; but the ignorant and the excessive
use, the abuse thereof, no less the perverse contempt neglect thereof, are the
curse of God, and the sin of men. They therefore that persuade the sick that
they have no need of the Physician, call God a liar, who expressly saith Non

such foolish calumny, and in their necessities let them remember their Maker,
and thankfully embrace his blessing and benefit of ease and health, which
thereby he hath commended and given unto them; lest unthankful to him, and

it is no wonder that the fewest speak truly good of good. Ecclesiast. 38. 4.
Some of these sorts do not simply or absolutely dissuade physic, but (as an
inducement unto their own practise and admittance) such physic only as
comes unknown unto them, out of Apothecaries shops, or from Physicians hands
and directions: thereby preferring their own private ointments, plasters,
ceareclothes, drinks, potions, clysters, and diets, because by time and
custom they are become familiarly known unto them, and now are of their own
domestic preparation, therefore are by their knowledge, acquaintance, and
auouching of them, grown into some credit and reputation with them. With this

expectation of uncertain trial, these known defects as the perpetual
consequences of this ignorance and want of knowledge, as they are ordinarily
admitted, so are they continually manifestly observed and noted by others
harms, and ofttimes too late repentance: for since want of knowledge doth ever
lamely give supply to any want, what safe expectation or probable hope can the
diseased have of ignorant persons in their distressed wants? Old Eve will never
be worn out of Adams children. Alas an apple can do no great hurt. It is fair
and beautiful unto the eye, pleasant to taste, and but a trifle, a small
matter, a little quantity, and of excellent quality; Adam must needs taste. It
is good for his eyes, it will clear his sight, an excellent medicine to make
him see. What is more fair, more easy, more gentle, more harmless, more
cordial, more dainty then an apple? Eve in good will offered it, and so Adam
took it. It made him also see; but Adam had been better still blind. A
dangerous and incurable leprosy and infection thence seized upon him, which
after none but the great Physician of heaven and earth could cure. Many
medicines are small, harmless, gentle, pleasant, and in themselves do not
hurt. But by accident, by consequent, by circumstance, death oft follows them
at the heals. Milk, broth, butter, and many other wholesome meates, iuices
and fruits in themselves, are of common harmless use, mild, nourishing and
comfortable, some of them sometimes sovereign antidotes against many poisons,
mitigators of diverse pains; yet because sometimes against some circumstances

This did witness a late Summers sudden heates, wherein the unadvised hasty

Northamptonshire sent labourers harvest people into their graves. With these
for farther illustration, I might number without number many more; but unto the

carry a manifest danger and malignity in their nature and use, I could think
no man so void of counsel, as to need therein counsel: yet because
experience of some errors herein past is argument of other remaining possible

to himself. It is ordinary with many unskilful busie-bodies under colour and
pretext of gentle and safe dealing, to make familiar and ordinary the use of
perilous medicines, which happily also they do not so distinguish or repute, and
therefore cannot be said to lye, (because they speak their thought,) yet tell
not truth, because they think not right. Historia.
I was sometime solicited by a careful mother for her child, whom I found by a
sharpe and acute conuulsion violently distorted, and before time allowed
leisure for preparation of remedies, swiftly strangled. In any propension
thereto in the constitution or other disposition of the child, was nothing
which might apparently be accused; and therefore making diligent inquiry after
some outward cause, I found that the suspicion of worms had occasioned the
commendations and use of of the herb Bearefoote, which though ordinary and
much accustomed for that end among women, and oft by good hap without hurt; yet
we could not but with good reason hereof convince, conferring the present harm
(which no presumption could unto other thing impute) with the danger and
maligne nature of that herb in production of such like effects: (although many
for the like use have in like manner given it unto their children without
blame.) Thus sometimes some men have devoured mortal poisons, not only
without harm, but with good and commodious effect. By these conveyances
through the like presumption, many vnwotting bodies oft bury in themselves
vnbewailed (because unknown) Ellebor, Quicksiluer. Precipitate, and the like,
coloured with better names, and at the present unperceived. Desperate trials
sometime bring forth strange deliuerances, yet neither is the boldness
warrant, nor the escape encouragement. There happen oft in these days many
sudden, marveled and strange accidents, posing the best Physicians
themselves, without doubt oft raised from causes by these errors unknown,
secret, concealed, or happily by time before the effect appear, forgotten: (for
secret mischiefs long time insensibly undermine before the sensible event
appear.) For proof of dangerous customs in ignorant hands, Historia.
I will make one example a light unto many. A woman sometime came to advise
concerning an extraordinary accident in her ordinary use of spurge-comfits. She
gave (at the same time her self, and some others in the same house taking
thereof with answerable effect and evacuation) unto a very aged man eight in
number (being her usual dose.) The first day they had no effect with the old
man, and in all the rest performed their wont: she therefore gave him as many
the next day with the like effect, and as many every day unto the 10 day, with
the like proof. It was then her fear he had tasted his own funeral feast
before his death, but he survived the fear without sense of change or danger.
Is it safe from this good hap, for other in hope still to hazard themselves in
such unsafe handling? Is it not rather manifest how ignorantly and commonly
these creatures overlook the danger which justly wisdom and reason suspend
and fear? Discreet fear awakes vigilance and circumspection, but ignorance
of danger is void of fear, and therefore of care. Careless attempts draw
harmfull and repented issues: and though good haps sometimes flatter vain
security, yet if seldom harms be not wisely extended as a caution and example
unto many, the custom of neglect will make the rare confusion quickly common.
So large a feast of spurgecomfits hath seldom kept so many holy days in one
belly, or a banqueting likeness so harmelesly privileged idleness in a
working quality. The consequent happened much fairer then could be foreseen or
hoped. If for that cause any man will again adventure the like, who will not
imagine that in the thought he hath already lost his wits, in the proof may
lose himself? If notwithstanding he escape, any man will wonder, but no man, I
suppose, imitate. It may be happily deemed incredible, that so common and mean
sort of people can attain acquaintance with so dangerous instruments, as some
before mentioned and other the like; but due exploration oft by the harms
occasioned doth testify it, and the means of their acquaintance discovered
doth prove it easy. Quacksaluers, banckruptapothecaries, and fugitive Surgeons
every where ouertrauelling the face of this kingdom, hunted by want of riot
from place to place, are oft compelled to insinuate and creep into the favour
of many mean people; and in their necessity do sell for gain and
entertainment, and in their prodigality for lust and love, these generose and
noble secrets carrying on the outside the titles of famous medicines, and being
within infamous poisons. And by this means quick and desperate experiments,
with such as thus like to gain them, grow vulgar medicaments.

beholders, some of this sort will not seem nice to cut their own flesh, that
it may be glory within few hours to heal it up again, the pain being
pleasure which is invited by consent, and recompensed by gain. It is strange
to see how these men leaving their old occupations and mechanical mysteries
wherein they were educate, suddenly find themselves inspired with a spirit of
revelation of rare secrets, and thereby promise unto themselves and others
miraculous wonders. And it is indeed true wonder to see with what agility they
are able so grossly to deceive, and in the end like noble Chemists, having
extracted silver out of the baser mettle of idle words, in smoke they vanish,
leaving behind them the shadow of death, with those who leaving the day light
of clearer understanding neglected, rashly run themselves into the mist of
imposture and ignorance. Thus prevalent is fair pollicitation and vain
wonderment. If men would consult with reason judiciously consider; though their
wonders were truly to be wondered, and worthy to exercise the wise and learned
in their extrication (as they are the vanities and inanities of argute and
subtle cousinages,) yet must it never be forgotten, that wonders yea and
miracles themselves are solie never arguments of truth or sufficiency, but for
the most part fruits of unprofitable curiosity, deceiving the simple, amazing
the multitude, and giving way and credit to untruth, cousinage and juggling.
Therefore in this kind the devil himself is excellent, and for the most part
it is one chief part, a true mark and prerogative of his followers,
Coniuerers, Sorcerers, Witches, and Jugglers; who wanting true worthiness in
themselves, make unto themselves these glorious covers. God hath given nothing
unto man, but for his travail and pain. And according to his studious
industry, care, prudence, providence, assiduity and diligence, he dispenses
unto him every good thing. He hath not ordained wonders and miracles to give
supply unto our common needs, nor to answer the ordinary occasions or uses of
our life: but our own needful discreet indeauors ever depending upon his
providence. Truth and sufficiency receive not their just trial by rare works

learn to guide themselves, they shall not so commonly and easily lose their
eyes in the gaze of wonders, nor their reason in the maze of such inexplicable
and intricate folly.

educate institute Physicians, as an vnder-growth unto themselves, by lying
promises, persuading many honest simple parents to commit their children,
otherwise perhaps more fortunate and ingenuous, to be their apprentices. Hence
it comes to pass that many in these days thus traded up by their example

Historia.
A gentleman of Northamptonshire vexed with an ulcer of the bladder required my
advice. Understanding by the daily abundance of purulent matter in his urine
(for the space almost of half an year before continually observed) together
with some store of blood ofttimes withal, (neither of which the bladder it
self and the exility of the veins thereof could so plentifully with so easy

accidents afford) as also by the more perfect permistion thereof with the
substance of the urine, that it was not only an affection of the bladder, but
a greater and more dangerous in the reins, (about the region whereof was ever
much pain and weakness) and conjecturing them past possibility of cure (their
substance already so far spent) I refused to promise or meddle farther then by
palliatiue cure, wherein accordingly I insisted a long time with good ease and
satisfaction unto the patient. At length by some friends there was commended
highly for a farther and better performance, a Barber Surgeon, who thereupon
being required and conducted thither, came unto the gentleman, and according to
the commendatios premised promised to cure him in six Aut facere ingenui est,
aut non promise pudici. Catull.
weeks space. Shortly after the patient complaining of want of sleep, he gave
unto him a Ladanum pill of Paracelsus, and after Mercuriall pills for another
supposed end; by the use whereof in his body, then by the length of his disease
exceedingly before weakened and extenuate, he presently fell into an amazed
staring sleepiness, or an astonishment between Coma vigilas dictum Galeno,
lib. 4. de loc. affect.
waking and sleeping, wherein after he had continued a natural day, in the
morning following he was suddenly surptised with acute and epilepticall fits
and a general conuulsion, with foaming, gnashing his teeth, loud stertors and
the like, whereof after in one day he had passed 8 or 9 fits in my sight (being
then upon that new occasion newly required, the Surgeon Qui nondum stygias
descedere quaerit ad vndas, Tonsorem fugiat, si sapit, Antiochum* Martial.
fled) he was after my coming and means used partly by Theriacall clysters,
suppositars, and antidotes fitting the present cause and accidents, through the
grace of God unexpectedly delivered, after he had by stool thus procured,
avoided one whole pill undissolved (seen by diverse well understanding
witnesses present,) as also diverse small fractions of Quicksiluer fluctuating
and floating like white pins heads, as the women that saw reported unto us.
To make the cause of these accidents yet more manifest; it happened that two
maid-seruants there attending upon the gentleman, by their continual
conversing near him and the infected sweat of his body, fell strangely and
suddenly into the same fits one after another by course, and each having
suffered six or seven apart, were carried forth, and after that time never
since (as I yet hear) nor ever before had the like, as they both then said.
One of these now lives married in Towcester in Northamptonshire, the other was
lately servant unto an honourable Lady. This history is known unto many of note
and worth beside. To conclude, the gentleman thus escaped, and grew by little
and little unto his former senses and strength as his first disease would
permit. Within a quarter of an year after, or thereabout, another Surgeon
again put the gentleman into a new hope of recovery: although the report of my
judgment did somewhat (as I heard) shake his confidence, yet not conceiving my
reason nor seeing the cause, and supposing no other but the ulcer in the
bladder, he took him in hand; and in his hand within few days he left his
life, according to my prediction unto diverse his friends concerning this second
attempt likewise solicited. By these examples it is manifest, both how bold and
confident ignorance will be, as also how powerfully and bewitchingly it

flag to call more fools to the same adventure. This is commonly seen in the
vulgar custom of curing the French disease by Barbers and Surgeons, who
precipitate commonly every one alike, and confusedly without respect or order
thrust all through the purgatory of their sweatings; bleeding, vomiting,
vnctions, plasters, and the like. Hereby many needlessly entangle themselves
upon mere supposal and fear, and many take more then necessity vigeth; and
others for satisfying that necessity, neglect a more material, and flying too
timorously and rashly a known inconvenience, run headlong unknowing into an

themselves, and no way liable to the harms of such desperate remedies, and be
free from the implication of all other diseases besides, (which entering by
their breaches may interrupt their smooth passage, and make pernicious their
French medication) they may happily escaping the danger, for the hazard attain
their desired delivery, as is in some seen. But if nature happily be weak, or
the disposition of the sick subject to the perils of that cure (which these
men seldom do or can consider) or any other disease lie in weight too prompt
to trust with any advantage, (which these men want knowledge to foresee) the
acquaintance with such remedies may easily prove a greater plague unto the
greatest pox. How can he that considers the disease and not the (...), c.

conjunction of any other maladies and respects therewith, whose necessities
may and do oft forbid and prohibit his remedies (that being a medicine to one
disease which is a mischief to another, and an ease to one which is a sorrow
unto another.) It is therefore no marvel, that while these men contemn order
and method, and the learned examination of these and such like circumstances,
and blindly prosecute issues unknown to foreseeing reason, they therefore
(though sometime they remove a mischief) yet either equal it again with the
like, or exceed it with a greater, or else ofttimes not profiting nor

though the ordinary batteries from hence every where almost leave rotten and
mangled monuments of remediless cures, if not present with the cause, yet
never far of, and though sometime long, yet ever certain. For though where
the body is strong, ofttimes many gross errors may be by the ignorant
committed, and yet not espied, (because where is strength there is less sense
and esteem of harms, (weakness being only unable to bear or endure without
complaint) yet the insensible sting doth oft breed the most festered poison,
in the latest sensible smart. The errors of the unskilful Pilot though great

considered, but in the dangerous sea the least error offers the ugly shape
of his own foulness. In bodies not easily harmed many rash harms are hardly
discovered, but in dangerous conditions the least lapses are heavy loads.
Ignorance therefore is only good when it doth no hurt, whereunto it is never
wanting in her property, but only sometimes in power. It is objected, that
wise and learned men do oft mistake. It is true: where is the greatest wisdom

justly merits the name of an ignorant and idiot. This is the plain and
uncontrolled difference between the learned and unlearned. It is yet farther
objected, that oft as good hap smiles upon these ignorants as upon more
learned. It is sometime true, but it is wisdom to distinguish how. Al things
that happen unto the understanding and notion of the mind (which is the guide
of all actions) are either Rerum quae cognoscuntur species sunt 4. Aut enim

related unto me among our merriments his medicine for a continual head-ach and
giddiness, which in time past had long vexed him, and solicited diverse good
Physicians in vain. By chance he met with an angry Surgeon, who being by him
in some words provoked, and finding the gentleman alone and far from company

and plentifully let him blood in diverse places; but life escaping, he thereby

learned Physicians, that they could not foresee, nor would not prescribe so
fortunate a remedy. Thus malice was as happy as an Empericks bold attempt, yet
herein was somewhat better, that it was freely bestowed. Historia.
In like manner, unto another so far engaged in the Neapolitan disease, that
discreet counsel durst not oppose equipollent remedies, a woman (purposing to
poison him) gave an unknown dose of rats-bane; and thereby nature driven unto
her utmost and last shift, setting open all the passages of his body, at once

strength of nature hath by the judicious and learned been carefully
foreballanced between hope and hazard: without these respects the use of hard
and vehement remedies by the hands of unlearned Practitioners are grown too
common. It is therefore good for men to take heed, how they too boldly walk
in the common tract of Empericks and unlearned, whose ways oft trodden grow
slippery, and therefore not varied proo^e dangerous. It is sometime nearest way
to go out of the common way, many times the fairest way, and not seldom the
safest way. For though diseases may be of easy note and well known, and the
vulgar medication no less otherwise apt unto the necessity; yet may one small
circumstance only by it self making the disease different, once escaping an
unskilful and blind eye, for ever after overrun the hopeful use of any other
means, and frustrate the happiness of after-health by better counsel. This
is the reason that so many suddenly and unexpectedly perish not without wonder
in the unskilful practitioners hand, who casting his eye upon nothing but that
which is common, takes for a great stranger what is otherwise, and therefore
not foreseeing, his coming is not prepared to entertain or intercept him with
best advantage; nor gives nor takes warning of him, and therefore is so
suddenly oft surprised by him. Historiae.
I may hereof give a rare instance in an esteemed friend sometimes a learned
Divine, who by some rash advice, his estate at that time not duly considered,
required of an Apothecary a strong medicine against the stone (wherewith from
his childhood he had been ever hereditarily Qui calculi non diu concreeriut ij

conference about that accident, both of us lamenting his so unhappy distress
and misery.

CHAP. VI.
Apothecaries.
HERE so fair occasion offering their memory, we may not forget our
Apothecaries. Among them also some to do a friend an vnlicenced friendship, or
to keep their wares in motion for fear of corruption, will happily sometimes
offer a casual good turn, to any that like the venture. I must needs say for
the privilege of Apothecaries, that if any may have prerogative to be
Physicians, by the excellence and rare choice of medicines, it is most proper
unto them; who have with them registered and enrolled the privy choice, trust
and command of all the best remedies, and have the best light to guess at their
best use. Nay I may commend them farther; that for the excellent preparation
and knowledge of medicines they sometimes may excel some Physicians
themselves: but above and beyond the preparation, the right and judicious
dispensation is truly worthy, commanding and directing their safe and prudent
use. This skill requires an understanding able to raise itself above both the
medicine and the Quam enim proportionem Architectu^ erga coementarios

proportion, time, place, quantity and quality, according to the manifold
several purposes and infinite uses for the preservation, conservation, and
continuance of health and life unto mankind. And herein how far it behooves the
erected mind of higher contemplation, to exalt it self in consultation above
the elementary consideration and composition of a medicine and the vulgar and
common sense, the continual exquisite use and exercise of the most
incomparable prudence and learning in the ordinary and daily difficulties that
befall the health, do plainly prove and demonstrate. It is not the medicine it
self, but the judgment and knowledge of the learned, and right accommodation
annexed unto the wholesome medicine, that adds unto it a worth above it
self; whereby it doth far exceed it self in excellency, in variety of
greater good, in distinction of more proper use, according to art and reason
thereto conducting it, which is the life of every application and accommodation
in all things. Hence even the greatest clerks with this sufficiency provided,
have not blushed to borrow or learn a good medicine at a simple and vulgar

hand, yea from fools and brute beasts, in their own more excellent
adaptation as the soul unto the body, conferring the full and true perfection.
The Ancients themselves have not shamed so to do, as Galen in diverse places
professes of himself. Unto Apothecaries therefore that faithfully and truly
apply themselves and their whole indeauor, that have tried and experienced
skill, and use faithful industry in fitting wholesome and incorrupt remedies
to attend each honest need and necessity without fucation, adulteration or
deceit, and contain themselves within themselves, no man can deny a worthy
esteem both in private thoughts and public estimate; but if the pride and
maister-ship of the medicine stir once in them the ambition of medication, as
in the former men commed them, so in the second they shall justly condemn
them: and as in the one safely use them, so in the other with safe discretion
refuse them, fearing lest with Salomons fly being taken in the Apothecaries
box, they also in like manner make a stink of the medicine, Historia.
an end of themselves. Valleriola mentions an Apothecary who with the
imprudent use of quicksiluer poisoned himself. I knew sometime an honest and
approved good Apothecary in Warwickshire, who imitating a prescription of
precipitate against an inveterate disease which he supposed in himself,
exulcerated his guts, and therefore died. These experiments in other then
themselves had been bloody and dishonest, and in themselves rather then in other
argue their strong confidence, (which therefore might easily seduce them to be
in time bold with others.) Example and imitation (which are the rules of an
Apothecaries practise) are but patterns of another sufficiency. Sufficience
therefore being not their own, it is sufficient to put them in mind of their
own. It is good for every one to be contented and contained within his own
lists, and of his own store with liberality to lend, and of another with love
and licence to borrow. This vpholdeth societies and good orders in common
weals, maintains mutual neighbourhood and humanity, friendly and just
commerce with love and loyal reciprocation, and distribution of every right to
every owner, with good to the general and common, and without hurt to every
private and particular. I say nothing of banckrupt Apothecaries, who having
left their own standing become walking merchants, and with a few pedlarie
wares remaining keep shop in their own hose, or else in their guts, who
(wanting other use) imagine them sufficient to make clean the kitchen. Let the
that desire their meat in the stomach should long find good cookery, take
heed who put herbs into the pot. It hath been required and by some imposed,
that a Physician should be both Surgeon and Apothecary himself. It is easily
decided. In judgment, skill, knowledge, and ability of direction, it is very
requisite and necessary, and the contrary is not tolerable in a true
architect: but every particular execution Ei qui praesidet, scire operari
necessarium non est, sed potius aliorum ministerio vti. Aristot. polit. 3.

more conveniently distributed and divided unto others, whose vicissitude,

make the meaner judgment better apted and more prompt. Galen indeed himself

offices the less distraction, where less distraction, there is the better

supply by others, the suffection or deputation may ease of a burden (as
indifferently else were imposed) there (the business less, and the diligence
and incumbence equal) the remaining task must needs be completely and
absolutely attended perfected. Concerning the Apothecary included in the
Physician: indeed the first Ancients were Apothecaries unto themselves, because
in themselves only was then newly sprouting in the infancy, the inchoation of
that skill, and therefore as yet they could not Omnes arts rudiores primu,

the Physicians eye and skill hath used another hand both as a needful and
requisite Medico mulrae arts aptam materiam praeparant, ipse naturae per

help in the mechanical ministry, and also as an advantage and ease to the
more necessary, laborious, and studious travels of his mind. In ordinary
dispatches therefore it is vnauoidably necessary an Apothecary be ever at hand,
as faithful as his own right hand, and in extraordinary the Physicians own
heart must only trust his own hand, and his own eye witness their consent.
This equity may satisfy curiosity.

CHAP. VII.
Of Practisers by Spells.
NOw to leave both Surgeon and Apothecary, the opposition against the use or
need of either, doth put in mind in the next place not to forget those, who
profess the performances, uses, and end both of Surgeon Apothecary, yea and
Physician himself without their help or need: such are such as cure by spells
and words. If men believe as reason would and as reasonable men should (for men
are no Nec credere possis Hunc hominem, humana qui ratione caret Maximia. vel
vt alij, Cornel Gall.
men if unreasonable) of any effects from spells, among the wise is no true
reason or cause, and without reason can be no right persuasion. Between a true

mediate consequution: but this cause being only ni opinion, can be no more
then opinion, and in opinion is no truth. Some finding spells to do no good,
object as a good, they do no hurt. This hurt I am assured they do; while men
have gaped after such shadows, they oft in the mean season have lost the
substance, their life and health: which while due season offered unto them that
had learned to know opportunity, bad scholars were still at spelling school.
To speak more seriously of such a toy: If the faithful and devout prayer of
holy men (unto which the promise of God, and the blessings of men are annexed)
hath no such assurance or success of necessary consequent, without laborious
industry and the use of good means, how can religion Quod neque religio

or learned, and justly suspected of all sensible men? It shall be no error to
insert a merry history of an approved famous spell for sore eyes. By many
honest testimonies, it was a long time worn as a jewel about many necks,
written in paper, and enclosed in silk, never failing to do sovereign good
when all other helps were helpless. No sight might dare to read or open. At
length a curious mind while the patient slept, by stealth ripped open the
mystical cover, and found the powerful characters Latin, which Englished were

light minds, by vain opinion grow to sooth and earnest. It is strange in these
days to behold how this folly doth laugh even wise men to scorn, while their
unreasonable parts of imagination and fancy, so juggle with their judgements
and understanding, that they can scarce contain themselves from believing and
consulting with such ridiculous folly. Thus able is fancy, not only to
deceive sense, but to obscure our reason. If there be any good or use unto the

they that trust unto them. I speak not of enchanted spells, but of that
superstitious babbling, by tradition of idle words and sentences, which all that
have sense, know to be void of sense, as the other devilish. The one (if
there be no remedy) we must permit unto fools, in the other we cannot deny
the devil.

CHAP. VIII.
The explication of the true discovery of Witchcraft in the sick, together
with many and wondered instances in that kind.
MAny things of great power and wonder, Witcheraft.
above reason and beyond the power of nature, have been effected through the
imprecation, stimulation and ministry of wicked men the associates of devils,
whose commerce with spirits hath been oft plain and manifest. But it is good
before we enter into the consideration thereof, that we be wary and
cautelously wise, how we make a true difference between a true work of the
devil, and the strange likeness which phantasmes (oft countenanced by
casualties and events) strongly work in the opinion and conceit. For as the
machinations of spirits are certainly oft inserted into the actions of men;
Historia.
so by the iuglings of the imaginary, are so lively framed resemblances and
counterfeits of them oft times, that they can hardly be distinguished. That it
may therefore the better first appear what fancy and imagination are able to
do, I will not here omit an history worth good ear: Anno 1607. a Parsons wife
of Northhamptonshire, dwelling within three miles of the town, came unto a
Physician, complaining of a tumor in one of her breasts. He demanded her among
many other things concerning the Sciatica, which he Narrata ab aegrotante
praeter totius plethora lassitudo partium omniu inferiorum cu mensium
retentione, coxarum grauitate in motu, torpore dum quiesceret, paratum affectu
monstrabant. Ideo neque praedixisse difficile, neque re ipsa affectum subsequi
miraculi loco haberi debet.
conjectured to vex her. She denied any acquaintance or notion thereof in all
her former life. The same night (being returned home) suddenly about midnight
the Sciatica seized painfully and grievously upon her. Some few days after, it
happened another of her neighbours came also unto the same Physician, whom
(beside the disease which she her self made known) he guessed to be troubled
with the Praeter plethoram tum infra tum supra diaphragma conspicuam, tumor
venarum molestus circa crura in poplitibus, de quo conquesta est aegra, de
spasmo distentione illarum partium facilem inde dant coniecturam. Vbi igitur
aegrae imprudentia praesatur causam, facilis est prudentia probabilem post fari
effectum.
cramp, and cursorily questioned her thereof. She never before sensibly
knowing any such pain, after her return also that night suffered thereby
exceeding torment. These two accidents compared together by the first party,
(the one in her self, and the other in her neighbour) and the apprehension
being whet by her exceeding pain continued, caused in her a strong and
resolute opinion of bewitching, which she presently unremoveably imputed unto
the Physician. Her outcries and impatience through her pain, made such
forcible impression in her husband, that to satisfy his wives unreasonable
importunacy, he was contented to come unto the Physician from her to
expostulate. He, before he could utter his message, blushing at the folly, and
yet desirous to satisfy his wives injunction, because she would not otherwise
give him rest, at length related unto him the cause of his coming, desiring him
for his sake (being much ashamed thereof) to conceal the folly of his wife.
This done, he returned home, and found his wife nothing better, but assuring
her self and him, that if he would but once more come unto the Physician, and
(as I conjecture) gain him to forgive her, she should presently be well.
Accordingly the next day he came unto him, and (then concealing the reason and
cause of his coming) desired him to forgive and pardon his wife. This easily
granted (as such a toy) he presently demanded the hour of the day, which
instantly the clock gave two, being afternoon. He hastened homeward, and
before he could speak unto his wife, she joyously entertained him, and with
prevention told him that she was perfectly well, and that just at She was
assured late the night before of the Physicians being at home that same day;
she knew the length of the way, her husbands vsuali pace, and n^w direct sp^ed.
She might easily compare the time of his going forth, with a competent time for
his attaining the Physician, and with all these might well hope of the
Physicians facility by his friendly entertainment the day before. From hence
her imagination satisfying itself with the confidence thereof, she might
thereby, settling and quieting her spirits, mind and humours, for a time thus
appease and mitigate her pains. As for her so true and just conjecture at the
time which was two of the clock, the circumstances before mentioned, and
likelihood it self did guide her to suppose it. If this reason satisfy not,
religion and reasons give leave farther to suspect, that the devil to advance
error and illusion, might convey into her imagination an inward and secret
sense of the time. The power that the devil doth exercise in this kind, might
be made clear by many examples.
two of the clock her pain left her, which she (it seemed) imagined (as it
also happened) to have been the same time and moment that the Physician had given
her desired pardon. The next morning her husband did write unto him,
discovering with this news the reason of his last coming unto him the day
before, together with this strange event following it. Within half a year
after, she fell sick again, and After the penning of this history, the cause
and manner of her death by her neighbours of worth and credit, was thus
reported. Her husband, at her earnest suit, consulted with a wandering Surgeon,
whom fame, it seems, had magnified for charmed and potent cures of such as
were bewitched. The Surgeon delivered a medicine unto the husband, promising a
miraculous cure thereby, and charged him withal, by no means to be feared,
though happily there might fall out some strange and fearful operations unto the
seeming. The medicine with this stile coming unto the patient, was gladly
received; and after she had received it into her body, she died. The glorious
name of the medicine, together with a confidence that this was only the
strange operation of the medicine foretold by the Surgeon, caused the friends
about her still to expect some admirable event of recovery, and therefore they
still gaped after her rprising: but in the end necessity called for a grave:
and thus their hope with her was buried.
died. This strong imagination, with this strange event, might have entangled
many a poor spinster in a thicker string then her cunning could vntwist, to
save the cracking of her neck. But if me wold more duly oft examine and weigh
these cases, they shall many times find the Witch in a foolish sconce; and
greater and more dangerous are the bewitchings of a mans own folly, and more
effectual oft times unto his own hurt and others, then any witch, yea or
devil whatsoever. Without doubt chance may flatter and countenance the
imagination with unwonted, yea and justly wondered events, and yet is that no
demonstration of ought about nature or reason. Casualty doth so apt oft times
consequences unto dreams, as if there were some secret power or influence in
them proceeding unto such effects, yet is it no proof of truth or trust in
them. Women oft times out of their Aelianus lib. 4. scribit Aspasiam concubinam
Cyri posterioris admonitam fuisse in somno de medicamento quo sanauit vitium
oris, quod venustatem prius valde deformauerat.
sleeps have foreseen and foretold many things, which according to time and
place have justly come to pass, but this doth make their dreams no oracles.
Many vain me out of the presage of their own minds, have confidently made
prediction of such things as have assuredly happened, yet is this no inducement
to take them for prophets. In like manner some that have possessed themselves
with witchcraft, and the opinion thereof, have seemed to know things above
their knowledge, and that knowledge above and beyond all reason hath been true:
yet neither is this any dispossession of themselves of this spirit of folly,
nor no just proof or accusation of any one to be a witch. I cannot therefore
take it for an ingenuous course, upon such grounds to draw simple people unto
confusion. It is an easy matter for any impression to work it self into the
imagination of a vain mind. And why may it not seem as easy for the devil
who is the author of lying Hinc illa (...) diabolica.
wonders, to credit it with wonderful events above the weak eye of our
reason? Therefore ineptly and injuriously may the illusion of fancy, and the
practise of the devil therewith joined, be made snares for the innocent, whose
destruction is his intention who rejoices in the perdition of mankind. Neither
can I believe (I speak it with reverence unto graver judgements) that the

coming of men or women to the burning of bewitched cattle, or to the burning
of the dung or urine of such as are bewitched, or floating of bodies above the
water, or the like, are any trial of a witch. I see no reason why I may not
think, that the devil by the permission of God, hath power indifferently to
work these effects upon any man, whether a witch or no. For if he had power
for his own malicious purpose upon the body of our blessed Saviour, to
transport it through the air, and to set it upon a pinnacle of the temple; and
upon the body of righteous Iob, with hope and desire of his overthrow: by what
prerogative dare any other man whatsoever presume to free himself from his
power, but by a special grace and mercy of God? Or why is it any imputation
unto any man to be known to be subject thereto, since God doth permit it in
diverse his dear Data est Diabolo potestas non modo vt fallat malos, sed vt

sufficient evidence to convince him a witch, Diabolus imperium exercet in

commission, which his malice will easily extend beyond the latitude: as by
right observation of many learned in their own experiences hath ben^ and may be
oft truly noted. I do not deny nor patronage witches or witchcraft, but wish
that the proofs and trial thereof may be more carefully and with better
circumspection viewed and considered: that rash determination beguile not the
wise, nor condemn the innocent, upon whom the devil can with more nimbleness
and agility transfer his own evil works, then either they can avoid it,
or others easily epsy it. Every thing whereof every man cannot give a
reason, is not therefore a miracle. There are many things whereof few Soli viri

practise and custom working desperateness into facility. Thus with common
wonder have some walked and danced voon cords. Some are written to have leaped
and danced upon the edges of sharp swords without hurt unto themselves, with
pleasure unto the beholders. Some have credibly been supposed to devour
daggers and other sharpe and dangerous weapons. That naturally the loadstone
draws iron the meanest know: the reason or cause the wisest never knew. There
are wonders in nature, wonders above nature; these are subtilties, the other
miracles. That fire and air, contrary to their own A forma vniuersali

moment pass so large a distance through the air, from a small flash of a
little flame: these and such like are subtilties, because the cause and reason
thereof doth unfold it self to few, or not to all, yet unto the learned. That
the Sun should stand still in the firmament, the Moon be eclipsed in no
interposition, the bodies of men should fly in the air, or walk upon the
face of the water; these and the like are miracles, because hereof is neither
power nor reason in nature. And as in the former to be easily drawn to

ignorance, so in the latter to enquire natural causes in Frustra de

vain flashes of seeming wonders lightly moved to deny or call into question

the power and force of nature. With therefore the common amazed thoughts of
vulgar people, to be blasted by the stupidity of every idle fear, to gape
after witchcraft, or to make nature a devil or a bugbear, must needs be base
procliuitie and unlearned lightness. To admit also nothing above or beside
nature, no witchcraft, no association with devils at all, is no less madness
of the opposite and extreme. But those whom true learning and wisdom hath
well instructed, know how to stay themselves, and to consist in a temperate
mediocrity between both these. The actions of the devil are discovered by
the proper notes and difference. First they are ever Hoc a diuinitatis
excellentia separat. omnis enim potestas supra naturam est vel diuina vel
diabolica, haec voique semper bona, illa nusquam non mala.
evil, either in themselves or in their end. Secondly, they are above Quorum

the power and course of nature and reason. This appears manifestly in his
violent carriage of so many herds of swine headlong into the sea, mentioned in
the Gospel: in his bringing fire from above so suddenly to devour so many
thousands of Iobs sheep. These, with other such like, carry in their mischief
and hurt the stamp of such an author, and in the transcendent Daemoniaci

and supernatural power thereof, the testimony of a spirit. This is plain,
and by these notes men may learn to distinguish between an imaginary and a
real devilish practise. Now the doubt remains, how we may in these works
and practises of the devil, detect the conversation and commerce of men. I do
not conceive how any marks in the flesh or body of any one, may be any trial
or manifest proof: for besides the grant, that Many and strange have been the
forms of diverse excrescencies, or growings in the flesh through all parts
almost of the body, whose nature, form and cause are well known unto the
Physician, though to his eye oft times strange and wondered. Scaliger in his
book of Subtilties, mentions a Waterman, known unto himself, who had a
horne growing upon his back. The like have others since and before known and
written. Some men have been borne with parts proper unto the other sex, and
women with parts or resemblances of parts naturally given to the malekind
alone. The errors of nature in monstrous births, are not obscure, and feed
variety of wonder; nor are nor can be tied from the counterfeit of any shape,
likeness, mark or figure, sometimes superfluously cast upon one part,
sometimes upon another.
likeness may deceive, who can assure me that the devil may not as easily,
secretly and insensibly mark the flesh of men as their souls unto
destruction? If the devil may mark them without their knowledge and consent,
shall his malice be their offence? or how shall I be assured he cannot so do?
He that can do the greater, can do the less. He that could give unto the Son
of God a view of all the kingdoms of the world in one instant (which was no
doubt a special strain of his utmost spiritual cunning, considering he was
then to deal with wisdom it self) can that cunning find no means to make
a small scarre, impress or tumor in flesh? Who dare presume to say, God will
not suffer him? Who ever so far entered into the counsel of God, or measured
what therein he doth permit? If no holy writ, no reason manifest it, proud and
blasphemously daring is observation in so infinite and unmeasurable a subject.
I deny not that the devil by covenant may suck the bodies and blood of
witches, in witness of their homage unto him; but I deny any mark (of never
so true likeness or perfect similitude) sufficient condemnation unto any man;
and beside and above all other notes or marks whatsoever, judge it chiefly and
principally and first to be required, that both the devils The devils property
is known by actions, deeds or works first found sustained by a supernatural
power, and next bent unto an evil end. Thus for devilish ends have Witches
and sorcerers been known to ride upon the seas in vessels incapable of such
carriage, or of any defence. Thus have some haunted men and other creatures, in
manners, means and circumstances more then any way reasonable or possible unto
humanity or the nature of man alone. Thus have some also declared the secret
words and actions of men, then absent in far distant places, and foretold
particular things to come. These with their devilish affection, end, and
intention are certain proofs of diabolical power and witchraft.
property therein, also the parties Consent and cooperation may be manifested
first by proof of any incantation, invocation, spells, and other performances
of other diabolical rites and ceremonies: secondly by their use of such
instruments as are usual or proper unto such devilish works Of this kind are
pictures of wax or other matter, by which they secretly work wasting and
consuming pains unto the living persons of those dead resemblances. Of this
kind are also charmed kno^s, characters and figures. Of this kind also are
diverse sorts of poisonsome matters, by them known to be solemnly sought, and
carefully hidden or kept. These found or detected, are certain conuictions of
witches and witchcraft, joined with other due presumptions and circumstances,
and a manifest detection of the assistance of any tra^ scendent force.
consent thereto may be justly and truly euicted, which is oft too lightly
weighed. It may be with good reason judged, that the devil doth not blush to
be both bold and cunning, there to set his mark, yea and make his claim where
he hath no interest. But when the devil doth appear in works and signs
proper to himself, and therewith shall be evident either directly or by good
consequent the act of any man consenting or cooperating, there law may justly
take hold to censure; and there also the former presumptions and marks (denied
sufficiency while alone and single) may now concurring be admitted and
allowed. I speak not this in contradiction of other learned judgements, but
retaining the liberty of mine own, and leaving the like equanimity to every
one. Nor do I deny or defend devilish practises of men or women, but desire
only to moderate the general madness of this age, which ascribeth unto
witchcraft whatsoever falls out unknown or strange unto a vulgar sense.
Concerning diseases therefore, it will not here also be impertinent or
unprofitable to deliver many their strange seeming forms from the too
ordinary injurious imputation in this kind. It is manifest and apparent, that
the mixture and implication of diverse and differing diseases in the same
subject, may and do oft bring forth a wild and confused concourse of accidents
seeming therefore of monstrous and wondered shapes, and therefore in their
deceiving appearance coming very near unto the similitude of bewitching. But
because every eye is not able in so various a chaos to Quip vbi nec causas

analyse and reduce them unto their several heads, and proper diseases, (so
intricately confounded one within another) it is not therefore sufficient for
reputing them as things without causes in nature. Many diseases single, alone

strange forms united, and in their mixture one with another, must needs arise

mind is as strangely transported into admirable visions and miraculous
apparitions, as the body is metamorphosed into the former strange shapes. In

usually think themselves to see things Historia Theophili, Medici aegrotantis

with their fingers they hunt for flocks and flies, and with narrow eyes pry

waters when none are near: some from fire, and likewise from many other
supposed fears, in their vanity infinite, as in their present and sudden
appearance unto the beholder full of amazement. How can these like accidents,
or any of them even single and alone in their several peculiar shapes apart,
but seem wondered? Much more when diverse of them, most or many of them, as it
sometimes falls out, are confusedly together so compounded, that at once in
the sick, a man may see a part of one and a part of another, a show of many,
and a perfect shape of none; must they needs not only affright a common
beholder, but sometimes also exercise the better judgements. I saw hereof in
the year 1608. a rare example, which both for illustration of that which hath
been said, and the instruction of other that may hereafter hap to behold the
like, and especially for the contentment of many eye witnesses (both worthy and
desirous therein to be satisfied) I may not omit. A gentleman of ancient name
and sear in Warwickshire, in the time of the late memorable long frost, called
me unto his daughter afflicted in an unknown and strange sudden manner, both
unto her parents, friends, neighbours, and also some Beneficed Physicians.
Physicians therein consulted. A vehement shaking and violent casting forward
of her head, every day in a much marvelled fashion surprised her about three or
four of the clock each afternoon, and so usually continued until the
twelfth hour of the night: every such shaking or casting of her head, ending
with a loud and shrill inarticulate sound of these two syllables, ipha, ipha.
After my first sight, I discovered these before wondered motives to be nothing
else but sneesings and sternutations, which in all men have their different and
(...), Sonat sternutatio quia per angustum illi est ex itus. Hippocrat. Aph. 7.

diverse noises, and in her were more then ordinarily violent. To confirm and
settle this judgment, I gave both by writing and speech prediction of a
sequel, either of the falling sickness Ingens sternutatio affinitatem habet

or some other spice or species of conuulsion, so grounding upon the continual
violence and vehemence of the sternutation, and the great oppression of the
brain, together with some obscure contractions of some parts already begun,
though happily of others vnobserued. In the mean season before my departure at
that time in few days the grieuousnesse, length, and frequence of the former
fits was much mitigated and grew more easy, and so continued the space of a
fortnight after my return from thence. This time last mentioned expired,
suddenly the parents again sent for me: from them I learned that their
daughter after diverse tortures of her mouth and face, with staring and rolling
of her eyes, scrawling and tumbling upon the ground, grating and gnashing her
teeth, was now newly fallen into Epilepsiam sequitur plerunque grauis sopor.

shape and image of death, without all sense or motion: her pulse or breathing
only witnessing a remainder of life. With these fits (oft in the mean season
first frequenting) at length she again Compositus enim morbus videtur, ex

above her head, together with a general starknesse stiffness of al these
parts, she spent many days in this manner, both day and night iterating these
fits, and each several fit continuing the space sometimes of half an hour,
sometimes a quarter of an hour. While these fits at any time discontinued, she
either slept, or (at least all her outward senses slumbering) her imagination

took no care, nor was thereby moved, except only when thereby happily they
intercepted or interposed her feeling and the imagined object, whereof she was

diligence by some quick medicines solicited nature to a better remembrance of
her self, at length upon a sharpe provocation she immediately answered our

and good means (for so they proved themselves ever by the immediate sequel of
good unto them) we at length obtained the continuance of all her senses. Her

same manner, befell a gentlewoman then lying at Cotesbrooke in Northamptonshire,

long. In this mean season I imparted unto her parents my doubt of a hard
condition, namely a palsy or maim in some part likely to be annexed unto her
recovery, if she survived her conuulsiue fits which still remained as before
mentioned. Between hope and this fear we continued endeavour, and in the end
by the infinite goodness of God, her fits before mentioned (namely of gaping and
carrying her arms distent above her head) with the rest decreased, now
discontinuing all day, only four or five short fits every night when she
first lay down in bed continued, and with the decrease of the former vehemence
and fearful continual frequence of the said fits, succeeded (as was before
feared) a palsy, which possessed both her legs with a senseless deadness, and
a general stupidity of one side of her body, being the ordinary
terminations of an Apoplexy, and therefore foredoubted. After she had continued
in this hopeful forwardness the space of two months or thereabout, she was
then commended unto the Bath, with my report and description of her former
passed accidents unto her Physician there, where after much and long fear and
doubt, she began at length to yield better hope, finding by little and little

summer passed. It hath been and is still a great doubt and question, not only
among the common and vulgar sort, but diverse also learned, whether this
gentlewoman (in manner aforesaid afflicted) shall justly be ranked among those
upon whom (by the permission of God) devils and witches have had a power, or
whom nature and the course of natural diseases have thus in manner aforesaid
afflicted. My own judgment must needs incline unto the latter, for that I
could behold in the gentlewoman nothing (most continually conversing with her)
which either my eyes had not before showed me in others, or perfect notion from
reading both ancient writings and later neotericall descriptions, had not
before made the same Qui vniuersale cognoscit quoquo pacto cognoscit

unto my understanding, which they then presented themselves unto my sight. The
first is in part testified in the margin of the page 59. 60. and 64. The
second, any man may witness true who can compare the report of all the fits
and accidents which befell this gentlewoman (which as truly and nearly as I
could, and I suppose fully, by the testimony of any that saw her, I have
related) with the several shapes of some diseases before mentioned, pages 59.
60. 61. 62. which are truly set down according to the common consent of most
writers. The mixture of diverse of them one with another, must needs make some
difference in them from themselves, where they are each alone and several: but
he that with that just allowance of that odds only, can consider the
particular accidents in the special example, with the true notion of the
diseases before it generally described, must needs grant them to be the same in
kind and nature. It may farther persuade, that my self with reason from the
known custom and nature of such diseases, gave both by speech and writing,
prediction of the conuulsion which after followed, and also of the termination
of her Saepius enim deprehendebatur repentino lapsu aut depriuatione omnis

Apoplecticke accessions in the lameness and palsy of some parts, which also
came to pass, and cannot now be denied testimony of many. It makes yet
farther against the opinion of witchcraft, that such medicines as were
ministered unto her, in reason good for her, according to that reason and
expectation for the most part ever profited, sometimes immediately with their
use reducing her understanding before lost, sometime recovering her speech when
she had diverse weeks together before continued speechless, and by little and
little evermore repairing continually some decays, notwithstanding many and
diverse relapses; which both her parents themselves, and the servants, and all
that ministered unto her, must needs unto God and truth with thanks
acknowledge. It farther confirms the negative of witchcraft, and is not the
least, that while the opinion thereof most hotly possessed most hearers and
beholders, the parents of the gentlewoman at no time in the height of their
daughters affliction, or a good space after, could resolve upon whom with any
just show of reason to cast the suspicion of bewitching, as they oft avouched
unto me both then and since. The most certain and chief proofs Vide Wierum

Demonic. Ioann. Hucheru Bellouacum de Maleficijs. Ioan. Baptistam Codronchium

of witchcraft devilish practises upon the sick, among the learned esteemed
are generally reputed three: First, a true and judicious manifestation in the
sick of some real power, act or deed, in, above and beyond reason and
natural cause. Secondly, annihilation and frustration of wholesome and proper
remedies, with discretion and art administered, without any just reason or cause
thereof. Thirdly, ought either in the knowledge or speech of the diseased,
discovering a ravishment, possession or obsession of their minds or spirits by
any infernal inspiration. Hence the sick oft speak strange languages

unto themselves unknown, and prophecy things to come, above humane
capacity. To the first doth satisfy the former manifest reference of all
accidents befalling the gentlewoman mentioned, unto the prevalence and power of
diseases before related. The second is negatively answered by plain
testimonies. Of the third and last was never mention, nor question, nor reason
of either. There can nothing be required more unto ample satisfaction: and as I
therein rest and stay my self, so I doubt not the consent and content of all
that affect truth and embrace reason. I will notwithstanding for the better
exercising and stirring up of diligence, circumspection and vigilance,
generally in this so hard and deceivable point of witchcraft, and also for
their sakes, whose weakness may as yet be incapable of satisfaction in the
former particular, answer some objections therein made. The forenamed
conuulsiue fits, of lifting up her hands above her head, Object.
which were the last remaining fits, toward their decay and latter end, never
came unto her but only when prepared at the night for bed, and unclothed into
her night-weeds, she began to yield and decline her body to lie down. In that
instant, each night without failing, ever and never before began her fits. When
she at any time lay her self down to rest upon her bed in her clothes
(whether by day or night) her fits notwithstanding appeared not. Some have
imagined some conjuration or witchcraft upon or in her nightcloths or sheets;
but to them that seek reason, I suppose it found. The power of voluntary
motion, which is the animal faculty, and the disease it self both possessing
the same parts, namely the sinews and muscles, while the disease was in his
vigour and strength in the beginning, it therefore mastered the faculty and
moving power, and continually ruled, so that the fits then never almost ceased
by day or night. Now in the declination and weakness of the dissease, and
toward the end, the faculty grew strong, restrained and commanded over the
disease, whereby all the day there appeared no fits at all. But when the moving
power or faculty composed it self to a true and general cessation and rest,
then in that instant the disease took his advantage and liberty to stir.
Object.
But why was it not thus also when she slept in her clothes? The sense and
encumbrance of the day-habite is ever an hinderance of perfect sleeps.
Therefore to them that sleep in their clothes, or upon their beds, commonly
there is not so true a ligation of their senses, neither are their sleeps so
sound, nor of the like continuance. While therefore she lay or composed her
self to rest in her clothes, the sense thereof both interrupted the faculty
from the true and sound disposing it self to rest, and also thereby put it in
mind of the disease which had so lately sharply visited it, with tart
remembrance; and the disease being now too weak to resist or to provoke the
faculty, could not upon that imperfect advantage stir, until by a more
sound and true dispose to rest and sleep, the spirits and natural heate more
truly retiring inward, had more perfectly left the outward parts, and thereby
the disease there still remaining might have more liberty and power to stir,
which notwithstanding also soon after of the own accord desisted, because it
wanted the former strength to maintain continuance. Object.
That which breeds other doubts, is that at such time when she wanted all her
senses, and altogether seemed senseless of any object offered unto her, or of
it self occurring, yet had she a curious feeling of such things as her mind
and liking sought or seemed to hunt after. This is no wonder to them that know
where the imagination intently and earnestly works, it there gives sense to
those Primum sensorium omniu sensuum commune est. Galen de sympt. differ.
parts it exercises, though all other parts be stupefied or asleep. This is
oft seen in many who in their dreams walk, talk, and do seriously many
works, distinguishing and feeling those things whereabout the fancy occupies
them, of other objects, though happily more near hand and of quicker
remembrance, taking no notice at all. The disease or accident which most oft
and frequently possessed this gentlewoman, was a kind of Apoplexiam, carve,
catalepsin altos sopores nominat omnes. Galen lib 13 de Meth. Med vt aliis,
Lethargum etia inter sopores recenset sed cum febre incidente propter humoris
putredinem. Object.
heave sleep, in degree only exceeding the ordinary resolution and ligation
of the senses by sleep, and therefore the same reason may indifferently serve
both. It is farther objected, that the gentlewoman oft pointed, sometime this
way, sometime that, as seeing the appearance of a woman of such and such form
and colours, which also according unto her manner of imperfect speech, she after
described, as some say. It is not unusual with the sick oft to imagine
indifferently, as well things inconsiderate and Sicut in somnis decipimur
insomnijs, ita vigilantes in aegritudinibus, (...), c. Arist. de insomnijs.
incomposed as truths, and therefore are their imaginations of no Egregie hac
in re satisfacit Theophili Medici aegrotantis historia, memorata a Galeno lib.
de sympt. different.
validity without better proof or reason, which I think before sufficiently
satisfied. And in this gentlewoman (having her head, where her disease had so
manifestly deeply seated it self, therefore so mightily oppressed) it was more
easy for any faculitie therein to mistake and err, then to conceive aright.
And therefore though it might happily manifestly appear (which may be and is
ordinarily rather the abusiue impression of some indiscreet The mention of her
supposed sight of the witch, came after the return of all her senses, and when
only the conuulsions of her arms and face were remaining accidets Object.
whispering about the sick) that she of her self primarily and without
suggestion conceived the form or shape of a witch, yet is that no sound proof
or clearing of the question of witchcraft in general, nor any reasonable
evidence against one particular, since the trials of truth are not sterred by
imaginations. It is lastly objected, that certain witches lately dying for
sorcery, have confessed themselves to have bewitched this gentlewoman. I grant
the voluntary and uncompelled, or duly and truly euicted confession of a witch,
to be sufficient condemnation of her self, and therefore justly hath the law
laid their blood upon their own heads, but their confession I cannot conceive
sufficient euiction of the witchcraft it self. It is known evidently unto men
learned, that the subtle serpent and deceiver the devil doth usually beguile,
delude and deceive those that trust in him by his juggling collusions,
persuading oft times those actions and events to be his gratification of their
malicious affections, which are indeed the very works of nature, and oft times
the rare effects only of hidden causes in nature. A witches confession
therefore being only grounded upon his credit, information and suggestion,
whose nature, custom and property is and ever hath been to lie and deceive,
is a mean, poor and uncertain proof of witchcraft, though a just
condemnation unto the witch, her self being proved an associate with the
devil in any sort. Her death therefore doth satisfy the law for her offence,
but is no sound information of the judgment of the witchcraft. Thus according
to that whereof my self could take notice in this gentlewoman (if more full
information of others observations in those things that by my self were not
seen or noted, fail me not) I have truly and fully described every material
accident and circumstance; and to all the known or conceived likely doubts and
difficulties therein have carefully and directly answered, and therein also
have (I suppose) satisfied the ingenuous and reasonable with brevity at full.
Now to conclude the former explication of the question of witchcraft in
general, I entreat the Reader to call unto mind the formerly mentioned fears
and doubts of witchcraft, which unknown accidents and diseases easily impose
upon minds herein unacquainted and not discerning their cause and reason, and
in them farther for future good to consider the possible contingence of many
more of like nature and sort in other the like cases elsewhere happening, and
here unmentioned. In both and with both let also be recalculate and cast the
strange and sly suggestions of the fancy and imagination, sometimes
countenanced by admired casual events and chances, sometimes applauded by
ignorant credulity, and sometimes advanced by superstition in all and every of
these still with the vulgar sort, advantaging the same error and opinion of
witchcraft. I have so much the rather thus far laboured, for that ordinarily
herein I see truth and judgment too much perverted, the diseased their health
and life thereby neglected, and many times simple idiots and fools oppressed,
whose weakness doth oft seem guilty, because ever unable to defend it self.
Every one in these cases is not fit or competent arbiter: it requires the
learned, and not learned in word and superficial seeming, but indeed truly
judicious and wise, whom ever to preconsult in these occasions is only safe,
is right, expedient, and ever necessary.

CHAP. IX.
Wisards.
THe mentione of witchcraft doth now occasion the remembrance in the next place
of a sort of practitioners, Wisards.
whom our custom and country doth call wisemen and wisewomen, reputed a kind
of good honest harmless witches or wisards, who by good words, by hallowed
herbs and salves, and other superstitious ceremonies promise to allay and
calm devils, practises of other witches, and the forces of many diseases. But
these being of the same nature with those before mentioned to use spells, and as
they before, so these now sometimes only superstitiously vain, sometimes
devilishly assisted, I will refer these unto them, and only dismiss them
both with a short history. Anno 1602. a poor boy of Pychley in
Northamptonshire, was suddenly surprised with a vehement conuulsion, drawing
his head and heals violently Nam in auersam partem aegrotantis reclinationem

backward, and in that sort carrying his whole body into a roundness, tumbling
up and down with much pain and inward groaning. The parents of the child posed

witchcraft, sent for a wisewoman, her wisdom came unto them. At the same
time it fortuned my self to be in the town with a patient of mine, a worthy
and virtuous Lady there inhabiting, who moved me to see the bewitched child,
and upon the motion together with her Preacher then living in her house, I went
unto the place where the child lay. There among other standing silent and
unknown, I beheld the fits, heard also the wisewoman wisely discoursing, and
among other things of the like nature, declaring unto the copany, that the
lungs of the child were as white as An possit oculos tantum contendere Lynceus?
her kercher. With this and some other such like kercher learning, I Doleba
mehercule quod pugillares stilum non haberem qui tam bellas fabellas
pernotarem.
silenty departed. When I was returned unto my patient, I there professed my
opinion concerning the manner and nature of conuulsions with their several
causes, amongst the rest not omitting the strange accidents which did oft fall
out in such diseases by worms. Not long after, when the cunning of the wisard
was now grown without profit, stale and forsaken, the child avoided a great
and long worm, and immediately after recovered without other help or means,
and so hath continued ever since. Thus the serpent beguiled the woman, and the
woman beguiled (though not Adam) many foolish sons of Adam. At length a poor
worm gave them demonstration of their ridiculous folly. Such teachers are
fittest for such schollers, whose gross ignorance is ever so far in love
with it own prejudicate conceit, that though they were brayed in a mortar,
yet cannot this love be beaten out of them for any love of truth or reason. I
did not therefore trouble them with my patience to instruct them, nor they
molest me with their impatience to hear.

Servants of Physicians. Ministering helpers.

up for themselves, presuming it good rhetoric (because an old figure) to
take a part for the whole. Thus seeing too much honesty would not suffer them
to rob their teachers of a more sufficient portion of general methode and art,
they think it sufficient to be able to supply the same particular means with
the like desire and goodwill. But apish imitation and resembling show can never
express the life of reason in her native use. Although therefore sometimes
some of this sort, by subtlety, a good wit, officious diligence, and thereby
pleasing fortunatenesse, do angle a good report and estimation, and thereby
catch many simple Parua leues capiunt animos
people (who hoodwinkt with good opinion discern not the bait) yet doth their
commonly observed daring those things which they know they know not, and their
ordinary raising themselves by the ladder of boasting, manifestly detect, both
their cloaked defect, and their choked guilt. For what expectation can be of
them who for the most part build their whole worth upon the meanest proof of
another sufficiency, and all the skill which they are able to expend, is but
that little which another without envy or jealousy could spare? Timely and well
grown perfection is never to be attained either by service or bare
observation. It is necessary that man be in himself a master of knowledge and
of sincere judgment, that shall be able truly to make right use of another
experience. Experience therefore alone, and the benefit of a Physicians service
or admission unto the view of practise, without the benefit of sufficient
general theory and learning going before, can in it self be no true
benefit. It is reason and knowledge that doth guide men wise unto La ars

do set the cart to draw the horses, and every one that goes unto plough,
knows they either never went to school, or begin their lesson at the wrong
end. By this preposterous defect therefore, and therein want of knowledge to
foresce the likely issues of their actions, since these Emperickes themselves
know not, not truly foresee what they endeavour or do, how shall others that
trust them know what thereby they shall suffer? Provident foresight is far

assuredly, that sufficiency is never found in the utmost observation or
Empericall tradition, but in a settled and itself confirming knowledge and
understanding. Neither can this true knowledge be duly or competently attained,

THE SECOND BOOK.
CHAP. I.
The Methodian learned deceiver or heretic Physician.
THus far have been remembered the ignorant practitiones that infost this age.
Now it follows we come unto another erronions kind of such as have a name and
portion among the learned: such are they that have a taste of good arts and
science, but are not truly earned, nor have sincerely drawn the natural and
lively sap of true science and understanding. Of this kind among the Ancients,
were reputed those they termed Quales Proclus, Antipater, Dionysius, Thessalus,

method, but a compedium or a method of their own making; or else because they
arrogated this name unto themselves in the best sense, as only in their own
supposal meriting the title of true Art and Method. These had their peculiar
and proper errors in those times in which they lived, then especially noted;
but we will make bold more generally under this name to comprehend all who
carry a name and visar of learning, but are not able to express the power
thereof, either by their distinct and truly digested understanding, or by right
performance in action and practise according thereunto. These men, any man may
note to be of three sorts: First, such as may commonly be observed to bear
natural defects and impediments within themselves: secondly, such as want time
in nature or their studies: thirdly, such as have spent most part of their life
otherwise distracted, and have not had entire employment in their callings. The
first rank nature her self doth note unto every one by their imperfect parts
stamped and expressed in their daily conversation. Such are they who argue in
themselves want of wit, of common capacity, of ordinary government: or are
disposed to lunacies, to inordinate affections and customs in the continual
course and practise of their life. The second are youths, young men, and all

manners, with all such as derive their knowledge no further then grammar
schools, or in Universities have made short stay and too sudden departure.
Both these are easily diseouered, and therefore cannot so usually deceive, or
else can but deceive such as deserve no better. The third, are all such aside
fraud their callings of their whose endeavour, and divide themselves between two
professions. Their neutrality in both doth prove their nullitie in either.
Perfection in any faculty requires more then a Qui si quid homo sit seias

the phrase, the language and sentences of wisdom, but want the (...). Alia est

soul, the substance and the sense. Hence it comes to pass, that tongues
overflow with aphorisms, maxims, and rules of ancient truth, but for the most
part confusedly, not rightly distinguished, mistaken or supposed. Neither cau
excellence in one faculty give prerogative in another. Therefore those that
are perfect and absolved artists in their own faculty, and will impair their
dignity by engaging it in another, (where neither their time nor proof can
equal it) let wise men cuatelously and with suspicion admit their counsel or
trust their practise. I sometime knew a learned Divine, batchelar in that
faculty, Historiae.
a great clerk, of much reading and study therein, whose busy and ambitious
brain not contenting it self within so infinite an ocean of sufficient sacred
and sweet employment, would needs break out into other bounds, and from some
borrowed hours and time for study in physic, grew to affect therein more
then a common name and understanding. In the end his pride and conceit of his
knowledge transported him so far, that among other ridiculous paradoxes, he
both in schools and common profession defended an indifferency in the
natures, qualities and use of Stibium and Ratsbane: to conclude, his confidence
herein so far bewitched him that he made trial thereof in himself, and as a
just execution upon himself, was the same day poisoned. Another of my
knowledge and acquaintance, a man in the Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Chaldey, and
other languages much studied, and in the judgment and theory of Divinity of
approved worthiness and understanding, having therein bestowed the best part
of his time, suddenly interchanged with an unadvised course of practise in
Physic; he spent some time in travel beyond the sea, and returned again
thence dignified; but his former studies were so well and soundly foresetled,
that they admitted not so true and right after-setling of the second. Hence as
his brain overflowed with inconstant propositions, and his tongue with
paradoxes, his actions also thereto suited. In the end he made upon himself an
experiment of the force of Opium in a more then ordinary dose, and so composing
himself unto a desired sleep, never returned to view the issue of his
experiment, but descending into the grave, left this memory behind him. If any
man wonder at these grand lapses in men learned, let him stay and satisfy his
doubt with admiration of the multitude of sects in all ages, swarming with
gross errors and opinions, even amongst the learned of all faculties and
professions. This undoubtedly grows from no other ground but want of entire
understanding of those things men study and read, through imperfect and
distracted employment of their minds, seriously and wholly required unto any
measure of perfection. Therefore Galen in his learned treatise of the method of
right cure (as also in other places) doth oft times witness, that where sects
and sectaries abound, there is infallibly mistaking and unsound apprehension of
truth, and therefore lamely, defectiuely, and in part attained, because Prim^

so only sought. If any man require a more special proof or trial hereof,
let him with me here cull and examine any few Aphorisms of Hippocrates, and in
them (though commonly and orderly read and avouched by every mouth) ye shall he
find how easy and ordinary it is for any man in any one to be inconsiderately
deceived and mistaken, if he do not with all possible diligence, indistracted

ends labour after it. For example, in his sixth book of aphorisms and 52.
aphorism, Hippocrates doth nominate a mortal sign in the diseased, the
appearance of the white of the eye in sleep, and sleeping with unclosed eyes.
In many diseased, this oft is found untrue, but with Hippocrates understanding
it is never Vide Galenu in praedictum Aphoris. Brasauolum in vtrosque.
false. He that simply and verbally only understands, and without meditated
differences and exceptions, or makes not more narrow search, shall hardly
truly find the certain and true limitation of this truth. For if this manner of
sleeping fall out from any outward cause, or besides reason or cause thereof in
the inward disposition, it is not simply or altogether bad, much less mortal.
For where the sick are thus accustomed to sleep in health, or so sleep by
reason of fumes and vapors ascending unto the head, and thence distilling into
the eye-lids, and so hindering their right closure, (as it is oft seen in
great drinkers) or where it proceeds only from worms in children, and the
like, the incautelous and superficial understanding is readily deceived. In
like manner the 51. aphorism of the same book doth promise by the coming of a
fever thereto, the profligation of the apoplexy. But this is not true,
confusedly interpreted, and therefore beyond the first view requires further
studious inquisition to find out the quantity Oportet febrem neque leuiorem
esse qua quae morbi materiam discutiat, neque grauiorem quam aegri virtus
ferat. Holler. tract. de Apoplex. Galen. in dictu Aphoris.
of the fever, with the degree of the apoplexy. Great wounds and cuts of the
head (saith the 50. aphorism of the same book) procure and incur feauers:

times that feauers may differently in swiftness or slowness of their coming
take, nor understands the causes slackening or quickening the feauers speed,
may easily too hastily before just time accuse the truth hereof. The 3.
aphorism of the fifth book threatens danger in conuulsions upon great issues
and losses of blood; but in what quantity thou shalt esteem them Magnus ille

pounds at once from the nose may be called much or great. The first aphorism
of the fifth book, doth pronounce the conuulsion procured in assumption of
Hellebore mortal. It is notwithstanding seen, that conuulsions so raised,
cease again without death or other danger. To understand therefore aright, we

periclitation, or with what conditions, more certain information doth ask
further search. The 40. aphorism of the second book, threatens unto old men
surprised with mur^hes and distillations, the end of their disease with the end
of their days. But unto perfect conceiving, is further requisite the
consideration of the degrees of old men, in whom is apparent either age alone

with age, which is a decay and wearing of nature together with years.
Infinite might we be in these and the like, every trivial and vulgarly
received rule requiring a more circumspect and considerate understanding, then
the first view or light reading doth offer or present. It is a common well
known and commendable caution, to suspect phlebotomy in children unto the
foureteenth year, and in old men after fifty or sixty years. But with what
restraints and limitations these rules are to be bounded, fully and truly to
conceive, besides their hearing or reading is required a view and review of
differing reason and expositio, diligent and careful scrutiny, oft comparing
and conferring odds and differences of circumstances. None truly learned will
or can be so inconsiderate or rash to take blood from age, whose veins are
exhaust or spent, blood dried up, or from infancy crop the first hopeful
sprouting or spring thereof; yet with deserved fame and honour to themselves,
and incomparable benefit unto the sick, have right learned worthy and
excellent Physicians used and prescribed phlebotomy both under five Auenzoar

out reconciliation to these doubts, and confirmation to more perfect
knowledge, which serious labour must buy, study continually attend, and thence
time gain, free from other impertinent implication. The common want hereof
suffers so many unprofitable questions amongst the the learned, maintains
contentions and pride of words, multitude of sects and schismes from truth: and
while men at other leisure, for other shifts, ends, and supplies, and not for
the own worthiness, or for it self seek knowledge, they commonly lose the
true end, and therefore true perfection. The innumerable dissentions amongst the
learned concerning the Arabic and Chymicke remedies at this day infinitely,
with opposite and contradictorie writings, and invectives, burden the whole
world. Some learned Physicians and writers extol and magnify them as of
incomparable use and divine efficacy. Some with execration accuse and curse
them as damned and hellish poisons. Some because they find not these remedies
in the common vulgar readings of the Ancients (the famous and learned Grecians)
with fear and horror endure their very mention, far therein unlike and
differing from that ingenuous spirit of the thrice worthy and renowned
Pergamene Claudius Galen, who in brightness of understanding, sharpness of
apprehension, and invention ouershining al the precedent wits that were before
him, yet did he with humble and daigning desire search entertain from any sort
of Versatus su i^notui celeberrimis in una quaque secta praeceptionibus pa^i

people, yea from the most unlearned Empiric himself, any their particular
remedies or medicines, which after by his purer and more eminent judgment, and
clearer light of understanding, refining, he reduced to more proper worth, and
thereby gave admired presidents of their wondered ods in his learned
prescription and accommodation. Some contrarily contemning the learning and
knowledge of the Grecian, and with horrid superstition, deifying an absolute
sufficiency in Chymicke remedies, reject the care or respect of discreet and
prudent dispensation. A third and more commendable sort differs from both
these, and leaving in the one his learned morosity and disdainful impatience
of different hearing, and in the other his ignorant and perverse Hermetical
monopoly, with impartial and ingenuous desire free from sectarie affectation,
doth from both draw whatsoever may in either seem good or profitable unto
health or physic use: from the Grecian deriving the sound ancient truth, from
both Greek, Chymicke, or Arabian, borrowing with thankful diligence any
helpful good to needful use. Antiquity hath given us our first Maiores

contemn none, and to view all, is the rarest growth, but truest perfection.
And thus by the examples before for many innumerable more, it is manifest that
men learned, knowing and reading much, may notwithstanding either through
distraction or negligence be esteemed and found in complete perfect and
distinct knowing, ignorant and vnwotting. And as their understandings are hence
corrupted and depraved, so necessarily by consequent must their actions be
answerable thereto, since thence derived, bad principles ever producing bad
practise. This is not obscure nor dainty in many common practisers of imperfect
knowledge, to be daily instanced almost every where, whereby that man whose
own judgment cannot give him dispensation to swerve and differ sometimes from
the common understanding, use, and custom of vulgar practise, shall oft times
dangerously err. In above 40. years being, I have now twenty years been an
understanding observer and partaker of diverse and different medicinal
practise, and therein have oft noted how that which sometime hath opposed common
received rule, in the peculiar proof of some other learned, hath given good
occasion of new disquisition of before vnconsidered reason or distinction in
the rule. For a brief taste of many, I will particularize some few. I have
observed in some kind of Palsies blood taken fro the paralytike side, when all
other means have proved vain, to have been the sole present successful
remedy, yea beyond all hope hath oft rescued the latest hope out of the jaws
of death. This much experience doth testify, yet is it contrary unto received
ancient edict. In like manner in some diseased plethoricall bodies, I have
observed and seen, that their general numnesse, Torpor leuis quaedam
Paralysis. Galen. de Sympt. causis.
torpor and stupidity raised in them from the distention, compression and
obstruction of their full vessels, hath immediately on the same side that was
let blood, found present and sensible delivery from those accidents with great
lightsomnesse and alleuiation, the opposite side still continuing in the former
manner oppressed and grieved, until the same remedy of phlebotomy hath been
thereto likewise applied. In common stoppages of the womb I have oft seen when
the usual bleeding in the foot hath nothing at all profited, but in vain
wearied the parts thereby fruitlessly vexed, that the incision of a vein in the
arm hath immediately opened the stoppage, and the former current hath freely
streamed. In some kind of dropsies, cachexiaes, or green sicknesses. I have
observed that letting blood by excellent fruit and benefit, hath proved the
successful remedy, above, beyond, and after all remedies. These things are
witnessed by many worthy testimonies, and yet are generally esteemed violations
of rule. I will not here dispute the causes and reasons of these things, nor
disquire how judgment did guide unto these trials, nor how necessarily or
probably the effects and consequent followed, or cohered with the judgment. I
will leave it indifferent unto every one learned, and unto right perpension in
just occasion of due consideration hereof. I give not these instances (as rash
supposal may imagine) to encourage Empericall boldness, unto common imitation
hereof, nor do hereby allow (as some not distinguishing may imagine)
bloud-thirstie phlebotomy to suck men's lives in rash trial hereof* but to prove
and manifest how necessary it is for a judicious and orthodox Physician,
diligently and prudently in his faculty exercised according to art, to retain
and enjoy a reserved power and warranted sufficiency within himself, to vary
and differ sometimes from too strict superstitious imitation of a common rule
and received custom. And from this worth and virtue hath it come to pass,
that many learned famous men, in their several ages have left so many worthy
additamets unto knowledge and the common good, by their own special proofs
trials of rules, in their peculiar practise oft different from vulgar conceit,
use and custom; unto whom may not be denied beyond the ordinary bounds, a
liberty and dispensation contained within the latitude of safe discretion and
art. And thus briefly both by the use of common distracted reading, and thence
indigested understanding, and also by the former particular proofs of easy
deception in acception of common rules, and lastly by examples of practise, it
is manifested that men otherwise, and in other respects, esteemed justly
learned, may inconsiderately easily err, when distractedly deuidedly they
employ their thoughts and cogitations, or want that sole or solide possession
of their whole minds and meditations by their own proper faculties and
functions. This is the reason, that though comparably to these times no age
hath ever afforded writings more prodigally obvious, nor show of knowledge
with greater affluence, yet in Authors never hath been either less true
meaning, or less right understanding. Hence as seeming understanding did never
more abound, so never was it of worse report, the goose Capit insanabile

sincere judgment, seldom vndazedly, or without winking, fixed upon the
perfect brightness and purity of serene and clearly distinguisht truth. And
thus much touching those that are of best proficience and most learned note in
divided studies and callings, distraction necessarily leaving a remissness and
neglect in many things both of mind and action. As for those that are of mean
literature in their own professions, their intrusion in others, and desperate
esteem and quality in their own, must needs preach their insufficiency in
the latter by their mediocrity in the first.

CHAP. II.
Of beneficed Practisers.
THE grand and most common offenders in those kinds before remembered, and in
these days, are diverse Astrologers, but especially Ecclesiastical persons,
Vicars and Parsons, who now overflow this kingdom with this alienation of
their own proper offices and duties, and usurpation of others, making their
holy calling a linsey wolsey, too narrow for their minds, and therefore making
themselves room in others affairs, under pretence of love and mercy.
Besides, their profane intrusion into inhibited lists, their unlimited breach
of law, and want of reverence and respect of order and distinction of callings,
(which true Divinity doth teach holy men) reason and experience do daily
witness, that by the necessary coincidence oft times of both callings
requiring them at the same moment in distant places, without conscience they
impose upon themselves a necessary neglect of both by an unnecessary Elige quid
velis, qu^ enim pudor omnia velle? Martial.
assumption of the one. This the poor patients necessity and need must oft
complain, though happily more seldom observed: and therefore of few is that
which herein is lamentable, at all lamented. Many times many poor people (and
sometimes men of better worth) in their necessities, and oft last extremities,
through this voluntary ouermeasure of employment in these enlarged spirits,
are not only deferred, procrastinated and neglected, but oft times even to
death illuded. For from report and information by others unto the Physician,
and from the indication by urine (which are borrowed, and therefore slippery
grounds) many diseases conceal themselves: oft for want of the presence of the
Physicians own view, the chiefest opportunity and hopeful hour steal away
unespied, and death makes many blind, because they had not their Physicians
eyes. In these difficulties therefore (wherein consist the greatest uses and
benefits of a Physician) these men by their double and both-hand employment,
compel themselves commonly to a double cruelty, either for the most part to
deny their presence, or else not to perform the promise of their presence,
being ever subject to a countermand, by their voluntary subjection to a
double command. If therefore they would consider the shortness of their lives,
with the immensity of their own task, they would not allow so large a
vacancie to succisiue hours and works, which now for the most part are most
part of their time unto the great hurt and injury of others, and the increase
of scandal unto their Persona namque venustat studium dum suo insistit
officio, nec praeripit alienum.
own vocations. I know the learned and reverend Divine is herein for the most
part free, or if some few be justly taxed, their modest minds will easily
moderate and reduce them; and for the rest, whose dispositions are shameless
and incorrigible, that may happily still become the fool, which is a reproach
unto the wise, and Nam quod turpe bonis Seio Titioque decebit, Crispinum.
befit the dishonest that defames the just. I do not dislike the devout and
charitable deeds of their holy minds, nor real compassion and contribution
unto the sick and needy, nor yet their medicinal advice with incorrupt hands
free from implication of private gain, and vnobserued and concealed
merchandising in charitable deeds; but I abhor and wish repented (which in
many of them is abominable and sacrilegious) their pecuniary traffic and
trading by usurped erecting in their houses Apothecary shops by manumission of
base wares that are not allowed, nor have obtained freedom elsewhere, whereby
unlawfully they exenterate and eat out the bowels of poor men's purses.
Neither is it any way to be justified, that they ordinarily travel up down to
spoil the more worthy of his fee, and the proper laborer of his hire: nor yet
is it less shame, that without shame or blushing their bills in many places
inhabit ordinarily Apothecaries files and shops, as if their own undoubted
right. Their master Saint Paul teaches every man to walk within his 1. Cor.

Polit. 2.
straggling in others: so shall they honour their calling, and their callings
honour them, and both honour God that sent them. I know the gift of healing in
the Apostles was the gift of God his grace and special favour and allowance
unto them for those times; but it was in them a miraculous and diuin^ power
conse^rated unto an holy end: but in these times it is an acquired faculty,
and in these men unto a mercenary use. It is indeed a deed of mercy to save
and help the sick, and a work of charity to advise them for their health
ease: but the common good and public weal, the law for both doth inhibite
the doing of every good by every man, and doth limit and restrain it unto some
special and select sort of men, for necessary causes, and respects unto good
government and policy, and for avoiding confusion, which is the ruin of
public weals. Shall then Divinity teach and allow for private deeds, ends
and respects of charity and mercy, to break Fuit haec sapientia quonda,
Publica priuatis praeponere, sacra prophanis. Sic honour nomen diuinis vatibus,
atque Carminibus venit. Horat.
public edicts, to transgress laws, to contemn magistracy, to confound
and disturb good order? Good order forbids, that for pretence of any
necessity whatsoever, cause or reason, one man presume to break into another
bounds, yea and Divinity teaches the same. God himself ties men in all
things, in all necessities, unto certain and appointed ends. He ordained a
select number of Apostles and Disciples, and unto them only annexed the divine
work and calling of nations and people unto salvation, commanding all men upon
pain of damnation to seek out and follow that means wheresoever or howsoever
distant, and did not ordain the means confusedly in every person to wait
upon every private necessity. In like manner in a commonweal, laws and
policy ordain (preferring the common good before every Omne publicum comodum
habet aliquid ex iniquo: quod in singulos peccatur, vtilitate publica
rependitur. Tacitus.
private ease and benefit) that every man have his distinct calling, unto
which all other men's necessity therein may and ought to repair. For if every
man might be of every calling, confusion of callings would in the end leave no
calling. Therefore every mans need or necessity is not sufficient to make every
one capable of giving supply needful thereto, but God, and nature, and law
have tied and allotted men to seek means, and those means confirmed to
certain set bounds and limits, that men may still in all things according to
the law of mortality, be ever in this life subject unto casualties, oft for
their trial, sometime for their punishment, or else for a further decree and
secret purpose of the Divine providence, so and to such ends thus ordering.
Thus by clear truth ouershining the mists clouds of false pretexts to the
contrary, it is manifest, that this fluctuation of these men between two
callings is offensive to God, scandalous unto religion and good men, and
injurious unto commonweales, and but presumption borrowing the face of
Divinity. What encouragement their example hath given unto drones and idle
persons, abounding by their example infinitely in the same wrong, he hath no
eyes that doth not consider. Their many, ordinary, rash, ignorant and
unskilful errors and commissions against the health and life of many, besides
their forenamed omissions, intrusions, procrastinations, and neglects of one
calling by another, I could by many too true instances confirm, but for
reverence of the callings I spare the men. I will only give two known
instances, wherein (as in a glass) men may view the diverse faces of many more
of the like sort. Historia.
A gentleman in Bedfordshire not long since was suddenly surprised by a
continual fever, accompanied with a general lassitude and weariness of the
whole body, and together with heate and burning, delirations and lightness of
brain. The habit of his body and his flesh were musculous and well liking,
the season warm, his age firm, and constitution sanguin^, his pulse high,
full, large, and in the vehemence and strength of motion manifest even unto the
beholders eye. A Parson or Vicar coming unto him, makes many fears and
seeming-graue discourses of the danger and imminence of a In la morbi,

Marasme, and from this supposed grand peril stoutly withstands the needful
use of due phlebotomy. The allies and friends of the patient observing the
daily decrease of hope and health, diligently enquire after another Physician,
and by hap found me where then employed. When I came unto the patient, the
Parson entertains us with confident discourses and disputes concerning a
Marasme, whom when I found after long patience and calm conference in the
presence and hearing of diverse worthy knights and gentlemen still endlessly and

contradiction, I in the end with their common consents contemned and rejected

phlebotomy, and manifestly saw the danger of the delay thereof, (both which
may appear by the description of his estate) and therefore seeing the
indication so plain, and the necessity so urgent, contrary to the babbling
opposition and caus^esse predication of needless danger, I caused him to
bleed; whereupon within few hours after, besides immediate alleuiation, nature

enabled to perform her Crisis, being before detained by the oppression of the
former quantity of blood, whereunto her strength was not equal. The life of
man unto God and men is dear precious, yet behold how presumptuously glorious
ignorance, and the lawless breach of the due lists of distinct and proper
callings, doth licentiously hazard the utmost price and date thereof. And how
likely may it seem, that the memory of this wrong had been in the same grave
buried, if it had not been prevented, and by the prevention solely observed. I
will now annexe another example of secret bewitching flattery by close
whispering of the sick, ordinarily practised by these kind of men, unto the
vnobserued and stolen perdition of many. Anno 1611. a gentleman in this manner
falls sick. He was suddenly surprised by a continual fever, with burning,
thirst, troublesome heate in the soles of the feet, and palms of the hands,
frequent delirations and perturbations of the mind, fullness of the stomach,
loathing, painful distentions and ructuations, dryness and yeallownesse of
the tongue, bitterness and heate of the mouth, pains about the short ribs,
loins, back and shoulders, ill sleeps confused dreams. There entertained
these accidents the usual fullness of his body unto the common outward view,
accompanied a pulse swift, vehement and large, an urine high coloured, red, and
thick: al which many witnesses of understanding confirm. According unto the
former indication, the patient was twice let Maxima remedia continuarum febrium

Parson-Physition led by a secret ambition of stealing the praise of such a
cure, (if fortune might happily favour the patient with ease, and himself
therein with the opinion of the merit (as was very likely) in this hope taking
opportunity of the patients impatience, he whispers unto him the
excellencies of Aurum potabile, far beyond all other remedies. After the
patient had from him received it, within short time good hap gave ease. Ease
being gained, begets in the patient an ever after incorrigible consultation
with his own sense, and now measuring his good by his ease, and settling in his
thoughts an assurance of his recourie, he studiously and continually defames
his Physician, and with evil clamours fills all corners of the country, as
far as his agents, his own tongue or credit could extend. In this interim
likewise he reiects the former begun methode of discreet euacuations and
alterations of the offensive humours of his body, and in steed thereof he
cherishes and cheareth up himself with daily magnifying and worshipping Aurum
potabile as the God and sole author of his supposed recovery. In this mean
season and intermission of former courses, the forward signs of fair
concoction, so hopefully before appearing diverse days together, now retire and
vanish, and painful swellings fall into Sic lib. 11. Galen. de Meth* Medendi,

his legs and nether parts: and then compelled he sends for other learned
Physicians, but uses them by uncertain fits, as his own conceit induced, and
with a reservation of his sole happiness and best security in Aurum potabile.
To conclude, he escaped the present perils of the former sharpe accidents, but

August next following. About that time he first began to find some
reasonable satisfaction in ease, and the recovery of some better strength, but
a secret remainder or impression of the former delirations continued, and some
suspicious signs of a Scorbut seemed to increase, which before likewise did
obscurely show. Beside the shameful wrong unto Physicians and patients, and
the injury of Arts and truth it self, in men that are professors of divine
and holy callings, behold the usual insidiation of Death and Danger, by the
spirit of flattering intrusion and secret lenocination of false hopes and ease
possessing the distraction of the distressed sick. What man learned and
judicious cannot determine, whether this dangerous long continuance of this
Gentleman's disease may not justly and in good reason be ascribed unto the
sudden Si integre, si plene, si perfect Natura iudicat, nihil noui moliatur

promised and intended? Or unto who doth it not appear palpably gross, that
Aurum potabile can contain in it self any such golden sufficiency, as soly to
remove or prevent all the former accidents in this gentleman described, which
God, and nature, and reason have ever denied unto any one particular or
special medicine whatsoever? Let al men then unto whom God hath given ears or
eyes, advisedly behold and consider how dangerous and injurious these ordinary
and ignorant intrusions in reason prove unto poor patients, who thus beguiled
with opinion, and blinded with deceitful hope, or ^ase, or sense, joyously oft
give thanks for their own hurt, magnify the authors, and not seldom perish
in the praise of their own harms. The unlimited expatiation of so foul wrongs,
do challenge all men, not only the learned, but all honest or ingenuous, unto
the vendication of art and truth from oppression by so gross and harmfull
ignorance. These examples are sufficient to admonish the offenders of their
impieti^, and others of their own peril in trusting unto them.

CHAP. III.
Of Astrologers, Ephemerides-masters.
NOw concerning Astrologers-practisers: Astrologi, (...).
There is a sort of men, who beside and beyond that is sufficient and
profitable unto Physic, use in Astronomical science, (having unadvisedly,
prodigally or vnrecouerably spent too much pains and time in the too curious
or superstitious, or supposed excellence in the vanities of Astrology, or else
finding by their other defects in themselves the want and insufficiency of
knowledge more proper and essential unto a Physician) do therefore (which now
is all the hopeful remainder of their time so far spent) fish for a name and
fame amongst the common and easy deceived vulgars, with the glorious baits of
prodigious precepts. Thus they hook simple credulity to worship and admire
their lying revelations, prescribe fortunes and fates, and limit the days and
dates of men's lives and deaths unto the dark points of their Kaledars. Neither
do they blush to promise and profess that they take counsel of heaven (when
heave Vide Isai. cap. 47. verse. 13. Stent saluent te Augures coeli qui

denies them) thereby gaining to themselves glory in the slander of heaven
and the scandal of truth. Thus usually they pervert the right use of
Astronomical science unto deceit, imposture, and juggling merchandising for
unjust and injurious gain, and persuade the voluntary motions and arbitrary
actions of men, their consequences and issues to be driven by the heavens unto
ends and destinies there enrolled, and themselves (as if the only true sons of
heaven forsooth) there only admitted to read and view. Indeed the will of man
hath not power in it self to will or move it self to any good pleasing unto
God, or saving to it self, but by the special grace of God, drawing, guiding,
or moving his will thereto, yet doth the general concordant consent of most
Divines grant as vncontrouersed, a liberty and freedom of mans will unto any

purpose therein. This all men, Divinity, Philosophie, reason, experience,
with an unity of consent confirm. If then a mans action be his own, if the
end his own, the effectual prosecution thereof unto the end his own; if God
himself have granted this privilege unto all men, as indifferent and common
unto all whom he hath created under the condition of men, what creature shall
intercept the Post Adamae lapsum (inquit Caluinus) supernaturalia dona in

endowment of the Creator? what shall take the honour of this gift from him
that gave it, or the right thereof from him that thence receives it? The
heavens cannot so blaspheme their Maker, though men thus dare belie the heuens
to justify their own impiety. All things depend upon the providence of God,
and from him and by him are ordained second causes, which indeed in nature have
their necessity, but in the will of man have a power only to move or incline,
and not to force. This is the reason, that though man by his stars be borne
to infinite miseries, diversely moving and affecting him continually, from the
earth, from the sea, from the land, from the air, from the fire, from his own
affections, infirmities, diseases, from diverse haps and casualties; yet unto
him that knows the free gift of his Maker, and the good that he hath done for
him, none of all these things by any necessity in themselves thereto, can touch

come near him. For whether calamity approach from above or below, from
maligne constellation, or other inferior or terrestrial encumbrances, man by
his spirit of understanding, by prudence and circumspect providence, hath a
large immunity, whereby he may and oft doth avoid these violences, and delude
their forces. The wise man (saith Salomon) foreseeth the plague, and hides
himself, neither can any evil befall the wise, which he may not and doth not,
either being to come by provident foresight prevent, or present by careful
industry allay, or past by diligence redeem, no influence or destiny being
able to bring mans will and endeavour to an higher point then wisdom and
goodness. This is the reason that common calamities befall not all men alike,
yea rather to every one unlike. This is also the reason that many borne under
the same constellation, have different fortunes from each other, and far
unlike their like constellation: nay it is oft seen, and cannot be denied,
that many men by their own industry have contradicted their stars, whereby
unfortunately marked in their nativities, they have triumphed over the heavens
in the felicity of their own wisdom and virtue. Of this sort have been not
only one Socrates and the great Philosophers, but many common men Socratically

come short of their destiny. For although the heavens do work by their
hidden power and influence, secret impressions, procliuities and inclinations,
as in all things under heaven, so in the constitutions and tempers of men in
their generation, conception and birth: yet are their effectual productions

do or not to do, to like or dislike, to do that he will, to refuse that he

God or men be just ordained against wilful (...) Non contingit quempiam ea

offenders: but God is just, and laws are righteous, and therefore men's actions
are their own, moved from an inward power and essence peculiar unto
themselves, and from an end and intention which is their own. Touching those
therefore that from the heavens promise to tell fortunes, to cast figures, to
turn Ephemerids for nativities, for good haps, for ill haps, successes,
losses, fortunate, unfortunate events, he that hath but common sense and
reason, and can think but worthily of himself, may Calliditas neque comprensa

easily discover their falsehood, imposture, deceit and cousenage, howsoever
sometimes events may countenance; for hoodwinked hap may sometimes light upon
truth, and craft working upon credulity, may make any truth of any falsehood.
Thus far briefly concerning the powers of the heavens over the minds and
wills of men, their voluntary actions, their consequences and issues. Now
concerning their virtue over the bodies and humours of the sick and diseased:
No man can deny the heavens as general Sunt enim superiora formae
conseruatrices inferiorum, quia causa causarum tuetur ea quae fecit. Scalig. de
Subtle.
and superior causes to have power over all things created under heaven, by
whose influence and radiation all things increase, grow, live, and are
conserved, and by whose recess all things morn, wither, fall and droop.
This doth witness the summer and the winter, all other seasons, which the
heavens by their motion varying, bring unto all things vicissitudes, changes,
and alterations, and by their secret influence imperceptibly distill different
and contrary inclinations, tempers, and affections. Hence winter, summer,
spring, and autumn, breed their peculiar diseases. Evil and maligne
constellations beget plagues, pestilences, and other epidemiall contagions,
which the air as the great mother of all things breathing doth fruitfully
conceive, and plentifully bring forth. Unto what sight or sense hath ever been
unknown, either the pride or splendour of the Sun, mounting in his glorious
altitude, or his eclipsed force and light somnesse opposed and abased? Who is
ignorant of the monthly metamorphosis of the Moon? What thing is or can be
insensible of the Cynosure, and the nipping frosts? Is not the glory of the
heavens over all, and are not his forces in all? Notwithstanding general
causes produce not particular effects, and the heavens are but general Pendent

vniuocam effection^m communionem. Scalig. de Subt.
causes, second causes, outward causes, remote causes, mediate causes, unto
those things which immediately fall out in the bodies of men from inward causes
contained within themselves, and therefore soly having by their inseparate
nearenesse an inevitable and vnauoided necessity in themselves. The inward
causes of diseases are the humours of the body, which can never be separated
from the body, because in them consists the life and being of the body.
Therefore when either they corrupted fro their kind, or offending in quality
or quantity, raise diseases in the body, how or by what means can the body
choose but be therewith affected, except it could leave it self? From any
outward cause which is without, and of another divided and separate nature,
separation doth free from immediate necessity or consecution. Since then the
heavens are outward causes, and removed causes, therefore never necessarily or
simply of themselves affect, and the inward causes of diseases stick nearer,
and so closely touch in their effects, that they suffer no interposition, it is
manifest, that the heavens have no certain or absolute h power in the
diseased, Communes causae communes habent effectus, nec vires aut actiones
particularium flectunt simpliciter aut primario. Causas vero immediatas
necessario sequuntur effectus.
nor can match or equal the immediate force appropriate only unto the
disease. The heavens indeed do oft and much also preuaile in raising, allaying,
increasing, diminishing, enraging and calming the inward causes, but ever by a
proportion, either with the temper and constitution of the sick, or the
humours of their bodies, whether originally bred, or after by time acquired.
Saturne is therefore said a great Lord over melancholy bodies, in like manner
the Moon over phlegmaticke, Iupiter and the Sun in sanguine, Mars in
choleric, (whether in their several revolutions apart, or their coniunctions
and combinations) and according to the greater or less proportion of their
peculiar humours in the body, and the dispositions of the particular parts of
the body, they more or less exercise their rule. Therefore also according as
means more or less accrue to lessen or increase their proportion: so more or
less manifestly are their effects and operations weakened or quickened. If the
wise Physician foreseeing the evil approach of a maligne and Saturnine aspect,
by discreet prevention abate and withdraw the melancholy humour from the body,
Saturne shall thereby want a part of his Causae efficientis opus augetur eius
aucta substantia. Gal. in aph. 5. lib. 6. Hipp.
proportion, and as the greater abundance thereof doth necessarily more advance
and promote his efficacy, so the exiguitie there of must needs abridge and
obscure it. The like may be said of all other aspects in their several
destined and appropriate humours. For the constellation of it self simply
Astra vim non necessitatem inferunt. Ptolomaeus.
cannot effect anything, nor can build or ruin any being, which first hath not
the seminary and prime foundation thereof in it self, both as his subject and
his means. And this is the true cause, that the body either by Physic reduced
to just temper in it self, or to an equal contemper of all the humours, or of
it self strong and healthful, in the most different constellations doth
commonly find indifference of alteration. And this is the reason that many in
the most Saturnine and deadly constellations live, as the contrary also cause
that many in the most fair and Jovial die. From this vncontrouersed ground,
Astronomers generally themselves advise and prescribe means, both to prevent
the harms of influences to come, and also to redress them present, and give
unto the Physicians hand powers and remedies to command, countermand, delay,
allay, and abolish. And from this reason P^olomy himself, the Prince and
father of Astrology, in unfortunate aspects doth advise to consult the prudent
Physician, and by his counsel and help to decline the maligne constellation.
For right remedies rightly administered unto the diseases and their inward
causes, by the decree of God and Nature necessarily oppugn, allay, prevent and
expel diseases, and therefore are not prescribed unto outward Externis causis
nihil praescribitur, summa tamen diligentia perquirendae praecognoscendae^ue
sunt vt deducant in interiorum cognitionem Gal. de Meth. Med.
causes, but only unto the inward. And although the outward cause happily first
raised or impo^ed the disease, yet in the cure is not that cause so much
respected, but his effect (which is the disease it self) or the inward causes
by which, and through which, the outward had admission to their effects. If the
inward causes (the antecedent and the immediate) be removed, it is a miracle,
and a thing supernatural, that there should remain his Cum efficientibus
causis necesse est accidentia tolli Gal. in aph. 22. lib. 2.

effect therein not follow him. Thus corrupt and hot constitutions of the
air, and constellations from the heaven, breed pestilent and hot diseases in
the body, and the diseases still remain* when the constitutions or
constellations are changed; but when the pestilent hot humours, and
dispositions within the body, which are inward causes, are thoroughly removed,
there can no such effects continue, be farther fed, or maintained. The outward
cause may also be continually present, yet particular subjects or bodies, feel

participate no effect: but if the inward cause grow in quantity or quality
unto the excess, it is impossible it should not in the same moment produce the
like sensible effect. For example, in some heavenly coniunctions or
combinations there may arise an hydropicall constellation, though many
particulars be nothing therewith affected, or thereto thereby inclined; but if
hydropical humours or causes abound within the body, it is impossible they
should there be without not only the imminence, but present cosecutio of the
dropsy. By these examples it is not obscure, that the heavens are a foreign
invasion, and therefore more easily admit Causa nulla sieve aetherea, sieve
syderalis, ^ne patientis aptitudine agete potest. Galen de di^. Febr. 1.

present. Where there is an vnproportioned congruity or susceptibilitie in the
body and humours with the heavenly inclination, there the heavens have no edge.
Where the disease hath once taken possession in the body, the necessity of his
effect is absolute and Causas immediatas necessario sequuntur effectus. Ideoque

shadows of true Astronomy. An example here of may not impertinently for
better illustration be here proposed. A gentleman of Northampotonshire diseased
by an immedicable ulcer of the reins, was moved by his friends (after my
despair of his recovery signified privately unto them) to call the advice of a
famous Ephemerides-master, who coming unto him, and not knowing (and therefore
not considering his disease) from the counsel table of his Ephemerids
pronounced, that if the patient survived 3. or 4. days (which we must suppose
were of an il aspect) until the next ensuing Tuesday (which was, it seems, a
fairer influence) he made no doubt of his recovery and life. But he survived
three months or thereabout, and in the interim neither did the aforesaid ill
disposed stars any apparent hurt, nor the well disposed any eminent good: but
after the forenamed three months, the stars brake promise, the disease kept
touch, the gentleman Astrologi dum coeli scrutantur plagas, quod ante pedes
est, nemo eorum spectat. Cicero.
died. The reason in the disease was manifest: without a new creation or
generation, a part in it self radically, and in the whole substance perished,
can never be restored. The disease therefore could not lie, nor all the heavens
could perform either a new generation (because the patient could not again
enter into his mothers womb) nor a new creation (because the world could not
again return into the old chaos.) How vainly then did here the Astrologer
gape and gaze after uncertain stars, when the true knowledge of the disease,
the cause and nature thereof (wherein consists an infallible ground)
manifested the certain issue? How foolishly and ignorantly (or shamelessly and
impudently) did Astrological simple folly or intolerable imposture, either
cunningly and wittingly seem to look aloft for that which lay near hand
below, or simply stumble over so plain truth, and tumble into so ridiculous
and gross error? And thus it is apparent, both how vncertaintly Astrologers

Of Coniectors by urine.
AS the heavens themselves are not free from the insinuation of imposture and
deceit (thus cunningly doth evil wind it self into the likeness shape of
goodness: (...):
) so is nothing almost under the heaven created, which is not made an
instrument, a visar and ba^d unto adulterate seeming, lying and cousenage. The
air, the fire, the waters, the foul, the fish, and infinite other Hinc (...),
c.
creatures, yea their definite and single Hinc Extispicia (...), Magia (...),

parts apart, are all made prodigious enchantments* and snares of ignorant
minds, begetting faith unto falsehood, and trust and credit unto untruth. As Art
upon true and proved grounds doth promise according to good reason fair
likelihood, so imposture upon wondered and unknown conclusions professes
assurance in falsehood, and certainty in impossibility; which while wise men
contemn, credulous fools admire and follow. Amongst many other, the
inspection of the urine is in this kind too commonly most palpably abused by
many that carry the name and badge of learning. It is a common practise in
these days, by a colourable derivation of supposed cunning from the urine, to
foretell casualties, and the ordinary events of life, conceptions of women
with child, and definite distinctions of the male and female in the womb;
which while impudence doth gloriously set forth, the common simplicity doth
worship and reuere. It is unknown to none learned, that the urine is truly of
it self and properly Vrina primo per se vere proprie antecedentes morbo rum

indication of no other immediate dispositions, but such as are of the veins
and liver, the blood and humours; the antecedent causes of diseases, and the
natural faculty giving only Coniunctas morborum causas extra venas, affectus

common and antecedent causes of all diseases. Erroneously therefore the common
sort imagine, that in the urine is contained the ample understanding of all
things necessary to inform a Physician, and from thence common expectation
doth generally deceive it self in the proof of a Physician by his judgment
of the urine. Unto the satisfaction of a Physicians knowledge, are many ways
and helps besides the urine, as material, and in many cases of more special
moment, necessity and use. In the pulse are properly and soly apparent
manifold medications, which in the urine Lynceus himself could never see. This
is the cause that many even unto the last moment of a languishing life,
continue in their urine not only no shadow of danger, but fair and flattering
forms of lying safely, the pulse Prognostica quibus praeuidemus fitne

particular parts have their peculiar Omnes quae nutriuntur particulae

recrements into the urine, and thereby confound the true judgment of any of
them therein; or thereby priuatiuely, when either by stoppages (which diversely
happen in the tortuous windings and turnings between the liver and the veins,
and conduits thence descending unto the reins and bladder) the substance,
colour and contents of the urine are Hoc indicatur in (...), in valida renum

intention of nature within. When therefore the urine descends in his own
substance, quantity, quality and contents, without impediment or hinderance,
it is a certain, proper and true demonstration of the true affects of the
liver, veins, the second concoction, and of the diseases of those parts which
in his descent it washes, and gives unto the wise Physician an uninterrupted
certain judgment of it self, as when it descends in borrowed In aegris
saepe transmittitur aliena materia ad vrinas tum critice tum symptomatice, in
sanis per proportionem correspondet bibitis assumptis vrina. Actuar. lib. 1. de

liquor and colours, it reports rather his rubs and interception by the way.
Hence the learned Physician, either by the first immediately instructs
himself to a direct opposition unto the discovered disease; or by the other,
finding the impediment that hindered the right understanding and discovery, he
thereby informs himself to remove that impediment, or else finding it
thereby vndiscouerable, searches it by another disquisition or inuestigation,
by another way or method, until he have attained the right end of a true
Physician, which is the prudent rescue of the distressed life and health, and
not the false trump of his own undeserved praise, promoting unworthiness to
gain lucre. Thus he neither deceives himself with vain expectation, nor
others with lying profession, but diversely in both makes a prudent and good
use of both, according to the indication, whether certain and vndeceiuing, or
doubting ambiguous. And as the ends are diverse, of those that view the urine to
conjure up wonders, and those that esteem the urine to detect the disease for
the good of the diseased: so are their understandings differing, the one truly

directed by reason and judgment, the other by nimbleness of cousenage and
circumvention of simplicity and ignorance; whereof the chief use is not the
benefit of the sick, but the colour of fraud and commodity by deceit. Touching
the oracles of Fortune pretended in the urine, and their floating favours in so
low an ebb, those that too commonly in their own experience find good drink
to steal their wit out of their brain, may happily imagine it thence descended
into the urine. I leave them there to seek it, that want it so much, and
deserve it so little. The mention is unworthy mention. Concerning the looking
of unborn babes in an vrinarie glass, and the making of old fools in love
with their own reflection: to unmask the common illusion in this kind, I will
briefly point unto the discovery of the folly, whereinto entering their serious
cogitation due recognition, they may more amply after exercise satisfy
themselves, whom their own fatal stupidity doth not detain, or resolute
obstinacy preoccupate. The conceptions of women, together with the accidents
accompanying the same, do necessarily bring forth general alterations unto the
whole body, partly by the consequent stoppages of the body, and partly by
distracting the natural heate and spirits from other parts unto that new
intentio, whereby is added either quantity or quality, or both unto the blood
and humours, and from thence the urine receiving different tincture substance
doth manifestly report the ods. Yet for that this sudden productio of change in
the body issues from conceptio only by accident, thereof being truly and
immediately no cause it self, but an occasion only moving other causes, as
commonly or more commonly moved, both by diverse kind of other obstructios
beside, also by other distractions of the natural heate spirits, by critical
intentions, concoctions, maturations of diseases; therefore is the confused
alteration of the urine found upon conceptio indefinite, can be no special note
of coception. This is also further manifested by the alterations and effects
themselves following conception, which not only in differing bodies, but in
the very same, are seldom the same, but commonly far unlike, yea and oft
contrary at one time from themselves at another. This women themselves in their
own experience must needs witness, seldom observing the changes of bodies
after coception in all alike, oft each in themselves finding the particular
manners of their own alteration far discrepant. This their oft deceit in
themselves, mistaking, and uncertainty in themselves commonly doth testify,
sometimes suspecting themselves with child when they prove diseased, sometimes
doubting diseases being only with child. Since then conception is neither in it
self a sole, nor a separate cause, nor any true immediate cause of the
alterations of the body following thereupon, but only the occasion moving other
causes, and those causes are as indifferently also moved by many other
occasions besides unto the same effects, their generality doth discharge their
propriety in this particular, and the common indication in the urine any
special signification proper unto conception alone. This demonstratiuely
proves the uncertainty of the signs of conception that are common with other
in the urine. Now concerning the small certainty of the signs that are thereto
supposed peculiar: the inward dispositions and affections of inward parts, which
by the outward sense cannot be deprehended, are by three Partem intetiorem
aff^cta ^dicant Actio ^ae^a, Dolor vel ametria in ex^etis aut retenris.

excretions proceeding fromht he party. The third is a distinct feeling or Vbi
dolor ibi morbus.
pain in the part. The proper functions of any part can never be disjoined
from the part, and therefore appear not in the urine. Pain or other sense
feeling are ever unseparable companions with their patient parts, whereof the
urine having no sense, can have no part, and therefore therein also is
vnsignificant. It only then remains, that the affection and conception of
the womb soly doth discover it self by the determinate excretions thereto
peculiar. The peculiar excretios of any part do bring testimony unto the truth
of their indicatio, either by the Quicquid e corpore excernitur vel est toto
genere praeter naturam, vel de substantia partis affectae, vel parti adnatum,
vel coctionis excrementum.
cocomitance of part of the substance of the part, or of part of some substance
either naturally, orby some il disposition adherent to the part, or of the
ordinary recrements of concoctions, or other preparatios, or operations of
nature in the part. Whether excretions in al these kinds proceed fro the womb,
how with what differences distinction, it is not here necessary to determine.
It is sufficient that the proper indicatio of the dispositios of that part must
necessarily be derived from the excretions thereto appropriate: which therefore
proves the urine no right prognosticator of any affection thereof issuing fro
other different vessels. It may be objected, that by the contiguity of the
womb bladder, and the near termination of their extremities, the expulsiue
faculty of the seminary vessels, moving sometimes with the vrinarie, may
thereby mixing their recrements connexe their indications. This is true, yet
not always, but rarely and seldom true, and therefore uncertainly happening doth
doubtfully promise or signify. The expulsiue motios and offices of the
seminary parts are not so ordinary, so frequent, so common, as the vrinarie,
neither doth their rarity in their motion always then meet or consent with
the urine, and sometimes also meeting therewith, it gives notwithstanding
impertinent indication unto the inquisition of conception, other common
Indican^ meses albi grauidarum qui saepe in bonis habentur, rubri etiam qui
saepissime per anastomosin venarum exteriorum ceruicis vteri crurales dicuntur

recrements after conception, no less or rather more descending then those
which are only consequents of conception. And thus is made apparent the
falsehood and deceit of the ordinary profession of the prediction of conception
by the inspection of urine, which also the most Veteres Graeci omnes omnino
praetermiserunt mentionem signorum conceptus in vrina. Mongius Costaeus in
annot in tract. Auicen de vrinis.
ingenuous and judicious writers and authors from their own long proof
experience have ever generally exploded as impious imposture. The true Artist
doth promise nothing beyond that which reason doth demostrate, art habitually
perform: the deceiver by fair pollicitations bewitches simple credulity,
ridiculously to delight in his own wrong and gross collusion. It is very
worthy note and memory, that a great and learned clerk Cornelius Agrippa,
retracting his former wont therein, doth ingenuously confess of his
affectation and circumvention of common admiration by his supposed magic and
Astrological skill, Vrinarum inspectione abuti ad praesentiendum an mulier
conceperit vel non, impostoru est, non medicorum, licet permulti nugas inid
genus cognitionis cautiones scripserint. Ioannes ^ebon. de therap. puerp.
and it doth well fit and settle instruction and satisfaction in this our
particular also, though of another kind I have been ( Ego quoque hanc ar^em a
parentibus puer imbibi, deinde non modicum temporis laboris in ea amisi, c.
Vide reliqua ex authore tractatu de Astrologia. Vide in marg. c. 3. p. 101.
saith he) from my childhood by my parents carefully iustituted in Astrology,
and in riper age and understanding afterwards spent therein no small time. At
length by long and certain proof I found it wholly compound and founded of
mere fictions, and toys of vain imaginations: wearied therefore and grieved
with my time and study so long and so idly spent, I laboured to cast away the
irksome and unpleasing memory thereof out of my mind, and never in my
thoughts to entertain it. Vrinam de impraegnatione nil certi significare omnes
antiqui crediderunt, ideo de hac re nullas notas reliquerunt. Nam cum foetus
sit extra venas de venoso genere tantum indicet vrina, non potest aliquid certo
indicare, nisi adiunctis alijs. Rondeletius de vrinis.
But the violent and forcible importunacy of great and mighty Potentates,
(who usually preuaile to abuse great and worthy wits unto base arts and
offices) again compelled me upon the fame rock, and my own private profit
again enticed me to think it duty and honesty to make profitable use of
wilful folly, and with toys to please these that so much desired toys. The
same Apology for the exercise of vrinarie Praestigiaturae opinionem merito

morbis praedicunt. Gal. lib. 10. de simp. Med. facultat. Historia.
divination, their own consciences unto themselves do make that use it, but
they loath the example, and truth is hateful because incommodious. It was
sometimes my hap to witness the free profession of a dying Physician unto
this point. He inhabited Northampton many years, was in nation Irish, in
manners homely, in learning of me diocrity, but in the auguration by urine of
conceptio was generally reputed excelling, and in a fortunatenesse therein oft
posing some better learned. Three or four days before his death (expected and
known unto himself) while by his own earnest request then (as oft before) I
was present, motion was made unto him that he would commend unto posterity
that skill by which he lived with many so much esteemed and admired. His
answer was free and ingenuous, to this effect: It is unworthy posterity,
unworthy the name of Art. I have long with the felicity of a good opinion
exercised it, and with tried certainty know it uncertainty, and certain
deceit. Simplicity is ever ready unwittingly to betray it self, and it is
easy to him (that is therein much and continually exercised) in common people
palpably to see their simple hearts, in their eyes, in their gesture, in their
countenances, and other circumstances, of themselves vnobserued and
vnconsidered. I have sometime by good hap been fortunate in my predictions by
urine, of conceptions, which because when it sometime happened, it seemed a
wonder; it therefore was ever largely transported many ways, and much busied
and employed common talk. I have proved therein an hundredth fold more often
and more commonly in mine own knowledge Temere, callide, astute dicta
aliquando incidunt in veritatem. sed quae vera dicunt prae caeteris quae
metiuntur non est pa^s millesima. Gellij dictum de Astrologis.
false, yet because to err was no wonder, (and therefore not so much worth
either relating or observing) as also for that it was for the most part but
privately to some sew known, and oft times also the shame of illusion in the
most put the report thereof unto silence, the contradictorie instances still
died unremembered, but fame and opinion survived and prospered. It ever excused
my deceitful custom unto my self, that I deceived none but such as either
desired or deserved it, who by their insidiation of the proof of my skill
either provoked it, or by their unreasonable earnestness extorted it. In this
and other the like, some few days before his death, he thus Vixit qua voluit
viuere part magis.
died unto his former life, and lived unto his soul and saving health. And
thus it is manifested, both by reason and also by the last testimony of dying
experience, how the vrinary divining for prediction of conception, forsaking
the brighter streams and clearer fountains of detecting truth, doth hide it
self in the puddle water, there laying shining baits for dazzled fish. The
more silence, the better fishing; lest therefore I may happily too much prejudice
the pleasing spoil of willing fools, I will think that which hath been
already said unto any other, sufficient intimation, advising honest minds from
the judicious Physician, by the plainest information to draw the Incertam
plerunque dubiam mercede referet qui periclitatione Medicos tanquam vates

CHAP. V.
Of Travellers.
AS from all parts of the world true knowledge doth fetch home his substantial
grounds to enrich it self; so falsehood and lying imitation doth likewise
derive deceivable colours to beguile the imprudent. Hence under the name of
Travellers supposed much knowing, by much seeing of things worthy to be known
(the common expectation of wonder giving glad entertainment, and desire of
novelty joyous welcome) insufficiency clothed with this outward figure of
sufficiency, doth oft enter into the rights of better desert, and by casual
pofiting some few, deceives most, and ruineth many. Travel is required in a
Physician, not as any part of his essence, but as an ornament, receiving the
essence and perfecting of it self from the essence and perfection of a
foresetled and continuing understanding. The general theory and speculation of
any knowledge or science whatsoever, is in no soil or country a stranger to
them that duly and truly seek it, nor doth understanding meet, or is taken up
in high ways; but to the most secret retired thoughts reflects the
brightness of his true worth, and from the perfect fullness of time, and
thence accomplished brightness of his beams doth seasonably break forth, and
soly give the rectified perspective of particular objects. In the occurrents of
travel, it is indeed the sense that conducts the object to the
understanding, but it is a pre-existing power and ability in the (...).
Scientia est, intellectus instrumentum. Aristot.
understanding it self that rightly judges and disposes the Res ipsae saepe
aut praeposterae, aut confusae, aut falsa specie solet sese offerre.
object. If therefore the understanding be either in it self originally
defective, or by want of time unsettled, or by precept and doctrine not
habitually formed; the sense may truly, rightly and continually present, but
the understanding shall either falsely or not fully apprehend, distinguish,
digest or dispose, whereby disorder in want of right method, doth rather
multiply confusion then increase right use. Hence many things worthy notice
escape ignorance, unjust reductions are commonly miscarried to improper
subjects, good uses are unseasonably or unreasonably wrested, mistaking
obvious, right estimates either for the most part vnobseruedly overpassed, or
casually well happening. For where wisdom doth not lead travel forth,
knowledge guide it on, prudence accompany it, good desire uphold it, the true
end persuade and call it forth; folly easily seduces, and depraved ends
pervert the right fruition. Hence we see commonly many travel far, and bring
home little. Some make swift adventure, and slow return, with late repentance.
Some bring home more then they would, some more then they should; and all that
begin travel with raw judgment, for the most part come home perpetually after
drunken with opinion. Different countries, aires, people, customs, manners,
zones and climates, do fruitfully expose commodious consideration unto those
whose judicious view and exchange doth know rightly to entertain them in the
way, and in many examples of many worthy Physicians, the benefits thereby have
ever been conspicuous. Amongst the rest, Galens industrious commutation of
distant regions, by his own writings are not obscure. But he that enters into
Galens travels without Galens Coelum non animu mutant qui trans mare currunt.

mind, may exceed him in the pains, but shall never come near unto him in the
fruit and worth. This is the reason that our common travelling Physicians for
the most part (the learned only in all places and countries worthily
purchasing unto themselves due reverence) do oft from beyond the sea bring home
strange preparations and medicines, but little wit and discretion safely to use
them; by the great opinion of far fetched wondes distracting and cousening
the needful inquisition of a more inward worth in themselves to warrant their
accommodation, without which, both heedless proof and needless use, do oft
find in the best excellence a harmfull goodness: and howsoever happily commending
it self in his own property and virtue, yet oft stinging unto the heart
busy, unnecessary and unadvised meddling. It is grown so common in these
days to entertain Quia inopes sunt indocti in patrijs suis viuere non possunt

lives of simple credulous men, for their own gain, into their own hands;
and after they have by their common desperate courses provoked and drawn
forth unwilling death (when they see him coming) to run away, and to leave
the miserable beguiled innocent in his angry jaws, to answer their rash and
needless challenge. The wiser sort have better learned to know them, but the
simple are still Quod non cognoscantur ab omnibus, hoc ipsum malitiam naturae
ipsorum auget, vsque ijs insidiantur qui ea quae versute semper perpetrant non
norunt. Galen. lib. praedict.
their prey. It necessarily now follows unto the general conclusion of all
that hath been before said, that both the travels of the mind, and
contemplation in the former tractates mentioned, and also the change of places
and countries here specified, with all other sense-informing means and
inquisitions of knowledge and science, without precedent right institution, and
settled incorrupt seeds of select understanding, shall all ever doubtfully, and
for the most part lamely succeed unto timely growth or ripe perfection. For
knowledge must ever go before industry as a guide, and particular practise
follow general rule, which he that hath not first in mind fully and truly
conceived, must needs want the idea that forms an understanding action. And
thus hath it hitherto appeared negatively, now it follows affirmatiuely,
where true election may make right choice of a good Physician.

long continue them to be the same. Hence by vicissitude it ordinarily comes to
pass, that of those things whereof lately seeemed certainty, thereof by

casual; that which was true, now false; that which was good, now evil, and
that which was possible, oft impossible. Necessity this uncertainty of all
things, doth drive men that desire with more likely certainty, through
prudence to guide their actions unto the school of contemplation of the world,
and of the general revolution of all things therein, (which is true
Philosophy) that thence by long study and diligence observing to know and
distinguish what is in nature, and the ordinary vicissitude of all things,
according to several seasons, circumstances and subjects, means, measures,
and manners variously, now true, then false; now necessary, then casual, now
absolute in it self, now conditional, with supposition, and by accident, now
possible, now impossible; they may inform themselves from tried and approved

not, time beguile not, advantage escape not, uncertainty prejudice not,
occurrents prevent not that good which according to reason and the destined
issue in nature, diligent endeauout may otherwise effect. This is the sum of
art and prudence. This is the use and perfection of reason in man, without
which man must needs be as the brute beast, void of understanding, dwelling in
perpetual blindness, darkness and confusion, without distinction of good and
evil, true and false, without consultation or election of the one or other.
Without the knowledge of nature our life is death, our sight blind, our light
darkness, and all our ways uncertain. He that knows not the quality of
the fire, can neither seek comfort by the warmth, nor fear the scorching. He
that hath not observed nature in the water cold and moist, shall neither

otherwise for ever men remain void of counsel and of truth. Hence it comes
to pass, that as men more or less earnestly seek the wisdom, order, and
reason of nature in her dispensation of the whole world, and therein more or
less dispend their studious pains, so they diversely obtain answerable
measures and proportions therein, growing in wisdom more or less according

time nor circustance ever or at any time abrogate. Hence above all other arts
sciences the art of Physic must needs be most excellent and true, because it
most continually converses with nature, as her prime proper subject, and
beyond all other most immediately depends upon the perpetual study, view,
obseruatio of nature, the continual consultatio with nature in every actio. For
it is requisite in a copetent Physician, that he be truly able fully furnished
to be unto nature a governor moderator to preserve her, to conserve her,

all needful helps, and to remove from her all harmful impediments. Lastly,
he must be a faithful friend in her necessity, needfully assisting, helping,
and comforting her. And how can he duly perform these things unto nature, that
truly and perfectly knows Physiologiae necessitas perpetua medico non ad
discendam modo sed ad exercendam quoque artem. Galen. de Med. opt.
not nature? Above therefore and beyond all other Artists the Physician
immediately hath need use of exquisite knowledge of nature. For since he is
deputed to be helper and restorer of particular nature, how can he for that end
but become scholar and imitator of the general? For as all particulars do
ever participate the nature and kind of the general, and are therein
comprehended, so besides that which unto every indiuiduall nature is specially
proper, there is an essential Species generis, indiuiduum vtriusque naturam
participat, vtrunque indiuiduum speciem genus facit comprehendit.
property in it belonging unto the general: without which as the particular
cannot be at all, so therefore is ever an eye, a respect and reference to be
had, that those things which for the good of the particular are considered or
consulted, may never be disproportioned fro the general: which he that knows
not, cannot consider. He therefore that shall rightly and prudently dispose for
the good of any man, ought as well to know and advise what and how he
participateth with the general condition, as not to be ignorant what is
peculiar Huc spectat (...) specificae differentiae, proprietates rerum
occultae.
unto himself. For if he know not the Sed Medicus exercendorum corporum

general kinds and natures of things, what powers, faculties, privileges,
prerogatives, properties, endowments, belong indifferently to all, as well as
differently to the special, he shall oft omit and overslip a larger portion
offered in the common good, then any speciality shall after recompense or
countervail in it self. Contrariwise also, if he only know the general, and
understand not to compare, consider, apt and fitly suit it unto the Vniuerse

particular, he shall never from the common derive thereto ought pertinent or
truly accommodate. It is necessary therefore a Physician understand both what
nature hath allowed man in universal, with all other things, and also no less
what proper to himself, and enclosed in his own. For if he know not nature in
her special kind, Qui ignorant corporis affectum secundum naturam a quo actio
producitur, prorsus cognoscere non potest affectum praeter naturam a quo actio
laeditur. Galen. de meth. med.
when her self is separate and free from other implications, how shall he judge
or know her just reduction thereto, when he finds her oppression requiring
his assistance to bring her home unto her self? Neither must he here only
consist, but must farther view and consider, what God either in heaven or in
earth, in the whole world, or the wide occan, from all the elements or
elementary things hath ordained for any good or use of man. For as God hath
created all things for the good of man, so hath he appointed the Physician to
fit and accommodate all things unto the necessity and need of man, and hath
farther also deputed him to supply unto man even those things which Natura non
potest aratro boues iungere, nec illorum opera terram scindere, art vtrunque

nature her self oft times cannot. Nature cannot either open the necessary
vein, or ventilate or evacuate the corrupt blood from the bruised part, or in
the right and behooveful quantity. Nature cannot with election or regularly
purge the right and proper humour, fitting the cause and necessity. Nature
cannot fetch home from the fields and mountains her medicinal herbs, fruit,
wood and plants unto her own necessity; but Art transports them unto her at
several seasons, and for several needs. Nature cannot decoct, infuse,
compound, mix or prepare her roots, metals, or other drugs and simples, in
number and nature infinite; but Art is unto her benefit and service therein
accurate. As therefore the Physician must ever have Nature for his chief Quo
natura vergit tendendu medico naturae ministro. (...), c. Hippocrat.

helper unto her. Not to speak of his excellent subject (which is the life and
health of mankind) his divine direction in his calling (led by the unchanged
order and wisdom of God himself, manifested and set forth unto him in the
structure and great frame of heaven and earth) doth exact and require in him
all possible perfection to sound and fadome the depth and height thereof. For
as it is manifoldly and immeasurably enfolded and wrapped up in the intricate
wisdom of his universal workmanship, so must long days and time carefully
spent, indefatigable study, pains and meditation, restless vigilance, a
clear eye of understanding, and sincere affection work and labour it out, and
thence must his prudent and wise action derive the ground of all his counsels
and consultations. And thus must the true Physician ever behold God as his
guide, and be governed and directed by his hand. For God is nature (...). Est

a pattern, what wisdom is sufficient, what sufficiency worthy? If any man
think it a light labour to find out the order and reason of so infinite a
workman in the immense work of all things, or but an easy difficulty to
imitate his example in infinite actions, he knows not what is the height of
humane wisdom, which being to know most (...). Qui maxim la dissicilia

shadow of himself) yet is it so much as is able to make men justly admired,
and happy that obtain it; as all other that want it, worthily as unhappy and
unfortunate as ignorance can make man. Ignorance is ever blind, blindness
continually stumbles and oft Animus lumine mentis intelligentiae orbatus,

infortunately falls; but knowledge gives eyes, and the happiness of sight
declines the unhappiness of our lives perpetual groping error, and the
miserable confusion of the darkness of mind. Since then knowledge is the eye and
sight of the mind, and all knowledge comes either by the ordinary light of
nature, or the extraordinary illumination of the Creator of nature, whence
shall the ordinary dispensation of men's ways and actions borrow counsel and
light, but from nature? And then how necessary is the knowledge, learning and
study of nature, not only unto the accomplishment and ornament of our better
being, but unto the establishment of prudence and discretion, and the happy
consequences thereof in all our lives and actions? If prudence and wisdom
flow from hence, and the miserable condition of man perpetually crave their
supply, and the neuerceasing mutable uncertainty of circumstances continually
multiply occasion of consultation from thence, how can any action or purpose of
man be rightly tried, approved and assured unto him, but by the complement and
perfection of this knowledge? And if knowledge only rectify and make happy
men's works, endeavours and actions in all things, how is it much more chiefly
and absolutely requisite and necessary in a Physician? His subject, which is

in the created order and reason of all things) challenges the help and

of counsel, and most incomparable sagacity of understanding. For what

reforming and moderating the errors of continual mutation and alteration, in
opposing death, and enlarging life; lastly, in arming the several true trials
and just estimates of the native uses and properties of all things, substances,
quantities, qualities, forms, seasons, and circumstances, according to the
command of the general commander of heaven and earth, and the edicts of
nature, for the good of man? What humane science can affoord more ample matter
and occasion of divine cogitation? what emploiments are more continual works
of charity? what virtue comes nearer unto God in goodness and mercy? God
creates man, the healthful and helpful hand of the Physician restores and
repairs his daily lapses. What wisdom more inwardly converses with the
hidden and secret works of God and nature? And though his better and more
erected thoughts oft humble themselves unto the necessities of miserable men,
(which proud and foolish minds contemn) yet hath the example of the saving
Deity herein most exalted him whom virtue instructs, wisdom forms,
prudence counsels, and Art firmly guides; without the competent concurrence
of all which, the necessity of their hourly use doth altogether deny
sufficience in a Physician. How worthy reverence in themselves, and how happy

particular practise and action? For although it be experience that indeed
gives unto reason the true reflection of it self, yet is it the rule of reason

others, because so slightly sought and found in Physicians themselves, every

himself or his action, unto particular trials of confused conceit and
confidence in opinionate grounds? Hence as mechanical offices and
administrations are rather more commonly conspicuous in our ordinary
practitioners, then any weight of prudent perpension or lively stamp of
judicious disposition or ordering; so doth the general slightness and
lightness herein of most, sprinkle a common disgrace and ignomy upon all,
casting the excellent faculty it self inestimate almost behind the most
inferior science. To leave therefore the proud and disdainful contemners
herein unto the just contempt of God and nature in his greatest need, that
others deserve not so ill, and all may learn rather to choose the good from the
ill, then to despise the better for the worse, I will here point the
inquisition of the best, who though happily rarely found, yet may the pattern
commend the nearest thereto, and draw the well deserving unto his safest
choice. In all cases and subjects of election, it is wisdom chiefly first to
seek that is most excellent; next, where excellence is not, prudently to
accept mediocrity, but ever knowingly to avoid evil. The pattern of
perfection doth show the more and less perfect, and manifests the more or
less imperfect, fro which the farthest distance is the greatest defect, and
the nearest affinity the best excellence. Of mediocrity are many degrees.
There is mediocrity ascending b from it self toward perfection or excellence,
and mediocrity descending Mediocritas in confinio boni malique posita est.
Col. lib. 4.
from it self unto the lowest step of means. All that are contained within
the latitude of mediocrity, participate the same true rules and grounds with
those that consist in the highest top of excellence, only herein differing,
that the latter with a more piercing eye searches the marrow of the same
truth, the other more shallowly sounds the same prosunditie. This difference
of mediocrities distinguishes only the several measures of the same
perfection, whereby they differ, not in kind but in degrees of comparison. Thus

good, better, and best of all; all considered in the same quality, every one

give true splendour and eminence, or mediocrity maintains within different
bounds of true Art and science, he is either in the one worthy, or in the other
intolerable. He whom farther unworthiness hath exempted out of both these, is
in himself unprofitable, and in others use (...). Eurip. Malus nihil aliud

wanting, where is desired any reasonable perfection; and this is the same
infallible truth in all faculties and professions. For many instances, behold
but one, and see by common consent of all learned, by testimony of reason and
experience, how progress of knowledge doth in every part answer the nature and
custom of husbanding seed. Compare (...). Analogiam habet natura cum tellure,

and both in all alike? The seeds of virtue and knowledge are ever fitly sowed

much proof as better consideration. And thus the necessary concurrence of the
knowledge of nature unto perfection in any worthy faculty, hath briefly and
sufficiently appeared, and more specially the use thereof unto a Physician hath
been plainly instanced and manifest, and his primacie in the counsel and
consultation of nature, the necessities of life have amply proved. It hath been
likewise farther considered, that as in all other arts and sciences, so
especially in Physic, no man ever attained the meanest satisfying worth,

confirmed. From hence it must necessarily follow as a certain conclusion,
that according as me are more or less wanting in any of these, so do the
number of the wants truly measure the quantity of their defects. And since
these are seven so inseparable companions guides unto sufficiency in those by
whom it is truly acquired, they must needs therefore by necessary consequent
be therein fair likelihoods and proofs of that sufficiency unto others also
whom it shall concern to know and enquire it for their own direction and
satisfaction. And as these are thus necessary to be enquired, so is it as
easy for the meanest to trace and discover them in any particular knowledge.

CHAP. III.
ANd thus with a plain sensiblenesse unto vulgar capacity, I have delivered
the sententious sum of those things which the learned in the largeness of
many volumes have widely scattered and confounded: which as according to the
first promise and purpose, it gives unto the meanest a light unto a larger
field of prudent consideration, so doth it also unto the younger student yield a
profitable taste of that true way and method which prosperously guides unto
perfection. And although sharpe witted folly in the ambition of proud conceit
hath oft times devised and imagined easier and shorter ways and Huiusmodi
^uere illi Thessalij asini ipse ipsorum parens Thessalus, qui in sex mensium
spacio totam medicinae artem non modo vorabant ipsi, sed alios docere

cuts unto an higher pitch, yet after-time hath still otherwise proved it unto
erroneous men, when for the most part their eyes and time are almost out, and
folly hath already too sufficiently fatted it self to glut repentance. I will
not spend time in blaming this our time herein, daily experience is just
reproof. From that which hath formerly been discoursed, there seems yet
remaining a doubt demanding answer: whether non but men, as before, known
learned, may prove of safe or commendable use? Where the causes and diseases
are both common and vulgar, and no circumstance requires more then ordinary
consult, there without doubt ordinary harmless remedies without deeper
counsel or advice, may by themselves sufficiently Sed medicus optime

satisfy an usual need. For this cause the Emperick is justly to be preferred
before all other sects, for that (for the most part) never changing his
approved ordinary good remedies, he thereby in ordinary cases doth more
commonly benefit; while other sectaries from the wild Methodici debitae
pharmacorum compositionis ignari opera Artis inuertunt. Galen. de Sect.
composition of their confused and deceived minds (ever therefore vainly
continually varying the mixture of their medicines) must needs thereby both
pervert the ordinary benefit of usual and tried medicines in common diseases,
and in all other also by their misgoverned rules, and mistaking reason, ever
either overrun or come short of that happy and safe issue, which more
distinct, judicious and truly understanding accommodation from more prudent
right deliberation doth more certainly and assuredly bring forth. This is the
reason that Galen. lib. de sectis in Suasor. ad arts. lib Isagoges Med.
Galen instituting and counselling a young Physician, doth chiefly instruct him
first to bend all his whole labour and endeavour to aim at that unstained
purity of sight and discerning sagacity, which is only proper unto the truly
learned and soly orthodoxe Physician, whereunto if his power and means will not
advance him, he then advises him to make choice of the Empiric soly to
Eaedem in ^j^dem affectibus medelae ab ijs qui rationem profitentur Empiricis

imitate before all other sects; because his plain constant course in ordinary
diseases doth most oft good, and in other most commonly least hurt, though with
the rest never sure, and not ever safe. And thus far (deserving reader) I
have pointed thy better remembrance into the right way of the most likely
inquisition. Virtue is likewise a needful companion unto sufficience of
understanding, a grace and ornament unto a Physician, and in him a benefit and
advantage unto the patient; by the one well gained, discreetly and justly
steering his sufficience, by the other well known, Natura siquidem vtraque

idea or large description. It only now remains thou call once again
remembrance unto remembrance, by recovering in our passed discovery in few
words the general brief sum for better impression and continuance. It hath
been manifested how senseless common use doth draw fond custom unto
mechanical counsel. Reason and prudence have also given thee a taste and
better sense of the vnobserued mischief therein, and hath taught thee a more
wise fear. Nor hath it been the least wisdom, to know to hold suspected
among those whom learning hath exempted out of the unlearned multitude, such as
make profession of double perfection in two Sua ipsius propria agere alienis

faculties, where one in true reason is never sufficiently or above needful
measure fulfilled in the most excellent, beside the perfection and right habit
of understanding, the attendance in care and circumspect action requiring never
less then the whole and utmost endeavour; Qui omnes in art aliqua minutias
subtilitates persequitur, exitum nullum inueniet: si vero in illis modum

addiscenda. Osor. de Reg. instit.
which he that thinks too much for his own calling, profession or faculty
whatsoever, is the least of all worthy of it, or well deserving in it. It hath
been likewise farther noted unto prudent observation, that among men honestly
limited within one calling, notwithstanding immoderate, extravagant and
impertinent curiosity too prodigally dispent in things of least moment, least
pertinent or profitable unto necessary use, doth vainly sometimes e divert the
more serious and chiefly fixed study and respect upon the more maine ends and
offices therein, (as hath been before noted of curious Astrologers and
superstitious Ephemerides-masters) whereby that which is most necessary, is
dangerously oft neglected, and that which is least needful, fondly more
preferred and esteemed. Lastly hath been pointed the man whom thou may most
discreetly and with most likely safety choose to trust with thy life and
health. First thou art advised to consider that he be a man free from the
former imputations; and secondly that he be commended unto thee by the seven
forementioned testimonies: one whom nature Praeclara aunt studia non omnibus
ornameto esse possunt, sed ijs tantum qui praeclaro ingenio egregia virtutis
indole praediti sunt. Osor. de Reg. instit.
hath fitted and set forth by common good parts expressed in open and apert,
just and discreet word and action, and also in special proof and use, the
same in all occasions, capable, sensible, wise temperate, and understanding; in
his profession carrying credited assurance by his former times, place,
institution, study and industry well known, commendably formerly, and ever
dispent. If thou make this careful and likely good election of thy Physician,
thou shalt not so usually find so many luckless events of after-repented
choices, nor so commonly heedlessly draw upon thy self so many miserable
calamities as daily fall out in want of more reasonable fore considered care
thereof. Happy is he who doth converse with the prudent, Prudentia ad rationis

consulteth the wise, trusts the just and honest, and imploreth skilful
help. God hath promised his blessing unto the prudent, in his unaltered decree

likely forestalling of otherwise more casual good. In the wise (with caution
