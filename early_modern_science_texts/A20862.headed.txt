THE MOST excellent, profitable, and pleasant book of the famous doctor and
expert Astrologien Arcandam or Aleandrin, to find the fatal destiny,
constellation, complexion, and natural inclination of every man and child by
his birth: with an addition of Physiognomy very delectable to read. Now newly
turned out of French into our vulgar tongue, by William Ward.

Printed at London by Iames Rowbothum and are to be sold at his shop in
Chepesyde, under Bow church.

To the right honourable and virtuous lord the Earl of Shrowesbury, knight of
the most noble order of the Garter. c. Iames Rowbothum wishes lunge life,
with the increase of godly honour.
I Doubt not (right honourable) but the mind of man is free, and hath the rule
and power of him self through the virtue of his liberty, and that the wise
man by his reason, and reasonable sapience, hath dominion over the stars and
their impressions, namely over all natural inclinations, and celestial
destnies, without any forced necessity to do this or that, which comes by
the grace and gyfte of God, the governor of the universal world. Even so
Stilpo (by reason ruling him) avoided whoredom, although he were naturally
inclined thereunto. Yet not withstanding it is most certain, that men have
some inclinations and complexions by nature which some men know either by
Astrology, or by conjecture of their nature, called Phisyognomie, and they
that conjecture are called in Greek Physiognomones which tell by conjectures,
notes, signs and tokens, the inclinations of men's affections. The Philosophers
indeed have invented and found out physiognomy to the great commodity of men,
for to know to what virtue or what vice young children were inclined to the end
they might amend their vicious and faulty nature with good education, not to
give the bridle to their affections, but to move them to scienences, studies,
and other qualities, whereunto nature most calls them and makes them most
inclined. So Apelles and Zeusis followed and learned naturally the art of
painting. So Polyeletus and Praxiteles followed the art of making pictures
images. So Demosthenes Cicero chose the art of Oratory and eloquence, in
pleading matters in the law: So Homere and Virgil followed poetry: So Socrates,
Plato, and Aristotle handled Philosophie. And now all is altered and changed
and almost clean overturned, and goes (as I might say) ouerthwartly like the
Crab. For he that should be naturally a plowman, is forced to the study of
pleading, and to be an Orator or Philosopher, or else of some higher
learning, snoring on his books, turning and returning himself this way and
that way, as though he sat upon coals or hoate embers. Contrariwise, they that
are well borne, and called by the benefit of nature to all honesty often times
are constrained to servile doings. The knowledge then of Physiognomy is
requisite profitable to men, so that men abuse it not, as some fond people do
(commonly called Egiptians) which are as it were ravening Harpies, hunting
after the gain of money, which have brought to pass by their lies, that this
part of philosophie is now in no estimation, which is to be lamented, saying
that even Hunters know by coiectures, notes, signs, draughts, lineaments,
sight of the body, the nature and property of dogs: And by the like means
Horsecorsers do know the nature of Horses, as the Poet Vergill describes in
the third book of his Georgykes saying.

The good Colt by and by marches high upon the ground, orderly extols
himself, or else sets down often times his soft thighs the one after the
other: And first he dare go in dirty ways, or into great rivers, and venture
upon a bridge which he knows not: neither fears he any vain noise or cry.
The good horse hath a high neck, a little head, a short belly, fat behind,
fair before, having a full mane. The red is fair, fair also is the
speckled, fair is the browne bay: and evil is a white colour in a horse. And
worse is the colour between white and red.

A good horse can not stand still at the sound of a trumpet that he hears a
far of. The ear we see waggeth up down, every member moves, foaming at the
mouth, he breaths out and gathers in under his nostrils fire hot breath. A
thick mane hanging on the side along down all his neck: and a double chyne
ending broad upon his back. He treads deep in the ground, and in treading
he astonieth it. His hard hoof of horne sowneth, with other qualities belogyng
to a good horse.

But now a days no man cares to conjecture, or to know by conjectures, or to
refer mans natural inclinations to such a profit. And though there were no
other profit risynge by it but only to make a troubled mind merry (whereunto
we oftentimes see music applied which is one of the sciences commonly called
liberal:) this art of physiognomy ought not be contemned. And therefore
wayinge with my self the pleasantness of this part of philosophy and having
occasion to publish in our vulgar tongue this little book of Arcandam or
Aleandrin doctor most expert Astrologian, treating of the predictions of the
birth fatal disposition of young children. I was so bold as to dedicate ye
fruit of this labour unto your lordship, and to honour it with the honourable
title of your honours name, most humbly besechinge your lordship favourably to
accept it as offered of one who wishes unto you and yours all health, wealth,
long life, and much increase of virtue honour, nothing doutinge but that after
your lordshippes weyghty and serious affairs, you shall not be grieved to
recreat your self with the reading of some pleasant part hereof, which may
ease such tedious exercises as your lordship may upon occosions take in hand.

Your honours most humble, Iames Rowbothum.

A brief declaration most certain and profitable, for to find out (as much
as the art of Astronomy can certify) mans fate and constellation indicatiue,
touching the natural inclination of man: Made by Arcandam the learned and
expert Astrologian.
THe manner to find out the destnie and constellation is this. First, if you
will know the constellation of any man, take his natural name which is
comonlye called his proper name and the proper name of his mother, in such
sort as neither of ye said two names in any wise be changed or depraved from
the vulgar or proper calling (as often times it chances by the common
apellation of men's names) but that they be perfect and not diminished. And for
two causes the name of the mother is taken and not of the father. First,
because the mothers side is more apparent then the fathers. Secondly, although
the father be the original of the conception and generation of the child yet
the child touching the body hath more of the mothers matter and substance
then of the fathers. Yea and as oftentimes it happens, some part of the
fathers seed doth not entre nor serve touching the material composion. For
man is verily a thing active, and by no means passive, and touching him self
can have no action. Whereby it consequently appears that the child concerning
the body hath more of the mothers substance then of the fathers. Whereunto a
third cause may be added, that for as much as the child is nourished of the
mothers substance and not of the fathers, that then the constellation enforsyng
his effect sign in the chyldes body, doth rather convert the same with the
mother the body of the mother, then with the father and the body of the
father. And therefore truly and determinatlye to know and learn the chyldes
fate and constellation, his proper name must be taken together with the
natural and proper name of the mother. Then diligently consider every letter of
the said two names, and amongst the same gather ye numeral letters, such as
signify a number, which according to the ancient account are seven as.I.
signifies one.V. five.X. ten.L. fifty.C. a hundredth.D. five hundredth, M.
signifies a thousand.

Taking all and singular letters of the said two names, as well the number as
such as signify a number. Then gather the whole sum, which sum so
collected, divide if it be possible by.xxix. because of the.xxix.
constellations of the stars, or because of the particular signs celestial
which after the ancient manner is the first division of the signs. And
hereby it appears that the principal parts of the particular stars and
signs celestial in number are.xxix. as here after shall appear. So that the
number signified by the numeral letters of the two proper names aforesaid
ought to be divided by reason of the said signs. And sometimes the said
number doth amount just to the sum of.xxix. and sometime it excedeth the
same, wherein is to be noted that either the number doth exceed or else is
equal.

If it exceed, then the number ought to be applied and divided by their unities
to the said signs adding to every of the signs their unities beginning at
the first sign which is the head of Aries and so of the rest successively.
And where so ever the last unity shall fail or shall be placed, there and in
that sign and in the part of that sign, the Infant (whose constellation you
seek to know) vndoutedlye is borne, and thereby you shall give judgment and
truly pronounce that in that sign the fate and constellation of the Infant
consists. Not withstanding that peradventure, according to the manner and
course of the stars, times and months, some other sign should seem to
have dominion over that nativity. And because that the sign wherein
certaynely the Infant is borne doth not alone bear rule in the time of the
birth, but all and singular effectually do concur according to the more
or less in every nauitie. So that eftsoon it chances that some sign
distinct from that sign appropriat to the month doth more effectually rule
and more excellently express his effects. Therefore to the intent you may
perfectly behold the fate and constellation of the party that is borne, you
must not only look upon the sign allotted and appropriate to that month
wherein determinatlye any is borne: but chiefly you must have respect to that
sign which specially hath dominion above others in the time of the birth,
not withstanding that sign appropriate to the month hath the principal
effect.

And whether one sign is more excellent or effectual then another you may
most certainly and truly know by this art.

Let us return then unto our former proposition, and say that either the
sum of the number signified by the numeral letters of the names aforesaid
doth not amount to.xxix. or else that it doth principally attain to that
sum, or is equal, or else excedeth the same. But now after the agreement
and concorde of the number, take also the convocation and assemble of the
signs celestial, which are touching their particular parts.xxix. as is
aforesaid, or xxx. as shall be said hereafter, beginning at the first
particular sign, which is the head of the sign Aries. And where so ever the
last unity of this number shall rest or remain, that is the special sign
and is of most force in the time of the nauitie. But if this number doth not
surpass the number of.xxix. but thereunto is equal, then the last sign
which is the tail of Pisces is the chiefest sign at the nativity.
Semblably if this number doth exceed the number of.xxix. then this number is
to be divided so many times by.xxix. till the number of.xxix. be found out.
And then for every unity one sign must be accounted yielding to every sign
his unity: and then the last unity, which is xxix. is attributed to.xxix.
and to the last sign which is the tail of Pisces, as was said a little
before, and that sign chiefly hath dominion in the nativity of the infants.
But if that number lastly remainynge be within the number of xxix. then every
unity of this number ought to be distributed to every particular sign
beginning first at the head of Aries, and wheresoever the last unity of this
nubre doth remain the same is the principal sign, and chiefly hath
government at the birth of the infant.

Here also ought diligently to be noted that the celestial signs may be
taken two ways, that is to say totally or touching the whole effects of the
same and are in number but twelve. That is to wet: Aries (and is the first
sign, at which you must begin, and then follow successively till you come
to the sign of Pisces which is the twelfeth) Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo,
Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagitarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces. Now each of
these signs in his whole effect doth especially bear rule in that month
which is appropriate to the same. And every sign entirely hath dominion over
every month such as thereunto is appointed. As for example: Aries hath
dominion in Marche which is the first month according to the computation of
Astronomers. Likewise Taurus in April, and so the rest consequently succeeding.
And although the foresaid signs singulerlye and appropriatlye have their
months specially assigned as is aforesaid. Yet all these twelve signs in
every month at all times, every day and hour, every moment minute of an
hour, do concur in the nauitie of every birth, although not equally yet
according to the moore or less. And that sign which chiefly hath dominion
in the nativity, the same is the constellation of the Infant. Moreover the
sign wherein the Infant is borne, although it be not that sign which is
appropriat to the month but some other, yet it is easy to be known fro the
sign particularly appointed to the said month. Likewyse the said signs
may be taken two ways not entirely but specially touching their parts and
by accepting the same in such particular wise (chiefly after the reconing of
ancient Astronomers) they be nyne and twenty, for five of them that is to
say: Taurus, Gemini, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius are every of them diuyded
into three principal parts. As into the Head, the Beallye, and Tail, and is
as much to say, into the beginning, the middle, and the end.

Whereby it follows that these five figures so divided do include fifteen
particular signs which are there.xv. principal parts for three times v. make
fifteen. And the other seven signs. That is to say Aries, Cancer, Virgo,
Libra, Sagittarius, Capricornus and Pisies, emongs whom three parts are
contained in Virgo for his tail is diuyded into twain as shall be said
hereafter, although here it hath but.ii. parts. All which seven are divided
but into two principal parts, to weet into the head and tail and so
include.xiiii. particular signs for twice seue is xiiii. Whereby it
manifestly appears by the premysses that the signs particulerlye accepted
are in number.xxix. because.xv. and.xiiii. make.xxix. Further it is to be noted
that in all and every the aforesaid signs being wholly accounted according to
the manner before remembered al these.xii. are concurrents either more or less
in the nativity of every infant. For each man hath in the foresaid signs a
part propriety as for example. The infant that is borne in Aries, Aries.
disposes his life in that sign and in that part of Aries which is most
pliant to his nativity. And specially the part which according to the
quantity has chiefest dominio in that sign, and is the first house of his
nativity which is a signifier of life. c. And also places in the said sign
his speech, wisdom, augmentation of al his works, his beginning, his name,
and the original of his life and years.

In Taurus is contained the substance of the infant, Taurus.
his gain or loss his living, Debts, Gifts, Servants, Helpers, such as be
obedient to his commandments, his witnesses and treasure. And this sign
because it is the second house signifies the end of his youth.

Gemini are brethren. Gemini.
This sign because it is the third house is a token of brethren, systers,
friends neyghbors brethren of husbands and such as proceed of the mothers
side, and signifies the mother her self. Likewise it is a token of faith,
religion, commandments, ambassadors, news, mutations, small iorneys, and a
space of life before death approach.

In Cancer the Infant disposes his father, Cancer.
grandfather, and all his parents on his fathers side, to wet, all his
ancestors ascendynge from the right lyne males, and his sisters and other
inheritors, except such as are inheritors by the succession of the dead.

Also it signifies houses lands, rights, treasures, and what so ever is hid
under ground, prisons, and prisoners, and all such as happens to the dead
being buried, after the burial, or without burial, as left soones it chances
to such as be hanged, beheaded, or otherwise slain. And because it is the
fourth house it signifies death before he grow to mans state and the end of
things.

Leo.
Leo betokens Infantes, love, messengers, novelties, gifts, rewards, fair
promyses, or mirth, goods by the father such as shall happen after death
whether it be praise or infamy.

In the.vi. sign which is Virgo are contained infirmities, Virgo.
and things contrary to health, servants, maids, lying, accusation,
vnrighteousnes, places prisons, mutation from place to place, Catayll of small
stature. And because this sign is the syxth house it doth insinuate end of
life and all such things as shall happen before old age.

In Libra which is the seventh sign marriages are contained, Libra.
mischief and peril in marriage, contencions, open enemies, wars, emmities,
thieves, partakynge, and opposition and every thing opposite, participation of
merchandise, expedite and small voyages, and because it is the seventh house
it notes the moitie and end of life toward old age.

In Scorpio is contained death, fear, Scorpio.
sadness, labour, dispeyre, seperatio, aide of adversaries, policies, wit,
letall, poison, substance or hereditaments as well of strangers as of
affinite such as the heyers ought to possess after death and signifies
because it is ye eight house end of life after the approchement of old age.

Sagitarius.
In Sagittarius being the.ix. house are expressed lunge Iorneys, or far
peregrinations and all things thereunto incident. Also it signifies faith,
religion, wisdom, Philosophie, writtinges, Books, Epistles, News,
interpretations of dreams and things to come great wonders, much honour and
joy. And for as much as this sign is lord of the nynth house it sygnifyeth
a beginnynge and entrance into half of the life.

Capricornus.
The.x. house is Capricornus which prefygurateth kingdom, government,
auctoryty dignities offices and all arts that may be exercised and whereby a
man may be a Master, it sygnifyeth also ecclesiastical iurisdiccion, things
stolen or carries away, praise and fame it pronosticateth also mothers,
graundemothers, ancestors of feminine kind, mothers in law, and half the
term of life.

In the eleventh sign which is Aquarius the birth appoints his proper and
prosperous constellation, Aquarius.
and it betokens praise honour, great fortune, faythefull friends aid of
kings and princes, treasour, and society and sygnifieth half the years of
man life.

Pisces being the twelfeth house doth demonstrate significations of werines,
Pisces.
sadness, poverty, privy hatred, deceit fear, sorrow, lamentation,
blasphemy ambushmentes, houses, prisons, captive hands, rebuke, and beasts
meet to ride upon.

In manner above expressed is entreated only of the infant borne in Aries
although the same must be divided and spoken of every sign ascending in the
nativity of every birth and of all other signs following the sign of the
nativity till by recourse the number of.12. be attained whether any be borne in
Taurus or in Gemini which is in order, is written the third sign or in any
of the twelve signs. And therefore you shall diligently note that every of
the aforesaid houses is in him self the first, and hath his second, third,
fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eight, nynth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfeth
house. And this I remember because the like whereof we have said of the
signs, the same I would should be understanded of the houses. And every
house according to their qualities hath eleven other houses beside him self
of whom their significations be derived.

All which (well beloved reader) may through the dexterity of thy wit be
easily understanded, whether the infant be borne in Taurus, in Gemini or in
Libra, as before. And so every man may learn to know by this art
determinatly his own fate, his proper and passive constellation, not forced of
necessity, but by the natural inclination. because as Ptolemeus says, a
wise man shall rule the stars. As much to say. A wise man may let and
prohibit the very future effects, The heavenly inclinatie no be no
inforcementes to the wise.
which proceed of the stars and the influences thereof. And so if he will he
may rule the said stars and heavenly mocions. And therefore for a monition
unto thee, the said stars do not enforse and constrain thee to any thing,
except it he such as are proclyue and ready to be drawn by them, and such
as will follow nature rather then reason after the manner of brute beasts.
Wherefore for a more evident doctrine and instruction of the premesses, the
Scheme or figure ensuwyng is placed.

Place this figure next before the sign of Aries.



IN the first treatise the said sign of Aries is described with the
efficacy and power thereof. Which Aries is divided into two principal parts.
Aries divided into two principal panes containing five chapters.
That is to say, into the head and tail. And this treatise conteyneth.v.
Chapters.

In the first the head of Aries is described with the efficatie and fortune
thereof. In the second the tail and force thereof. In the third the special

this sign, I refer to the universal chapter of this sign Aries where is
entreated the entier effect and general fortune thereof, and is the fifte
Chapter of this treatise.

The second Chapter mencioneth the tail of Aries, the.ii. particular sign
or the latter part thereof, according to the sign particular is called

Taurus the second and principal sign celestial.


depiction of bull

THe second principal traictise of this book entreats of the principal
sign called Taurus, which sign is divided into three chief parts that is
to say into the Head, Taurus divided into three parts containing vi. chapters
Bealy and Tail. This treatise is divided into.vi. Chapters. The first
conteyneth the head of the said sign. The second the bealy. The third the
tail. The fourth the judgement of the same touching the male. The fyfte
touching the female. The syxte and last entreats of the general fortune of
the said Taurus.

Concerning the first Chapter of this treatise, wherein the head of Taurus is
spoken of which is the third particular sign called Adoldaya, the third
particular.
hath.vii. stars disposed in this sort. And is to be noted yt whosoever is
borne in this sign first touching the disposition of the body and vinacitie
of this sign shall be of colour pure, of body fat, the body.

the belly. The third of the tail. The fourth of the judgment of Leo touching
the male. The fifte of the female. And the sixte of ye equal fortune of both.

The first entreats of the head of Leo, which is the eleventh particular

marks, the first in his face, the rest upon his thigh, breast, leg, and
privy parts. Touching his colour, his body shall be white, his face neither black

naturally give to be notably proud of such stomach that in his heart, he
would wish himself comparable to Kings, yea and them to excel, if it were
possible. And he is of such and so great pride, that by reason of his haultie
cocourage, as well in value as dignity, or other sufficiency, he will suppose
no man in the world (be he never so great) to be his equal or match, or at
least wise greater then he, and also in his heart judges him self to surpass
or is able to excel in human felicities all and singular other persons. He
is also covetous and very ireful, and yet that notwithstanding, of much mirth
pastime in so much ye continually he wold be merry plai: he will be a wise man
proper, the Magik sciece will do him great stead. Likewise touching his life and
manner thereof, he shall be much vexed with the headache, in such forte as he

the Gall. He shall be pained in his thighs chiefly in the upper parts thereof.
He shall have three principal diseases, the first when he is.xiij. years old.

recover, then shall he attain to the sum of a hundredth years. And either he
shall die upon ye swords point, or else by some grievous infirmity of the
body. And according to his prosperous fortune, he shall pass from one
promocion to another, in so much as among kings and princes he shall be familiar
and well beloved. He shall get much treasure, and bring it heaped together. He
shall lose them again, and at length shall fall in danger and displeasure of
some pier or noble man.

The.ij. chapter entreats of the belly of Leo, is the.xij. particular sign,

angry, and is of speech very rustical. He is very doubtful and suspicious
in his doings. Touching his good fortune, he shall have no good fate, but by
virtue of this sign shall be most unfortunate as is aforesaid. For he that is
borne in this sign is subject to many troubles, if he be borne in the day he
shall be very fearful and timorous when he travails, if he be borne in the
night what hour so ever it be, saving the second, then he shall be of a merry
countenance, and shall have a round nose, a stripe upon his head, and a
natural mark upon his feet. He shall be witty, fearful and careless. He

Hyppe, which shall happen by fire, or shall have some other sign. He shall be
depriued of his speech after the disposition of the Sign, and influence
thereof, unless the same by some particular cause be wythstanded or else
interrupted by the divine clemency, or else by the liberty and will of the
Lady of this Science whose liberty this Sign, not withstanding may be
applied to good, and to virtue, and to works godly, who also may appease and
mitigate the influence and malice of the said Sign. Semblably if he be borne
in the second hour of the night, over and besides the premises. Touching
his evil fortune, he shall less his Infantes and Children, and few shall
remain on live. Likewise he shall be curious in searchynge of Parables and
Mysteries. His first Child shall be a female, and the second a male. During
his life he shall sustain much trouble and perylles.

The third Chapter mencioneth the tail of Leo, or the latter part thereof,
which is the tenth particular Sign. And hath one only Star in this form.
And who so ever is borne in this Sign, touching the bodies disposition, is

in exile and out of his own Country. Likewise, concerning his good fortune,
he shall reign and bear rule over his own Country, and shall have
authority to judge either such as is a thief or malefactor, or of another
man, or else such as was his own fugitive or Verlet. Moreover he shall be of
power to do many things with Lords Piers of Realms. He shall be very happy in
matters of husbandry. He shall have a very fair and beautiful wife, whose
colour shall be salowe like to one that hath the green sickness, and she shall be
one of his own kynred, whom when he hath married, GOD will give unto him
much substance according to the efficatie and influence of this sign. He
shall avoid many perylles and shall enjoy goods abundant. He shall have
pains in one his of feet and shall be bereft of both. He shall be depriued of one
of his bones. And upon his belly shall be hurt, either with iron or fire. In
his affairs he shall not accomplish his will, except it be in Winter time or in
the Spring. Six months he shall be fortunate in his busynes, even according to
his Hearts desire: That is to say, in September, October, November, December,
January, and Februarye. In Summer Autumn he shall not be so fortunate. He
shall less much goods, and his labour shall little avail, by reason of the
three marks in his breast. Let him not pass from one Country to another,
because change is not profitable to him. If therefore he will be fortunate, let
him continue in one place certain.

The.iiij. Chapter mencioneth the judgment of Leo touching the male. Where
note, that what soever man Child is borne in this sign. First touching the
universal disposition of the body. search the.iij. particular signs of Leo
aforesaid, and there see the conditions equal of the same. And touching the
disposition of the mind, he shall be naturally witty, subtle, eloquent,
coragious, ireful, and sollen. For he will be soon angry, and soon pleased
again. His stomach and subden anger is such, that by reason of his natural
animosity he shall sustain much contumely and displeasure. He shall be very
covetous, arrogant bold wilful to al things, which he sees or hears, in so
much as what soever he either hears or sees, al that doth greatly please
him, and that he embraseth and desires to enjoy and do the same, according to
the exigence and manner of the thing he hears or sees, and specially, if the
thing heard or seen be stable and able to be suffered, but within a while
after he will be weary thereof, and care nothing for it. Likewise he is
bountiful and liberal, because he can not keep secrete the thing he
possesses, and although he would keep it secrete, he can not but with great
difficulty. He is naturally gentle and quiet, but yet a derider and mocker.
And touching his life and manner thereof, he shall have.vij. terms or special
sicknesses, whereof the first three shall be very vehement.

The first shall be when he is.x. years old. The second when he is.xx. And
the.iij. when he is.xl. And if he pass and skape the said.iij. diseases, then
naturally and with happiness enough, he shall attain to.lxxx. and.viij. years.
In like manner touching his good fortune, he shall with good success abide the
brunttes of malice, and the state of his life. He shall have dominion over his
Country, and shall vanquish his enemies, although he shall object him self to
many afflictions dangers, from the which he shall by Gods help right well
eskape. From xxx. years upward he shall aspire to his better fortune, and then
shall see his substance augment. Of honourable personages he shall purchase
much wealth, and thereby his house shall be plentiful of money and abundant of
riches.

Concerning his evil fortune, he shall have a fall from an high place, and
shall have payne in one of his feet, and by water shall sustain trouble. He
shall not keep his first wife. Twesday shall be his contrary day, wherein if he
be wise, let him do no new matter or begin any enterprise. In the.v. Chap.
is entreated the judgment of Leo, touching the female.

Who according to the manner and state of her body, shall have a broad breast
and small thighs which are tokens of boldness and stoutnes of stomach. She
shall be very menstruous and fertile enough, not withstanding she shall have
but few Children, with certain other conditions of her body before declared in
the iij. particular signs. After the disposition of her mind she shall be
naturally subtle witty, desirous of learning. She shall be chaste, shamefast,
courtilike diligent and of good stomach, by reason whereof she shall be, very
prone subden to anger yet shall be soon again appeased. And not withstanding her
anger, yet in her own household very liberal, by whose means the house
shall be plentiful of meat drink. And because of her natural subtlety, she
shall be very bold, for as much as what soever she hears or sees if it seem
to comprise any subtlety or difficulty of matter, imidiatly she will desire to
know it. She is liberal because she can not keep close such things as she
hath. She is very lowly humble, if she chance to be spotted with any sin,
immediately she will fall down prostrat upon the ground, humbly ask mercy
forgeuenes of her Creator. Concerning her life and manner thereof, she shall
suffer the lunatike passion a notable payne of her hart stomach, which if she
eskape, she shall live till she be.lxxxv. years of age. She shall also be pained
in her toes. She shall have sufficient revengement upon her enemies. And after
her evil fortune she shall have many fortunes. For first she shall have a fall
from an high place, and her body hurt with iron or fire. When she is.xxiij. years
old she shall be married, and by her husband atteyn to promotion. Her husband
shall not live long, but shall die by mean of poison or witchecrafte. And at
length shall marry another who shall love her dearly. Of her neighbour she
shall receive damage in her treasure. When she is.xij. years old unless she
take good heed shall be deceived by oppression upon her body, and shall less
her maiden-head. She shall be troubled in the water and in danger of life.
Thursday is her contrary day, and therefore let her do no notable thing upon
that day, wash her head or put on any apparel. And here is also to be noted,
that the best remedy to avoid all her misfortunes, is first to address her
self, by prayer to our Lord GOD only, with all her heart. And to carry
about her precious Stones such as be orient and glisterynge. And then easly
she shall overcome al her misadventures by gods help.

The.vj. Chapter determines the general judgment of Leo, is to be noted that
this sign hath a singular fortune in warfare dominion: besides which they yt
be borne in Leo, have pains in the stomach, apostumes, pestiferous agues Such
as be borne in the service of great men, the same this sign presents to
their service. He shall be fortunate to gold brass, horses, and to such
merchandise as be of colour red. Fro the mid of October to the mid of April,
from the mid of July to the mid of August, he shall prosper otherwise not. And
touching the weke, he shall have.iij. happy days, to wet, Sunday, Twesdaye,
Wednesday. Saturday is his unfortunate day. But Monday, Thursday, Friday, be
indifferet. Likewise his fate is towards the East, and therefore let him place
his chamber door, bed, window, and all his affairs into that part,
especially if they be notable.

Virgo the syxte celestial and principal sign.


virgin

THe.v. treatise of this book entreats of the.vj. entier and celestial
sign called Virgo, with the three principal parts thereof. The first being
the head of Virgo. The second the first part of the tail, and the third the
second part of the same. And is divided into.vj. Chapters. The first Chapter
mencioneth the head. The.ij. the first part of the tail. And the.iij. the.ij.
part. The.iiij. the judgment of Virgo, touching the male. The.v. the female.
And the.vj. the common and indifferent fortune of Virgo.

The first Chapter determines the head of Virgo, being the.xiiij. particular
sign called Lacxa, and has.v. stars in this form disposed. And he that is
borne in this sign, shall be fair and beautiful, and of comely stature,
white upon his breast, but his hears shall be red. And by the force of this
constellation. He is naturally inclined to have curled hear and red, and by
nature loves the same, in so much that if he have not such hear of that
colour, yet he will seek to have the same coloured by art. He shall also be
naturally marked in the face, belly, thigh and leg, and upon his right
Elbow, and the said mark can not by any means be put away. Concerning the
disposition of his mind, he shall be honest, skilful, apt, shamefast, a
lover of justice. His mind shall be good and his voice vehement and loud.

He shall be as simple as a Lamb, having no regard or care upon the goods
of the world, or the goods of fortune. He shall know nothing that is good,
nor shall take heed of any man, but shall trust all men. He shall take no
regard of harms wherwyth he might be infected, and that by reason of the
four natural marks upon his Face, Belly, Thyghe, and Legs, aforesaid.

And by force of the same, he shall be very negligent, employing more care upon
his own affairs as is aforesaid. But if he would take heed, no doubt he
might bring them to good effect. He shall be desirous and covetous. He shall be
ireful and subden, and by reason of his soubden foresyght of offence, he shall
prevent the anger of his brethren. Touching his life and manner thereof, if this
man be borne in the.iiij. hour of the natural day, he shall dye without any
sickness, but if he be borne in the fifte hour, then before his death he shall
be very sick. He shall have.iiij. terms or principal sickennesses. The
first, when he is xv. years of age. The.ij. at.xxij. The.iij. at.xxxvj. And
the.iiij. and last at fifty, which if he escape, he shall attain to.lx.
Likewise touching his good fortune, the man so borne shall have a good fate,
and by reason thereof shall be exalted, and have great preferment. He shall
have many Children, and if he would use diligence upon his own busynes, he
should profit very much, especially in tillage. When he is.xxxvj. years old
he shall be preferred to honour and dignity. But if he be borne in the first
hour of the natural day, then he shall be a great king or lord. But if in
the third hour then king of all kings, a mighty Sovereign. He shall have
great prosperity, and shall exagarat to him self infinite treasure. Likewise
touching his evil fortune, when he is married his wife shall live but a short
space, and he him self shall dye with her, or within a while after. And
although he shall be abundant in Children, yet few of them shall live. He shall
fall into many miseries, because he shall be pained in the belly or some other
place. He shall moreover be marked in his privy parts.

If he be borne in the.iiij. hour of the natural day, then shall he dye
soddenly without any disease. He shall be diuorsed from his wife, whereof he
shall have great heaviness and sorrow.

The.ij. chapter entreats of the first part of the tail of Virgo, called
Alecaneth, and hath.v. stars shaped in this form, is the.xv. particular sign.

great beard, a fair nose. After the quality of the same he shall have fair
hear, narow eyes, and al his body shall be white. He shall be naturally marked in
the forehead, in the upper hip, upon his shulders, the paulme of his hand, in
his belly guts. After the disposition of the mind, he shall be wise, his
counsel shall be heard apt to every thing. He shall be lowly, good, devout, shall
love to be praised. He shall by nature atteyn to live to.lxij. years, and shall
dye before he be old. And touching his good fortune, he shall have two wives,
which shall be very substantial and rich, in so much as by them he shall
possess great riches. Likewise he shall be very apt to every thing which hath a
good end.

Concerning his evil fortune, he shall be bitten of a Dog in the face and on
his body. He shall have few Children, and they shall not be long lived, but
shall die in short space. Further, all such things as are spoken of in this
Chapter are general, and generally belong to all such as are borne in this
sign. If the party borne in this sign happen to be borne upon the Fridaye,
then he shall have great misfortune. If he be borne in the night, then he
shall have a natural mark upon the Crown of the Head, the Belly, the Face,
or foot, and shall have great Feet.

And touching the disposition of the mind, he shall be an upright man
walking iustelye, seldom exceadynge the path of equity. Likewise he shall
have two dyseases especial, whereof the first shall be when he is fouretene
years of age.

The other at.lv. or.lxxx.viij. and shall dye in his own house, but the cause
of his death shall be a stroke with Iron or a sword. After his good fortune he
shall marry two wives, and one of them shall have a very small neck. Likewise
he shall have much by means of his Children. Also touching his evil fortune
in old age he shall fall into the thraldom of a man of honour or power, and
shall be stricken with Iron, and in his own house shall dye of the said stroke.
In getting of riches shall take much pains and labour, and strangers shall
enjoy the fruits of his travel.

the 16. particular sign
The.iij. Chapter entreats of the ij. and last part of the tail of Virgo
called Aliena, being the.xvj. sign particular. Where is to be noted, that
whosoever is borne in this sign, touching the disposition of his body and the
quality thereof. He shall have a fair stature and a simple countenance. He
shall have a natural sign not able to be put away upon his right Elbow.
According to the disposition of the mind, he shall be honest, apt to learning,
wise, good and shamefast. He shall be very covetous in tillage, but in other
affairs he shall be remiss and negligent, whereas if he would take heed he
should greatly profit. Likewise touching his life, he that is borne in this
sign, and specially if he be borne in the.v. hour of the day, he shall
naturally have.iij. sickennesses whereof the first shall be when he is.xij.
years old. The ij. when he is.xxxij years old. And the.iij. and last, when he
is xl years old. If he chance to eskape the first, which wylbe very
dangerous then he shall be afflected with the.ij. which if he also eskape, then
he shall attein to the.iij. And touching his fortune before he be.xxxvj. he
shall obtain to a certain of honour and office. He shall have many Children and
shall profit greatly in tillage as is aforesaid. And if he wold be careful and
diligent, he should greatly profit in all matters. His evil fortune is, yt he
shall fall into many troubles by reason he shall be much pained in the belly, or
by some other means shall be extremely vexed. He shall have a strype upon his
Head, or his Face, or upon both, but notably in his privy parts, where he
shall be greatly pained. And although he shall have many children, yet few shall
remain on live, and in that point shall be very unfortunate. He shall be a great
Horder, and a great gatherer together of money, but by myschaunce shall lose
his money so gathered. If he be borne in the.iij. hour, then he shall be most
puysaunt a King of Kings, consequently most fortunate, if he borne in ye.iiij.
hour he shall be infortunat, because he shall die soddenly. If he be borne in ye
5 hour then in his body he shall be very foul deformed, but in riches he shall be
very abundant plentiful.

The fourth Chapter discourses the judgement of Virgo touching the male, and
first touching the disposition of the body, he shall be beautiful, of good
behaviour, and shall have a natural mark in his shulders and loins, and in
none other place. He shall be lunge lived. He shall have.iij. fortunate and
special days in the week. That is to say: Sunday, Twesday, and Wednesday.
His infortunat day is Friday. And that day ever is somewhat unfortunate. His
good fortune is toward the South. And therefore let him dispose his affairs
that way, together with the door and bed. The same is naturally of the
Melancolyke complexion, and is of nature cold and dry. Therefore his apparel
ought to be of some dark or black colour.

The fifte Chapter touches the judgment of Virgo, concerning the female.
Wherefore note that the maid or woman borne in this sign, shall be marked in
the said places as is described in this Chapter precedent. Touching the
disposition of her mind, she shall be witty, shamefaste, chaste, gentle,
benevolent and glad to please al men, whereby she shall be beloved of all men.

But she shall be somewhat cursed, and that only belongs to her evil fortune.
About.xvij. years of her age, she shall marry, and her first husband she shall
not love, who shall dye, and afterwards marry the.ij. Her first Child shall be of
excellent beauty. She shall be enrapped with many sorrows. She shall suffer
diverse maladies, which if she eskape she shall live.lxx. years.vj. months, v.
days. Her fortunate days be Wednesday and Sunday. Her infortunat day is
Saturday. Therefore upon that day let her begin no new work, but abstain
from all notable busynes.

They that be borne in this sign as well men as women shall suffer much pain in
their thighs, feet, and head. Her fortune is towards the South, c. as in the
former Chap. And both kynds shall be liberal.

The.vj. Chapter comprises the common fortune of Virgo. Where is to be noted
that the borne in this sign have their fortune in tillage, and in al things
generally thereunto apperteining, especially in all things that be sown. They
be subject to pains of the thighs and feet as fistulas or such like, ache
in the head, dropsy, the flixe or colic, besides others before mentioned.
And among other countries they shall visit the city of Jerusalem, the river
of Euphrates, Spain, other countries adjoining. And their good fortune or
chief dominio is towards the South. Their fortunate days are Sunday, Twesday
Wednesdaye. Their unfortunate is Fridaye and Saturday: but Friday to them that
be borne in this sign is ever unfortunate. He that is borne in this sign, as
is aforesaid is melancholic, cold, and dry. And therefore let him wear
black apparel, or such as be of dark colour, and of no light colour, because
this sign is altogether melancolick that is to say: earthy.

And here note that all ye things aforesaid, are general spoken generalli,
touch al singular such as are borne in ye belly of Scorpio, whether it be in
the day or night, or what hour soever it be. But yet here further is to be
considered, that the borne in this sign, whether it be in the day or night,
over besides the premises touching his body, shall be effeminate, and touching
his life and manner thereof, he shall be flattering, skappye, and shall have a
payne in one of his feet, if he be borne in the third hour of the day it
signifies good fortune, for he shall be lucky in tillage of ground, but in
merchandise little fortunate. But yet not wythstandynge in those trafiques,
which he shall attempt he shall receive much profit. Semblably touching
his evil fortune, he shall dye of a strype with a sword or else in his
journey trauelynge and shall have a mark upon his knee and back.

The third Chapter describes the tail of Scorpio called Elebrah, which is
the one and twenty particular Sign, and has six stars in this manner,
where note that who soever is borne in this Sign. Wheather it be by Day or
Night, or what hour so ever it be.

First touching the disposition of the body shall be beautiful, neat, having
fair, eyebrowes, clear eyes and small lean checks and thin and under his
Jaw shall have a mark. If any be borne in this sign in the time of Winter,
then his complexion shall be effeminate. If he be borne in the Summer then
touching the disposition of his body he shall be beautiful, but yet gross and
fat under his apparel. Also if any woman be borne in this sign, she shall
be of an indifferent stature and beauty, her face fair, of smothe here and by
reason of her cold complexion she shall desire to wear much clothing. She
shall have a blemish in her eyes, and shall be marked upon her arm, fingers,
and knee. If he be a man, he shall be of sanguine complexion, and mischiefuous in
geuynge a blow. He shall be naturally inclined (not, withstanding it seem
marvelous) to contradictories, that is to say, to justice and vnrighteousnes,
to loss and gain, to truth and falshold, and all by reason of the concurrence
of the opposites and contrary signs, and yet not withstanding the sign that
is of greatest force, shall bear the chief rule touching the premises.
Touching justice, he shall be naturally given to honesty, he shall be just
and of much equity, and in all his affairs greatly inclined to justice. And
touching the contrary he shall be a great Inuenter of news, a Talebearer, a
Liar, deceyptfull, envious, and false, prone to deceit as well by his look as
by his laughter. He shall be full of discord and a sower of debate, chieflye
among brethren and friends, whereby it appears that he is naturally
inclined to iniquity and vnrighteousnes, craft and deceipte not withstanding
his nature also to the contrary. But yet the sign of most force as is
aforesaid doth principally bear rule in this nativity. And to say any
thing touching his life, and manner thereof, touching his future inclination,
we can not. For as much as the concourse of the stars in this nativity are
divers. Likewise concerning his good fortune or indifferent fortune, this man
at one time shall want, and at another time shall have sufficient.

He shall have three wives, whereof the first shall be a widow. The second
and third shall be virgins, but the third shall bury him. And here is meet
to be known that by reason of the generality of this sign, and of the
concourse of the signs, this native should be coupled to four wives, but
yet the chiefest shall prevail. He shall be of power and liberty to do and
accomplish his own desiers. Happy shall he be to the femine kind, that is to
say, to things of that kind, as cattaill and such like. He shall be twice
bitten with a dog or other beast upon the shoulder and on his nose ornostrels
shall have a mark. He shall be in danger or thrall of men of power or
authority. His last Wife shall bury him by reason of the mark upon his
arm, or the bit of the Dog as his constellation doth thereunto chyefelye
enclyne.

The fourth Chapter describes the judgment of Scorpio, touching the male.
Where note that the Child borne in this Sign (touching his body) upon his
feet and hands shall have a natural mark. And touching his mind, he shall
be bountiful and liberal, so that he shall not keep secret his
substance.

In the service of others, he will be mearrye, trusty, bold and pleasant.
In his conditions strong, stable, and not wauerynge, not desistynge or leaving
of from his affairs being once begone. Touching his life, he shall have
three principal diseases the times whereof be not here noted, which if he
chance to eskape he shall live.C.x. years and.x. months. And according to
the virtue of this sign there shall be no impediment in the constellation, except
it happen by some particular cause.

His fortune shall be good for that in hearing and saying his luck shall be
prosperous. He shall attain to great wisdom and learning, and to the
magic science he shall greatly apply himself, and the mysteries thereof
diligently search out. And yet his diligence so taken doth include a certain
doubt or duplicitie, by reason of the force and efficatie of the word. For it
may signify great inuestigation and diligence and that perteyneth to his
good fortune, or else it may signify a causable infirmity procedynge of the
said Magic science, which belongs to evil fortune. He shall have great
abundance of money, and the same daily shall increase and multiply. By
means of a woman he shall be greatly enriched, and over his enemies he shall
have the victory. In forreyne places he shall exercise tillage, and at length
shall return home into his own country with gain. Of his betters by way
of reward, he shall receive Horses, Sheep, Oxen and other beasts. This
native shall be in great danger, and except he take heed, he shall be
hurt with a sword. Saterdaye shall be his contrary day, and therefore upon
that day, let him not wash his Head, or put on any new garment, or else
attempt any strange enterprise. And some affirm that he that is borne about
the end of this Sign, shall be of neither kind, or of both, that is to
say, as well male as female.

The fifte sign declares the effect of Scorpio concerning the woman.

Who hath her recourse to the parts of this sign before mentioned in each
Chapter. Notwithstanding over and besides the premises, thus much is to be
spoken. For first, you shall note that she shall be of a frendlye condition,
obedient serviceable, fearful, and shamefaste. She shall be wrathful and
have him in deadly hatred that doth her any displeasure. She shall have
Children by three husbands, and with them shall live in great felicity. She
shall vanquyshe her enemies, but yet till she be thyrtye years of age she
shall sustain much sickennesse. Nevertheless, of Cattayle she shall have
haboundaunce, and many people shall be under her government. But yet in her
youth she shall abuse her body in playing the Harlot, if the force of the
imminent constellation do take his effecten, bit she shall be with a Dog,
and in the end shall be blind. Of her brethren and parents she shall receive
much trouble. Saturday shall be to her infortunat day, therefore upon that day
let her not wash her head, put on any new garments, or do any other
strange fact.

The syxte Chapter entreats of the general fortune of Scorpio. Therefore the
borne in this Sign is naturally moyste, Phlegmatycke or Sanguine. And such
shall be singulerlye fortunate of all things that be of colour red, and
in byinge and selling of all such. The like fortunate in all things
factible, or to be forged with or in the fire, extrahible or belonging to the
same, and in marchaundyse of vnknowynge things. And therefore as much as he
can, let him wear such garments as be Red. The like fortunate in
Warrefare and Tillage, and in all Beasts belonging to the same. Fortunate in
Hospitalytye, whether it be done for money sake, lucre, or for Gods sake.

The unfortunate Days be Thursdaye and Saterdaye. The rest be good,
especially Twesdaye. He shall be affected with the Chyragre or Gout in the
Hands. With the Sciatica and payne in the Head.

And if Saturne be found to be asscendent, than he shall have great pains in
his toes. His fortune is towards the South, and therefore let him dispose his
affairs that way, and convert to that part his chamber Door, Bed Window,
and the like.

Sagitarius the.ix. celestial and principal sign.


depiction of archer

THe.ix. treatise makes relation of the.ix. celestial and principal sign
called Sagitarius, which is divided into two parts, that is to say, the head
and the tail, containing five Chapters. The first entreats of of the head
of Sagitarius. The.ij. of the tail. The.iij. of the judgment of Sagitarius
concerning the male. The iiij. of the female. And the.v. and last of the
general fortune thereof.

And over and besides the said five Chapters, there is a general rule next
after the second Chapter, not wythstandyng the generality mentioned in the
end of this treatise.

The first Chapter entreats of the head of Sagitarius called Albaham, being
the.xxij. particular sign, the 22. particular sign
hath viij. starsfashioned in this manner. Where note that who so ever is borne
in this Sign, first touching the disposition of his body, hath a beautiful
body, comely to behold, lunge and tall, and throughout beautiful, a little
head, a thycke face, a fair nose, white teeth and short. Upon the left part
of his Head he shall have a strype, and the like upon the Crown of his Head,
his left Hand his Fyngers, Arms, Teates, and against his Heart. He is nymble,
swift on his feet, and very expedite in running. He shall have a natural
mark upon his pryuye members. He is of colour black, whose face shall be like
to them that have the green sickennes.

Touching the disposition of the mind he shall by nature have a good wit,
and a sharpe, and therewithal constant and firm. He shall love wise men, and
shall embrace all such as be of discretion.

Therefore touching this part of nature, and the natural constellation
bearing rule in this nativity, he shall acquire unto him self possession with
wise men.

And although that he have a covetous mind naturally disposed to avarice, by
reason of the concourse of certain stars, yet by means of the dominion of
this Sign, he shall be studious of good things, and shall be inclined to virtue,
and especially to the virtue of liberality.

And therefore he shall not be much inclined to the opposite or contrary, nor
yet to extort other men goods. And because principally he is bent to
virtue, it will follow that he shall be of great authority, exalted in high
degree of honour. Moreover although he be naturally inclined to liberality,
and not to rapine or extortion, yet he shall be procliue and given to many vices,
that is to say, to pride, covetousness, lechery and glotonye, and chiefly to
pride little esteeming other men doings or sayings, very haultye, in so much
that what soever question any do ask of him, be shall get no answer at his
hands. And by reason of his pride aforesaid, he shall be a great Cauillour,
Liar, Chyder, and full of contention. He shall have a very pestiferous and
venomous tongue. And although he be naturally inclined to a certain spice of
liberality, for that he will covet to possess nothing unjustly, yet he shall
be desirous to get substance, and covetously to enjoy it.

Whereby consequently it appears, that wholly he is not given to covetousness,
but to a certain spyce thereof to a desire to have. Likewise he is inclined to
Lechery. For with three women specially he shall have to do, but some times (by
natures impedimet) he shall not project his seed, although he be very desirous
thereunto. He is much disposed also to glottony chiefly to catyng of herbs and
in his meat doth greatly love them.

Furthermore note here that the premises do not only belong to the man, but to
the woman also subject to that constellation. Concernyg his life and manner
thereof. He shall be long sick, and shall have a payne in his heart. He shall
have three special sickennesses. The first when he.xx. years of age. The.ij.
when he is.xlvij. The.iij. and last, when he is.lxxx. Touching his good
fortune, he shall be in great estimation and honour. He shall have many
children, among al he shall have a twin or two borne at one birth, and of
them he shall see the third generation. He shall atteyn to his fathers
enheritaunce. In all his affairs he shall prosper and daily he shall see his
goods increase. He shall come into the world with his own star, that is to
say, he shall enjoy all things according to the influence of his sign. He
shall have much trouble in the water. He shall fall into a river but he shall
eskape drowning. He shall lose the most part of all his goods and shall fall
into the hands of his enemy and sometimes into hands of a woman a she enemy.
He shall be bitten with a beast in the midst of one of his fingers of his
right hand, and shall dye an exile out of his country. His most derest friend
beloved above others he shall less, and he shall be wonderfully troubled with
deuilles and evil spirits.

The second Chapter describes the condition of the tail of Sagitarius,
which is.xxiij. particular sign called Albeyda, the 23 particular sign
and hath vij. stars fixed in this manner. He that is borne in this sign,
first touching the disposition of his body. He shall have a body comely, a
ruddy face, red hear, narowe eye-browes, eyes like a Cat, he shall be
bald, and beautiful to behold, naturally marked upon the head, his left
side, and upon his right nostril.

After the disposition of the mind he shall be very ready to anger, and therein
also shall be very sonbden, and the payne being past, he will soon be appeased.

He shall be of an excellent wit, and naturally given to the exercise of
riding and shotynge. He shall not he circumspect in his doings, nor yet
foreseing in things that may happen. He shall have much payne in his guts,
and in his head, especially he shall suffer three several sickennesses. The
first when he is.xxj. years old. The second when he is.lxij. years of age.
And the third when he is.lxxx. And touching his good fortune, if he do not
take away or remove the natural mark which shall be upon his right buttock,
or right nostrell, then his Constellation shall be prosperous. But if the
said mark be violently removed from the place, then his fate shall be
hindered and empeched. He shall be valiant in arms, and therein also
victorious. But if the hour of Saturne do concur with Saturne in his
nativity, he shall be impotent by reason of the influence of that planet, and
therefore shall with great labour attain to any commodity, and with much
difficulty acquire his former good luck. But yet not withstanding the
impediment of Saturne, if the marks aforesaid be not taken away yet he shall
obtain the victorious feats aforesaid. But if his mother parhappes do take
away that mark from the places aforesaid, some evil hap may chance unto
him. For he shall have much a do to repell the influence of Saturne. The said
marks do vehemently resist the malice of the planet by reason of their
notable virtue.

So that Saturne shall do no great hurt although he do some hinder. And
touching the evil fortune of the borne in this Sign of Sagitarius. He shall
be in many troubles. He shall be hurt with whotte burning iron.

He shall be in danger of Thieves not only by traueylynge by the way, but
also in Cities. He shall also lose and forgo many possessions purchased by
him self, which shall be confiscate and taken from him through the malice of
certain natural marks, whereof one shall be in his stones.

And another upon his left side, by force whereof, he shall not long after lose
his sight.

Likewise thou shalt have in remembrance this rule following, touching the
tail of Sagitarius, generally apperteyninge to all men borne in this sign.
And first thou shalt know that if it happen he be borne in the second hour of
the day, not withstanding the premises he shall be foul and evil favoured.
He shall be bald, and his Children also shall be bald, by reason of the marks
aforesaid, whereof the one shall be upon his ribs, and the other upon his
left side. Also by force of this constellation, he shall be very lecherous, and
shall be diseased with a great infirmity. but he shall recover. In like manner
touching his good fortune, he shall have two Children borne at one birth. His
possession and living shall be indifferent, for sometimes it shall be
diminished, and sometimes increased. All these things thou shalt diligently
note, over and besides the things contained in the two Chapters aforesaid.

In the third Chapter entreatyng of Sagitarius judgement touching the male.
There is to be noted that he that is borne in this Sign, shall have a merry
and pleasant countenance.

Likewise, touching the disposition of the mind, he shall be gentle,
faithful, meek, liberal mixte with stubburnesse, by reason whereof, he shall
be of great authority, gentle, kind, courtelyke, and a great bankettour, by
reason of which his courtesy many well repair unto him, and be gestes at his
table. And by means of his liberality he will be a bountiful geuer of
Horses and other fourefooted beasts. He shall be very ingenious, wyttye,
artificial, sobre, grave, painful, and careful of his affairs. He shall
be subtle and very ware about his doyings. So that he will not disclose his
secreates to no man, but secreatelye will keep them to him self, the same will
very finely keep hid in his breast, for that almost he is mistrustful all
men.

He shall be with many vices encombred, because he is naturally given to be a
great fornicatour, and one that will be soon angry, and yet soon appeased
again, and when his anger is once done, then he will utter much fair and
gentle talk somewhat joined with couetouusnes. He shall be skabbye and very
full of ytche. He shall be aflected with two notable strong sickennesses. The
one when he is.xxxiij. years of age, which shall be so vehement that he
shall stand in great hazard of life, which if he eskape, then shall he have
the second, which shall happen when he is four skore and eyghte years of
age, whereof he shall dye. Semblably, touching his good fortune. The first
Child that he shall have, shall be a son. He shall have to his friend a Pier
of a realm, with whom he shall dwell in household and shall possess other
men goods. In like manner chynge his evil fortune, he shall be in danger
of three several frayes, and her that should be his first wife he shall not
enjoy. And by the malice of others he shall be in displeasure with his friend
aforesaid, and yet in the end he shall overcome their malice, and be
reconsiled to his frendshyppe again. He shall be hurt with Iron unless
warily he take heed thereof.

Sunday is his contrary day, therefore upon that day let him attempt no
new enterprise, nor wash his head, or put on any new apparel.

The fourth Chapter of this present Treatise describes the Judgement of
Sagitarius touching the female. And here to learn for to know the
disposition of her body, you must repair to the Chapters of the head and
tail of Sagitarius (which is before recited) where you shall find many
things spoken of the female borne in this Sign.

And touching the disposition of the mind, she shall be very much given to
the Arts of Magic, and to Witchecrafte, and by reason of the subtlety of
her wit, she shall put the same Arts in practyse. She shall be very
cursed, careful, merciful, chyldebearynge and a great Liar. She shall incur
great peril, especially for one offence that she shall commytte, for which
offence she shall be brought to Judgement: Which peril if she eskape, then
she shall live till she be three score and.viij. years old. She shall fully
accomplish her fate.

And although she be subecte unto much malice and danger, yet she shall
obtain the victory over them all. She shall have two husbands, whereof the
second shall be the better. Sunday shall be her unfortunate day, and for
that cause, let her attempt no new enterprise or other notable or new
thing.

The fifte and last Chapter makes rehearsal of the general Fortune of
Sagitarius. And first the borne in this Sign shall be Fortunate, both in
the law of GOD, and also in the law of the World.

He shall be happy in all kinds of Marchaundyse, especyallye in that Art
that chyefelye uses the Press, and in Tailors craft. Also in the Drapers
science. Chyefelye in clothes of fayreste Colour, if they be retayled
percelle meal by the Yard, or Elle.

Also in the Bouchers occupatyon, and Beasts which are accustomed to be
sold in the Shambles. This Sign is also Cholerycke by nature, and therefore
the borne in this Sign is naturally Cholerycke, by reason whereof he is whotte
and dry. And he shall have a great payne and gryefe by means of a soore
Impostume in the Lunges. And also of a consuming and vehement Ague, which is
called Hectica.

And also of an inflammation that shall proceed from the Lounges, according to
the quality of this Sign.

The apparelles and the colours which ought to be most used of the borne
in this Sign, is Gray, Browne, Yelowe or Red, which Colours by reason of
the heate and Fire, are most apt, most necessary, and convenient.

The one half of the life shall be fortunate, and the other half
unfortunate, not only in days, and hours, and in Months, or Weeks, but
also in whole years by the number of six. That is to say: by six and six.
Six good years, and six bad, years.

The Male or Female that is borne in this Month, has his special Fortune
placed in the West. And therefore towards that part of the World let him
dyspose all his doings, concerning his House, his Door, and his Bed, and
all his special affairs, and notable acts. c

The third, when he is one and twenty. The fourth, when he is thyrtye.

The fifte, when he is six and thyrtye. The sixte, when he is four and
forty. The.vij. when he is six and forty. The.vij. when he is.lx. And then
by force of his constellation. He shall dye through the weakness of his
members.

Moreover, touching his good fortune he shall have two sons, and shall
receive inheritance from his Progenitors. And his end shall be better then
his beginning. He shall be naturally given to the marchaundyze of Goats,
and therein shall be both fortunate and lucky, if he will diligently follow
the same traffic.

Likewise, touching his evil fortune, he shall be subject to the hand of
his enemies. He shall be depriued of one of his members, and thereby shall be
maimed. And before the time of his death, he shalll suffer many and sundry
great troubles at the hands of a noble man.

The third Chapter determines the judgment of Capricornus touching the male.
And for the man child borne in this sign, there is nothing found certain,
touching the disposition of his body in this Chapter, and therefore recourse
must be made, to the Sign wherein the male Child is borne.

That is to say, to the head of Capricornus, or else to the tail, and there
the truth concerning his corporal disposition may be found.

And yet not wythstandynge (over and beside the premises) such one hath a
little head, hollow eyes, and a soft speech. And touching his mind he shall
be very incredulous harde of belief, in so much as them that swear, and
confirm their sayings with other, he shall not credit. And therefore like as
he shall not believe others, even so it is as meet that other shall be as
harde of belief to him, and shall not credit his words though he bind them
with oaths. He shall naturally be very subtell and secrete in all his
affairs, and therein shall be a subteil and crafty deceyuour, and a bold
sufferer and bearer of adversity. Likewise he is naturally covetous, ireful,
and therein very soubden and mischievous, vsynge a mischievous and ungracious
stomach, and therefore with great difficulty he shall return to his former
quiet. And not withstanding the aforesaid vices he shall be naturally given
to be civil, honest, amiable, and pleasant. Moreover, touching his life and
manner thereof, he shall be full of sickennes. But if he eskape one very
vehement sickennes (which shall happen when he is twenty years of age) he
shall live by force of this Constellation, eight and fifty years unless some
natural impediment of any particular or universal cause opposite do occur
and happen. His life shall be shortened by reason of the truncation and
cutting of some of his members.

He shallbe married to two wives, and the second he shall marry, when he is
one thirty years of age, which shall be his better Wife, by whom he shall be
greatly enryched. He shall enter into other men labours, and enjoy
goods gotten by others.

He shall tread the ground of many Countries, and at length shall return
to his own Country, and to the place of his nauitie with great gain and
substance. He shall have to do with much treasure, and shall enjoy part of
the same.

Touching his evil fortune, he shall suffer much adversity in the place
where he was borne. And for that he is naturally subtyle, and of myschieuous
mind. He shall suffer much trouble and yet shall overcome it well enough.
His first Wife shall dye before he be one and thyrtye years old. Sunday is
his contrary and unfortunate day. Therefore upon that day let him
attempt no new fact, or any notable enterprise.

He seems to be of a melancolycke or earthye Complexion. And therefore he
has his Fortune chyefelye disposed towards the North part.

And here thou shalt diligently note, that he which is borne in the end of
this Sign, shall be borne in Adulterye. And this Sign hath no power in the
nativity of women, but only of the males.

The fourth Chapter of this tenth Treatise descrybeth the Judgement of
Capricornus, touching the female. And thou shalt note that the woman-borne in
this Sign, has nothing in this present Chapter that is certain touching
the disposition of her body. And therefore look in what part of this sign
soever she be borne, there thou shalt find her natural and corporal
disposition. And therewyth also thou shalt have recourse unto the next
Chapter ensuynge, and the difference shall be found to be great between both
the kinds.

For as much as the bodily disposition, as well the stature as the other
composition of either kind is indifferent and equal. Moreover touching the
disposition of the mind. The woman Child borne in this sign shall be very
wise, and a geuer of good counsel, in so much as by reason of her great
wisdom and consideration she shall be acceptable to all sorts of men. She
shall attain to a good fate and constellation joined with much joy, and
mean of her wit. She shall bring her devises to good effect. She shall be
naturally given to be of cursed heart, very whotte and wilful specially in
those things touching the disposition of her wit and policy and thereby
very desirous to know such things as be most pleasant unto her with her
neighbours, and specially such as be most acquainted with her. She shall be
courteous and friendly. She shall be soon abashed and desirous to see the world,
therefore shall travel in unknow places. She shall receive hurt of a four
footed beast, whereof if she eskape she shall live four skore years.
Likewise touching her good fortune, she shall be called a mother of Children for
that by force of her constellation, she shall be chyldebearynge and apt to
Children especially to sons. She shall also be abundaunte in four footed
beasts, and after she is passed the age of forty years, her time following
shall be more prosperous. And concerning her evil fortune. She shall be hurt
of four footed beasts, and shall be very fearful upon the water. Her luck
over her Cattle shall not be very prosperous. Sunday is her unfortunate day,
and therefore upon that day let her attempt no special matter, especially of
any great effect.

The.v. Chapter of this.x. treatise having his title of the general and
universal fortune of Cappricornus, is chiefly prosperous in husbandry, and in
all kinds of Beasts and Cattle, concerning the same, and in all weighty and
ponderous matters touching earth, and that which is possible to be done with
earth, with stones with wodd, and with the hydes of the beasts before
remembered. Likewise, in bying and selling of grain, and other heavy matters
abundant upon the earth, and especially growing in the same. This sign is
prosperous in dull and heavy beasts as Asses, Swine, Oxen, and such like, and
in all kynds of works possible to be done with great and painful labour. The
borne in this sign shall be more healthful in travel then in doing
nothing. Likewise this sign over and besides the particular events, is much
disposed to Impostumes of the stomach, to the Cough, and to inflammations of
the Liver. Also his time touching his indifferent Fortune, is divided into two
principal parts, not only in days, weeks and months, but also in years,
for the time is divided by the number of five, because continually there
shall be five good years and five bad. This sign also extends his Fortune
towards the Southe. And therefore let him dyspose all his wholle affairs (if
he mind to prosper) that way. And from time to time let him use to wear
Black garments.

Aquarius the.xi. celestial and principal sign.


water-bearer

THis.xj. Treatise making mention of the.xj. Sign called Aquarius, is divided
into three principal parts, comprehendynge.vj. several Chapters. The.j.
conteyneth the head of Aquarius. The.ij. part the belly. And the.iij. the
tail. The.iiij. the male. The v. the female. The.vj. and last, the common and
general fortune thereof.

The.j. Chapter making declaration of the head of Aquarius, being the.xxvj.
particular Sign, has two stars framed in this sort, and is called Astrad.
Where is to be noted, yt who so ever is borne in this sign, shall be beautiful
in the face and body, having a natural mark in the head, the breast, and
left foot. The colour not altogether white, but somewhat disposed to black, to
the colour of Honny. Touching the disposition of the mind very well learned,
but naturally unjust a doer of much wrong, very desirous to walk after meals.
And not withstanding the natural inclination to the doyng of wrongs, yet he
is of nature godly, pitiful, patient, and a lover of companions, and yet
somewhat inclined to the contrary, as to impiety and godlynes, iniquity and
right, vnrighteousnes, justice and mercy. He shall be so pitiful that he shall
accuse no man, but rather be an excuser. He shall naturally suffer an ache in
the Head, and a payne of the Heart. He shall have two natural sickennesses.
The first, when he is twenty years of age. The second, when he is fifty. He
shall be greatly honoured, and from many troubles, which he shall suffer,
almighty GOD shall mercifullly deliver him. And his Fortune shall be
indifferent. That is to say, some time having sufficient, and at other times
also he shall lack.

Also, a Dog shall grievously byte him upon his Thyghe or Leg.

He shall wander into a strange land, and in the myddest of his wealth and
substance much adueruersitie shall happen.

The second Chapter of this present Treatise describes the Belly of
Aquarius, which is the.xxvij. particular Sign called Alscadabra, and has
xij. stars formed in this sort. Who so ever is borne in this sign shall have
a good body well complexioned and made. And this body shall be White
naturally, and shall have some natural mark in his Face, Back, and Elbow.
His Body shall be naturally full of holes, shall have upon his head a blow
or strype with a sword or dagger. This man shall be very wise, meek chaste,
and shamefaste. And shall love no vanities, but rather shall embrace truth and
virtue.

He shall fear GOD, and desire to do rather good then evil, to which good
qualities he is naturally given. And by reason he is tender, he shall have no
natural force to do any actual or corporal labour, and consequently not
given to walk much. He shall be much pained in the rains of his back. He shall
have iij. principal diseases. The.j. when he shall be.xxix. years of age.
The.ij. when he is.xxxvij. The.iij. and last when he is lxxxx. Concerning his
good fortune, that although he shall enjoy in his own country no kind of
office or promocion, yet in a strange country he shall attain to much
honour. Concerning his evil fortune, he shall suffer much trouble, and sundry
discommodities over and besides the biting of a Dog or some other beast,
either upon his arm or leg. He shall have much evil fortune by means of
his Parents, for they shall be taken from him by death, and from them shall
receive no kind of inheritance or substance. And by force of this
Constellation, he shall end his life in a strange Country, and in the water.

The third Chapter of this treatise descrybeth the Tail of Aquarius, being
the.xvij. particular Sign of Heaven called Algassarall, which hath two Stars
placed in this manner. Where is to be noted that who so ever is borne in this
Sign. First touching his bodies disposition, shall be fair of body, and of
a ruddy face, short in stature and somewhat bald.

Touching the quality of the mind he shall be naturally very lecherous,
and greatly given to the love of women, vehemently desirynge their company.
A great Surfetour, greatly occupyinge him self in bankettynge and Belly
cheer, frequenting the same without measure.

He shall be very covetous and desirous to have, for what he sees he will covet
to have. Which vices not withstanding yet given to quietness, greatly embrasinge
peace and concorde, and much abhorrynge discord, avoiding the means
thereof, as much as lies in his power. Likewise, he shall be endowed with a
certain frenzy, and shall by a natural sickness in a strange Country yield
furth his breath.

Three principal terms or diseases he shall suffer. The first, when he is
twenty years of age. The second, when he is five and forty. And then he
shall be in great danger of death. But if he eskape the same, he shall live
one hundred and twenty years, and three days. Likewise, touching his good
fortune, he shall live a lunge space with his Wife and shall get much
substance and riches. And although he shall have great loss, yet he shall
have plenty. Touching his evil fortune, he shall be without a head, and
depriued of his Parents, and Brother. In a strange Country he shall end his
life, as before is remembered.

The.iiij. Chapter entreats of Aquarius judgment touching the male. And to
learn the disposition of the body, recourse must be made to those things
that be reported in the three Chapters before mentioned, where very largely is
intreted the particular fortune of Aquarius. Over and besides he shall have a
great audacity of speech. Semblably touching the disposition of the mind,
and especially concerning his life, he shall be covetous, lecherous, prone to
anger, contencious, a liar, because he shall speak one thing and do another,
and that shall be by force of his principal constellation.

Not withstanding the said vices, he shall be very ware and circumspect, wise,
pollityke, trusting in his own wisdom, and shall have a certain
excellency of art and knowledge. Careful over his affairs even from his
youth.

Singulerlye beloved, courtelyke honest and good. Honest he shall be for that
he shall be conversant with the honest. Good he shall be by virtue of the
Constellation, and therefore naturally inclined to goodness, singulerly
embracing all things good and honest. Merciful, for that he shall extend the
same to such as have need of mercy, specially Orphans and wydowes, to whom
he shall not only be pitiful, but a benefactour and defender. He shall
wander into many places, and thereby by little and little shall be enriched.

Likewise, touching his life and manner thereof. He shall have two special
sickennesses. The first when he shall be six and thyrtye years of age,
which shall be very vehement and dangerous, whereof if he be acquieted,
then he shall feel the other, when he is four skore ten years of age, of that
last disease without fail he shall dye. In like manner touching his good
Fortune, he shall be happy, for that he shall be skilful in Art and
knowledge by reason whereof, he shall attain to preferment. He shall have the
charge and government of many and diverse sommes of money, and by a strange
man shall unlooked for enjoy much treasure. And concerning his evil
Fortune, his abode shall not continue in the place of his own nativity, but
wandering abroad shall perambulate strange places, and in them shall
continue. And not withstanding this his peregrination and dewellynge in such
places is indifferent either to good or evil Fortune. Therefore as seems to
me, it tends indifferentlye both to good and evil fortune. He that is thus
borne, his first wife shall not long tarry with him, and after she is dead,
all things shall have moore prosperous success with him.

And the loss also of this Wife, as specially I do note, seems not to me
to belong to evil Fortune, but to indifferent.

Likewise, upon the water he shall be very vnfortune, which by nature he shall
abhor. He shall be enwrapped with many and sundry dangers and amongst
others specially with his wife and woman. Saturday is his contrary and
unhappy day. Therefore upon that day he must attempt no notable enterprise or
fact, nor yet upon that day wash his Head, put on new garments, or do
other novelties remembered and spoken of in the treatise before.

The.v. Chapter of this.xj. treatise descrybeth the judgment of Aquarius
touching the woman. And here is to be noted, that the woman borne in this
sign touching the disposition of her body, shall be delicate and tender, and by
force of this constellation shall have a mark in her right hand. She shall
be true, faithful, constant, wyttye, and of a good complexion, and disposed
to all goodness, specially to mercy and pity. Likewise, touching her life and
manner thereof, she shall have a great disease in her eyes, and shall have two
special sickennesses, whereof the chiefest and most dangerous shall be when
she is of eyghtene years of age. And the second she shall have (if she
chance to eskape the first) when she is four skore years old, and then shall
dye according to the effect of this constellation.

Also touching her good fortune, she shall abound in Children. She shall be
enryched with other men's goods, and shall attain to an indifferent wealth.
When she is.xv. years of age, Fortune shall favour her better, and she shall
enjoy a better state. Much evil Fortune shall happen unto her in her time,
and amongst others, her good name shall be blotted with infamy, and shall be
defamed with the corruption of her virginity, and shall have experience of
strange places, and be very odious to her enemies. Her first Husband shall
put her from him. She shall be hurt with four footed beasts, or shall be
very near the same. But it seems to me she shall passiuelye receive a hurt
or danger.

The.vj. Chapter entreats of the common and general fortune of Aquarius,
which consists special in tillage and in beasts meet for tillage together,
and in all beasts of great quantie and fatness, as Asses, Moyles, Swyne, Oxen,
Kine, and such like. Likewise, fortunate in buildings, in earth, in stone, in
wod, in hydes of beasts, specially the beasts before remembered. Furthermore, it
is commonly and for the most part fortunate in those things which be done with
great labour and exercise. This sign is fortunate toward the west, therefore
they must dispose their affairs that way. The Sunday is unfortunate for
them, therefore that day let them not do any new notable work, as is said
in the other treatises. They shall be vexed with long fevers quotidians and cold.
According to the virtue of the constellation, their time is divided into.xv. so
that the first.xv. years going before, are good and lucky, the.xv. years
following are unlucky and unfortunate: and nevertheless in the good fortune of the
first.xv. years the Sunday is always unfortunate. As touching the good fortune
of the first.xv. years, among the unfortunate days, the Twesday and Saturday
have the principal point in the good Fortune. They be naturally fanguine,
whote, and moist, and therefore they must wear red and black garments.

Pisces the.xii. celestial and principal sign.


depiction of fish

THe.xij. treatise of this Book speaks of the.xij. and last principal
sign of Heaven, called Pisces, and is divided into two principal parts, the
Head and the Tail. This treatise conteyneth five Chapters. The first, makes
mention of the Head of Pisces. The second of the Tail. The.iij. of the
judgment of Pisces for the male. The iiij. of the judgment for the female.

The.v. and last, of the common fortune of Pisces, both of the male and female
together.

The first Chapter makes mention of the Head of Pisces, which is the.xxix.
particular sign of Heaven, called Algafayser, and conteyneth two stars thus
set. He that is borne in this sign, shall be White, and soft of body, and
namely of a white face. He shall have a large breast, a comely beard, a fair
forehead, fair eyes, more black then white. He shall have many natural
marks on his body, by the which according to the virtue of the Constellation
rulynge, he shall be naturally inclined to fidelity and wisdom, but rather he
shall be faithful and wise in deed. Moreover, he shall have a natural mark
upon his Elbow or in his Foot, and shall peradventure lose one of his
members, or else it shall fail him. He shall be of a smiling countenance,
merry, and loving pleasure and play, naturally inclined to equity: but yet
covetous according to the conjecture taken of his Constellation. And though
he be naturally subject to the payne of the Head, he shall be healthful, of a
sound wit, and of a wholesome complexion. By the virtue and lyuelynesse of
his complexion, he shall live naturally three skore and ten years without any
notable sickennesse, saving the head ache, which he shall often times have.
As concerning his good fortune, he shall get much money, and possess many
possessions. He shall have three Wives, and shall be troubled with the third.
When he shall be in publycke offyce, many would hurt him, and yet they
shall do him no hurt, because of their weakness, and finallye he shall
surmount them: for their envy and malice shall have no power against him. As
concerning his evil Fortune, he shall fall into many adversities and
troubles by his Constellation: Yet not so but that all these fore said things
in this Chapters be general as touching the influence and efficatie of the
Sign, and that they do appertain generally to all that be borne in this
Sign. For if it chance that any be borne in the third hour of the day, as
touching the disposition of the body, he shall have a natural mark in his
Nostrils, and shall have lunge eyes. As concerning the disposition of his
mind and wit, he shall be a very suspect man harde of belief, and
therefore not believed.

As concerning the manner of his living, he shall have a great sickennes and
fervent in his Nostrils, so that by the feruentnes of it he shall dye where he
was borne. He shall have.iij. grievous sickennesses. The first at.xxvij. years.
The.ij. at.liiij. The.iij. at.lxx. years. And then he shall dye of this
sickness, if he eskape the other twain, or else be in great danger. As
concerning his good fortune, although by the effect of the Constellation, he
should fall into a river, yet he shall be saved from it, and shall rise out of
it again if he fall in, which thing belongs to his good fortune.

He shall have many Children. He shall be mighty, and rule in Ilandes.

By the mercy of GOD, and the goodness of the Constellation, he shall eskape
from all his trouble.

As concerning his evil fortune, he shall fall into a river as is aforesaid.
And also into the hands of a mighty man, and into much trouble. Yet not
wythstandynge that these things do appertain to his evil Fortune, they
shall have a good issue and end. For he shall be delivered from these
verations as before is said. Whereof it follows, that this fortune is evil by
accident. Furthermore, because of the mark that he shall have in his
Nostrils, he shall bury his Parents, which he shall lose according to his
Constellation. Which thing belongs somewhat to his evil Fortune.

He shall lose some of his temporal goods, which he shall have gotten with
great labour, and shall wholly be spoiled of them, or of the most part of
them.

The second Chapter makes mention of the Tail of Pisces, which is the.xxx.
and last particular Sign of Heaven called Luaten, having twenty Stars,
set and disposed in dew order, in such manner and form as here follows.

He that is borne in this sign in the first hour of the natural day shall be
fair of look, having fair eyes, fair face, and fair of all his body. He
shall naturally have many marks. As concerning the mind wit, he shall be
witty, and prudent, and amiable, his voice well sownyng, and liberal more
toward strangers then to his neighbours. Staungers shall have much riches of
him that is thus borne. He shall have three vehement sickennesses. The first
at.xxviij. years. The second at.lvi. The third and last at.lxxx. years.v.
months, at the second hour of the fifte month. He shall be a good while
without Children in wedlock, yet he shall have many. He shall have a charge in
a strange country: But he shall dwell in his own native country. And if it
chance he be borne at the second hour, than as touching the disposition of
his body, he shall be marked in the breast, and in his Finger.

As concerning the disposition of his mind, he shall have naturally all the
signs and marks that he shall have which is borne in the first hour, or in
another, saving the second hour, for he that is borne in the second, is
naturally liberal, and yet covetous.

As concerning the manner of his life, you must say of him that is borne in
the second hour, as of the other that is borne in another hour of this
sign. He shall be aboundaunte in vittayle and riches. He shall out live two
Wives that he shall marry, by whom he shall have his goods and possessions.
He shall be mighty and strong by Sea and by land, and shall have a son of
power and might, of whom he shall see great things, and shall have
generation of him. Some of his members shall be diminished: and if he eskape such
a passion, he shall fall no more into it, which things appertains to his good
fortune. And finally, he shall be delivered from all adversity.

Touching his evil fortune, he shall lose some of his goods by violence. He
shall fall into a river, whereoute he shall rise again, and shall take no hurt
at all, as is aforesaid. He shall come into the hands of a puysante man, from
whom he shall be delivered. He shall lose by violence much riches which he had
gotten, without recovery or hope of recovery.

The third Chapter determines of the judgment of Pisces for the male. The
man child borne in this Sign shall have a natural mark in his head shoulder,
or foot, and a scarre in the midst of his body, or some where else.

He shall be a player, merry, a dispyser of Fortune, very harde of belief,
lecherous beyond measure, and have great fansye to women, whereby he shall
suffer great contumelye and hynderaunce. He shall be furious and hasty to
anger: but as he is soon angry, so shall he be soon pacified again.

He is naturally covetous, hardy, standing in his own conceit, frendelye,
unkind, a liar. Yet not withstanding these vices he is witty, according to
his nature, avaricious, covetous and greedy of learning, eloquent, obstinate
in his learning, defending his conclusions obstinately and wittilye.

And though he have a small wit, yet it is ready, sharpe, and prompt. Such
a one borne thus is given to the company and love of good men, earnestly
loving his friends, and wyllynglye will venture him self for them, whereby he
shall suffer hurt and detriment. He shall have seven great syckennesses,
whereof three shall be very extreme, and specially the syxte, which he
shall have at four and thyrtye years of age. And if he eskape it, he shall
live.lxxxv. years, and.iij. months, and.xiij. days, he shall dye of the vij.
sickness. Until.xxxiiij. years of his age, he shall not be rich nor poor,
nor shall come to any honour. He shall be rich by the death of his kynsfolke.

He shall get much goods by his labour, travel, and notable industry.

He shall have the revenge of his enemies, and see the punishment of them. He
shall marry at.xxxiij. years, and if he marry before, he shall not keep his
Wife lunge, but shall marry another. He shall be called the father of
Children, and shall have many, yet he shall not have a son at the beginning.

If he will remedy his evil fortunes, and be delivered from them, he must
cal earnestly upon GOD, desiring mercy for Iesus Christ's sake, and by that
means he shall be delivered. In marriyng a Wife he shall be somewhat
unfortunate, because it shall not be expedient for him then, but in the age of
xxxiij. years as is said. He shall be hurt by his neighbor in his goods.
He shall have many suytes in the law, because of his getting: and shall suffer
much and diverse tribulation, and specially in his youth, wherein certain
things shall come luckily to pass with him. The Saterdaye shall be
unfortunate for him: Therefore that day he may not attempt nor take in hand
any new thing.

The.iiij. Chapter describes the judgment of Pisces for the female.

The maid that is borne in this sign, shall have a mark by nature in her head
or face. She shall be fervent and earnest very honest, loving the deckynge of
her body: desyryng to have brave apparel: hardy, eloquent, having a ready
tongue to speak, wyttye, wise, pitiful, merciful, faithful, amiable,
liberal, of a merry heart. She shall be tormented with the grypynge and
frettynge of the Belly, payne of the stomach, with the Lunatike passion or
Fransie, whereby she shall have great trouble the space of eyghte months:
and after that she is eskaped from it, she shall live two and seuentye years.
She shall comme to great honour, and have many Children, and shall be called
the mother of Children: yet hereof she shall have some misfortune: because her
first Child shall be a daughter and not a son according to the
constellation. As for the mans part being inclined to the contrary, and
surmountinge the natural complexion of this maid, sometime for the meetynge
of certain particular causes, which may alter the complexion of the man and
of the woman, and may sum thing change it. She shall be burned and hurt
with fire. And if it chance that her first Child be a son, he shall not
be a true male, because of the opposition and inclination of the mother,
whereof I have already spoken. At.xxv. years of her age, she shall have suit
with her father or mother, or against them both, if they live. The Saterdays
shall be contrary to her unlucky, therefore that day she may not begin any
notable work.

The.v. Chapter recites the common fortune of Pisces. They that be borne in
this sign, have their fortune, in art of a handy crafts man, and in
merchandise of cloth, if they be fair, also in metalls, and in merchandise of
flesh, and namely in merchandise of corn wheat and barley: and moreover in
horse, in divinity the civil law, they shall be subject to what sicknesses
burning, as to fevers, fretting of the belly, poison, specially at ye years of
44 68, they shall have 3 lucky days in ye weke, Monday, thursday friday, the
twesday saturday unlucky, ye wednesday sunday indifferet. Furthermore they have
6 good years 6 bad, they have their good fortune toward the south therefore they
must dispose their door, bed, such like affairs that way, they be choleric,
whereby they be bald, they must wear grey apparel or black, and not red,
grene, white, or blew.

Besides that which is written in the Prologue set before the treatises here
expressed by Chapters, you must number reken this letter N. among ye numeral
letters that signify ye number, and it is as much as two being compounds and
made twice of the letter. I.

Now, for to find the total or principal sign, you must divide the number
by.12. Of a thousand there remains the number of 4.

Of 900 nothing. Of 800 8. Of 700 4. Of 600 nothing. Of 500 8. Of 400 4. Of 300
nothing. Of 200 8. Of 180 nothing. Of 160 4. Of 140 8. Of 120 nothing. Of 100
4. Of 80 8. Of 60 nothing. Of 50 2. Of 40 4. Of 30 6. Of 20 8

The number that comes of the letters of number, must be divided by 30, for
to find the particular sign of the child that is borne, because there be 30
particular signs, and because of the tail of Virgo, which is divided into
two parts, whereof follows the division of the numbers by 30.

Of 1000 10. Of 900 2. Of 800 20. Of 700 10. Of 600 nothing. Of 500 20. Of 400
10. Of 300 nothing. Of 200 20. Of 180 nothing. Of 160 10. Of 140 20. Of 120
nothing. Of 100 10. Of 80 20. Of 60 nothing. Of 50 20. Of 40 10.

Furthermore, you must note that the number which comes of the numeral

HEre by the nature you must understand the inclination and natural
complexion, which specially we may conjecture by the colour of the body.
For naturally black men are fearful as the Ethiopians be.

White men also be timorous and fearful: and they that be of a mean
colour Black and White, be strong and bold. They that be yellow of the
colour of Gold be courageous as Lyons. And if they be to yellow, they be
malicious as Foxes.

They that be some what pale and darcke coloured be fearful: and this is
referred to the perturbation that comes of fear. They that be very pale,
and almost green for paleness be cold: and therefore they are vnapte to
moouynge, slow, and negligent to work. They that be of sanguine colour and
somewhat red, are nimble and ready to work. They that be of a fiery and
inflamed colour become out of their wits, and be like mad men, when they be to
much chafed. So you must coiecture of other colours that take part of the
aforesaid. They that desire to see many other signs tokens of the natural
inclination, must have recourse to Aristotles little book entitled of the
physiognomy: to the works of Galene, specially to his little book, where he
says that the manners of the mind do follow the temperature of the body.
Furthermore, you must note yt we have four humours, which Galene calls the
elements of living things yt have blood, to weet: blood, fleme, collor, the
melancholy humour. The blood is whote, moist sweet. The spettle called fleme,
is cold moist, without quality, as the water is, if it be not depraved. The
collor or flaua bilis is whote, dry bitter. The melancholy humour is cold, dry,
bitter earthy. The blood nourishes. The fleme helps the moving of the
joints. The collar cleanses makes clean the flematike excrements of the
bowels: provokes the power or strength excretiue.

The melancolicke humour helps the belly in his actions: For, because it is
eager and bitter, it constreyneth and presses the mouth of the Ventricle or
belly called the stomach, and makes it embrace and reteyne the meat, until
the digestion be made. The blood makes men moderate, merry, pleasant,
fair, and of a ruddy colour, which be called sanguine men.

The fleam makes men, slothful, sluggyshe, neglygente, drowsye, fat, and
soon to have gray Hears.

The Choler makes them angry prompt of wit, nymble, inconstant, lean
and of a quycke digestion. The melancolike humour, which is as it were the
substance, the bottom, and leese of the blood, makes men rude, churlyshe,
careful, sad, avaricious, deceyuours, traitors, envious, fearful, weak
hearted, and dreaming and imagining evil things, vexed with the trouble of
the mind as though they were haunted with a malignaunte spirit. These humours
than may be referred to the Phisonomye: for by them a man may know the
natural inclination of men. You may also refer thereunto the temperature of
ages. For the puerilitie or Chyldehode, which is from the birth unto fiftene
years or there about, is whote and moist. The adolescecie or youth, which
endures until five and twenty years, is of a good and mean temperature. The
youth or floryshynge age of mans state, which endures till five and thyrtye
years, is of a whote and dry temperature. The fourth age is the first part of
old age, which endures till forty and nyne years: and then men begin to
ware cold and dry, and like unto a plant that dries up and withers, and
they be called in Latyne Senes The second part of old age endures until
end of the life: and the men be called in Latin Seniores. And this age is also
divided into two or three degrees. They that be in the first degree, have yet
their green old age, which yet may handle and execute civil matters. They
be of the second degree, which draw them selves by little and little from the
said affairs because of their weakness. They of the third degree are in
extreme feebleness. If you desire to know any moore of the signs of
Phisognomie, you shall find them by diligent reading of authors.

The prediction of the manners and natures of men, by considering of their face
and other parts of their body.
Of the judgment of the head.
Saying that the head is the part that is most seen of al the parts of mans
body, Hypocrates in his.vj. book of common sicknesses, not without cause
shows how to judge of the whole body by the consideration of the head. For
that which is either greater or lesser then it ought to be is always faulty
and not good, and they that have this fault or lack, have also those things
that do evidently appartain to the faulty hurt minds. And now even as the
head which is little, is never without fault, so that which is great, is not
altogether parfite and good: but sometime good and sometime ill. It is a sign
of goodness or of wickedness.

But the best fashion is the round head, and somewhat low on both sides, as if
you should imagine a very round Sphere made of Ware to be somewhat lowe of
each side. The best form then and shape of a head, is that which is meanly
great, and hath a comely convenient roundness: which appears before and
behind somewhat lowe. The principal cause why the head is little, is the lack
of matter or substance. And the cause of the greatness of it, is the abundance
and superfluity of the substance and seed man. But if there be little matter
with the force of the first formatiue virtue, it shall be of a good form and
shape, and less evil, for as much as in the creature the noughtines of the
fashion is joined with smalenes of the head. The brain follows the form and
fashion of the skull. For if the skull be corrupt, the brain shall be also
corrupt. The head of man hath more brain proporcionallye then all other
beasts. The male hath more brain then the female. The head of man hath more
ioynynges then all other things: and the male more then the female. A well
fashioned head is like a mallet, whereof the fore part and the hinder part,
be lofty and high. The form or fashion of the mean ventricle, must be a
little pressed together, and so the cogitatiue is the more noble. If the form
before be lowe, the man hath no judgment. And the hinder part be lowe, he
hath no memory, and hath a weakness of moving his synowes, and consequently
of all his body: for by the force of the brain is declared the force of the
neck and synowes: and also the brodenesse of the shulders and of the breast,
and the parts of the sides called Hypocondria, which be ioynynges to the
liver and lunges. The head that is of a reasonable fashion augments the wit
and virtue, and declares a magnificence in the man: but when it is evil is
fashioned it shows the contrary.

The judgment of the head.
THey that have a great head, and yet not out of measure, are commonly fair
and well conditioned. They that have a great head out of measure be fools,
idiotes, dull heads. When the head is great proporcioned to the body, and
specially to the neck, so yt the neeke be strong, and meanelye great with the
sinews great strong, it is a very good sign. The head fashioned like a Sugar
lofe, declares the man to be paste shame, a devourer, bold and rash, which
thing comes of the heat and dryness of the brain. It is a another thing
when the head is great and the other members are not great accordynglye. The
head is of a good fashion, when the ventricle before is also of a good fashion,
and moyste enough. For the taking of the kinds comes of the moisture, and
the reteynyng comes of drynes in the part behind. The head with a mean
ventricle somewhat pressed together about the sides, declares the ventricle
cogitatiue to be ready to comprehend and devise, that which is comprehended,
and that because of the unity of the spirits that are in that place.

The head round signifies, mobility, vnstablenes, forgetfulness, small
discretion and little wisdom in the man, for sometimes the moving of the
spirits stays. The little head necessarily shows an evil sign, for as much
as it soon falls into a sickennes, because that in it there is little brain,
and the ventricles narowe, wherein the spirits to straightly kept do not
their office: for they are oppressed, inflamed, and choked up, wherefore they
imagine not well, they dispose nothing well, they have no memory. Such men are
commonly soon angry, are fearful, keep their anger long, by reason of the
great drought, and whote temperature of the brain. They take in hand false
matters they speak ill, have a double tongue. The lunge head without measure,
having the Organes a wry, and not right, notes vnshamefastnes and folly.
The head lowe and flat betokens insolency and dissolutnesse.

The head high before betokens pride. The head that hath as it were a hollow
whole behind and is lowe and hollow, declares man to be subject to anger and
deceit. The great head with a large forehead and a face like a Giant, is a
sign of a slow man, gentle, strong, and not easy to be taught. When the
head is right and almost flat in the myddest, and of a mean greatness, it
shows the man to have great wit, and to be courageous. If the head be in
all points of a good measure, it is a sign of a great wit and that the man
is sharpe and liberal. We mean the head not to great nor to small, but
according to the quantity and measure of the body.

The Judgment of the body by the colour.
BLacknes in a man like a glistering horne is a token of adustion as well in the
members as in the hear. A black colour shows the man to be of a small
courage in feats of war fearful and crafty and is to be compared to them
that dwell in the southe. A green colour, dark, or black, declares the man
ready and prompt to anger. Men that have a very red or red headed in
colour are subtle and crafty. As the common saying among the French men is
l'ay veu bein peu de petites gens humbles, rousseaux fideles, that is to say I
have scene few little me humble or lowly, few red headded men faithful and
true. They that have a pale and a dead face, and yet a red forehead and lowe
eyes, are altogether shamefaste. And to them you may attribute passion. The
white colour samewhat ruddy, signifies the man very strong and courageous.
Such are the northern men. The colour that is very white shows the man to be
contrary to virtue. A pale colour sygnifyeth the man to be without courage
in deeds of war, fearful, and a turner of his back, if syckenes be not
the cause of this paleness. When a browne colour is myxed with a pale, it
declares the man to be a blab of his tongue and a prater, soon angry, and a
speaker without any temperature. This colour then tends to an extreme folly.
They that be but a little red and freckled and have quavering and moouinge
lyppes and wide nostetrells be commonly courageous and ready to wrath and
anger: and to them also is passion attributed. A mean red colour notes a
ready and pregnant wit and understanding. They that be of a fyrye colour
or very near, keep their anger lunge and are harde to pacyfye or to be ruled
when they are angry. When the veins of the brain and of the temples be seen
and the eyes sanguyne, it is a sign that the man is subject to vehement
wrath, and that sometime he is folyshe out of his wyts. When the face is red,
it is a sign of shame or drunkenness you shall then know this colour by the
signs of the eyes.

The judgment of the hear by the substance.
THe hear smooth and thick betokens meekenes, cold and moisture. The
further that the brain is from heate, the more hearye is the head. The heate
of a man that goes to the upper parts percinge through from all parts goes
thorough the skin of the head and makes an humour to comme out of the holes
that it makes, and the finest part of this humour vanysheth away but the
grosser remains within and is turned in to hear. Which is harder than the
skin and that by the means of the outward cold, the hear is as big as
the pore or hole, and as lunge as the violence and force of thrusting it out is
great. When the hear comes out slowlye, it is a sign of a moyste
complexion and not sanguyn. If they come a pace the body shall enclyne rather
to dryness than to moisture. And when heate and drougth do join together the
hear comes out the sooner, and therewithal grosser. The multitude of hears
declares a hot man and the grossnesse of them shows him to be full of
fumosite. And therefore that happens more in yonge men than in yonge
children. For in children the substance is more vaporous than moist. But in
young men it is contrary wherefore contraries follow their contraries. Abundance
of hear in young children shows their complexion that increases and
augments, to tend to melancolines. The curlinge of the hear signifies
heate and drines, comes of the crokednes of the pores. The hears that be
right up in the head the hear also that stands upright in the rest of the
body betoken fearfulnes in ye man. The hears right or thick declare the man
to be cruel and when they be rare then they show him to be a deceiuour and if
they be curled and turning upward it is a sign of a hoate complexio. And they
be fast together appearing up on the forehead they declare a mighty courage and
a brutal as the courage of bears. The hears that be pressed down and
couched together upon the middle of the forehead rising together upon the top
of the head show the man to be hoate, and without knowledge of honesty. The
hears that be thine slender and few in number beside the temples declare the
man to be cold and without force. The reason is for in that place, are the
great arteres that place ought naturally to be hoot, and consequently to have
abundance of hears for as much as the generation and growing of hears
comes of heate. Therefore when the hear is thin and slender in that place,
there is lack of heate, and this ought to be ascribed unto women for they
never have a bondance of hear in that place. The hear thin and hard beside
the temples declare the man to be cold and fearful. And when they be thycke
in the same place and beside the ears it is a sign of heate whoredom. And
they be there stable, black or yellow they signify a violet mind or courage.
If they be gross and somewhat whiter, it is a sign that the man shall be
indocible whom men shall not rule nor tame. The abundance of gross hears
pressed down, with the abundance of hear in all the rest of the body, do
show in an infant a melancolines to come, that is to say, that he shall fall
into a fury or folly. When hears grow in a man that is already aged it is a
token of great adustio by nature, yt which engenders folly privation of wit
and sense. Women are never bald, for their nature is like the nature of
infantes or children. The gelded men likewise never wax bald for they be
almost of the nature of women. The hears yt are made curled by touching like
unto the wrinkling of pepper do sygnifye weakness in the virtue digestiue
and age coming hastelye on.

The Judgment of the colour of the hear.
THE signification of the colour of the hear is not verified for the most part
but in temperate climates. Yet a man may Judge thereof some thing in every
climate in making comparison of men of ye climate unto other as to ye Flemynges
Ethiopians. For the Ethiopians be black their hear is curled and extreme
crooked. Yet therefore their complexion shall not be hoate but this heate and
curlynge of hear comes of an outward heate.

For they be rather cold, for as much as the heate goethe out by vapours. But
Fleminges which dwell in cold regions, are whit and have their hear some what
of a yellow colour flat and plain. And yet for all that we may not say that
generally they be cold but rather that their complexion is very hot: for the
heate is within them as it comes to pass in winter c. A white colour
signifies either a vehement cold, as it appears in old men that have white
hears or else a great dryenesse, as it happens in things vegetatiue when
they dry up, the which for their blacknes or greenesse turn in to whiteness.
And that never happens unto men but at the end of sicknesses dryinge up.
Hears have four principal colours to weet black red, aberne and white or
gray. The regions and air do some thing in the aperation of the hears. The
whytenesse of hears comes by want of natural heate or by rotten fleam.
And is a sign some time of wanton manners and conditions. The black hear
comes of superabundant coler aduste or of blood aduste, red hear
sygnifyethe heate which is not aduste for they be of a diminished heate The
hears that be very red declare the man to be a crafty deceiuour, depriued
of wit colerycke, full of wrath and furious without reason. The hears that
be of a chest nut colour declares the man to be upright, just and well
beloved of men. Golden hears, that is to say yellow hear or of the colour
of gold, come of cold diminished. The abern coloured or yellow hear hold
something of cold, and the heate is dead in the moist, and this is referred
unto infantes. The people of the north notwythstandinge have this heate
because of the region. And therefore this must be noted for such things do
many times deceive the Iudgers of Phisyognomye. The blackenesse of hears
which is like to a bryghte horne with some roughnes and crookednes declares
the heate of the complexion: but the hear that is only black sygnifyeth
fearfullnesse and covetousness. The colour that is as it were a bright
glistering horne, is like to the nature of Mars. Nevertheless the hears be not
gross, but somewhat fine of the finesse of the humours, and are made black
with a great heate, which thing appears in bread tosted upon the coals
because the moisture in gone. But when the rest of the body is to heary then
Mars Saturne do employ their forces. And such men are commonly thieves and
robbers and when they have their breast only hearie, it is a sign of heate of
a great courage. When all the body is covered with hear, it is rather a sign of
ye courage a fowerfooted beast then of a ma: when the nod of ye neck is
covered with hear even from the head it is a sign of strength and of courage
and in that the man is like to the lion.

The Judgment of the forehead.
THe face is the only party where the man only becomes. They that have a
great forehead are commonly slothful and are compared to oxen. They that have
a broad forehead commonly chang their mind and if it be very great, they be
fools of little discretion and rude of wit. Understand take this brodnes with
the just quantitye of the length and largeness. They that have a round forehead
are subject to wrath and anger specially if their forehead be open plain. And
they be also insensible like unto Asses. They yt have a little forehead and
narrow be fools, doltes, not easily to be taught, slovens, devourers like
swine. They ye have a meetly long forehead have good wits are easily to be taught
but yet they are some what vehement as dogs be. They yt have square forehed of a
mean greatness for mall to the head are virtuous, wise, and courageous like
Lions. They that have a plain and flat forehead and with out wrinkle will not
bow, be without wit contumelious, and much subject unto anger, obstinate, and
full of contention. They that have a lunge and stretched out forehead be
flatterers and such have their part of passions. They that have a darcke and
covered forehead be audatious and terrible. A lowe forehead and obscure,
makes the man ready to weep, and in that he folowethe the pecockes. The
forehead that is great hath ever much gross flesh, and contrary the little
forehead hath fine thin flesh. The little forehead and finesse of the skin
betoken a fine wit and wauerynge. Now than the spirit or wit, is a fine
body engendered of the vapours of the blood. And this spirit or wit bears
the virtues of the soul to the spiritual mebers. And therefore where there be
gross humours there a good wit cannot be. When a forehead is to much
wrinkled, it is a sign of a man without shame, and this wrinkling comes of to
much moisture, although that sometime it proceeds of dries, if the same be
not in all ye forehead, it declares the man to be full of anger, and very
subject to anger and kepeth lunge his anger and hatred without cause. They
that have a short forehead, the temples and the checks flat pressed down,
large chawbones he subject to the disease called the kings evil. They that
have as it were a little cloud on ye top of their nose or in ye midst, as
narrow are coumpted angry men as bulls and Lions. A high forehead large and
lunge signifies increase of goods. A low forehead is no sign of a manly ma.
The forehead that is some what swelling up about the temples with a grossenes
of fleeshe with the Jaws also full of fleeshe, declares a great courage
anger, pride and a gross understanding.

The Judgment of the eyebrowes.
THE eyebrowes are places in the jointure of the bones, and therefore they
grow in many men when they be old. The eyebrowes that be very heary declare
folyshnes of manners and mischief. The eyebrowes thick with abundance of hear
joined to the beginning of the nose do sygnifye a great adustion, such men are
of an evil nature. If the eyebrows yt be high upward do descend to the
beginning of the nose and above are rising to the teples, it is a sign that
heat drougth do rule, and such men be crafty malefactors If ye eyebrows
descend downwardon ye side of the nose, rising upward on the side of the
temples, they declare men to be without shame and dull and that because of a
furious heate. The eyebrows thin and of a competent greatness, declare the,
temperature and goodness of the humours and they that have them so are of a
great wit. The eyebrowes lunge show the man to be arrogant and without
shame, but when they be lunge with much hear they sygnifye the man to think
and to have his mind upon great things. The eyebrowes which descend
downward on the side of the nose, and raised upward on the side of the
temples, and hanging downward on both sides declare the man to be without
shame envious, folyshe insatiable, and like unto hogs. The eyebrowes which
descend crooked on the side of the nose declare the man to be witty in naughty
things, and when they be crooked on the out side of the eye, they signify the
man to be recreatife merry. If ye eyebrowes be right as though they were drawn
with a lyne and log it is a sign of an evil mind weak and femnine and as
women's minds be. When the eyebrowes comme together, they show the man to be
very pensyfe and not very wise. Hanging eyebrows and falling down upon the
eyes, declare envy: but if they be crooked they sygnifye a small memory. The
eye brows that be round compassed like a bow, so that they join almost to
the nose, declare the man to be subtle witty and studious. The eyebrowes
thynne meet or measured by the diamenter, and great betoken a good wit.

The Judgement of the eyelyddes.
THE eyelyddes are set above the great coueringes of ye small veins by a
gross vapour. The fynenesse of the skin declarethe the substance of the
matter that is to say of the humours and that coler has the dominion. And
they that have such hear, be malycyous and vicious unto whom you may also
ascribe the other passyons of colere.

And when that place is very fleshye (as the eyes of the Dules) it is a sign
of fraud and guile. The eye lid appearing high above, and seems fuller
then it is, declynynge a little above the eye, declares the sight to be other
then the common sight of men, and to much fixed and set upon one thing. But
if the said eye lydde tend downward, it is a sign that the man is full and
fat, and namely when it is red round about, it is a sign that the man is
a dronkarde and riotous, c, which thing I have tried in many men which did
haunt taverns. The reason is, because such a disposition of the eye lydde
signifies weakness of the eyes, and consequently of the brain. Wherefore
they that have them so, fear often times the Wine. If they be thin and fine
downward, so that the white of the eye be covered, it is a sign of dryness
of humours. And if that happen in any sharpe passion, it is a sign of death.
When the hear of the Eyelyddes is crooked downward, or naturally turned or
wreathed at one side, it is a sign of lying and subtlety. They that have
very great or gross Eyelyds, see farthest of, for they conserve their sight
with heate and outward cold. When the corners of the Eyes be broad, it is a
sign of diseases of the Eyes. And if they have any fleshye appearance, they
signify Dronkennes, and specially when ye Eyes be apparent and clear, and
have their couerynges dried up.

The Eyelyds above the Eyes, which cover them beneath signify lunge life.
They that wag and remove often their Eyelyddes, be fearful, and without
good sense or wit.

The Eyelyddes thynne, sygnifye health, and declare the thought of the man to
be nygh unto good.

The judgment of the eyes.
THe complexion of the Eyes is moist, they be made of.vij. lids, which are
called in Latyne Tunicae oculorum, with three humours. The passions of the
mind be declared specially by the Eyes, as tribulation, mirth, love, hatred,
such other.

The Eyes have four principal colours, to wit, black, somewhat white,
changeable, darcke, and taunye. The form of the Eyes that be round, are the
most wauerynge and rolling that be, the most parfyte, and incorrupt, because
there is no squarenes in them. The Eyes that have corners are most filled with
superfluities in ye same corners: the eyes yt be great betoken fearfulnes
weakness, for their grossenes comes to a great abundance of moisture in ye
brain, wherein there is a certain coldness, which is spread among ye mebres,
quenches ye blood: wherefore even as the sprite of the blood makes the man
bold, so the coplexion that is cold and moist makes him fearful. The eyes
that be bolt foreward, declare folly in the man. But when they be hollow
inward they show a malicious subtlety in the man. Broad eyes tendynge to the
largeness of the body, and like unto Hogs eyes, declare a moisture of the
body. They that have their appearing outward and lofty see not very well:
for their eyes be far of from their fountain which is the brain. And
such men are commonly great babblers and praters. The hollow eyes far in
the head have a sharper sight than the other. The rollynge or waggynge of the
eyes comes of heate and betokens wrath, lecherye, and boldenes. When the
eyes move deformely, so ye now they run, and now they stand styll, it is a
sign of great malice, and that such men are full of wicked cogitations. They
that remove their eyes swiftly with a sharpe sight, be thieves, vnfaythfull, and
full of deceit. Such men have a subtell wit, but it is readyer to evil
than to good. A steadfast look, comes of two great and steadfast cogitation,
and oftentimes of a desire they have to deceive. They that have a look like
women, are whoremaisters and without shame: for that disposition comes to
them by such a complexion as women have. When a man looks as though he were
a child, so that his face and eyes, be always smiling, it is a sign that he
shall be of a lunge and merry life. Merry and laughing eyes with the rest of
the face, betokens flattery, lecherye, and backebytinge. The eyes that be as
it were yellow, signify cruelty and deceit, as it appears well enough in
bawds and murderers, this colour comes of a Choler raignyng and adust.
Little eyes signify malice, folly, and weakness in a man. The hollowness of
the eyes comes of a dries, which dries up the muscles and ligamentes.
Whereof ensues a contradiction in the inward parts, that the man becomes
brainles. The eyes are set situat naturally in man according to the largeness of
the body. The Eyes that are of diverse colours dim in the balle of them
betoken folyshnes. The boltyng out of the Eyes doth represent diverse objects,
whereby it comes to pass that the man is confuse with this diversity of
objects, going about to behold them all together. The Eyes that tend
upward, signify goodness, but if they be red great tending upward, they
signify wickedness, folly, dronknes, And that comes of the weakness of the
brain, which is very moyste and not temperate. The elevation of the Eyes
comes by accident, for the cause of it is to much heate, the Sign whereof
is the red colour: whereof also comes the perturbation of the reasonable
soul.

As we see in the great anger of men.

The extention of the Eyes and of the face, show the malice of the man:
because that heate and drynes be the cause thereof. And the whote soul,
brings commonly some evil sign. The Eyes that be as it were hidden in the
head, see further of then other and signify suspicion, malice, dangerous
anger and naughty conditions: they declare the man to have a great memory,
and specially of Injuries: audacious, cruel, full of craft, a liar, vicious,
and a Whoremonger. c. When the Eyes are now shut now open, and by and by
stand styll, such men have not yet committed any crimes, but they have them
in their heart. The Eyes have diversities of colours because they be Diaphanes
and of a rare substance and fine. And therefore the spirits of the sight show
their qualities in the Eye. As a woman that hath her flowers spotteth the
looking glass, mars children in the cradell, sometime hurts whole sound
eyes: when there be many apparent spots in the ball of the Eye it is a sign of
noughtynes.

And yet shall the spotted eye be worse, if it be of diverse colours. The
chaungeablenes of the eyes comes of nothing but of heate raysynge up the
vapours unto the eyes. And the greater the variety is, the greater is the
heate. For as much as the spots be diverse, the adustion of the spirit raised
up, is the greater, whereof comes the diversity of manners, and the multitude
of vices. And of this great variety, the honest and commendable judgment is
corrupted. The eyes that be red as coals, signify wickedness and
obstinatie. For by the colour of fire, is signified great Choler. They that
have mean eyes, enclinynge toward the colour of the sky, or somewhat black,
have a sharpe and piercing understanding, and be faithful and courtesy.
Almansor says that the best and most commendable colour of the eyes is
between black and changeable, if they be not full of beams, or if there be
not any rednes or yellowness in the, those eyes declare discretion
understanding. His reason is, because they be without Choler or Melancholy
adust. The colour of the eyes gray and black, specially where be no spots,
is cause of moyste humours and temperate without adustion, whereof follows the
spirit like unto the nature. And of this spirit comes the understanding
and speculation: the diverse coloured is made of a moore clear visible spirit,
therefore such men are well borne, and seekers of knowledge and science. The
worser eyes have white spots or black or red, or of some other colour. And
they that have such eyes are worse then all other, and more to be reproved.
The changeable great and of aberne colour, if they have little red sparks
very dustye signifies the man to be troubled in his mind and vicious: but
yet bold and wyttye. When there be little red spots in the eyes, and turn
moore to black than to red so that they seem black, it is a sign of a noble
heart, just, good witty. The Eyes that shyne within as spots of White
betoken clean men, stable, and very courtise.

The Eyes that have little spots all together red, yet not roud but square,
and shynynge like fire within underneath, that there be other beside them that
be pale, other blood colour, that the circles which close in the ball of the
Eye be sanguine, that the Eye be of a good greatness, that the Eyelyds the
ball do remove wag much, it is a Sign of a cruel heart, moore than a man
would think: the redder those little spots be the smaler, so much the moore
do they show the great anger wickedness in the man: the spots that be greater
darker, diminish those great vices: but they take them not away all together:
the black spots or sanguine in the black ball of the Eye or browne do
signify malice or poysonyng. The pale spots signify secret wickedness.
And you must note that as much as the colours are moore vehement, the moore
efficatie they have.

Yet there be some Eyes coloured like the Rainbow, the which if they be
dry, declare great lack of wit: But if they be moist, they signify
magnificence wisdom: yet with wrath infamous whoredom. If the ball of the
Eye be black, closed in with the foresaid yellow colour, or if it seem like
gilt (as the Physicians say) it betokens the bloody Flixe in the nether
parts.

The great Eyes long Eyebrowes, betoken short life. They that have in their
Eyes a blackyshe White, are commonly great Personages, live in great honour.

The waueryng or moouyng Eyes sharpe, sygnifie theft, which is attributed unto
Hawk.

The dry eyes and full of veins, betoken privation of wit to come or
present. The eyes compassed about with dim darkness, declare that the man
is seasoned with evil dotrine, and that he is vnfaythfull and temperate. But
when they shyne much and be without spot, it is a token of goodness. When the
eyes shyne very much, and are browne, and sanguine it is a sign of rashenes
and of privation of wit: But if they be well proporcioned, they betoken good
state of the wit. The colour of the eyes mean between black and changeable
is commendable above all other sorts aforesaid, if they be not full of
beams and streakes, either yellow or red. If the eyes be great, and very
clear and clean, they signify justice, docilitie, providence, and good
aduertisment. If they be eminent, red, and small, it shall be a sign of the
thought and the tongue vnrulye, and of an inconstant mind. Trembling eyes and
browne, betoken a man without shame, vnfaythfull and unjust.

When the eyes have a competente greatness, and be very bright, it is a sign
of magnanimity, that the man enterpryseth great things brings to pass
great matters. Sometime it is a sign of anger, and that the man is given to
Wine, that he is a thief, and covetous beyond measure.

When the eyes be great and smiling it is a sign of a dull man, lecherous,
and that foreseeth not what shall come after. Hollow eyes and smiling as it
were lying in wait, or to spy, specially, if the cheeks, the eyebrowes, and
the lyppes do move all together, it is a sign of wicked cogitations, deceits,
and namely, if sometime the eyelids be joined together, touche one another, it
is a sign of most wicked thoughts. Sad eyes are not much to be feared: for
they be to the cogitations of moist eyes, betoken study of good sciences. But
if the eye brows and the Forehead be of a good bredeth styll, that the Eyelyds
be good, it is sign of a faithful mind, grave gentle: the sad Eyes dry with
sharpness of the Forehead steadfast look, casting down of the Eyelyds signify
hurt cruelty, that the man hath a rash boldness: they that have watery Eyes are
lovers of Wine, and become bald, and such men have always a moist Brayn weary:
they that have their Eyes very watery running, are slepy love to sleep.
Blerines or watrynes of the Eyes comes of gross blood, of a melancholy humour
which falls into the Eye lyds: the watrynes of the Eye by the look of the
disposition, betokens drunkenes: if it be with depression of the Eyes, it
declares sleep.

The flat Eyes sygnifye slowness: wherein the man is compared to Oxen. The
means of the Eyes sygnifieth goodness and purity. The Eyes that be somewhat
hollow, betoken magnanimity. But if they be moore hollow, it is a sign of
mekenes. If the ball be black, it is a sign of a slothful and dull man. The
ball of the Eye that hath round about certain Pearls, signifies the man to be
envious, a babbler, fearful, and very dangerous. The Eyes that stand awry
with a vehement ague, sygnifye death. If the Eyes tarry lunge open, it is a
sign of folyshnes, and that the man hath no shame.

The Eyes that be very black, betoken fearfulness, and desire to scrape
together goods. And if they be not very black, but somewhat yellow, it is
a sign of a good and virtuous mind: the Eyes that be Browne, or White,
signify fearefulnes, and specially the White: the eyes that be not altogether
Browne, betoken a good courage and mind: the Eyes that be full of veins,
signify foolish men and destitute of their wits, and that is referred unto
Goats.

Now the eyes are called full of veins which have many little lines or
streakes, as the minutes of veins be, by the which the colour of the eyes is
made diverse. The eyes that be inflamed signifies the man to be paste shame.
The eyes are inflamed when they shyne and are bright, glitter like fire: for
they be kindled with ire and wrath. And if they see one thing, they think
they see twain. The eyes and the cheeks red betoken dronkenes And when they
be red dry, it is a sign of wrath anger. When the eyes be browne or
troubled, it is a sign of fear. The mean eyes and lowe, betoken
shamefastness honesty. The steddye eyes snd somewhat red betoken whoredom
devouring The changeable eyes short declare a covetous man desirous of goods.
But if he have the forehead and eye brows half retyerd he is the moore
covetous.

The Judgment of the face.
THE face is taken symplye for a natural look: but the visage is understand
of the quality of the mind. The face of them that be very clean is mean in
the cheeks and temples and somewhat fat. And that face is a true face,
loving and not disdainful. The merry face comes of a merry heart, and so
the contrary. The mean form that is to say neither to great nor to little,
is very handsome. He that hath a full and fat face is importune, a liar, a
devourer, and not very wise. A fat face makes the man circumspect in his
affairs, and sygnifyeth a sharpe wit. The thynnes of the face betokens the
man to be pensive. A round face sygnifyeth folly: and a great face sygnifyeth
sloth. The face that is very little sygnifieth naughtinea, craft, flattery, no
liberalite: fearfulnes. They yt have a crooked face, are of a naughty and wicked
dysposytion. A lunge face testifies the man to be without shame and injurious
and that comes of heate. The temples swolle with great veins and arteries,
signify wrath and anger. If the fleshye face be somewhat thick, and not very
neat it is a sign of fearfullnes and of great folly. A gross and rustical
face with broad Jaws, sygnifyeth a rude and blount nature.

The Judgement of the visage or of the face.
THe asperite or sharpnes of ye face, of ye state of the lips, of ye chekes,
of the forehead, and of the countynaunce, sygnifieth a folyshe man and without
sense or wit. The face that sweteth often, yea with a little moving betokens
heate, leacherie, glottonye, and that the man is a great eater, and therefore
falls into indigestion: and at the last into great sycknesses. When the face
is hollow like a valley, more lean than fat, it sygnifyeth the man to be
injurious, envious, a liar, a rioter cruel, and specially if he be of an adust
colour and somewhat black or else yellow. The face well proportioned of
flesh, of colour, other things appartaining, declare a commendable life, and
abundance of virtues. Every fat face full signifyeth an ignorant man, and
given to pleasures. Take heed you be not deceived in the judgment of Lazer
men for their eyes become round and their veins appear. The little visage
hears witness of a little understanding, of wyckednes, of folly and of
ignorance.

The judgment of the nose.
THe nose that reaches down even to the mouth of a competent bigness
declares the gristle and the brain thereof to be of a hoate complexion and
sygnifieth goodness and audacitye. When the nostrells be great and wide it is a
sign the mans codds and stories be great, and that he is a whoremonger, a
traitor, false, audatious, a liar, envious, covetous, a nyggard, and but a
little fearful and of a gross understanding. The Nose shows the
disposytion, of the hart: if it be great, it is a sign that the man is subject
to wrath. A little nose and a great also declare the secrete parts of the
man, and of the woman. The pryuye member of a man great, comes of a gross
and hot matter. Yet the foot of the woman declares her matryce. A narrow
foot, lunge lean shows the like of the matryce of the woman, and so the
contrary. The measure of half the foot being bare, is the measure of the
length of the matrice, yea in all women. Great lips declare the skin or
the lip of the gate to be great, and so contrary And specially in a maid.
The nostrells of the Nose show the stones of the man. If they be great and
wide it is a sign that his coddes be great and large: but if they be small
it is a sign that the coddes be narrow and small. Wherefore the rule cannot
fail (unless it be by accident) that is to say by syckenes and ill rule, as
dancing, or such like. For travail and labour increases the member. And so
many have their right hand greatter then the left because it labours
more. A hawke Nose sygnifyeth magnanimytye and courage, cruellty, rapacitye,
and boldness which thing comes of heate. And therefore they that have this
hawke Nose are commonly angry and full revenge and give themselves to
vnlawefull things. A flat Nose sygnifyeth violence whoredom and yet
nevertheless weakness. For that comes of fleam of moisture If the nose be
short the mouth little and the teeth short great, that comes of moystenes and
cold. A sharpe nose, a lunge neck, and the voice fair shrill come of
coleryke temperature. When the nose is broad in the midst toward the typpe,
it is a token of superfluity of words, of lyeing of anger. I have known such
men exceeding in vices and chieflye in lies. They that have their nose sharpe
at the end are commonly liars hurtful, and contentious. For that proceeds of
coler. The nose that is great at the end, declares desyrours of things as
oxen are. And such men covet all that they see, and specially in carnal
voluptuousnes. And moreover are commonly very angry. Large wide nostrells
betoken whoredom. The nose that is great at the end signifies insenble men
past shame and unapt to be taught. The nose turned upward and round at the end
is a sign of magnanimity and great courage which is in lyons. The nose
thynne and small at the end like a birds bill signifies lightness and folly.

The Judgment of the nose and nostrells.
THE nose that is crooked and hard from the forehead to the mouth, is a sign
that the man is without shame. A hollow nose and the forehead round and
emynent above, declares lecherous men. If the nose be crooked nygh unto the
forehead it is a sign of a man past shame and without honesty. The nostrils
crooked are ascribed to men of a good hart. The Nose tending to the laterall
parts of the man, if it decline only to one part of the posytion, going from
the girdle on the side of the last part betokens some hurt: But divided into
both the parts of the posytion, it shows syckenes or hurt, and that comes
either of the primatyue cause, or of the cause goeyng before. The Nose that is
in his beginning almost flat. Betokens lyberalitye such are the Lyons. A
red nose which hath a hole at the very foundation, and the breadth of it
somewhat swellynge, after the fashion of strawberies, betokens dronkenes: and
such men are commonly moyste and lecherous, specially if that sign be on the
body of a small measure. And this hath been tried. Open and wide nostrils
sygnifye readynes to anger. The thin and very open nostrils, betoken
cruelty and disdainful thought. The nostrils thynne and lunge sygnifye
vnstablenes and lightness. And if they be thynne and sharpe they signify
quarelyng men. When one part of the nostrils is myxed with the forehead and
taken honestly from the forehead and separated by a good composition so that it
be not to high nor to lowe with some lyne descending it is a sign of
constancy, manlines and prudence. The nostrils right up betoken
distemperance of tongue. The nostrils that be in all things greater, are
better than the lesser. The little nostrils are naturally ascrybed unto
servile and bound wits and to vnfaithefull men. The wide Nostrells show a
token of mirth and strength. And when they be very narrow, round, and
almost stopped they betoken folly. The largeness of the nostrells, the Jaws
fat, and the small quantity of hear on the cheeks, sygnifye a moist
complexion. If the hear that grows in the nostrells of a man be great
thycke, and much, it is a sign of a hard wit and spirit and unmovable.
But if there be little hear and soft, it betokens a gentle and easy
wit, and good to be taught.

The judgment of the ears.
THE great Ears are engendered of abundance of matter and such men have
commonly a little neck, and fair.

They be sanguine somewhat choleric with gross blood and some thing aduste.
And those men are very vnpacient and prone to anger. When the ears be great
and right beyond measure it is a sign of folly, and abundance of many
superfluous words and lunge life. If they be so great that they may be
compared to Asses ears, it is a sign of folly and slowness. And when they be
great and hang downward, they sygnifye riches. If they be thynne and dry,
it is a sign of great vnstablenes, and that the man shall not have much
goods. Very small ears betoken folyshe men thieves and whoremongers. The
small ears sygnifye the same thing that the other before do and therewith all
they sygnify deceit and malignite. When the ears be narrow and very long it
is a sign of envy. And if they be very lunge they show and declare an
envious man. Little ears, sygnifye short life. The ears that be to round
declare an indocible man. If the muscle of the ears be joined fast with the
flesh of the throat. it is a sign of folly, and vanity. Pliable ears
declare the proportion of the heate and moisture. The right ears stiff and
full of gristles, declare that drynes hath dominion. The ears that be like
half a circle mean, and hollow, and Joined to the line and middle somewhat
pressed together toward the centre, styckinge near to the head declare goodness
of nature. The ears that be couched close to the head sygnifie dull men slow
and slowthfull. The ears that be hidden and fixed right to the head betoken
slowth. The ears that be hearye betoken long life and a good hearing.

The mean ears among all the sorts aforesaid are good, and tokens of
goods, If there be any great quantitye of lunge hear and thycke in the
ears it betokens a hoate courega and a desire of carnal pleasure.

The Judgment of the Jaws and chekes.
MAlae be the emynent parts under the eyes and Maxillae is the diminutive. The
chaffes be the parts of the Jaws out of the which the beard grows. The
Jaws are taken offten times for the chaffes. The Jaws specially declare the
complexion of ye man. The Jaws that is to say the eminent cheke of the upper
part of the mouth with the length of ye Jaws of the part of the composition
sygnyfye malicious men. The short Jaws and far out from the upper part of
the mouth sygnifye malice backbiting violence envy, specially when in those
parts there is no flesh. The lean Jaws of a thin substance browne or
somewhat yellow declare a hot a dry complexion. The Jaws that be as it were
black, with a purged substance of flesh signify exces of dryenes and colds as
it appears in a melancholy man. The gross flesh of the Jaws is a sign of
a gross nature of cowardnes and sometime violence. The Jaws that be to thynne
betoken malignity. And they that be soft and long sygnifye importunate
babblynge and prating. The cheeks that be full, with full and blown temples,
betoken great wrath. When the chekes are small and so sytuate, that they
appear cut and separated from the eyes, it is a sign of abundance of
evil humours.

The roundenes of the cheeks declare envy. When the cheeks be lyghte and
evil set, they sygnifye length of tongue, importunitye and much talk. Red
cheeks (as is above said) signify dronknes.

The nature of the mouth.
THE mouth great wide betokens wrath, boldness war. And such men are commonly
glottons. A wide mouth without measure. as thought it were cut and stretched
out sygnifieth ravening inhumanite, wickedness, a warlyke hart and cruel, like
unto beasts of the sea. Such men are great talkers, boasters, babblers,
enuions, liars, and full of folly. The mouth that has but a little closing
and a little opening, sygnyfyeth a fearful ma, quiet yet unfaithful. The
mouth that is very apparent and round with thyckenes of lyppes, sygnifyeth
vnclenlynes, folly, and cruelltye. The mouth which hath a quantity in his
situation with a little shutting, and smiling eyes with the rest of the face,
sygnifyeth a carnal man a lover of daunses, and a great liar. When the mouth
turns in speaking it is a sign that it is infected with some catarre or murre
as it is manifest enough. The long chynne declares the man to be very little
subject to anger, and of a good complexion: and yet he is somewhat a babbler
and a boaster of himself.

They that have a little chin, are much to be avoided and taken heed of, for
besides all vices with the which they are filled they are full of impiety and
wyckednes and are spies, like unto serpents. If the end of the chynne be
round it is a sign of feminine manners and also it is a sign of a woman. But
the chynne of a man must be almost square.

The judgment of the lips.
THE lyppes be of soft flesh with a good moouinge because of the speech. The
great lyppes are meet for fools and dullardes. The red colour of the
lyppes, on the side of the opening of the mouth, comes of the veins that
be in that place. The natural colour of the lyppes is red in the utter
parts because of the fynesse of the skynnes, and sygnyfyeth cleanes of
complexion and without myxtition of troubled blood in great virtue. The
blacknes of the Lyppes sygnifieth the contrary, for the virtue of the blood
and natural heate is gone and those that have such Lyppes are syckely. The
nether lip lose and very red sygnifyeth great fleshelynes, and
vnshamefastnes in a woman. The lips gross declare great substance of matter
drawn of heate. And the grossenes declares the humours and the gross
spyrites, of the which proceeds dullness of understanding. If they be right
and thycke, that is to say fyrme and fast, and Joined together Mars is their
planette. And likewise when the mouth is great.

Soft lyppes and somewhat smiling which be in a merry face betoken
fleeshelyenes. Yet sometime they be also deceyuours, thieves and full of fraud
and gyle.

They that have not red lyppes within are sick, or very near to sickness. The
lyppes of the mouth very great, and slack, or to much turned outward
signify simplicity, and readiness to wrath and gross wit: and fleam rules
in them. Thynne lyppes and lose in the uppermost parts, so that the upper
lip be bowynge down to the ioynyng of the lyppes, signifies magnanimity:
thynne lyppes and hard appearing about the teeth signify a beastly
understanding and wit unapt to be taught. The lyppes that be great beneath
in the nether part, betoken folysh men, and like to Asses. The upper lip
very apparent in the Gummes, signify men that love contumelies and evil
slaunderynge, and are always in brawling and contrauersies: the little lyppes
with a little mouth, signifies weakness of the spirit and naughty craft.
The best manner or sort of lyppes and mouth is when they are not to moyste, for
the moystnes of the mouth and lyppes, sygnifye fearfulness and malignity.
The great blab lyppes, betoken great folly, babblynge and audacity. The
lyppes that be neither to thycke nor to thynne, and somewhat turned outward,
sygnifye, secretenesse, policy, wrath, and a great wit. The lyppes that
be well coloured, moore thynne then thycke, signify a fair conditioned man,
and changeable to two ways: But rather unto virtue. And of such men Iupiter
is the Planet. The lyppes that be not equal, so that one is greater then
the other, declare the man to be wise and of a changeable fortune. The upper
lyppes small and somewhat lofty, signify the man to be a blab and a lunge
tongue, very envious, and an accusour.

Thynne upper lyppes, hanging and turned insyde out, betoken a thief, and a
deceyuour. You may not judge of the Ethiopians lyppes unless you have been
conversant among them and diligently noted and observed their qualities. But
of our regions and countries, we may give judgement.

Of the teeth.
WHen the teeth that be like Dogs teeth, be long and fast, and that they
stycke out of the mouth, it is a sign of a glotton, subject to anger, wicked
and a fool.

Weak teeth thynne and small, declare all the body to be weak, and the life
of the manne to be short and weak. The sownde made with the teeth betokens
folly or lack of wit, which thing happens sometime to Children
sleepynge, which is a token of Worms.

Great and broad teeth, apparente either within, or without, sygnifye
vanity in a man, slouthe, simplicity, but yet a good wit.

Some say that is is sign of a gross wit, procedynge from gross humours:
the teeth that be extreme dry altogether without moisture, signify in a
sick man death, and in a healthful man they show a sickness very nigh at
hand, for the moist root seems to be consumed. And the bodies of such men
are as a lamp without Oil: ye teeth that be full of reume signify a fault
of the head, or else of the stomach, through the communicatyng of the head
and the lunges, which becauses of a descending or running at the nose (which
goes by the throat) of coughing or quinseys, and of swelling in the throat.
Beasts that have their teeth gagged like a saw drink lyckynge: but those
that have them uniform and even drink suppyng.

Of the tongue.
THe tongue is made to taste and to pronounce words and to utter the voice.
The tongue that is turned right down, or that stutteth or stumbles,
signifies the flixe of the belly: they that be subject to laskes and flixes
become stutters, because of the matter which descends from the head, which
enters into the poores of the tongue and muscles, whereof it comes to pass,
that the tongue is the greater, and thereby made brother, and so shorter: and
therefore some stammer and stutte. The tongue that is tied before, can not well
pronounce words or letters, but pronounces C, instead of S: and that makes
the man to stutte. And if it be tied behind it can not well pronounce the
letter R, but in stead of R, it pronounces L, they that stutte fear wine,
for they will be drunk commonly, and therefore drunkards do stammer, and can
not well pronounce this word (Trentatry). The heaviness of the tongue in youth,
signifies sudden death after it waxes once lyghte. The great and broad
tongue declares a rude wit and understanding and flematycke humours. He
that stutteth and repeteth often the first syllable of a word is ready to
melancolynes. The tongue that is touched with a light mouynge and is cause of
repetynge the words by corruption of speech, betokens folly violence and
wrath: because of the moouyng of the spirits, and of the heate which hastes
the provocation unadvisedly. When the tongue is lunge and red withal, it is
a sign of wisdom: for it declares good and commendable humours. A white
tongue betokens poverty and misery. The tongue that is hurt or marred with
heate unnatural sygnifieth distemperaunce and evil disposition specially of
the belly and breast. A lunge tongue, gross and so round that a man may wipe
his own nose with it, declares a nature like an Ox. The tongue that is
shortened with some humours loses his taste. All men that stutte be rude of
body and proud.

Of the voice.
THey that have a slow voice and grave, are quiet men and easy to be spoken
to, merry and well manered. The voice that is grave and drawn long, betokens
strength I mean the gross voice, and that sounds like a trumpet. The force
of the voice, follows the wydenesse of the Veins, and the multitude of
spirits: all the which things come of heate. The men that have a gross
voice are very injurious and are compared to Asses. They that have a gross
voice by nature, without forcynge it are strong, and that is referred to
Dogs. They that have a gross voice, and sowndynge well, are warrelyke and
eloquent.

A sharpe or shrill voice signifies fearfulnes. By this voice I mean a small
voice and not a great: the voice shrill and soft, and broken betokens a
womanlyke fear, and is attributed unto them yt be effeminate: the voice sharpe
and strong, declares men to be full of anger, it is the property of Goats.

A weak voice betokens narrow arteries, and want of spirit, which things
come of cold. A soft voice and not drawn or stretched out, betokens
meekenes, which is in sheep. For you must refer and compare the voice as
well as all other things to the likeness of beasts. The antiuocates, that is to
say, they that speak great at the first and small at the last, and have a
sharpe voice are full of wrath, and yet they be soon appeased again, are of a
gentle affection. A mean voice in sound and in greatness, declares the man to
be wise, circumspect, just, and true. They that have an unpleasant sound of
their voice, and discordyng are numbered among the fools: they that be hasty
in their speech (specially if they have a shrill voice) are commonly wicked
and great fools, importune, and liars. But if the voice be great, the man
will commonly be angry, and of a noughty nature. They that have a soft and
sweet voice are envious, and full of suspicion.

They that move much and often and speak with mouinge of their hands, are
vncleanely, eloquent, and deceyuours: But they that move not so their hands,
have a perfect wit and understanding, and have also a good disposition and
good counsel: they that speak in the Nose are liars, evil wyllers, and
envious.

The manners and conditions of men provinces.
THe Spaniards are meanly strong but for to do all other things, which are
possible to be done, they surmount pass many other nations. And there be many
among them very excellent, and that in diverse manners in casting the stone, in
nymblenes and in many other things.

In Portugale the men are melancholy and sanguyne for the most part: many of
them are sufficient strong, although they have no lyuelynesse of wit or
spirit.

The Sicilians are choleric, and melacolicke, and strong of body: they
exercise them selves in wrastelynge, or at the casting of the bar, and are
nymble and quycke.

The Italians for the most part are weak men, and some among (although the
number be small) have great strength, and are wont to be moore excellent
than other, but yet rather of imitation then by invention. They be slender,
and of a stature between great and mean.

In Germanye the men are flematicke, which show manifestly the nature of
that complexion, that is to say, that they be flematycke and very
Chollerycke. Furthermoore, they he of a great body, but yet few there are
among them that have great bodylye strength, or any great activity and
nymblenesse, to do any harde things, though they be very industrious to
do material things, which concerns any work of the hands.

The Frenchmen be made and proporcioned of fleam and of Chollere, and are for
the most part slow and weak. Yet there are some of them singular, and
surmount others in many things, but the number is small. They be robute and
strong, but they have not the mean and way howe to use their strength.

The judgment of other parts of the body.
THey that have a little Neck and a long, have a good voice great are fools,
fearful malignat. But they that have a short neck, are very whote and great
deceyuours.

They that have a great neck, are great fools, and great eaters: the nod of
the neck long and broad, signifies good courage and pride: the elevation of
humour, signifies a rude unfaithful nature. When the arms of the body that
is right up, are so lunge that the hands reach to the knees, it is a sign of
activity and nymblenesse at work, of audacity, and of goodness, with
liberality: But when they be shorter it is a sign of a lover of discord,
and of an ignorant person.

The paulme of the hands long, with lunge fyngers, signify an apt man to
many arts, namelye to mecanycall handye crafts, prudent and ware in all his
affairs. For there is in him a sign of good regiment and governance: the
greatness of the fingers sygnifie folly and imprudencie.

You must also measure the place from the navel unto the end of the breast
and to the beginning of the neck. If the part of the breast be bigger, it is
a sign of prudencie and wisdom, but if that which is in the breast unto the
navel, be greater it is a sign of a devourer. If the belly be to slack,
as though it were empty, it is a sign of fearefulnes, of wyckednes and of
deuouryng: the belly that is somewhat softer and deeper, is a sign of the
force and virtue of the wit, and of magnificence. The sides thynne and narowe
and deep, betoken fearfulness: But when they be moore fleshy and harde,
they show the man to be dnapt to be taught. And they that be round, as
though they were swollen, sygnifie much unprofitable talk.

The back broad and sound, is a sign of manlynes, the woman's is contrary. If
the body of the that have crooked bodies be soft, it is not so evil as if it
were in a thick hard body. If the lower part of ye chyne of the back be hidden
in the breads and to abundant, and environed with flesh, it agrees with
women. That which is lunge and sharpe at the end, it declares distemperaunce
of the carnal desire, and fearefulnes. Then the chyne of the back of a man is
that which is manifest in the bones moderate and sound. The haunches harde and
solyde, and seperate from the bones, betoken a strong and warrelyke man. But
if they be broad, ample, and full of flesh, they signify a feminine
understanding and wit: But if they be to lean and full of wrynckles and
compassed about with a thyn skin, they signify the wickedness of Apes.

When the knees touche one the other in going, they be referred to the woman
kind. When the lower parts of the shynnes next to the heals, and the
heals, and the under part of the feet be broad, and full of flesh, it is
a sign of a foolish man, or without wit. The under part of the feet
separated from the synowes and arteries, shows a clear understanding,
noble, and manly. If the feet be soft, and enuyroned with flesh, it is a
sign of a soft and womanlyke wit. The feet very lunge show the man to
be vigilant and given to deceit, seekynge the hurt of many men. The feet
very thynne and short, betoken malignity. The short feet having the sole
hollow is an evil sign.

Of the going of the feet.
THey that marche or go a great pace are stout men and attain to the end
of their enterprises. But they that go alytle pace, and short, have but a
little courage. The crooked going, is cause of grief, and of obscurity of
wit. When the man goes lightly having all his body vpryghte, it is a
sign that he will take in hand some enterprise, and by and by do some great
thing.

But if a man go swiftly with his eyes looking downward, and go altogether
crooked, it is a sign of a nyggard, fearful and subtyle. They that have the
nod of the neck short, are audacious and bold, and yet fearful. They that
have a harde brain, it is a sign that they be indocible. The nod of the
neck turned upward, signifies insolence, rigour, folly and vanity.

When the nod of the neck hangs on the pectorall parts, they declare the
mind to be occupied in thoughts and imaginations. And it is also a sign of
sparynge and of wyckednes. The throat sharpe sygnifieth lightness. The shulders
thynne, right, and pointed, sygnifie the man to be a liar in wait to deceive.
The Elbows thynne, sygnifie imbecility weakness. And when they be very
full of flesh they betoken weakness. But when they be meanly solyde harde
great of artires and muscles, they betoken a noble body, of good courage. When
the fingars are soft it is a sign that the ma is easy to be instructed and
taught. When they be hard he is strong and vnapte to be taught. When the hands
be short and the fyngars strong it is a good sign. If the fat and little
hands have very short fyngars they be. token a deceyuour, a spy, and a thief.
The hands thin and crooked, show the man to be a great talker babbler. The
nails white broad some what red sygnifie a very good Judgment. But when
they be narrow very long it is a sign of folly, cruelty. The nailes yt be
bowed crooked signify impudency, and violent rapacite. The nailes that be deep
within the flesh stick to fast unto it signify excessyue cruelty great
folly. The nailes that be to short pale black, and sharpe, declare a naughty
malignant man. These signs that be attributed to the nailes of them selves
have no virtue nor force. But when they be joined unto other greater they have
some efficacy or forte. When the fingars be joined and sticking the one to the
other, they signify vnclenlynes. And that be cafte fast together round show
malignity, covetousness and the man to be a whoremonger. When they be small and
thin it is a sign of folly. The short fingars and great signify envy,
audacity, cruelty. And when they be two long and to slender, it a sign of a
wyttles man far from wisdom. And if there be to great distance between
them, it is a sign of lightness and of to much talk. But when they be meanly
great of an honest form and fashion it is a sign of very good manners. Now
these things are meant as well of the nailes of the tooes as of the fyngars and
hands. A slender thin breast without virtue or strength, signifies weakness
of heate. They yt have their paps hanging their breast environed with soft
flesh, are given to wine, and to lechery yea excessiuelye. They that wag
their shulders lift up their neck shall be coupted arrogant proud. But they
that wag all their body show evidently that they be effeminate. And among al
these the most tolerable kind are they ye bow down their body on the right
side when they stir, and the folyshest are they that turn body toward the
left side.

Of the breath.
When the breath sometime rests and than a long time after breaks out in
great abundance, declares the man to be in great trouble of mind. Also when
the head shakes sighs, it is a sign that their is in it some naughty and
evil framed thing. The spirit that makes a noise, and is greatly moved and
thrust out, it is a sign of cruelty that the man is given to wine. They also
yt have their breath troubled and gross as they that have run lunge are
void of counsel and subject to anger, and have also a facilite readiness to do
and to speak. This rule ought to be observed in all signs and tokens so that
you must take the superfluity in evil part and the mean and temperature to
be good. When ye thighs be to crooked and to heary it is sign of whoredom. This
is referred unto the goats. Aristotle saith more yt the buttocks that be very
dry signify virility malines they yt be very fleshy moist signify
effemination, they that be as it were cut, declare the wickedness of ye man. And
this is referred unto bears and apes. The signs of an impudent man be such
as follow. First he hath bright shining eyes open, the eyelides far a sonder:
great feet, great hands he reiseth himself against the ye behold him. He is
red of colour hath a sharpe voice. And beside all these signs of impudency he
is injurious. The heary ma which hath black hear right smooth, the mouth, the
chin, and the temples heary, great eyes and glistering, is furious, inclined
to whoredom: a lover of fraies and fightinge, evil tounged, Ieronimus
Gardanus a Physician of Milan a man truly of great learning knowledge saith
thus in his.xii. book de subtilitate. Eve as all lame me are wicked so all
they which are in health have not good manners. For it is more requisite, there
is more a do to form a mind without fault, than a body. Wherefore the most
wicked of al other, are ye croak backed men seeing the fault of them is near
unto the hart which is the prince of all ye body. Next are the blind and the
squint eyed men, forasmuch as nature hath failed about ye brain. After them
come the dome the deffe. And then the halting men after the are they yt have
their fingars fast joined together, or to far a sounder the one from the
other for nature hath failed in them, in members less necessary. They that be
full of wartes have the next and last place and the scarred bodies follow them.

The Judgment of other parts of the body.
THE largnes of the breast and the greatness of the shulders and back sygnifye
bouty, and audatitye, with capacity of wit and wisdom But ye smallness of
the back declares the man to be of a discordaunt nature. The means of the
breast and equalnes of the back is a very good sign. The shulders lose
declare weakness of the mind and fearfullnes. They that have a great belly are
indiscreet, fools, proud and whoremongers.

The mean belly and narrow stomach sygnifie hyghnes of understanding and good
counsel. The smallness of the legs declare ignorance and the greanes of the,
sygnifie audacity strength of body. Abundance of flesh at the knes
sygnifyeth debility and weakness or effemination. They that have a wide pace in
going and slow, prosper commonly in their doings affairs. But they that
have a little pace are violent, and of small strength and in their works of an
evil will. Finallye he hath a good memory and well composed in nature that
hath a soft flesh moyste and mean between rough and soft, and when he is
neither to great nor to little when he is white, declining to reddenes: or when
he is neither to much but meanly black. Gentle of continuance having the
hear full and mean. Great eyes somewhat round A mean head, and of a good
fashion, with a great neck well and equally set. The shulders fast and
ferme without wauerynge to or fro not having much flesh in the small of the
legs, and knees. A clear voice small temperate: some what smiling not mockig:
having a like loke of mirth c. Yet you may not be to hasty in giving
Judgment or advise in one of these signs: But take the testimony of them
all. And you have the dyuersyte of signs tending to divers things turn
always to the better part and the most approved. Then may you pronosticate
and give Judgment more assuredly of great and small things to comme, yea
of every man what soever he be, for as much as you shall know moore
certaynely his deeds and his manners, in keepynge this rule and way.

FINIS.
