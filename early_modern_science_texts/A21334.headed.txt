De cursione Lune.



Here begins the course and disposition of the days of the Moon in laten
and in English which be good: and which be bad after the influentes of
the Moon drawn out of a book of Aristotiles de Astronomiis.

QUicu{que} enim cursionem lune scire volueri^ Sciatis Primo quo modo Sol per
signum vadit. Sol nam{que} in quo libet anno {per}transit omnia signa morado i
quo libet mes / in omnibus diebus eode modo Luna {per}trasit oia signa in quo
libet mense.

La quo{que} signo duobus diebus.xii. horis. Et quando luna iuncta fuerit cum
sole in aliquo signo tunc la esse in combustione ibidem quo perficit
cursione suam. Cum aunt separatur a sole a part occidentali per duo decim
gradus iterim elucere tuc la nova {que} si ista coniunctio sit ante
meridiem dicit luna prima. Sed si post meridiem diei sequentis la luna
secunda. Certum est {que} luna seper habet initium ab eodem signo in quo est
tempore coniunctionis. Et ideo prodest scire in quo signo fit luna oi die. Quia
luna est aliis planetis terre appro pinquior rebus mundi plus alijs prestat
effectum secundum naturas et complexiones signorum que discurrit vt dicit
Aristotiles in libro de Astronomijs.

Luna in Ariete.
QVando luna fuerit i Ariete signo mobili orientali calido et sicco igneo et
colerico masculino bonum est iter versus orientem incipere in illa part
mercandizare. Et qui tuc iter incipit been a^ (...) ^omplebit Et bonum est
sanguinem mi^e de brac^iis balneum intrare et illud fa^ velicip^ quo vis cito
finire malum est ^t lauare medicate ventosas in colo po^ et sanguinem de
naribus minuere / vxo^ ducere / domum fundare precium vel aliquod incipere quod
vis diu perseuerare medicina non accipiatur quia si accipiatur cito euomitur.

Luna in Tauro.
QVando luna fuerit in Tauro signo / Signo meridionali frigido sicco
melencollico terreo femineo bonu est seminare ortos / vineas / et arbores
plantare: quia scito crescunt et multo durabunt bonum est mansiones fundare /
vxorem ducere / et illud facere quod vis multu durare Malum est medicari collum
et gulam / et gulam vel aliud incipere quod vis cito complere.

Luna in geminis.
Cum in geminis luna fuerit signo cum bipartito cum corpore calido et humido

GOd that all this world hath wrought
And all makynd hath made of nought
and on the cross us bought with payn^ and wo
Send us grace so for to do
That we al sinful mankende
To that great joy we may wend
That he bought us all to
when he to death for us was do
All things that ben don and wrety^
As these great clerks wetyn
written they be for over profit
For our solas and our delyte
So saith saint poule in his saw
That is a techer of gods law
There for friends I will you fond
Some things to do you vnderstonde
That may some what glade your chere
And all tho that should it here
For I shall tell you no fable
But things hothe good and able
And that ben provide be holy wry
And drawn out by clerkys wit
Therefore lordynges less and more
Ly^ten all to my lore
And I shall rede you beforne
what time so that a child should be borne
Of that child what it shall be fall
That his ending in his happys all
And what betokens our dremyng
That we met in our slepyng
Good or evil or vanite
All together here shall ye
And also what time is good
Man or woman to be latin blood
And a^ thing that is for to done
So says the reule of the moon
To tell you I have sowght
what time is good what time is nowght
For by the moon withouten lesyng
Is reuled every erthely thing
Thereof holy wryght beryth wytnesse
And our forefathers as I guess
Adam and Eve and Abraham
And all the kin that of them cam
Beryth wytnesse of this story
For it was made by them truly
And take exampel at them shulde we
That were our forne fathers provide have be
How we should here heygh and lowe
Our destinies and our happys know
Therefore lordynges I pray you
For to lysten this beginning now
The first day.
THe first day of the moon Adam
Our forne father in to this world cam
That day is good withouten sin
All things for to be gynne
The child that is borne that day
He shall be nobyl and wise parfay
And of lunge life withouten fail
But often he shall be in great travail
And who so that day take sekenesse
He shall langure lunge as I guess
with great payne skap he shall
And therefore always thank god of all
And what thou metyst in thy sleep
God of his mercy thereof take keep
For it shall turn the to Joy and bliss
whereof god give us grace not to miss
But that day is no time good
On no manner to be let blood
To let the blood on no vain
who so will ben withotuen payne.
The second day.
THe second day profytabyl is
All things good to do I wis
That day our lord began eve make
Of mannys rybbe she was take
who so will to wife that day old or young take
That day is good wedding to make
For who so that day wed his wife
Together they shulde have lunge life
And often both mirth and wo
So had Adam and Eve also
who so do any theft that day
He shall be taken there with perfay
what child so that day be borne
Many virtues lye him beforne
A blessyd body shall he be
wise in good and of heart free
Be it maiden be it knave
Joy Enough it shall have
Love of man and of woman
More than this book tell can
And who so that day take sekenesse
He shall soon be hole as I guess
what so in thy dream come to the
It shall turn in to vanyte
And who so will that day blede
It will help him if he have need
The.iii. day.
THe.iii. day Cayn was borne
what so thou dost that day is lorn
But thou serve our heaven king
Therefore I rede the withouten leasing
That ye that day no thing begin
For ye should lesynt it your sin
For Caym for his sin full even
Had the curse of god in heaven
And who so that day take sekenesse
He shall ben holdyn long in distress
That day is not good out to ryd^
He no horse for to stryde
And who so that day borne be
Face and couetyse be shall he
And loath to give the pore bred
And they he shall a wicked ded
That thou dremyst it turns to nought
To let the blod be not thy thought
For that day is meruylous
And a day full perylous
The.iiii. day.
THe.iiii. day borne was Able
That day thou may boldly and well
Al that thou will boldly begin
Out taken deeds that lunge to sin

And after hedys of water to dig
To opyn them and late them ren^e
Both be field and be fen
who so be borne that day without fail
He shall have aparty travail
He shall be aparty lechour
But he shall suffer in m^ny a sharpe shour
He shall wele over escape all
And great rychesse him shall be
And great well or that he they
who so that day do any folly
Or any theft and therefore fl
Hastily found shall he be
who so that day in sekenesse fall
Son^ ^ey or wast he shall
what thou thynkyst in thy dremynge
It shall amend no help no thing
That day is good for every man I wis
To pass the see with marchandys
That day to let the blood
Is neither much euel no good
The.v. day.
THe.v. day Abel made is offering
For his sins to the heaven king
And Caym made his sacrifyce
That day falssely in all wise
That day is nought to take
Sacrifyce thereon to make
who so that day borne be
Hard destynes have shall he
He shall be ever sorry and mad
In all his live therewith I lad
In great travail and in sin
And vnneth it shall fro him wynn^
That day who so do any trespass
He shall be takyn with that casse
who so that day sekenesse have
Medicine no no leche shall him save
who so that day to the see fare
Him were better not come their
That thou dremyst shall be certain

About vndyrne thou shalt best sp^de
But loke that day thou do nought
But thing that need must be wrought

And if it a maid child be
Happyn on noble husbonde shall she
And who so any trespace do
He shall skape fair there f^o
And who that day any sekenesse lacche
It shall be strong a way to katche
For he shall be pynyd with all
But at the la^t skape he shall
That thou dremyst soth shall be
That thou shalt it soon se
But loke thou tell it no man
For nougth that any friend can
But that day is not good
For to let vein blood
To the see is good to fare
If thou have any shafare
Good time to bye and sell
And houses to rear and till.
The.vii. day.
THe.vii. day was Abelle slain
That day is good for certain
Bestis to put in to pa^ure

And of sin be sore a dredde
Kind wise fre and amiable
Curteyse and good happy stable
The name there of shall wide goo
If thou ought that day mysdoo
If thou that day sekenesse fonge
It shall goo soon or last lunge
But for sothe I the say
Of that sekenesse shalt thou not day
And he or she be weddyd that day
Shall well love other parfay
And either of other be of love Jealous
But if thou rear that day an house
It happyth fair at the last
He thorugh fire be not down cast
who so that day to the scole be set

So thou grieve not god therewyth
Thou shalt well speed in town and fryth

In great travail be shall he
And ever besy and sorry
And treue as any s^yle treuly
If thou that day any sekenesse feel
Thou shalt lye lunge and after have heal
If thou that day s^ele ought
with the to prison it shall be brought
But ^are the ^el of letyng blood
For that day is no time good
That thou me^ys^ in thy dream that night
It shall the turn to joy full right
The.xxix. day.
THe.xxix. day was borne Salomon
Loke thou that day begyne thing no
For if thou do I sey trewly

But who so that day borne is

And liking of women al his fylle

And if it a maid child be
Meke and mild courteyse be shall she
Fair of face and amiable
And to all men delectable
And or she be of any age
She shall be married to great lynage

She shall live evermore in her wydowhed
If sekenesse that day do the travail
Thereof thou shalt soon be hayle
If thou steal ought thou shalt have shame
But blode letyng is nought to blame
All thy dream to good turned shall be

The.xxx. day.
THe.xxx. day was borne Absalon
That day is good to begin upon
Children to set to scole to lere
To bye and sell and houses to rear
To chafre to wed to pass the see
To begin tylth and graffe on tree
That day what woman do lecherye
She shall never leave that folly
But what child that day borne is
He shall be good ware and wise
Be it maiden be it knave
Joy enough shall it have
If it a maiden child be
Soon shall be her destyne
That al men shall desire her than
And also if it should be a man
All women both whyt and blake
will desire him to her make
And thou pike or steal that day ought
To the treuthe he shall be brought
Thy dream shall turn to great trauayll
Or thou shall fall to great parayll
That day also is time good
If thou will blede vain blode.
Now have ye herd old and young
Descried many diverse thing
Of chafare / of dremys / of children birth
Of bledyng / of wedyng / and other mirth
And by our formest faders wytnesse
But I warn you both more and less
That ye be never the more bold
For any thing that I have told.
