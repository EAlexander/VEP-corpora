Imprinted at Collen by Arnold Birckman / In the year of our Lord M.D.LXI.

The first chapter is concerning the head and his parts.
For falling of the heir of the head.
MAke lye of the ashes burnt of doves dounge / and wash the head therewyth.
Falling of heir.
But if ye can not get doves dounge / take leaves of oken tree / and seth the
middelmost rippes of them in water / wash the head oft there with / letting it
dry by it self / yt helps very well.

Or else take the ashes burnt of little frogs / make a lye therwyth / wash the
head oft therewyth / that hinders the falling of the heir.

But for ye dry skaldes of it / called in Latin Furfur / Porrigo or Pityra /
seth the rotes of Malowes in water / wash ye head oft therewith / and they shall
fall of. Dry skaldes. Scelfferinge of the head.
He yt hath a scalfering head / let the same take ye course brame or wheat /
cast seething hot water upon the / let the stand one day night: after yt let it
be strained through a cloth / put a little vinegre thereto / struck it upon the
head / moyste it oft therwt / yt doth drive the scelfering away.

If one hath a head that can not be healed / let him take thick creme /
Uncurable sores
and anoynte the head therewith well in the evening and morning three weeks
continually / but let the head be first well and bare shaven / yt the creme may
the better pearse in / wash the head every third day with strong warm lye /
that the head may be chased therwyth: at the last rensch the head with cold
lye / the same draws the heate out of it / after that let it dry / anoint it
again as before. Of this wise may thou heal cleanse a head / though it were
harde crusted with corruption.

But if any hath had vnclene scurfes or scabs upon the head / is healed of
the / howbeit it pilleth as though it wold break up again / let him struck or
anoint it with oil of flax sede or lyne sede / let him frot the head sore
therewyth: the same makes the skin strong / harde and also clean / that it
break up no more.

For lyse and nittes.
TAke the heads of herb Get or Nigella / and burn them to ashes / put
swynes grese thereto / and struck or kemme the heirs therewyth / that drives
away lyse and nittes. For lyse and nittes.


Or else bye quicksiluer for a penny / and slake it with fastinge spatle / put
thereto half an uncle of swines grese or butter / anoynte therewyth a kamb / and
kembe thy head therewyth / the same drives away and kills all the nittes.
But if it is in summer or harvest / that thou may have the roots of wild
saffron / take the juice of them: where the same is straked / there slays and
drives it away the list / and also lise of the privy members.

Or else take a little piece of the clothe that goldsmythes wash the gilted
vessels with / and struck the place therewyth where they are / and they do fall
of: and this cloth may thou use to twenty men / and it may be kept yearly
and daily / and remains good to use / specially for ouerbrowes and eye lids
/ wherein the same vermin called the life of privy members do grow / and may
be used without danger. Life of privy mebres.


For the life of the head / take a penny worth of lorel or bay berries / bray
the to powder / lye the in a linen cloth / seth the same in running water / and
wash the head there with. The same virtue hath also the root of Bearfote beaten
to powder.

Of payne in the head.
Of pain in the head.
THe pain of the head comes sometime of his oune disease / sometime of other
mebres / as of the stomach: sometime of outward accidents / as of beating /
falling or sunheat: sometime of wounding / sometime of cold: sotyme of heat /
sometime of superfluity of blood / sometime ca it not be said by what occasion
/ sometime comes ye sickness or disease by it self / the same lasts continually.
But most chefely comes it by ye vpbraything of ye stomach into the head: to
heal this / is necessary to know of what complexion the disease is / yt thou
may purge clese it thereafter. If thou wilt than help him / take heed of what
complexion ye disease is. Tokes of headake caused of blood.
If it comes of ye blood / the same is hot moist / yt shalt thou know thereby
/ if the payne is most in ye forpart of ye head / then are those veins read yt
are by the eyes / the face rede and hot / ye veins under the eyes are pale /
the veins of the teples beat fearcely / ye vein of the pulls beats fast and
sore / and is great / his urine is read and thick / his body louse. These
are the evident tokens of the blood.

Tokes of headake caused of Cholera.
If the headake comes of Colera / that is / of hot and dry complexion / yt
shalt thou know thereby: The nose is hot and aketh for heate / the tongue is
great and dry / he is thyrsty / and can sleep but little: and when he sleeps /
he fights is unquiet / the vein of his pulse is little and feeble / feleth ye
grefe most in the right side. The same needs not to blow his nose / for nothing
issues out of it / by reason of the great heate.

Tokes of headake caused of Flegma.
If the headake comes of flegma / that is / of cold and moist complexion or
nature / the same hath greater grefe in the hindmost part of ye head then the
for part / and can sleep better: he is heavy in all his members / he is little
thyrsty / the veins of his pulse are great and feeble.

Tokes of headake caused of Melancholy.
But if ye headake comes of Melacoly / the hath he ye most grefe in ye left
side of the head. Galen saith: the head is divided into four parts: In the
fore part hath blood the dominion / Colera in the right side / Melacoly in the
left side / flegma bears rule in the hindmost part.

Headake of blood
If the headake comes of blood / then let him blood in ye head vein called
Cephalica / in ye hand by the thumb / or else in the forehead. Take heed also
lefst his age of youth (whereby he might be to feeble) hinder the: or else ye
time: the same must be kept with dietynge / as I shall teach hereafter.

Headake of Colera.
If the headake comes of Colera / the same must be let blood at the liver vein
/ and give him to eat prunes of Damask / and sour cherries though they be
dried / take oil of roses or violettes / put thereto as much vinegre / anoynte
his head therwyth where it grieves or aketh / dip two hepe clothes therein / let
him hold the in his hand / ye same draws out ye evil heat: but if ye can not
have the oil of roses / take the white of eggs / rose water and vinegre / and
do thus: Set his fete in hot water / and rub his legs well dounwarde: and if
he will not have the washed / then let him dyppe the fete in cold water / and
lay him down to rest / and not sleep by day time / but beware for heate and
wine. Howbeit if he will drink wine / let it be sour / and well mixed / let
him also drink water sodden with barlye / the same doth cool him / let him
take otherwhyles sugar candy into his mouth / to slake the thyrst / or else
again cofect of cherries or prunes. But he must beware of salt meates and flesh
/ without it were of chycken / or else let him eat sour vnrype grapes / or else
the juice of them / or sorel. Let him use a little vinegre in his meat / but no
spice nor ought yt chafeth: take heed he be lose in ye belly. If need
constrain the / take Venice soap or alume / make pills of it / use it for a
suppository. Supposi^
But if ye have ye roots of betes / struck the a little with salt / put them up
into the fundament / or else seth honey till it be black in an earth v^ssel /
put a little salt thereto / make pills of it / and use them likewise. If ye
have not honey / take the iolke of an egg / as much salt / seth the same
together / and make pillets thereof / the bigness of a haselnut or filberte /
and put that into the body / the same retains the sege. If it is a man / let
him beware of women / for they are hurtful for him / also of mostarde /
garleke / onyons / lekes and such like. Superfluity of blood. To make the nose
to bleth.
If the headake comes of superfluity of blood / then make him thus to bleth at
the nose without smart: Take sedes of red nettels / and bray them to powder
in a mortar / blow a little of the same powder into his nose with a quill. But
if ye can not get sedes of nettels / put a hole of the herb called Millesoyl
or Yarbe into the nose / and rub ye nose outwardly softly / and then shall it
bleth. But if it be in winter / and can get nether Surgeon to let blood /
nor nettels / nor nettels sede / nor yet no millefoyle / and would gladly
draw the blood from the head / then take two sack bands / and bind or tie
them first about the legs above the knye / let it so abide the space of half
a Pater noster: then lose it again / and tie it again. Do this the space of a
quarter of an hour: than tie his arms above the elbow likewise / thus shalt
thou draw al the blood from ye head. But ye must handle this thing warelye /
lest ye let the m^nbre to lunge to be tied / whereby the membre might be
asconnyed or choked.

But if the head burn to sore / take the juice of Porceleyne / and struck the
head and tempels therewyth / or where the most heate is. Heate in the head


If the head doth ache so sore / (by reason of a morre or running) that he can
not snoffe his nose / than were it good to use confectes made of the
apothecaries / called Nasalia / and put them thereinto / or else Margerim
wrethen together / and put into the nose / for the same draws out all euell
humours. Headake of a mor.
If ye can not have the same another / the take a grene rote of betes / as lunge
as a finger and a half / sharped a little and bruised / put the same into the
nose and let it abide the space of a quarter of an hour / the same draws out
also all euell humours.

But if ye can not have the same another / than take the sede of Cokle / that is
found in the corn / beat it to powder / put the same into the noise / that
draws sore. Or else take a pot / and put rapes into it / and seth them / than
hold thy nose over it / that the vapor or hot breath ascend so into thy head
/ that thou do even sweat with it.

Or take water crosses dried / not in the sun / but in the air / bray the
same to powder in a mortar / or within your hands / syft it through a lynnen
cloth. Howbeit if it would be to long to dry it in the air / then dry it in
an oven / when the bread is drawn / or else in a stoue or hot house.

Headake of Melancholy.
But if one hath payne in the head of Melancholy / his disease is come by cold /
and of dry complexion. Dicte the same and give him to eat meates yt are hot
and moist / to chafe his nature and moist his body. If he have no sieges / then
give him the fourth part of an uncle or iij. drames of Diacartha mi / before
day break / and let him walk up and down / until he get a siege. But when
the siege is done / then give him some thing to comfort him or that may
restore his strength / as supping or broth of chekins / or young beafe / and
mix sometime a little beaten saffron in his meat. After that may ye give him a
few pigs fete / for the same make his veins tender and moist / give him
sometime in the morning or day time milk to drink / yt is sodden with eggs:
that strengthens him / and gives nature force. Also ought he to bath
sometime a little in a bath made with Fenel or Heysede / gathered upon a heye
loft / otes straw: but ye may not bath to long nor to hot. If in bathing the
sweat will not in short space issue / the go out: for the is not the bath good
for thy / keep thy self warm after it / lest thou do take cold upon it /
beware of all meates that may cool dry the / as mustard / garleke / onyons /
lekes / also of harde or old chese / Martinmasse beafe / Haringe / read
haringe / Ling and such like.

Headake of flegma.
But if the headake comes of flegma / namely of cold and superfluous moisture
/ then is it necessary to purge the head with pills Cochie / and pills De
iera. Beware of such things as cool / and bring corrupt moisture / as
fruit / water / flesh / fresh chese / new bread / and all that is of euel
digestion. His temples ought to be anointed with oil of Camomille. But if thou
hast not oil of Camomill / then take two eggs shells full of flowers of
Camomil / grieve or seer / and seth them in wine and water together / and when
it is sodden to the half / then strain it through a cloth / and put thereto
butter / so much as a gouse egg / and then boyle the water and wine away:
Bath his fete also in a deep tob / even until the knees / that the hot breath
may thorou warm his body / he may sweat. Into this water put two handfuls
of flowers of Camomille / and a handful of heysede well sodden. If he do sweat
well / lay him to sleep / cover him warm: if he could sweat in the bed /
that should do him good / then give him a little grene ginger / and a little
coriander stiped a night lunge in vinegre and dried again / the same doth chafe
his head and stomach / and consumes the euel humours / that rise out of the
stomach into the head / and trouble the brains / that same doth it swag. Give
him also in the morning fastinge / if he can bear it / and let him fast two
hours there upon: Take three quarters of an uncle of aqua vite / a penny weight
of beaten saffron / and a penny weight of beaten Cinnamon / half an uncle of
Buglossen or Oxetunge water / mix these together / let them stand a day and
night / then shall it be tempered the one with the other. This doth warm his
stomach / rises into his head / dries his moist brains / whereof his disease
comes in the head. Let him eat meates of good digestion / and not to much
at ones: Nota.
for so lunge the stomach is cold and moist can it not digest well / and if he
eat much / thereof waxes it full of slyme and filth / and many diseases grow
of it / as payne in the head / grievous couginges / agues / gripinges in the
belly / worms / payne in ye mother or matrice / and many other: and if the
payne lies in the head / then let him be bathed / specially with these
herbs: Take of Valeriane and Fenell of each a hand full / Ootes straw two
handful / a peck of Ootes / but if thou hast no Ootes / take the straw only /
Heysede / of every one iij. handful / put the same into a little sack / and
seth it in a kettel with water / bath therewith / and when he is thorough warm and
sweateth / then rensch him with louke or blood warm water / and cast a cloth
or twain over him for cooling / lay him down / cover his body and head
warm / that he may also sweat in the bed: afterward take some of the
covering away / let him sleep a little in the bed / and after that give him
a good broth of a pollet or chycken / or else a supping of young beafe or veele
that is not ouerfat / or else the broth of gray peasen / with beaten saffron
the bigness of a peas: but he may nether eat nor drink to much / then rest a
little. If he can / let him sweat a little after it / be always still / both in
the bath and also bed / as he is in the heat or sweating / lest he become to
fell. The head washen with lye / wherein are sodden ye flowers of Camomil /
takes away the evil humours of the head and brains yt are gathered there in
with cold: the same doth also the water where in flowers of Camomil are sod /
put upon the head. Headake of stoppinge.
But if ye head did thus ache / by reason of a constipacion or stopping / so yt
ye could not well take breath / the bye half an uncle of Cinomon unbeaten / and
eat oft a little thereof / or else take a piece of bread / stipe it in wine / and
strowe Cinnamon beaten upon it / eat the same / that takes away the stoppinge
/ minisheth the slyme / of the which the stoppinge is engendered.

This medicin doth also minish greatly / and takes away the payne in the
head: Take a pint of wine / warm the same / then take four yolks of eggs /
beat the same in the wine / and moysten his head well therewith: the same
draws out the heat / and alayeth the payne.

But if the head ache were come of cold air or winds / Headake of cold^ air.
the wash ye head with water / wherein are sodden ye flowers herle of Camomil /
after yt struck ye forehead / teples stomach with ye foresaid oil or butter / or
else stipe soft clothes therein / lay the into the neck / the same draws out
the evil moystnes cold / warms ye head. Water distilled of Betony / a cloth
dipped there in / pressed well out again / and then wrapped or tied hard about
ye head / restores the head that was distempered with cold moisture (even yt
some fall into frenzy) right well to his former estate. But if thou can not
get the water / but can have the herb / then seth the same in wine / mixed
with the third deal water / and use the same in stead of the distilled water.

A wounderfull experience for the headacke.
SEt a dish or platter of tynne upon the bare head filled with water / put an
uncle and an half / or two vnces of molten lead therein / while he hath it
upon the head. Or else make a garland of Veruayne / and wear it day and night
/ that helps wounderfully.

Likewise may thou take two hand full of Veruayn / the same may thou chappe
small / seth them in a quart of wine / put the into a little sack / lay them
hot upon the head / twice or iij. times / that heals well.

A slouggish or slepery disease.
A slepery disease.
This disease comes gladly and lightely of cold much moystnesse / specially
to a good folk / because their natural heate is gone. This disease is thus
known: they have always great heat / whereof the cause is an impostumacion / yt
lies in the head behind / and his urine is pale and thick. By reason of yt
disease ye trublinge of his head brains / he lies or sits / making
semblance as though he did sleep / and yet doth not: he wendeth waltereth /
happily his head fete do mete together: the same must be healed of this wise:
Bye a little nysing powder / or else take the sede of ye Nigella that is found
in the corn feldes / beat and use them in stead of the nysinge powder / or
else use the flowers of mustard sede / or take beaten Mergerun gentle / put any
of these into his noise oft times / and cause him oft to nyse. Rub also the
soles of his fete oft with warm water / vinegre salt / with a woollen cloth /
the palm of his hands also / and keep his belly louse with suppositories of
alum / or other / as I have taught before / and let him be laid in a place
where much light is: let also much communication be had with him / to hinder
him of his sleep / and keep him from slepinge. But if he hath great heate /
then may he be bathed in a bath / that the unclean heat and moystnesse may
avoid from him / and anoynte his head with water / wherein are sodden
Camomille / Anis and Wormwood. Roses dry or grene were good also / of each a
few / that the water be not to strong: for the washing and bathing doth
much good to the head / by reason it doth comfort the same.

To the patient may be given Diapenidion / Diagalanga or Pliris cum musco /
made in the Apothecary.

But if the urine is rede / and the pulse beats sore / then comes the
disease by heate: let him then use cold medicines / as confect of roses or
violettes. Also were it good oft to burn the heir of a man before his nose /
and he so to receive the sent thereof.

Galen saith: He that hath payne in the hindmost part of his head / the same
must be let blood under the chynne / specially on the right side.

A medecin awaking a man sore, and withstands sleep greatly.
To drive slype away and to avvak a man.
SEth or boyle Few or Herb grace and vinegre of like quantite in a covered
vessel / and when it is sodden / put a little more vinegre to it / and put ye
Few into a little cloth / put it then again into the vessel where ye vinegre is:
when thou wilt awake him / then take the cloth / hold it to his nose / and
brows / to his temples / the same awakes him contin^ntlye / causes to sleep
nomore. Strong vinegre holden to his nose / so that he holds in his breath /
doth likewise: for he awakes / and specially a feather dipped in strong vinegre
/ and thrust into the nose so far that he be constrained to nyse.

Penyreal dipped in vinegre / and holden to the nose / doth likewyse.

Two things hinder a man of his sleep / the one is natural / the other
unnatural. ij. Things hinderinge sleep.
The unnatural hindrance of sleep weryeth a man / and coleth him inwardely.

But he that hath payne in the head by reason of exhalation or vpbraythinge
out of the stomach into the head / let the same eat ripe quinces after
breakfast / that are well roasted / the same refrain the vpbraythinge into the
head / and drive dounward to the siege.

But if the vpbraythinge come by reason of a cold stomach / then were it good
to eat Coriander ^ede / after breakfast / the which is stiped in vinegre a
day and a night / and dried again / this withstands the vpbraytynge of the
stomach.

Or else give him to drink the juice of Wormewoode / so much as conteyne an
eggs shell / with as much wine: this same is good for the evil euaporacion or
rising up into the head.

They which are inclined to this disease of the head / ought to be little
sturringe / and beware of meates that be of euell digestion / as Martimasse
beef / salt fishes / or moulberries: for they cause euel euaporacions to rise
into the head.

Him also that hath headake / and wots not whereof it is / may thou heal
of this wise: Headake whose cause is not knovven.
Take a pennyworth of pepper / as much beat mustard sede that is not steped /
mix these two together / let him take there of in his mouth so great as a
small bean / and remove it with his tongue hither and thither / let him keep it
thus in his mouth a while / and it shall draw the euell humours out of the head
into the mouth. This must be done fastinge / and three hours in the day.

Headake of much nisinge.
IF a man doth nyse much / that comes by reason of cold in the head / him
may thou heal of this wise: Headake of much nisinge.
Purge the head with pillule auree / or pillule de hiera picra / after that let
him eat nutmegs / Coriader and Clares / and let him oft smell at Castoreum /
or else put a drop of Oleum benedictum into his nose and ears in the morning /
that chafeth / let him eat oetmeel gruell / and drink wine or stale bier or
ale / another let him eat meates that be moist of complexion / but dry.

Of apostemation in the head and brains.
THe brains are grieved many ways / sometime of ye stomach / when a man eats
meates / that the stomach can not digest / and lye sliminge rotting in the
stomach / yielding an vpbraythinge into the head / whereof ye head hath ever
payne / and thereof are the brains diseased. Apostematio in the head and
brains.


Sometime engenders an apostemacio in the brains of some little skins / that
environ the brains / the same are called Phrenesis. Phrenesis.
He that hath ye same apostemation / can not sleep / and becomes sometime mad.
The same apostemation comes sometime of Colera / when ye same is inflamed / and
breateth up into the head. It comes also of hot blood / that lies in the
heart / and brarheth up into the brains: he that hath the same apostemacion /
hath also great drought in the mouth / and the tongue waxes black / he
becomes read under ye eyes / specially about ye nose / such apostemacio have
they most / yt are of hot dry complexion / when they labour or travail to
much. He yt hath this disease / ye first iii. days when it overtakes him /
must he let blood in ye Cephalica / that is the vein of the head / and the
same day ought he to let blood in ye forehead / or else set horselcaches or
blood suckers thereto. But if the horselcaches will not suck / then anoynte
the temples with wine / then do they sit to by and by.

Good heed ought to be take to them and well kept / give the none other meat /
the bread steped in almondes milk. Give the almond milk to drink beware of
meates of hot complexion / let the be still quiet / beware of vexynge and
anger / or else become they lightly frantic and mad.

Beans are not good for feeble brains nor lentilles.
Al men yt have feeble brains ought to beware of beans / for they trouble the
brains / and cause heavy dreams / the brains and head sick. The lentilles do
likewise / for they cause euell blood / and stop the bowels veins / that they
can not sweat / that in such men as labour not / tender and sick feeble / they
hurt the breast / the lights / the eyes / the skin about the brains / and
all the veins of the body: Contrary to this are speces / which comfort and
fortify the body / head and brays.

Of whirling in the head.
VVhyrlinge in the head.
MAny are whom the head whyrleth so sore / yt he thinks the earth turns
vpsyde down / ye same also hath payne in ye eye / he thinks yt a sort of
flies do fly before his even: those may be healed of this wise: They may
drink no strong drinks nor wine / without it be well allayed with water / to
the ought to be give pills made of half an uncle of Aloe / a penyweyght of
Mastix / give him of them every night five / ye bigness of small beans / and
give him after yt Diamargariton or Dianthos / or else Diapliris / for the same
comfort the head and stomach / and anoynte his head with oil of Camomille.

Or else take Betony / whose leaves must be dried in the shadow / and made to
powder / the same strowe or struck upon a piece of bread / being stiped ni wine /
and eat the same in the morning and at even / the same restores the brains.
Or else take Cerfoil or Cheruill sodden in water / and lay it to the temples and
forehead / the same warms the brains and head / take Pennyreal made to
powder / and drink it with water of Pennyreal. Comin refrains the whyrling /
comfort the brains / and makes them to grow again or increase.

Another for the whyrlinge.
Come stiped in vinegre three days lunge / and after dried again / at night
when one will go to bed / kept hole in the mouth / chawed as lunge as a man can
/ at the last swalowed down / etc. Some eat it made to powder / but it is not
so good.

If it were a sickness fervent / by reason of an exceeding cold or whyrling /
then take the brains of a hog / roast the same upon a grede iron / and cut
slices thereof / strowe a powder there upon made of Cumin Peonye sede Penny
real in like quatite: this is very good / put thereto so much miscelde or an oak
/ as any of ye other spices made to powder also / give it to ye patient / let
him use this iij. or iiij. times after another / he shall be healed. For it
drives out all superfluous humours of the brains / and dries sh^rpeneth it.

When a man can not sleep.
OFt times comes that a man can not sleep by reason of the heat of ye brains
moving / sometime by reason of the read colera / vvaking unnatural.
which is hot and dry / sometime by reason of the black colera / which is
cold dry / when melancholy is risen into the head / sometime comes it by
reason of exceeding heate / that is risen into the head of sweet moystinesse.

If the waking come of melancolia or sorowfulnesse / then becomes a man
straight about the chest or stomach / his heat is dry: vvaking of melancolia.

vvaking of read colera.


ye colour also of his skin is altered. But if ye waking come of ye rede colera
/ then waxes his skin rede coloured also / then give him barley water to drink.
But if the waking come of the black colera / then becomes the skin of the
patient pale / and he hath much carefulness / anguish and pensisnesse. But if
it comes of phlegma / then becomes the patient heavy and slouggish.

It is to be considered / that if a man watch much / it makes him heavy of
courage / and that comes by reason his members dry / wherein lies the power
of the body / and it hinders also the digestion of the stomach / whereof are
engendered evil moystures in the body. Nota.


If the weaking is caused by colera / then wash his head with water / wherein
are sodden leaves of violettes / or else Lettis / or the sede of it / struck the
head with women milcke. Cure of the vvakinge of colera.


Alume the bigness of a great bean kept in the mouth / draws the moistness
out of the head: after that wash the mouth with water / and beware of all
things that are hot of complexion.

If the waking be caused by reason of heate / take white or black poppy sede /
bray the same in a mortar / pour water therein / and make a milk of it / which
give him to drink. vvaking of heate.
Or else seth the tops of black poppye in milk / and let him drink it. Take
a dish of black poppy sede / beat it well / temper it with water blood warm /
that it wax as a thick milk / moysten therein a fine linen cloth a hand
broad / and as lunge that it may go about his head: the same doth cool his
head / and if he awake about mydnighte / do it again. Howbeit ye must take
heed / that if he have no sieges / then give him to bedward half an uncle of
syrope of Violettes / with an uncle of warm water / mixte together / but let it
be cold when ye will ministre him the same: give him also to drink cream / or
potage of peasen sodden without any salt or fatness / only peasen / and let
him drink the same blood warm in the morning / let him after this lye high
with the head / well covered / and let him fast hereupon six hours.
Nevertheless if he wax faint / and hath had a siege / then may he eat and
drink a little, but beware of excess.

The crowns upon the poppy heads sodden in milk / make of the same a pap /
and thereof at night: the same may be given a yonge child / and it causes to
sleep fast and restlye. Or else take Betony / and lay it upon his head.

If one sleeps vnrestly / let him eat lattice: but is it a child / let the
Lattice be well sodden in water / and give him the same to drink.

Of one that hath the palsye.
The palsy.
THe palsy takes men sundery wise / for sometime comes the disease by anger /
sometime by cold / sometime by superfluous eating and drinking / whereof is
engendered in man overmuch slyme / whereby the veins are stopped / or else that
the blood increases excessively / and overcomes the heart / or else strayth
in the members / of the which is caused the palseye. It takes men also that be
lecherous / whose mary in the bones waysteth cools / so that unawares all his
sorce fails / and he finally doth dye.

Sometime doth it take any of the members that have ben maimed / and not well
healed / whereof they wax sometime sere / and can not suffer the heate of the
heart / which is cause of their death and destruction / and the membre
becomes lame and wry.

The causes of the palsy.
This disease takes sometime the one membre / as hand or foot / sometime the
half body / or the tongue / so that a man can not speak: sometime comes it of
overmuch joy / heuinesse / meat or drink / overmuch labour / rest /
slouthfulnesse / fear / swounynge / hartequake / and of supers^uitye of blood
/ flegma / colera or melancholy.

Sometime is the cause / that the two strings / coming down from the brain
through the backbone into the fete: through the one goes the natural heate /
and through the other the cold / that the same strings (I say) are stopped /
ether the one or both. Wherefore / in whatsoever membre is stopped this stringe
/ that the natural spirit can not come into the same / it waxes lame. Let
every Physician or Surgeon therefore rule him after this / and well and
exactly know / and search the cause of the disease / that he may the more
certainly know how to heal the patient.

Supers^uitye moisture.
If moisture is cause of the disease / then must the same be minished by such
things as consume it / warm and comfort the body / of this wise: Take
Lavender / Sage / Cousloppe called herba Parali^is / Ren / Juniper berries / of
each a handful / a pint of Aqua vite / a quart of strong white wine / putt
all these into a great pot / and set it into a kettel with water / and let
it seth well. With this wine streke the lymmes grieved twyse in the day / and
let them dry again by them selves / and drink twyse in the day of this wine
/ at every time so much as an eggs shell conteyneth.

Supersluity of blood.
But if the disease is comme by reason of supersluitye of blood / then must he
be letten blood incontinently. And if the disease is in the right side /
then let him blood in the left side: If it is in the left side / then let
him blood in the right side / in the arm / and give him half a dragme or
triakle in a bath / with warm wine / wherein Castoreum hath ben sodden. But if
thou haste not Castoreum / then take Lavender or Sage water / drink that / the
same helps. But if thou haste not the water also / sees the herb ether of
them in good wine / and drink it. Or else take fine Sage / Lavender / of each
three handful / let them stepe in three pintes of wine xiiij. days / after that
styll and drink it. If ye can not stylle it / then seth the wine with the
herbs / and give him to drink of it.

If the palsy hath taken a man, and his members were so holy^ taken, that he
doth not feale when he is touched upon the same, then let him be bathed dry of
this wise.
Cover a bathing vessel well and close / lay brickestones in the fire / that
they wax glowynge hot. A bathe for the Palsye.
Take also Juniper berries / Mullen called Tapsus barbatus / and read Organ /
of each four hand full / seth the same well in a kettel well covered / or else
in a pot / and put six quarts of good wine thereto / put hot water in the
bathing vessel / that it be well warmed. And before thou entrest into the
vessel / take two tiles that be hoted / put them into a tobbe / and pour of
this foresaid wine upon them / so that even the very bathing vessel be
warmed with it: then set the patient in the vessel / and take always a stone
out and into the tobbe / and pour of the wine upon it / until he do sweat.
But ye must beware lest he do bath to hot / that he faint not / or that he
bath not to lunge. Of this bath are all his members chafed / and that helps
him very well. When he goes furth out of the bath / then let him lay himself
upon a bed: and if his strength is so good / that he can sweat in the bed /
that is very good for him. Let him also beware for taking cold. And when he
waxes dry / then let his lamed lymmes be straked with water of Lavender. If
ye have not the water / then take the wine wherein Lavender hath ben sodden
with Sage / or else Sage alone / do this three times in the day. If he hath
streingth sufficient / then let him be bathed ix. days lunge / every day
ones. He ought also to be anointed with half an uncle of Castoreum made to
powder / with ij. vnces of oil of olive warmed / let his limbs be anointed
therewith threse in the day / if he can suffer it.

To restore again members that be lamed or taken.
TAke Sage and seth it in water / put it into a lunge pot: To restore again
mebres that be l^med or taken.
if the disease is in the hands / then put always one hand into the pot /
that the exhalacion come to it so hot as ye can suffer it / till it do sweat.
After that take half a pound of Aqua vite / and a hand full of Sage / and as
much Rue / cut them small / and seth them in the Aqua vite / in a pot with a
narrow mouth / well stopped / and so put into seething water.

If the Aqua vite is drunk in of the herbs / than put more therein / seth it
until it boils / then put a little thereof into a gobblet or other crewyse /
well close / and chafe it so warm as ye can suffer it: stype a soft or fine
cloth therein / and struck the patients lymmes therewyth by a fire. A^ter yt
take ^yle of Camomille / and put thereto as much Aqua vite / and struck the same
with a soft linen cloth about the joints of the patient. The cloth ought to
be made of this wise / that it be as lunge / that it may cover the joint
holy: then wind a black shepes skin about the jointure / every even and
morrow / xiiij. days continually.

But if the Palsye hath taken a foot / arm or knee / then put the herbs out
into a tob / lay a piece of wood thereupon / set the fete there on / and cover
the tob close. And when it waxes cold / then chafe it again with a hot
brick / and bath the membre / as before. But if the disease were in ether of
the houkels or shoulders / then must the foresaid herbs be putt into a little
sack or bag / being broad and lunge half a yard / and then seth it / and
lay i^ hot upon the taken membre: and when it waxes cold / then to lay
another strayghte way in the place / and anoynte him as before / and keep the
membre that is taken allwaye warm. Let his meat and drink be allwaye
seasoned with beaten saffron / according as he couled. Let him also eat oft
yonge hogs or porckes fete / sodden with rapes: the same comfort the synewes.
Or else let him use in stead of saffron / Cinnamon / or else the soueraygne
Buglosse.

For trembling or shaking of the hands.
Treblige or shaking of hands.
Wash thy hands out of a Lauor with cold water / and let them dry by them
selves / as oft as thou doest wash them: but it were better if ye laid Sage
there in.

If a man stands in fear of the Palsye / let the same eat every morning
two or three mustard sedes / and two pepper corns. The same is assured for the
same disease that day.

Of drunkenness.
Dronkenesse.
Drunkenness comes oft by superfluous and vndigested vapor / braythynge up /
and troubling the brains. Likewise doth also the Son / with ouerchafynge head
/ whereof the brains wax feeble / and mans head aketh: which accident drunken
folk doth overtake also. Drunkenness doth also weaken the wit and body of
man with the memory so sore / that he knows nomore what he doth / then an
unreasonable beast.

To vvax drunken and yet drink not over much.
It chances otherwhyles to some fol^e / to be drunken / and yet do not drink
overmuch: and that happens two manner of ways: First that they have so
great payne / or wept so much / that thereby their brains and head are become
feeble: and when they drink / the drinking doth so much the sooner strike into
their brains. Besides this are many men / that by nature have a feeble head and
brains / though they are no great drinks / and therefore doth the drink run
soon into their heads. This also happens diverse ways: First / because the
drinks are to strong for them. Secondly / because the wedder or place where
they drink / are to hot for them / or else the Son hath febled their
brains. Thyrdelye / if they are in a whote place and much noise / which they
are not accostumed / with that doth the drink sweetly ouercomme them / etc.

If the drunkenness is of hot complexion / then anoynte his head with oil of
roses / or oil of violettes / or both mixte together / anoynte (I say) his
head and temples there with: Dronkenesse of hot coplexion.
after yt give him to drink water of Poppy / beaten with water of roses / and
mixte together like milk. After that set his fete into a warm water / rub
them with salt / with a woollen cloth / then anoynte them with oil of violettes
/ that the vapors may synke down out of the head. After the same cause him
sieges with pills of alume or soap / or else with the yolke of an egg and
salt. Let his drink be barley water / or else syrop of violettes / with as
much again blood warm water to drink. All this have I chefelye showed
therefore / that if a man doubts / he may know how to help him self.

I rede / that if a man do eat three carnels of Almondes / he doth not lightely
wax drunken. Nota.
He yt knows he is grieved with that impediment / the same ought so much the
more take heed to him self / lest that rudeness and misbehaueour happen to
him: for it makes feeble every mannis body and soul / his understanding /
wit and honesty / etc.

If a man is greatly thyrstinge / and dare not drink his fill / the same shall
slake his thyrste of this wise: To slake thyrste.
Let him take flint stones / the bigness of a Walnut / and lay them in
cold water / and now and than let him take one of them into his mouth /
that shall make him moyste.

For the falling euell.
Against the falling euell or syknesse / take miscelden of oken tree with the
bark an uncle miscelden / of Pere tree half an uncle / the paring of the toppet
of hertes horne a quarter of an uncle: Falling sickness
make of these things a powder / and give the patient thereof to drink / the
more he drinks thereof / the better it is / and this must he do fastinge.

Put also of the powder into a cloth / and lay it under his head without
his knoweledge / and let him sleep there upon.

This powder must he use in the morning fasting / and to bedward at even /
and let the powder be refreshed every night. Let also the powder to be
laid under his head / and the powder that he drinks / be of like weighte.
This doth help him.

Macer writes that the roots of Peony be very good for the falling syknesse
/ if they be hanged about the neck. Lib. 6. simpliciu
Galene doth also write of a child / which had the root of Peonye hanging
about his neck / and was fre all that while of the falling sickness / that it
was about it: and when it was fallen of by chance / than gat it his former
disease again.

Hipocrates saith also / that he did tie a child of five years the rote of
Peony about the neck / and it rose continentlye again from the falling
sycknesse / and was hole: and thus is it twyse proved.

If it be a man yt is grieved with this disease / let the same take a he Wolves
heart / and make it to powder / and let him use that against the disease: but
if it is a woman / let her take a she Wolves heart / c.

A wounderfull powder for the falling sycnesse.
Powder for the falling sickness
TAke a living or quick molle / open him / and take out the entrails / and
cast them away. After that put the Molle with skin and altogether into an
earthen or stone pot / stop the same well and close with clay / set it then
by the fire / and let it stand until the moll is consumed holy to powder.
After that lay the same powder upon a marbel stone / that is clean washed /
take the juice of Cousloppe leaves or rotes two vnces / grind the same with
the powder in the Son. The next day grind it again with the juice /
again the third day / and let it always dry in the Son. After that take the
rotes of Basil / and stamp them / and take an uncle of ye same juice / and mix
them together with the foresaid powder / as is said of the Cousloppes / but no
more save ones. After take the rotes of Gentian dried / make a powder thereof:
of thissame powder mix a quarter of an uncle with the foresaid powder. After
that take an uncle and an half of the rote of Peony / made to powder / and mix
it with yt powder specifyed before. Hang also a root of Peony about the neck.
Drink of the foresaid pouders a quarter of an uncle with blood warm wine / lye
down to bed / and cover thy self warm. After that in thy meat to beddewarde
put the other quarter of the powder / and do so while the powder lasts. Eat
little at night / no entrails of beasts / as heart / liver / c. nor sucker /
and keep good diet / and thou shalt be hole.

To know whether a man be possessed with an evil spirit / and how he may be
helped.
INsania / in Latin signifyeth Madness / the same comes sometime of evil
meates / Of ragig
sometime of overmuch drinckinge / or if a man being hot / drinks cold
drink / sometime of superfluous slyme that lies in the stomach of meates that
be not well digested / sometime of meates that be hot of complexion / as are
garleke / pepper / and such like. Sometime doth it come of the bytynge of a mad
beast / or of an infect air / or anger / or overmuch sorrow / sometime also
of evil moisture / or that a man hath had no natural siege a great season /
and the corruption is rotten within him / and the vapors are risen up into his
head / and the brains are perfumed and corrupt therewyth / which causes a
man then to be witless and ragious.

Raging caused by blood
If the madness comes of the blood / then doth man singe and is merry /
sometime thinks he / that he is in heaven / or else that some body talks to
him / saying he is God / or an angel: sometime that he is rich and wealthy.

Cogeled blood.
But if the madness comes of congeled or burnt blood / the same are sometime
a little merry / after that wax they angry / cry and beat themselves and
another. Raging caused by cold and droought.


If it comes of cold and drought / then doth he always gloom / weep / and
fear him / that is not to be feared. Sometime thincketh he that the sticks and
straws he sees / are serpetes / toads or such venomous beasts / he crepeth
into the darcke / bends his hands together / wening some body will take
ought out of them: sometime crows he like a cock / sometime barks he like a
dog / and many such foolish toys uses he.

But if it comes of Flegma / then are his brains corrupt and slymed with
cold / and thereof becomes he mad: Raging^ caused by flegma.
to such one doth the devil gladly accompany / and so is he possessed.

He that is become mad with sadness and heuinesse / to him ought fair* be
spoken and made merry / many things should be promised him / and some be
given. Sadness or heuynesse.
If it is a man / the same ought to be refreshed with women / the same avoids
anger. But if it is a woman / the same ought to be refreshed with men / and to
their company admitted: the same brings them to their right mind again. It
is good also to give them meates of good digestion / as mutton / chykens / new
laid eggs / white bread and drinks not to strong. If they have no sieges /
then give the pillulas cochie to bedward / the same purge the head. It is to be
considered also / that if he have much blood / then ought he to be letten in
the middelmost vein of the forehead: six days after ought he to be letten
blood upon both the hands / by the thombe in the Cephalica. Let him use meates
and drinks cold of complexion / let him not drink wine.

This drink were good for such one.
TAke a dish full of barley / Licoris an uncle and an half / cut ye same small
and take an handful of Waybred / and seth all this in a quart of fair water
/ strain it than through a cloth / and let him drink of it. A drink against
raging.
It is good also to wash his head in lye / where in flowers of Camomille are
sodden Veruine / of each a hand full in a quart of water / the same comfort
the head.

If the madness were of Flegma or of superfluous cold / whereby the brains
were cooled / then let him eat meates that may warm him / let him keep him
self warm: but first ought he be purged of this wise: Cure of raging caused
by flegma or cold.
Take the leaves of Sena / made to powder a quart of an uncle / fine sucker
half an uncle / and an eggs shale full of aqua vite / as much of Buglosse
water / as much of good white wine / and so much broth of Peasen / as
altogether: let the same be warm / and put all these things together / and
beat them well: of this give him to drink in the dawninge / or when the day
breaks. If he will not take it by him self / then open his mouth by force /
and pour it into the same. The third day after give him to bedward iij.
pills of cochia / and let no air come to him.

If it is in winter / then keep him warm in a close chamber both night day.
But if it is in summer / then lay him in a chamber that is somewhat high / and
make him a fire of Juniper wood / wher^on the berries are / for yt is very good
for him. It were good also to put saffron into his drink and meates / his
best meates were old hens or cocks well sodden / for they do both warm and
comfort him.

And if he hath great heate in his head / then make him this collyrium: Heate.
Take Housleke and leaves of Roses of like quantity / well beaten and mixed
with women's milk / struck the same about his temples / the same couleth the
blood / and alayeth the raging: let him beware of strong drinks.

Raging vnknovven.
If a man is mad / and it is not known whereof it comes / take the lounge or
lights of a Goat buck / and bind the same warm about his head / the same
alayeth the rage. Or else take a black hen / and open her quick upon the
back / and lay the same so warm to the head. But if it is a woman or maiden
/ then take the lounge or lights of a Goat.

Raging of cold.
If a man becomes mad of cold / then were it good furth with to take a
black hen quick / and rip the same up upon the back / and lay her with
blood and all upon the head: for the same doth warm his head and brains very
well.

A good drink for one that rages / and specially if it is come of cold.
A drink for ragig of cold.
TAke a quarter of an uncle of beaten saffron / half an uncle of Cinnamon / half an
uncle of aqua vite / and put this into a pint of wine. The speces ought to be
knitt in a linen cloth. And let him drink a good draught thereof in the
morning and evening.

Spece^.
It is good also if he use speces in his drink prepared of this wise: Take a
quarter of an uncle of Saffron / Cynamon a quarter of an uncle / Clowes a quarter
of an uncle / Sugar an uncle / make thereof a confection: the same doth comfort
the head and brains very well. Or else give him the sedes of Peony beaten small
/ temper the same with wine / and give it him to drink / that gets him his
wits.

A sumigation.
It is good also to take the heart and liver of a fyshe called a Pyck / and put
the same into a pot with glowyng hot cools / and hold the same to the
patient / so that the smoke may entre into him. If he is possessed / he can
not abide that smoke / but rages and is angry.

It is good also to make a fire in his chamber of Juniper wood that is grene /
and caste into the fire Franckincense and S. Ihons grass or S. Ihons wort:
Fuga da monu, or Hypericon.
for the evil spretes can not abide this sent / wax angry / whereby may be
perceived whether a ma be possessed of an euel spret or not.

The cure of all these evils is (without God will punish them of a several
wise.) They shall take and use two eggs shells full of Aqua vite / three times as
much of other wine / mixte among it / a quarter of an uncle of powder of Scene /
the same let him use three morning fastinge. A cure general.
Or else let him use Aqua vite / where in is styped fumitory / or the mary of
Walwurt / or th^ stone Lazulus / or Garmander / or Brake of the wall / which
all do purge black colera or Melancholy: For with purging black colera / is the
spleen cleansed / and there with avoid the strange thoughts and imaginacions /
the pensiffenesse and melancholy is driven out / and the brains get again
their force or strength / and are increased. Wherefore if this be done / then is
the euell sprete or will driven out / and all wicked thoughts are forgetten.
If man be thus tended / than comes he again to his right natural
understanding. Nevertheless the forsayde medecins must be ministered to him
ether when soever the pangs come upon him / or when he seems to be fre of
them / that they may minishe by process of time / or else hinder so much the
less. If any child wear Peony sede about his body / no euell sprete can
hinder him.

Item x. or xij. sedes of Peony beaten with wine / then drunk / avoid the
disease called Incubus / that is the Mare / which is a sycknesse or fantasy
oppressinge a man in his sleep / that him seems a great weight lye upon his
body / wherefore he groneth and sighs / but can not speak. Incubus or the
Mare.


If a man were desperate or frantic by fantesyes and his wits were spread
abroad / if thou wilt gather again ye scattered wits: To gather wits
stravved.
the take a great basin / set it sedelings to a wall / so that it do lean
holy upon the wall / then take a lauer with a cock full of water / set that
high upon a coupborde or other thing / open ye cock a little / so yt the water
drop by little and little upon ye basin / and make a ringinge / and run out of
the basin again. Into this chamber or place lay the patient / so that he can
not se this / nor let not much be spoken to him: then doth he muse and fantasy
so much upon yt dropping ringing / what it may be / willing gladly know what
it is / yt at the last he fastens his wits / gathered them again. If the
water fail / the fill ye lauer again. Also may be given to him the sovereign
water of Buglosse.

Of disease in the even.
IF one have disease in ye even / the same comes of ye four coplexios:
Disease of the even.
as namely / if they be moist / yt comes of ye blood / the same his eye are heavy
/ the filthiness yt comes out of the / is very vnclene / ye veins of ye
teples grieve him. If it be of read colera / then do his eyes smart him so sore
/ as though one did prick him into the same with nedles / they are very rede
and hot. The cure
First loke the patient have good sieges / and let him beware of things that
are hot / and be quiet. Purge him his head with pills de hiera picra: the
first night let him take v. pills / the second night vij. ye third night ix.
the same do purge his head. Pills cochie do likewise / but of them must he take
nomore / save iij. at ones. Let him eschew flesh / but eat fishes without
skales.

This collyrium following is a medicine for the even: Collyrium that is a
medicin for sore eyes.
Take the white of eggs / and beat them so long till they wax so thyck / that
if ye put a little straw there in / it stands upright: than hold the dish
wherein thou doest beat it upon the one side / and let the thynne run out
into some other vessel: to the same put as much woman milk that sucks a
boy / and as much water of roses / beat all these together / and wet a fine
linen cloth therein / press it out a little / and lay it upon the eyes ^ till
it waxes dry the / same slakes the euell heate / and draws it out / and
alayeth strayghtwaye the payne and smart of the even. Do this every hour
ones / and when he will go to bed / then lay them cloth upon his even / and
struck of this confection with a whether into his even / the same takes away
the smart also. But it were very good to lay first the white of an egg and
rose water to his nape of the neck.

Also if the head and eyes do ache / then make a foot bath / A bath for sore
eyes.
and let him sit there in until above the calfe of the leg / cover him
well / that the vapor may stryke up to his body / and chafe him / also rub
him his legs while he sits in the bath. After that take the white of eggs
/ water of Roses and vinegre / of each a like / and beat them together / then
take a fine linen cloth / a span long / and a hand broad / dip the same into
it / and lay that upon his neck: when the same waxes dry / then let him
wash his fete in cold water / so that they be wet no farther / then the ankles
/ then let him draw them out again straight way / and let him lye down
upon a bed / and let the fete be uncovered / and then lay the collyrium upon
ye eye / and this must he do in the morning / at none and at even: the same
draws out the evil heate / and alayeth te payne / and is oft times proved.

Experience.
The rote of Pilletory taken in the mouth in the morning and at even knawed /
but not eaten / and then the mouth washed with half vinegre half water:
the same draws down the heate through the mouth / and minisheth the heat in
the head and eyes.

Reed eyes.
But if the eyes remain read / then take of that water that stands in the
leaves of wild Tasill / and put that into the eyes: or else the water that
drops out of the veins in marche / when they be most communlye cut and
bound up / put thereto the third part as much white of an egg beaten. Also
if a read spott or a bloody mark did remain in the eyes / the take the white
bladder / having at the yolke of an egg / called the chycken / put that in the
eye in the morning and even.

VVeke even or sight.
If a pore body hath weak even or sight / wilt thou keep them that they wax no
worse / take the tongue of a fox / hang the same about his neck / and so
lunge it hangs there / shall not the sight wax feeble nor weak / as saith
Pliny. Likewise doth it also to him / that eats or knaweth every morning
fastinge five or six sedes of Juniper / and holds the nethermost lip above
the upper / and holding his hand before his mouth / blows / and receives
the breath into his even.

Spots i the eye.
For spots in the even / take the herb Veruayne with his rote hole the
substance / tie the same about thy throat / and wear it / until the spots
perish and fayde: the herb may be sowed with a linen cloth about the
neck.

Spur blind.
If one were spur blind / which also is caused by superfluous humiditye of
the head / when the veins of the sight are stopped with payne / yet are the
eyes fair and clear / so that a ma can not perceive he is spur blind /
without one do take good heed. At the last gets he many syckely weke veins
or spots about the forehead. The appel or ball of the eye of some men doth
break / so that the innermost of them doth rot / and the sight of the eye
perishes: the same also have oft payne in the head. But this disease do
lightely great women whose flowers fail before it be time / and specially women
that have cold heads. If this were looked to otherwhyles / a man might well be
helped / with giving a quarter of an uncle of Iera pirra that he were purged: he
must beware also of things that cause euell humores and of inordinate
meatinge or drinking.

Runnige even.
If a mans even do run of superfluous humiditye / then lay Walnut leaves in
cold water / and to bedward shake the leaves that the water avoid from the
leaves / and lay one of them upon the one eye: and when it waxes dry / lay
an other upon it / the same draws the evil moisture and heate out of it /
and cleanses the even.

He that hath a dymme sight / let him take the water of Dandelion or of Cicory
/ and put the same into his even / and they shall wax clear. Dymme syghte.


He that hath read or running even / let him take the water that stadeth in the
wild Tasill leaves / or else water of the vynestock / the weight of half an
uncle / the weight of ten corns or greynes of white Amber: Read or running
even.
put ye same into a glass / and let it stand viij. days before ye occupy it
/ shake or stere it every day three or four times in the day: the elder it is
/ the better is it.

The rote of Veruin or cut Malow / called in Latin Alcea / hagged about the neck
/ drives away spots and blemishes of the even / whether it be in a man / or
horse / as I Ierome of Brunsweig / author of this treatise / have sen my self.
Spots or blemishes i the even.
I have also myself done it to a blind horse / yt was first bought for x.
crowns / was sold again for xl. crowns / the which was hanged the root about
the neck / gave him the herb chapped with his meat or prouander.

He that hath gotten dust or such other thing into his even / let him lye upon
his back / let him put into his eye iij. or iiij. sedes of Clary / let him
clese his even / than do they roll about into the even / and draw ye dust
with them. Dust in the even
This is proved by the wild clary / called communly Oculus Christies sede /
that it doth so. The stones also found in the maw of swalowes / and specially
yonge ones / do likewise.

To heal all manner disease of the ears.
Sometime is the hearing lost clean / so that a man hears nothing at al / or
a little. Disease of the ears
He that is so diseased / must be laid in the sun in summer / and loke into
his ears / whether ought be fallen into them: or else whether an apostemacion /
or bluster / or any other thing be in it / whereby his hearing might fail.
But if nothing is found nor scene in therein / then is it sure / yt the grefe
comes from within ye head / of some vapor yt is gathered there / where by the
hearing is stopped / or else of some apostemacion in ye head / where ye organes
of hearing are. And he yt is so diseased / speaks so softly / yt he can
scarsely be understand / is troubled with sleep. Cure.
To the same ought be given iij. pills de iera picra Galeni / the same draw the
humours from ye ears head / cause him to nyse. After yt set boxes upon the one
ear / to draw the fylt out of ye head. But if a man is let blood in the head
out of scason / the same hurts him sore / and causes him to become deaf.

If a man have a sounding or piping in his ears / the same comes sometime of a
hot slymy fylthynesse / or of a hot slymy moystnesse. Souding in the ears.
He that is so diseased / ought to take pills de iera picra / then put oil of
Hempsede warm into his ears / mixed with a little vinegre / after yt let him
leap upon his one leg / upon that side / where the disease is / than let him
bow down ye ear of that side / if happily any moisture or filth would issue
out.

This disease comes sometime of the Summer heate: he that is diseased thereof /
hath great heat in his head. Put woman milk and Hemsede oil mixte together
into his ear / on that side where he is diseased / that alayeth the heat.

Let him that is deaf take a handful of Rue or Herb grace / Cure of deaf.
chappe or cut the same small / and put it into a new pot with a pound of good
vinegre / cover it close / and put it to the fire / and let it seth / that it
run over. Then let him go into the hot house / and when he doth sweat well /
take a thonnel with a lunge pipe / yt he may cover the pot holy therewyth /
make hot the pot / and let the vapor go thorough the thonnel into the ear. If
it be in winter / and can have no Rue / then seth beans of one year in
water / and do likewise. If ye have no beans another / than take Heysede upon a
heyelift sotten in water / and use the same as is said of the Rue / so hot as
ye can suffer it.

Souding i the head.
Against the soundynge and whysperinge in the head / put warm water into a
lauer / and let it drop softly upon the hindmost of the patients head /
by this dropping is the soundynge and noise in the head taken away. And when
the lauer is empty / then fill it again / until the payne is away.

Hearing evil.
He that hears euell / let him seth Juniper berries and Sauin of like
quantity in good wine / put into a new pot / well dressed and stopped: then
let him bore a hole thorough the lid of it / and lay his ears upon the hole
/ to receive the same vapor.

Against sounding and ringinge in the ears.
Souding in the ears.
IN May bore a hole in an Ash tree about the midst / put a rede or such like
thing into the same hole / and set a vessel or pot by the tree / under the rede
/ let it so stand five or six days / then shall run clear water out of
the tree. This water put into some vessel and make it warm / hold the ear
over the vapor of it / and make as it were a tent of a sponge / wet the same
in the water / and cleanse the ear therewyth in the morning and even / and the
soundinge or whyspering in the ear shall go away.

Of blethynge at the nose / and staunchynge of the same.
Blething at the nose.
BLething at the nose is sometime good / sometime evil. He that hath a Catharre /
that is a room or stillinge down of humores in the head / or an apostemacion
/ blethinge at the nose / is good for him. It is also a good token / if the
blood waxes to hot in the body / and runs up into the head / and fylleth
the veins so sore / that they do breast. If the blood then come furth at the
right nose trill / the let him blood at the Cephalica upon the same side upon
the hand / by the thombe. But if the blood comes furth at the left nosetrill
/ then tie his leg above yt kne with a strong list or swadeling band / then
remains the blood in yt leg: after that beat eggs shales to powder / and
syft then through a linen cloth / and blew them into his nose: if the shales
were of eggs / whereout yonge chickens are hatched / it were so much the
better. Or else take the dounge of an ass / mix the same with vinegre / and
hold the same at his nose. Likewise doth the dounge of a Sow or Swyne that
hath eaten grass. Stauchig of blood


He that bletheth so sore / that nothing can stanch him / it is good to tie
his fourth finger / or finger next the little finger of the same side so fast /
do he do so even swell: for that stauncheth the blood / and specially on the
left hand.

It is good also to tie ye herb called Shepherds burse about his neck / or
else give it him to hold in his hand / until it waxes warm / and dight it
in his meat. Or else take a soft linen cloth / the length breadth about of half
a yard / wet the same in cold water: but if ye have vinegre / take of like
quantity / and tie it about his privy membre. If it is a woman / then let her
hold it to her privities. And if ye have no vinegre / then bind him the cloth
about his neck / dipped in water only / and when it waxes warm / than wet
it again. It is to be considered / that thou do lose his gyrdel / set him
upright / lest he do hang forward.

It is to be noted / that blethyng is caused sometime in yt time of a disease /
or in the amendinge / this last is good / wherefore it ought not to be
staunched: The profit of blething Tokens of blethyng.
without he did bleth to sore / whereof the patient might be the more feeble /
and therefore ought he to be helped / lest he wax to weak. If the blood come
out from the head / so that a man hath gotten a rising of the blood into the
head / that shalt thou know thereby: he hath payne in the forehead: the same
must be letten blood in the Cephalica / that is ye urine of the head. But if
the superfluity of blood or blething comes of ye liver / then hath he pain in
ye right side with a stiche: the same ought to be let blood on the right had /
by ye little finger / in ye vein of ye liver. But if the blood comes of ye
spleen / tha hath he payne in ye left side with a stich: the same ought to be
let blood on the left hand / by the little finger in ye vein of the spleen:
the same also ought not be girded / nor yet wear any weight about his body /
nether deck him warm: he must beware also of all that might warm him / and be
quiet. Nota.
It is to be marked / that when he that hath the pestilence bledeth / and can
not be staunched / nor cease / it is an evident and sure token of death.

Of spots and blemishes of the face.
IF a man hath spots or blemishes in the face or under the eyes / or where
they be / take the rote of Couckoupintel or Wake robin / stamp the same / and
struck the juice there of in the morning and evening upon them / and they go
away. Spots in ^
Or else take the stone growing of wine life / beat the same very small / hang
it with a cloth in a moist cellar / set something under it / for out of it shall
drop water: with the same anoint the spots under the eyes oft times / but
beware it come not into the eyes. Or else anoint thy selfes with the water yt
stands in the wild Tasill leaves / or else with the water yt drops out of
the Vine / when he is cut and bound up in Marche / the same do oft. Or else
anoint the spots oft with the juice of the rote of Briony or wild neppe /
beaten and strained.

Against a fistula by the nose / take the slyme of a sows guts / and burn
that to powder / put the same powder into the disease / it heals the same / for
it hath ben expe^imented. A fistula by the nose.


Against evil scabbinesse or schilfering chekes / that will not heal nor fall
down.
Take onyons and white Lily roots of like quantity / roast them in ashes /
shell them and make them clean / then strain them through a cloth / put
thereto oil of Roses / and struck this upon the sore. Scabbye chekes.


Against the fistula in the cheke.
A fistula in the cheke.
Mark which touth stands next to the sore / the same draw out / and cleanse
the hole: take the rote of that drawn touth / and put it into the sore /
hereof is the sore healed.

Of all diseases of the mouth and his appertenances.
Diseases of the mouth.
Against the stinking of the mouth / chawe oft in the day herb called Cinkfoly
or fyuefyngered grass / and it shall go away in four days.

If ye have eaten garleke / and your breath savours strong after the / eat the
leaves of Rue or herb grace / and it shall not be perceived with you.

If a man have great heat and drought in his mouth / so that he thinks his
mouth will burn / then take the water of Marche ^se in thy mouth / that
slakes it. But if thou haste not that / lay four or six flint stones / so
big as a Walnut in cold water / and take always one of them into thy mouth /
and hold it therein: and when it waxes warm / take it out / and lay it in
cold water again / and take another into thy mouth. This doth much good / and
slakes also the thyrst.

Of all diseases of the teeth.
The vse^ and diseases of the teeth.
THe teeth are created to chawe the meat therewith / that it may be the more
apt to digestion / they aid also to the speech / to retain the breath / and to
man^dorning or continesse. They have (...) payne and sinerte / as other members
or lymmes / namely knawynge / holes / worms / wagging / apostemation in the
gummes / corrupt humours and blood of the gummes.

A sure medicine for toothache.
A sure medicin for tothake.
TAke a garlyke head / pil it / beat it in a mortar / that it wax soft / moisty
/ and that it be not hole: and loke on what cheke or side the toth ache is / on
that arm bind the garlic / upon the wrest of the arm / where boxes are set
most communly / so that it do not touche the mousse of the hand / and lay it
as ne'er together as ye can: cover it with a spoune or broad Walnutshell a hole
night / and then will it caste a bluster: pearse the same through / or else will
it burst by it self. But if ye will have it run sore / take a leaf of
Danwurt or Walwurt / and turn the rough side inwardely. And if thou wilt have
it to heal / then take the Walwurt leaf / and turn the smooth side inwardely
/ and it heals.

To make a tooth so fall without smart.
SEth as many little grene frogs / brething or sitting upon trees / as thou
can get in water / until the flesh do consume: To make ^ teeth fall out
with out smart
take the fat flowing upon them / and keep it in a clean thing / and when need
is / anoynte the teeth therwyth. But take heed / that thou do not touche the
other likewise / or else consumes it the other also. Likewise doth the touth of
a dead man / if one touche there with the sore touth: but let him that doth it
beware / lest he touche any more / for they fall out also / without any smart.

The gray worms brething under wood or stones / having many fete / and when
they be touched / do they cluster together like porkenpickes: these persed
through with a botken or like thing / and then put into t^e touth yt aketh /
alayeth the payne. Likewise doth also a little slyce of the rote of Acorus / of
some called in English Gladen / of other Galanga / which grows in waters and
marasses / this must be laid grene upon the touth. A piece of the grene rote of
Termentil doth likewise.

Of the swelling in the rote of the mouth / called in Latin Vua or Vuula.
THe swelling that is caused of a cold slimy humour / falling out of ye head /
and hanging in the rofe of a mans mouth / is called in Latin Vuula / which
hinders a man of his speech: this shall be cured of this wise: Svvellig in the
throat.
If it is of superfluous blood / then is the disease read / long and great /
the veins ^f the forheade are gross and swollen / then let him blood in the
Cephalica upon the hand. But if it comes of other accidents / as of
superfluous moisture and cold / then take white dogs torde that is dry / and
make it to powder / and take commune salt / and dry it in a pan upon the
fire / so yt it wax eve brown: bray the same of like quantitye together to
powder / put that to the swelling or disease: for it is good and upright.

Or else bye white Frankincense / cast a piece of it upon hot coals: put a
thunnel over it / and let the smoke thereof go into thy throt / that helps /
and is oft times experimented or proved.

Or else take Sal armoniacum / and make a powder thereof / heave the swelling up
therewyth.

It is very good to let him blood under the tongue / or else upon both the
thumbs / when the disease begins: for it helps him. Some do cut it of:
but that is dangerous. They that be so diseased / must beware for cold drinks
/ and specially of milk and chese.

An other experience for the swelling in the rofe of the mouth / or else him yt
can not well take breath / which I have oft showed poor people / namely / to
pull ye patient sore by ye earlap vpwardly / incontinently shall he be healed.

How to help one that hath the Squince in the throat / called the Squinancia.
THe Squince or Squinancy is an apostem in ye throat / is very dangerous. If it
comes in a sickness / then is it dagerous / if it comes in an ague / the is
it not so dangerous. To such a patient ought to be give gruell of otmeel / well
lifted through a cloth / and put thereto ten or twelve almondes well bea^en: and
when it is dressed in a vessel / put a little suker to it / and ^atso with
bread. But if he hath an ague with it / give him of a quillis of a cock
without bread / and make him a drink of this wise: Take of Lycoris / cut
small j. vnces of suker have an uncle / seth the in water / skin it well / and
let him hold it away a little in the mouth / and wambel it roundabout in the
mouth. Make him also this plaster to lay outwardely.

Cure of squinacy
Take white dogs dyrte three vnces / Dittanye beaten powder an uncle / grene
Wormwod brayed small an uncle / half an uncle of barley flower: mix these al
together with honey / struck it upon a cloth / lay it warm about his neck.
This plaster hath healed many / it heals a man / or else dies he ye fyft
day. Sometime breaks ye swellynge out outwardely / but ye inward is deadly
for it doth lyghtely choke a man. It is therefore diligently to be marked what
occasion of ye disease hath. If it comes of reed Colera / which is ho^e dry
/ than hath ye patient great pain anguish / with ye great hea^e thyrste.
Make him a plaster outwardely about his neck of Popular leaves sede / sees it
well / temper it with oil of violets Camomille / and struck yt upon a clothe /
and lay it warm about the neck.

But if ye can not have yt oil / take the leaves of Elder / leaves of reed
kole / of each a handefull / chapped small brayed / sees them with honey and
butter / of each a spounfull. Lay this warm about his neck.

Thyssame hath helped and healed many: or else make him any of the players of
the swalowes nest following.

But if the Squynce is of superfluous blode and heate / than must he be let
blood incontinent in the right hand upon ye thombe in ye Cephalica / under ye
tunge: In ye hand upon four vnces / under ye tunge upon two vnces. And as
soon he is letten blood / must be made this drink for him to gargelle: take
about five vnces of Diamoron / take one uncle thereof mixte with warm water /
hold yt in the mouth / gargell therewy^h spytt it out / cause him to do this
five times. The next day let boxes be set upon his neck / without scrapynge /
these shulde draw ye blood from thence. Or else bind about his neck / as I
have taught before / and let this byndynge be three times within day night / at
every time a quarter of an hour.

Make him this plaster: Take the nest of a swalowe or pie / but ye swalowes
nest is the best with all the substance / as clay / gravel / styckes or
feathers / nothing except / beat it / and syft it through a course syffe / so
t^at it may be fined / put thereto honey grease / and make a plaster there of
/ struck it upon a cloth / and lay it about his neck. Of this wise have I
helped one in iij. hours space. Item make him this drink: Take Licorys / Anis
/ Figs and great Raysons / of each an uncle / sees them in a pottel of water
/ and give him every time thereof to drink.

But if thou can not have these things / art far from ye Phisicion / hast
a swelling in thy throat / than is nothing better than to take warm Mylla
gargel the same as hot thou can suffer it: this done oft / takes away ye
sycknesse / and mollifyeth ye apostemacion. Likewise may be done with mylcke or
water / wherein is sodden knapwede / otherwise called Deuels bit. And when ye
apostemacion is broke / give him warm yolks of eggs that be soft / and barley
gruel / and give him to drink water / wherein Barley is sodden / that purges
and heals him.

For the hoorsnesse.
HE yt is waxen hoorse by reason of an humour descending / or coughinge / of a
cold air or drink / of creyng or weeping: Horsnes and the causes thereof.
let the same drink in the morning warm water / as hot he can suffer it /
and wet a linen cloth in half water and half vinegre / wring it well out /
and wind it about the neck / and another that is warmed upon the same: do
this in the morning / at middaye and to bedward / let him keep him warm and
beware of cold air. If he could sweat in the bed / that were very good.
Let him also beware of cold drinks / fruits / grapes / and such like.

He may also drink warm milk / in the morning and evening / the same doth
avoid horsenesse also. Or else take Aqua vite when thou wilt go to bed / stipe
a piece of bread therein / and eat the same at even and morning: but if he is of
hot complexion / then is Aqua vite not good for him.

He that is so hoorse / that the lights seem to ascend into his throat / and
he is of cold and moist complexion / the same should drink fasting a quarter of
an uncle of oil Benedicti / mixed with a little water / though it be unpleasant
to drink / yet is it good and without danger. But if ye can not have the oil
/ then eat Anis sede: the same is wholesome and good for the horsenes. Or else
sede the karnels of Quinches / and drink that water warm to bedward. Or else
take three vnces an half of flint stones / put to them a quart of springing
water / and seth it to the half / drink thereof blood warm in yt morning at
even / and it shall go away. Or else give him this drink following: Take wine
oil of olive of like quantity / seth them in some thing drink thereof so hot
thou can at night / and in the morning a good draught: the same takes the
horsenesse away without danger. But if thou can not have oil of olyue / then
take half so much butter as the wine is / and do as is said before.

A confection to hold in the mouth against hoorsenesse.
TAke fine mustard sede meal / put thereto four times the weight of honey /
make thereof a confection / put it upon a trenscher / and cut in pieces: but set
in a cool place for melting / hold one of these slyces in thy mouth in the
morning and evening / and let them melt by them selves.

Or else give him this drink: A drink for horsenesse.
Take Penyreal a hand full / cut it small / and seth it with a pint of vinegre /
till the third part is sodden in / then strain it through a cloth / and give
the patient to drink thereof in the morning and evening always a spounfull. Or
else take a great appel / roast the same well / slice it / and lay it hot in a
dish with water / and eat it. This ought to be done to bedward / and cover
thy self well and warm / put thy head under the covering as far thou can /
or else cover thy head and face that no air come into thy mouth: the same is
good / and drives away horsenesse.

He that is become hoorse lately / let him roast a rape in ashes or upon the
fire / yt she be all black / then pare her clean / eat her as warm thou can:
drink a draught of water as warm thou can suffer it. Then wet a cloth in
cold water / strain it well out / and wind it so about thy neck: upon the
same bind another cloth well warmed / and do this when thou go to bed /
in the morning / for it drives hoorsenesse away without danger.

An experimented science for horsenesse though it hath lunge lasted.
Against ^n old horsenes
TAke a soft night kerchyf and warm it / take also a head pelow / warm
the same also / and bind it with the kerchyf about the head neck / when thou
wilt go to bed / and let it be so about thy head all night. Do this thr^
nights one after the other / and keep thy self warm / and beware of cold
drinks and air / and it shall surely go from thy without hurt. This same is
good also for the flixe and cough. Give the patient also Lycoris in his mouth.

Against horsenesse go into the hot house / and when thou hast half bathed /
drink a good draught of warm water. This is oft proved.

Garl^k sodden and eaten makes a clear voice / and drives away horsenesse
and the old cough.

Of the yexe or yexinge.
The yexe and his causes.
THe yexe comes sometime by reason of the superfluous emptynesse of the body:
sometime of superfluous fill of the stomach. If it comes by reason of the
emptiness / that signifyeth the sick or patient sufficiently / whether he hath
a long season not eaten or drunken / or else whether he hath had outrageous
sieges. Him shalt thou h^lpe of this wise: Seth an old hen with a quarter of an
uncle of Cinamome / a quarter of an uncle of Mastix / give him that broth to
drink / and the hen to eat. Give him also Hogs fete and white wine. If he be
not hot / give him confect of Quinches: but if he hath great heat / then give
him sukar of Roses.

Fill of the stomach.
But if it is of superfluous eating and drinking / then make him to perbreake
with Oken leaves / or else as I shall teach you hereafter in the chapter of
vomiting. Or else take a cake of roses and Wormwod / of like quantity / of each
a handful / and seth that in read wine / and lay it wa^me upon the stomach.
Or else let him say ought wherewith he may be sore astonished / and he shall be
rid of the yexinge. But if a man doth yexe sore in a sycknes / it signifyeth
most communely death.

Of suppuration or matteringe in the breast.
Suppuratio in the breast.
HE that hath a mattering in ye breast caused of cold / ought to beware for cold
/ and eschew the air / let him lye high or sit upright / let him not sleep
much / in his sleep ought he be waked otherwhiles / yt he may himme. Make him a
butter sup of half water and half butter / let that be well sodden / and
put not much bread therein / and eat that broth as hot as he can. The same
broth let him drink to bedward / that weakens the corrupcion very well /
and makes it apt to be cast out. Also ought little meat be given him at ones /
and little drink: for the corruption grows ye more of much eating and
drinking^. Let him always be hungery and thyrstye / nether eat any fishes nor
speces / nether drink any sour drink. A syrop of Violettes were good for
him: but if ye have not that syrop / tha make a milk of Hempsede / of water and
hempsede / or else in stead thereof take creme / and eat that / the same cools
and softens the heart without hurt or danger. After meat ought he to
walk a little / having always a warm cloth before his mouth / that the air
do not hurt him: for of the walking doth the corruption louse.

Ye must also take diligent heed that he have good sieges. Also were it good he
did sweat in the bed if he be so strong / or else to cause him to sweat with
a bath made in a kettel / and so to lay him to bed to sweat. This bath ought to
be made with Valerian and Ootstrawe / and covered with warm sheets / for these
things weaken the corruption.

Item / roast onyons / and eat them / a little butter therein / were very good.

He that hath a dry cough / and doth not caste out / it is an evident toke /
that the same hath an euell stomach / that doth not well digest / whereby are
caused many greueous diseases. A dry cough.
But if he voideth spatle that is whyt / mixed with blood / and that with payne
/ the same is a sign of a privy digestion / and of a disease of the pulino or
lights / and that is deadly.

But if he casts out afterward without smart / which nevertheless is a
little redish / the same is a sign of appearance of digestion / and nature
begins to cleanse / and is perfect.

He that hath a cough with payne in ye breast / the same ought not to bath in
water / another eat nuts / nor oil of nuts / nor poppye sede oil: Cough
vvyth payne in the breast
but let him drink water sodden. If his cough comes by cold / then let
him drink good wine.

A man that hath great disease in the breast / and also in the head / if thou
wilt help him / and purge the head and breast wounderfullye of all slymye
fleumes and filth / without any cost: Payne in the breast and head
Take two or three rotes of Bet^ / wash them clean / and dry them well / then
bray them small / strain the through a cloth / and a very blew juice shall
come out of them: upon that shall ye se a white some / blow the same away /
and take of that juice three or four drops in a quill / and draw it into thy
head through the noses: or else fill a fylberts shell full of it / and draw it
so in through the nose. Then clise thine even and nose with both thy hands /
and within a quarter of an hour issues a great deal of slymye moystnesse
out of thy mouth / whereof a man may marvel. Experience.
I have ones scene six vnces run out of a mans mouth at one time. And out of
mine oune mouth is of this wise four vnces run out / where I thought I should
have had none at all.

Of an imposteme in the breast.
The cause of an imposteme is of superfluous evil flegma in the head or
stomach: The cause of apostemes.
wherefore when the head and stomach are purged of the flegma / then go the
apostemes away also by themselves. Let the patient eat little or nothing /
and that meates of good digestion.

A drink for apostemes.
Make him this drink: Take Maiden heir / called also Colader / whyt Endiue /
Scabiose / Morsus diaboli / yt is / Deuels bit / of each a handful: Barley
pilled or puched / an eggs shell full / waters so much as is convenient / or else
ij. quarts: seth these ij. finger breadth away. After that streyne the through
a cloth: of yt make a hepsede milk / with a good porenger full of wash
hepsede: of ye same give him half a good cruys full to drink blood warm in the
morning at night. But if ye have not ye herbs / then make a hepsede milk with
barley only / and drink that half a cruys of goblet full.

A salf for apostems
After that make him this salve / and anoynte him therewyth about the breast.
Take fresh butter or creme / or else both in like quantity / seth therein leaves
/ the sede of Malowes / streyne it than through a cloth / and anoint his breast
therewith. If ye put capons greece thereto / yt were very good. After that were it
good to make him a clister or a suppository as is perteyning hereto. And this
ought every Physician know search of what coplexion ye patient is / whence ye
disease comes / what medicine is convenient for it. For if the Physician doth
it not / and ministers to him that which is contrary to his nature or
complexion / than doth he misorder the patient / is gilty of his payne or
happily death. For this cause ought no Physician to trust to his sciece nor
wisdom only / but ask enquire of ye patient or other al circustances / to what
fashion ye disease doth incline. He ought also to se view ye vrin feel ye pulse
/ to behold the patients physiognomy. The may the Physician minister to ye
patient so much ye more boldlier medicines / according to ye sciece: to such a
Physician may a man trust so much the better: for he may be called a true
Physician. For apostemes in ye breast are dangerous / therefore is it true
necessary / to know by what complexion or teperatur ye diseases are caused.
Apostes of Colera.

Apostes for flegma or cold.


If ye disease comes of read Colera / or blood / the ought ye to minister ye
patient al such things / as I have taught in ye precedet chapter. But if it is
caused by flegma or cold / then make him this salve / and anoint him about the
breast. Take an uncle of butter / capon or hens greece an uncle / oil of Bay or
sorel half an uncle / and mix them together / anoint him about the breast
therewith / and lay vnwashen wolle thereupon that is black. But he must
refrain from salt meates / and of all sour meates.

Against breaking up and vomiting.
Against perbreakynge.
TAke a piece of bread stiped in salt and vinegre / bruise it / and make it like a
thick plaster / lay it upon ye chest or hearts holownesse / where the mouth
of the stomach is. And if ye struck it about ye patients mouth / yt comfort
him / and gives him strength.

Item ye water wherein karnels of quinches have lain or stiped / ye same
refrayneth the breaking up of the stomach: for it comfort ye stomach / makes
good digestion. But when ye time of the quinches is / then may they be sodden
alone / without sucker honey / in stead of confect for ye hart / so used.

The right making of Ptisana / that is / Barley water.
Barley water / communly called Ptisana / is praised and commended of all
Physicians / and is a sovereign medicine against all colerik and subtle heate
/ it opens the oppilacion or stopping / it moves sweat urine / it mollifyeth
ye belly bound with hard filth / it causes sleep / alayeth thyrst / it doth
also partly norish / it is convenient for al parts of the breast the poulmon.

Ptisana is taken sometime warm / to cause sweat / sometime cold to allay thyrst
/ sometime with suker / sometime without suker / sometime much / sometime little. The
ministratio thereof at one time is is a cruys full / that is iiij. vnces /
howbeit it must be ministered to an empty stomach / or at the lest not
overcharged. It is sometime taken by day of the thirsty diseased / and is
convenient in fervent agues and many other diseases.

Take fulgrowen barley that is heavy / not withered / take also clear running
water / yt hath his course toward the East / whose ground is stony or sandy.
Of this water take x. parts / of the barley one part: Making^ of Barley water.
put them together into a clean pot / make a slow fire under it of wood twelf
hours long till the water is coloured of the barley yalow rede / like to bier:
after that take it of and let it cool / and use it.

Howe he may be helped that speweth blood.
HEmoptoica is a disease / when a man speweth blood at ye mouth / whereof the
cause is superfluity of blood / this shall be know of this wise: Spevvig of
blood
he is full of body redish / his veins are great. Sometime comes it out of
the stomach / then hath the patient payne in ye breast before. But if it comes
of the lever / then hath he payne in the right side. And if it comes of the
lunges or lights / then hath he payne in the left side / cougheth much.
Sometime doth it also come of falling or ryottinge / and the must he be helped
of this sort: He must beware of anger / of long fasting / of sour or bitter
meates and drinks / and of surfeiting. The cur^
He ought to be let blood on the same hand / where the disease is. If it is of
the lever / then must he be let blood in the right hand: but if it is of the
lunges / then ought he to be let blood on the left hand / and give him this
medicine.

Take Plantayn wild Tasil / with ye water yt stadeth in the Tasil / put thereto
reyne water / streyne it through a cloth: of this give the patient to drink in
the morning fasting and to bedward. But if the wild Tasil have no juice / then
seth it in reyne water / bray it / strayn it through a cloth / cast the herb
away: then take the broth / put suker thereto / give it the patient to drink.
Give him also in the morning and evening to drink goats milk / or powder
made of moulberries: or else give him to drink reyn water wherein are sodden
shepeherdes purse / knotgrasse and waybred / bray them when they are sodden /
streyne them through a cloth / give him to drink thereof three times in the
day / every time a good draught. Give him also three days one after the other
to eat wheat with water and butter.

If one speweth out matter.
The same may he help of this wise: Give him Diapenidion or diagagatu. Ye must
mark also / that if ye lay the matter or corruption / that he voydeth upon
hot coals / and it stynketh / then signifyeth it the rotting of the poulme or
lights / which is very evil and deadly: to such one ought no man to minister
medicine / for he is to sore sick.

But if he have great heat in his sycknesse / then say al Physicians / that
nothing is better / then to give him to drink barley water. This heate is
known by the urine / whether it be great or not / by the chance of the vrin /
and the thycke of it synketh to the bottom. But if the disease will last lunge
/ then give the patient what he lists / and if he waxes a little stronger
there of / then give him more: if not / give him no more. Ye must mark also /
that if he be sick of an ague or like disease / then let him be given what
he lists / while the disease lasts.

When one would gladly perbreake / and can not do it.
Perbreaking of a diseased stomach.
THe perbreakinge happens many ways: sometime by the disease of the stomach /
as namely / when the stomach casts from the bottom yt meat / and can not
keep it / which happens that the nethermoste part of the stomach is stronger
then the uppermost. The cause of this must be considered by the same that is
wyded.

Perbreakinge by grefe of the stone
Sometime comes it by the grefe of the stone / or else the corruption then will
grow to matter / that there of he doth perbreake. Thissame is well perceived by
the urine / and also whether he hath payne in the loins / bladder / or back.

Perbreakinge of cold moystnesse.
If the perbreaking comes of cold moistness or humours / then is it yelowe. It
is to be known / that ye ought not to stanch that perbreakinge until the
stomach be cleansed of the evil humours / after that ought it to be provided.

If the perbreakinge be sound and harde / that the patient can have no sieges
/ then give him Cassia fistula / and cleanse him. Perbreaking that is harde.


But if the perbreakinge is of the read Colera / by reason of a hot stomach /
then give him sour bitter Pears to eat / or else give him Sorrel to drink /
or else give him syrop of Violettes to drink with water in the morning and
evening. Perbreakinge of read Colera.


Item meddlers eaten fasting / wythstande perbreakinge caused by heat. Likewise
doth Mint eaten fastinge / and Anis eaten mornings and eueninges.

Or else take a cold flint stone / and hold it to the neck of the patient /
the perbreakinge cease. Or else take a hand full of feathers / and put them in
to a pot / and put to them glowynge hot coals / and hold thy mouth over it
wide open / that the vapor or smoke may go into it / and then shall the
wamblinge cease. Perbreakinge of black Colera.


But if the perbreakinge comes of the black Colera / then set boxes of each
side of his neck.

Of Flegma.
But if it is caused of Flegma / then take Wormwod / Mugworte / Hirse or Millot
vnstamped of each four vnces. Put all these into a little sack or bag / and
quilt them so / that they cluster not / and seth them in half wine and half
water / wring it then out / that it drop no more / and lay it then warm
upon his breast: the same warms his body and cold stomach / and alayeth the
rambling and perkreakinge. It helps also a woman with child that hath
overmuch wamblinge. Also doth it help them that have the stone engendered of
cold / and must bow themselves much / it doth also alaye grepinges.

If the perbreaking comes of cold / or else of cold and moist humours /
Perbreakinge of cold.
ether in a man or woman / then take Cumin / and make four bags / each a
span long and broad / put in each of the bags an uncle of Cumin / quilt the
same bags croswyse / that the Cumin do not cluster / seth the same in a quart
of vinegre / bind one of the upon each wrest of the hand as warm as it may be
suffered / likewise upon the wrast or jointure of the fete. And when they wax
cold / warm the again in ye same liquor / wherein they were sodden / lay the up
again as before / of this wise cease the perbreaking continently without
danger. And give the patient a broth of gray peasen wherein Cumin is sodden /
let him drink good strong drink / let him put at every breakfast a penny weight
of beaten saffron therein / ye same coforteth ye brains stomach / refrayneth ye
rambling or perbreakinge: but he must bewar of such things as cool him.
Howbeit some complexions ca not away with saffron abhor it: for it causes a
lothsomnesse: let the same drink water of Buglosse and Porcelene / the same
comfort the head also.

But if the perbreaking would not hold up / then make him a bag of half an
elle in length and breadth / and put therein Cumin / and dress the same as is
said before / seth it in vinegre / and lay it warm upon the navel / as warm
as thou can suffer it: and when it waxes cold / warm it again: with this is
allayed the perbreakinge / and also doth this wythstande the grepinge.

But if one had a wamblinge / and did perbreake / and wist not for what cause /
or whereby it comes / let the same take the leaves of Quenches / bind them
upon the wrast of the hades / that alayeth it: Perbreakynge whose cause is
vnknovven.
the grener yt leaves be / the better be they. Yet if one would keep the in
store for winter / let him pluck them of from the trees before our Ladies day /
the xv. day of August / and let them dry out of the Son.

Against perbreakinge take half an uncle of Betonye powder / and two vnces of
honey / make a confection therewyth / and give the patient thereof every day
fastinge.

Meddlers eaten / do wythstande perbreakinge / comfort the stomach / and refrain
wamblinge.

I myself have had a woman / which was accustumed every morning / to void at
the mouth about two eggs shells full of vnclene slyme of clammy flegmatish
matter: the same was taught to take a certain space every morning a warm
slyce of bread / roasted with salt / and that alayeth the perbreakinge.

But if a man had eat ought / or had slymy matter within him / would fain be
rid of it: To cause perbreakinge.
to cast the same out by perbreaking / let him take white nisynge powder /
called Lingworte / about the third part of a dram / and use it in a broth
of peasen / and it shall continently break from him. But if thou can not
have Lingwort or Nising powder / then take the root of Elder / and pyll the
uppermost shell of it when it is crene / wash it / and b^ay it in a mortar /
and give him it in a warm peasebroth. As for nising powder belonged to strong
complexioned folk to use / and not over the weight that I have above
specifyed: For I was called by a man / that had taken nisinge powder or
Lingwort / a little bag full / as is commenly sold / and had eat the same /
supposing therewyth to drive away from him / such filth and slime / as he had
in his stomach. And as soon as he had taken it / furthwyth had he such a rage
and grepyng within him / that easily was scene the stomach rise up and down /
even to the neck / and a cold sweat brake out: so that he wened to dye
straght way: yea I my self judged him dead also. But as soon as I toke an
uncle of wine / and a dram (or the fourth part of an uncle) of Castoreum /
warmed and mixte together / and gave him it / by and by was the wamblinge
allayed.

Of like wise have I scene a boy of eight years / eat the parings of white
^isinge powder / that were pilled from the root by a Potekary / and when the
child was brought to me / not knowing what had happened / I advised by my
self / that the child had eaten Lingwort. For the sweat brake fearcely out /
and it waxed pale / as if it would dye. Wherefore I gave him Castoreum / the
bigness of a filbert with a little warm wine / and continently was it hole /
which was even at the point of death.

A strange Apotekary bad my seruaunt smell in a sag / wherein was beaten
Lingworte or nising powder: and when he smelled therein / he thrust his head
into it / so that his mouth and nose were full of it. Then ran he up and
down in the house / as though he should have dyed. Wherefore I gave him
str^ight way fresh butter / and after that Castoreum with wine / (as is said
before) and he was healed incontinently. This have I written / that simple
folk may beware of Lingworte or white nising powder / with out it were proved
before / wherefore the commune people knows not. Like I my self have scene a
strange peddelapotecary minister to the commun people / that two or three dyed
of it. Therefore when one will use them / he ought not to take above the weight
of twintye wheat corns / with a whyt peas^lbroth. Howbeit for the Lingworte
may be taken the roots of Elder pilled / as is specifyed before.

To cause to {per}break without pain
Wilt thou cause one to perbreake lightely without smart or pain / take the
sede of Orange / seth that in water without salt / and put a little oil of
nuts thereto / and give him it with some course meat / and let him eat well
/ that the stomach may be full. After yt give him of the foresaid broth warm
a good draught: after that let him labour a little / or else walk / until he be
chafed / and then shall he perbreake and cast out whatsoeur evil corrupcion
he hath in his stomach.

The cough and the causes thereof.
For the cough.
Many ways gets a man the cough: sometime of the breasts mistemperinge /
sometime of a matter that is inward or outward of the body. If it be within /
as it happens oft / that an humour falls out of the head into the breast /
the same is the worst to be healed. An humour in the breast


If the cough comes of heat / then is the brine rede / and this throat is
dry and rough. To such one ought be given barley potage with butter to be
eaten / and Ptisana or Barley water to be droncken / wher^in Lycoris is sodden.
Give him also to eat potage made with Lettis chapped and sodden in water / and
after that well fried in butter / this takes away he cough without payne.

The cough that is engendered by cold / is known by the whytenesse of the
brine.

He that hath a fervent cough / let him take Neppe / that cattes delight in / so
much as a Walnut / let him cut it small and stamp it / and ma^e a taunsey
thereof / with two eggs beaten therein: let him eat this / and it shall make
him whole. This taunsey may he eat when he will / and is specially good for
him that hath a cough / caused of cold.

Or else use this medicine: take wine and oil of olive in like quantitye / put
the same into a cruyse / and seth it a little / stere it together / and give him
that to drink / when he will go to bed / and in the morning / so warm as he
can suffer it: do this two days one after another / and this breaks the
running or morres / and softens the cough without hurt. It is also good for
horsenesse / caused of cold.

The cough doth also overtake a man by reason of an euell humour engendered in
the liver or the lights / and so do fall into the breast: An humour in the liver
the same must be helped of this wise as shall follow.

Sometime is the cough caused by foren or outward occassions as are smoke /
evil vapors / stinking airs / dust / cold drinks / or of drinking cold
when a man is chafed / or else when he drinks / it falls into the wrong
throat. Outvvar de occasions.


The dry cough comes sometime / that ye patient hath an vnclene pulmen or
lights throat / of fylthy matter / yt is assembled about ye pulmon the
gristels of ye pulmon in the chest / is wax tough: Dry cough.
whereby it comes / yt a man can not cast it out / gets sometime a deadly
aposteme. When it is now grow to an aposteme / then help him with syrups /
as I shall teach you here after to mollifye it. Take also diligent heed whence
the apostemacion comes / yt thereafter ye may know how to cure him / and let
this following be the general cure.

Take a whit cloth / wet ye same in cold water / strayn it well out again: tha
wind it well about yt patietes throat. Cure general of apostems in the breast.
After yt take another warm cloth / wind also threfold about ye throat: this do
in ye morning / middaye / at night / give him this syrop: Take a dishfull of
brayded or beat barlye / four vnces of res^nes / xij. figs well wash in
warm water: put the into a new pot / take iiij. quarts of water / let the seth
half an hour. The strayn this / put the drink again into the pot / cast into
it six vnces of sugar / let it boyle ones / then take it of and stand to
cool. Drink of this when ye will / specially in ye morning even to bedward.
This moll fieth very well / causes to cast out / makes large about the breast:
also doth it heal ye soreness roughness of the throat. If it waxes thick /
then put more water to it.

A drink for the cough / for thyrste and roughness of the throat.
TAke a quart of water / put an uncle of sugar therein / and seth the third
part of it away / strain it through cloth / and let it cool / and drink of
it so much thou listest. It is good also to wash thy mouth in the morning
and at none with warm water / and to rub thy teeth: also to wash the forehead
and temples with warm water / this cleanses and makes the head light.

An other syrop for the cough and apostemacion in the breast and heart / which
weakens and causes to caste out.
TAke Violettes a handful / six leaves of Hearts tongue / put them in a clean
cloth and in a pot / to this put a quart and an half of water / seth it
until the third part be sodden away: then press it through a cloth into a
clean pot / put thereto four vnces and an half of sugar / steer it well
vnti^l the finger is all molten. Of this may thou drink when thou wilt.

If the cough comes of heat / then is the throat sore / and very dry / and
the patient is very costyf. The cold air doth him good / when he goes in it:
for he thinks that his heart is refreshed and quickened. Thissame ought to be
let blood in the Epatica or liver vain.

But if it is not convenient to let the same blood / then mark whether his
cough be caused by a hot humour / and to what part it flows / and on that
part shall ye set boxes / for that is good.

For the hot cough.
Give him to drink syrope of Violettes / to bedward / at night / in the
morning / and else when ye will / with a little blood warm water. The same
cools / mollisieth and causes to cast out: it slakes thy^st / breaks
apostemacion / minisheth the cough / and comfort the dry and hot heart.

But when a man did cough / and were straight about the breast and heart / and
had heate therewyth / so that it were taken for an apostemacion.
TAke a dish full of Hemp sede / put thereto a little warm water / bray it
well / and strain it with warm water / so that it become as a thyn parage.
After that when it is cold / give the patient thereof to drink so much as he
lists without hurt: the same doth mollifye cool very well / slakes thyrste
/ and makes large about the heart. And it is hood to seth that hempsede milk
with butter / sup there of with a spoune as hot as ye can suffer it / and in
three days ye shall be whole without hurt or payne. It is good also for stich
about the hart.

But he that hath a consuming cough / and were greatly travailed therwyth / let
him eat at ones half a uncle of sugar Benedicti. A consumynge cough.
Then let him take three hoops of a vessel / the one always greater then the
other / hang over them a couerled or tent cloth / tied to the roof or plancher
/ in the form of a bell dounwarde / and above narrow / reaching within a
foot to the ground. Under the same set a stool with a hole / but sitting upon
the same / he may not reach with his head to the chain or festeninge. Then
take Malowes / Oerstrawe of each a great handful / and as much of herb
Valeriane / seth the same in a kettel well covered. After that put them into two
robs / and put the one under the stool with a hole / into the other set thy
fete as hot as thou can suffer it / and let the vapor strike up into the and
upon the naked body / until thou be fallen into a sweat. If the tobbe under
the stole doth cast no more vapor / then lay a hot flintstone therein / so
oft till thou be fallen in a sweat: and this ought to be done in a warm
chamber / or hot house. Ye must not trauayl your self to much / lest ye wax
to feeble: and also if ye be fat / like ye have a siege before ye attempt this
dry bath. When ye now do sweat well / then lay you down upon a bed in ye
chamber or hot house: and if ye have yet strength to sweat more / do so / for
it is very good: for it weakens the harde matter / and makes easy to be
caste out / whereof the cough is engendered. After the bath must ye not go in
the wind / and remain that night in the hot house / or some close chamber /
and should eat some thing that gives strength / and drink good drinks: the
meat must be such as nourishes well / as are Oetmel gruel / Persely ro^es /
and such like. This shall ye do three days one after another / ye cough shall be
mollified without grefe: and if he had a running in his head / whereby the
congeled matter might be hindered to lose and break / this shall break it /
and void it. Take also oft in thy mouth the root of the herb called Pelitory
of Spain or Mustard sede / chawe them / but swalowe the not: that draws
much corruption down. If the patient is strong of complexion / than put a
little Nisinge powder into his nose / to draw down the evil humours / and
beware of cold.

He ought also hold his mouth oft over a pot / wherein are sodden Rapes or
Nauets / that the hot breath or vapor may go into his mouth / until his face
wax reed / and he do sweat: and let him keep himself warm thereupon. Thus may
he do likewise over a pot / wherein Appels or Pears are sodden with wine / Ale
or Bire.

Item if ye will be rid of the running / take ix. matches made of brimstone /
put them into a pot stopped close / save a little hole / make the to burn /
hang a clock or some thing upon thy head / open thy mouth wide open over the
pot / and receive that breath or vapor into it: this do in the morning and
evening / and the running shall break or fayde.

This following is very good for the cough coming from the lights.
Against the cough caused of diseased lights.
Eat a potage made of wheat / water and butter: or else take a dishefull of
pure and clean wheat / seth the same in two quarts of wat^r / until the third
part be sodden in. The same broth is good drunken for the cough / for it
cleanses the pulme or lights / and the pypes of the same / whereof the cough
comes.

A cough with gripynge.
He yt hath the greping in his body with the cough / or else should get an
apostemacion with the cough / let him take iiij. vnces of a black shepes wol /
put ye same as warm upon his body / as he ca suffer it / ii^. times in yt day /
in ye morning / at none to bedward. That mollifies yt matter / whereof ye cough
is engendered / so yt he may void it / takes away the grypinge and cough.

Cough of humours.
But if ye cough did come of humours / desceding fro the head or other mebres
into ye breast or stomach / the give him this drink: Take honey the quantity of
an egg / beat the same with warm water / drink it as warm as you can / in
the morning and at even: that alayeth the humours. Ye must beware ye have good
sieges / lest ye get a greping thereby.

Another drink for the cough / that cools and mollifies very well / and
specially apostemes.
A drink for the cough.
TAke Hempsede well beaten / mixte with water / and strained through a cloth /
so that it wax even as milk / drink thereof in the night and toward night when
ye are thyrstye.

Or else take Rapes or Nauettes as much as a fist / roast the same well in ashes
/ yt they become as weke as a pere / ye reader they be / ye better are they: it
grieves not though they be burnt somewhat. The same shall ye eat when ye go to
bed / as warm as ye can suffer it / and likewise in the morning. This is
good also for horsenesse.

The rote of Iris or blew flower delyce sodden in wine / drunk in the morning
at night / takes away the costifnesse / makes large in ye breast.

He yt cougheth / ought oft keep his breath in / so long as he can: if yt do not
help him / then let him daily blow ye fire with his mouth / he waxes whole: if
yt do not help also / then let him eat roasted figs / whereon is strewn ye
powder of Nep or Catmint called in Latin Calamentu. But some use nomore save
four or five Pepper corns / and chawe them / that takes away the cough.

Of disease of the heart.
Hearts disease.
CArdiaca is a disease of trembling of the heart / when it trembles / leaps
and beats / by reason of the humours / that are gathered within the celles or
felles that environ the heart: and this overtakes the patient suddenly / when
the humours fall to near the heart.

If the humours are mixte with blood or colera / that causes over great heat /
then trembles the heart / and the patient waxes feeble / and thyrsteth very
sore / and draws his breath heavily.

If the humour be mixed with melancolike blood / then trembles the hart / and
the patient is werry / thyrsteth not / and is faint: wherefore ought ye hart be
helped furthwith / saying it is the most noblest part of man.

If the hearts disease comes of colerik blood / which is hot and dry / then
must he be let blood in the lever: or else (without the season do hinder it)
give him a drink made of Cassia fistula / tempered with Borage water /
Buglosse water / and Medewort water / called in Latin Melissa.

But if the disease come of Melancolick blood / make him a siege with Diacartami
three quarters of an uncle in the morning / let him walk well upon it. The third
day give him pills de iera picra seven in nombre to bedward: the same cleanse
the hart from filth and noiaunce. It were good also to bath and sweat / yet
not to whote / lest he wax to feeble.

Sometime comes it of evil heat and moisture / and corrupt blood / then doth
he sweat sore. The same shall be let blood upon the left hand in ye vein of
the lights / and anoynte him with Paulinum / and oil of Violettes / and give
him sugar of Roses light meates. Or else take a good tatt hen / yt hath ben
killed ij. days before / yt she be tender: of the same seth a quarter very well
with water / in a pot well closed and stopped / yt no breath can come out of it.
Then take it out / hold the quarter before the patients mouth nose / the
savour thereof shall comfort and strengthen him very well / let him drink a
little of the broth. But if the patient hath taken cold / then put a little
Cinnamon in ye water to seth with ye hen / for yt gives good warmth. This pot
oft time ought to be putt in a stillitory / called Balneum Marie / mixed with
ashes / and well closed / and ought to seth three hours / or more / until every
water be consumed: and mark well when it is enough.

If a man hath a stiche about the hart / if it comes of blood / or a hot
humour / or a fall or bruising / than give him to drink Endiue water / Pimpenell
water / Moulbery water / or else Borage water. Stiche about the heart.
If ye have not the waters / then seth ye herbs with water / drink it. Or else
take Borage ye herb / chap it small / dight it like a thycke potage / put
butter therein eat yt in the morning / yt is very good. Bugiosse is yet a more
sovereign herb to comfort the heart / dighted of this foresaid wise: but ye
Borage potage is good for ye stiche about the hart / specially if one makes a
potage thereof with the herb of Dasye / ye helps well / if a man were fall or
wounded: for it drives away the euell blood / yt it avoid from him with a
siege. Also if a man have any grefe or heuines about the heart: the let him use
ye herb / flowers or root of Borage / or else the water distilled thereof or
sodden: for it comfort the heart very well / and makes a man merry.

Of hearts feblenesse or faintness.
THat comes thereby / when the filth is so increased about it / that it can
not expel and cast it from it. Faintness of heart.
This filth is engendered by great surfeting and excess / specially in such /
as surfeit labour not / whereby their stomach waxes so full / yt it can not
digest it. Or else if a man had eat meat euel to digest / whereby the body is
filled with overmuch wind / the hart febeled / whereof man gets many
diseases and inconveniences / as are scabs / yushes or wheales / mattering
sores / karnels and the canker.

But if this filling or repletion is in the stomach / yt mark thereby: he
belketh or breketh much wind upward / or perbreaketh / hath pain in ye head.
Help the same of this wise: Purge him with a drink of powder of Scene / give
him in the evening a quarter of an uncle of powder of Scene / and in the
morning as much / with a peas broth blood warm / and that shall cause him to
have a siege. The next day after / cause him to sweat in a bath / (if his
strength can suffer it) with these herbs: Take Valerian / Popular / Heysede and
Ootestraw of each a like / and give him to eat broth and potages with a little
saffron / that comfort the heart. If ye have no saffron / then take powder
of Buglosse / or else give him potage thereof to eat / or cause him to
perbreake / and tie his legs with little cords / thrust a squill dipped in
oil into his throat / to cause him perbreake. Or else cause him to perbreake with
Oken leaves / as I have taught you before. Or else give him ten penny weight of
whyt nising powder / if he can suffer it: Howbeit I wold not gladly cosel it /
therefore beware always of nising powder / if you can forbear it.

The manners of voiding the body
It is to be noted / marked know / ye great voiding emptening of the body is by
sieges / by perbreaking / blething at the nose / sweat / flowers of women /
running sores / by letting of blood / which is an abundant emptyninge / and
weakens the body / chaungyng a man his color / quenchyng his natural heate /
whereof then must the heart needs wax faint / as well as of excess of
fyllinge or surffetty.

Soudain alteration
A rash or soudayne alteration from heate into cold / stops ye sweat / and
encloses the filth within the body / whereby a man waxes faint and feeble. It
fortunes also yt a mas heart waxes faint of soudayn joy / yt happens most
to aged folk / whose nature cosumeth. The heart also shrink together by reason
of excessive fear / heuinesse mischange / or else by astonishment. For great
joy doth the heart so open it self / that the natural heat faydeth even away
/ then waxes it cold and feeble / that men do sometime dye for overmuch joy and
gladness. Sometime waxes the heart faint / by reason of the payne that other
members have / for the payne strikes to ye heart / and troubles the natural
course the body and entrails.

If now ye heart is faint by reason of great emptiness / then let his face be
cooled with water / pull him by the nose / scratch him about ye hollow or pit of ye
stomach. But if the emptiness be in the upper members / then bind the
nethermost members.

Nota for vvarmig and confortynge the hart.
It is to be noted / yt nothing is better for faintness of heart / the yt a ma
put hole saffro in his drink / put always a little in his broth or potage: yt
comfort the heart very well / warms a man: likewise also doth Aqua vite /
wherein is put hole saffro then drunk. Or else take every day about one or two
of ye clock at after none an egg / roast it / yt the white there of wax a little
hard: then take the yolke out of it / put it into a dish alone / and pour a
good ladel full of flesh broth / and put beaten saffron therein / as much as
though thou would salt an egg / put thereto also a little salt / and drink
it then out: that same is a great comfortinge of the heart / and not only the
heart / but also the whole body.

Voidnes in the nethermost mebres.
But if the voydnesse or emptiness is in the nethermost members / then tie his
upper members.

And if his head do ache so sore thereof / that he thinks to be raging thereby /
then help him of this wise: Bath him softly / and he shall lyghtely sweat.
And if he hath heate in the head / then make him this: Take an uncle of oil of
Roses / vineagre half an uncle / beat the well together / struck this oft
about his head / this alayeth the heate and ragynge of ye head. Give him
pills de iera picra / and set his foot oft in warm water / and rub them
dounward. And when he takes them out / then let him rynsch them in cold water
/ and lay him down and rest: but let him have the soles of his fete vncouerd
/ that the euel humours and heate may draw dounwarde toward the fete. Give him
to eat meates confortatiue: howbeit not to much at once / until he have
recovered strength. If he be a man / he must beware of women: for that shulde
hurt him.

If ye feblenesse is come of heate or of vapor / help the same of this wise:
Faintness of heate.
Keep him from anger or whote meates and from wine / without it be very well
allayed / and give him this following: Take the karnels of the Pomegranate / and
as much Barley meel / mix the same together / and make a potage thereof / let
him eat that. This cools the heart / and conforteth it: it is also good for
the stomach that is ouerchafed. But if ye can not have Pomegranates / than take
in stead thereof Berberis.

If the faynenesse comes by trouble and cold / the give him such things as
warm him / and bath him in warm water / to warm him naturally / and let him
drink good wine. Faintness by trouble and cold.
Take also Saffron / Cinnamon / Clowes / of each a quarter of an uncle / Sugar
two vnces / Aqua vite half an uncle / water of Buglosse an uncle / white wine a
quarter of an uncle / put these together in a glass / and let them stand a day
and a night. After that drink three mornings thereof fastinge / that chafeth
and warms the stomach / and comfort the patient. And in his meat ought he
to put of the foresaid spices / and keep him self warm / and beware of such
things as cool.

Of all accidents and diseases of the stomach / and howe it may be healed.
VVhan the stomach is full / and can not digest / it is to be marcked / whether
the matter indigested comes of superfluous eating and drinking: Of the
accidences and diseases of the stomach. Tokens of the evil digestion in the
stomach.
for that weakens the stomach and his natural operation. And these are the
tokens / whereby it is known / whether the disease comes thereof: the vapors
come out of the stomach / clim up into the head: or else is his mouth bitter /
and he is thyrsty / hath great pain in his even. Sometime comes the disease
by unmeasurable and inordinate eating of cold meets / and thereby is the
natural operation of the stomach altered and weakened: and in the bottom of
the stomach engendre evil humores / causinge that man can not digest. And
these are ye signs whereby this is known: the urine is white / thick and
pale: above in the mid is it clear / and in the bottom is it white as whey of
milcke / synckinge and cleninge to the bottom as it were corrupt matter. The
patient hath great payne in the kidneys and backbone toward the left side.
He hath also great cold in his brains / which comes thereby / that the
stomach and brains be far asunder / and the vapors draw up out of the
stomach into the head / and thereby is the cold of the brains augmented.

If the stomach were full of euell humours / that are hot / and were engedred
of such hot meates / as are Garleke / Ouyons / Mustard / Pepper / and such
like / then are these the tokens of it: The patient hath great payne in the
head / he hath great heate in the lever / which is by reason of the hot
meates that he hath eaten: for they inflamme the lever / and consume her
moisture. And if the patient is of Sanguine or read Colera complexion / and
eat such hot meates / then gets he fervent heate / and burns like
fire: he consumes his natural heate / and gets an unnatural heate in al
his body / and at the last gets he a fervent ague / called stinking febres
/ by reason the natural heate and the natural moystnes which manteyn the body
/ are consumed.

If the patient is sick of the heate / then must he beware of all manner of
hot meates / and that he eat not much at ones / nor surfeit. Hypocrates
says: Like to like / mistempereth the body: and therefore ought cold
meates be given him / that is hot: and contrarywyse hoate meates to him that
is cold / to set the body again in a frame. Therefore also is it
convenient to give the patient lyghte meates of digestion / and cold / to
restrain the heate of the blood and the read Colera.

And if the disease were of flegma or black colera / or else of surfeiting / the
must he be helped of this wise: He ought not to eat nor drink much / but his
meates ought to be such / as warm comfort the stomach. He ought also to eat
cofectes of quinches / made with quinches / sugar / or cherries / or with sugar
appels: the same augment and restore again natural moisture.

Item when a man hath his stomach full of superfluous hot moisture / of
sa^guin or read Colera complexion: then must the evil humours be digested and
prepared with any of these drinckes / which ye can best get. Take Barlye
half a pound / three quarts of water / and seth them to the fourth part /
then strain it / and put therein the roots of Succorye two vnces / Fenel
roots an uncle / Maiden heir / Endyue of each an uncle / the herb Buglosse /
the herb Borage of each half an uncle: pour over this the foresaid Barley
water / and seth the fourth part away / and then strain it again / put an
uncle or an uncle and an half of sugar to it / and give the patient to drink of
it in the morning and evening. And when the matter begins to be ready /
then purge the stomach of this wise: Take electuarium de succo Rosarum three
quarters of an uncle / a quarter of an uncle Diaprunis laxatiui / Cassie fistule
extract half an uncle / Honey of roses half an uncle / water of Buglosse /
Borage and Endiue of each three quarters of an uncle. Mix all this together /
and give ye patient the one half at evening / and the other in the morning in
the dawning / let him walk upon this / and not lye down again until nyne or
ten of the clock: for as soon as the hot moisture is prepared and digested /
then is she easy to be caste out / and wyded. And if the patient sweat much /
then is it to be marked / that the body is full of superfluous humours: and
with digestyng of the humours / according to mans complexion / is he cured and
made whole: and this aforemencioned drink and purgation is the digestion and
auoydinge of such filth. After that ought some conserves and Electuaries be
ministered to him.

The stomach doth sometime wabel is quasy by reason of a heate / that is
engendered by vndigested meates / or vnwholsom meates / and the vapor thereof
beats up into the head. The same disease happens sometime of raw humours in
the stomach / and if ye take the patient by the body / then is it outwardly
weak / and yet feeble. Give to the same in the morning half an uncle of
Diacarthami / or else give him half an uncle of Electuarij de succo rosarum:
the same cleanses the rough moisture out of the stomach.

But if the stomach doth wamble of Melancholy / then is his body hard and dry /
when a man grips thereon. He that hath that disease / ought to anoint the
body with oil of olive / wherein are sodden Fenkel sede or Kumin.

If a man had some euell matter / upon the mouth of the stomach / which he
would gladly vomit out: or else did perceive / he had much slymy filth within
him / wold fain be rid thereof by perbreakinge: or that his stomach did wamble:
let him take grene Oken leaf in his mouth / and chawe it. If ye can have no
grene leaf / then take a dry or seer oken leaf / and lay it in water / and
then put it into thy mouth. Do this twice / thryse or four times / and it
shall draw much slyme and filth. And if he hath any matter within him / then
doth he cast it out by perbreakinge. Or else take a little springing water / and
vinegre of like quantity / and drink thereof as much as an egg conteyneth.

If a man had gotten vnlustynesse / that he had no appetite to meat / and
waxes heavy faint / nether can tell whereby it comes / nor yet hath great
heat: To avoid quasinesse and euell appetite.
then is nothing better for him / then that he take three hens eggs in the
morning / and let them be thorough warmed. After yt let him break them up / and
take away the white thereof / and sup out the yolks / and drink thereupon a
good draught of wine / and fast thereon until the evening / walk sometime:
yt consumes the evil humours / which cause vnlustinesse.

But if he had gotten this vnlustinesse after meat / then let him eat no more
after that until the even / and then let him eat a thynne pap of oetmeel
/ made with wine / and let him drink little / for that is good. And when he
will go to bed / then let his fete be rubbed with vinegre / wherein is sodden
Wormwod: this will happily cast him in a sweat / that were very good.

If the vnlustinesse comes by adversity and heuinesse / then is he holy
dismade and heavy / and all what he doth / that grieves him. The same must be
cured of this wise: Let him resort oft where mirth is used / and eat meates
good of digestion / and in all his meates let a little saffron be put: for
that comfort the heart / but it causes vnluste in the stomach / therefore
ought but a little be put therein / yet causes it good blood / and rejoices
the heart.

He that hath an unmeasurable lust to meat or drink / the same hath also
sometime unmeasurable sieges: Gredynesse to meat and drink.
for the meat goes oft from him not well digested / saying the stomach needs
not overmuch meat / to digest well / that it leave not at the last evil
humours. The same ought to drink good read wine / and eat meates that do not
ouerchafe the stomach.

They that have many cold humours in their stomach / let the same eat fasting
raw onyons with salt and course bread. Cold humours in the stomach.
Garlic doth also consume superfluous humours in the stomach / and helps it
to digest: wherefore it is good for labourers / that drink much water / and
eat cold meates: it drives away also the dropsey.

But if the stomach had overmuch slymy humours in it / then ought it he losed
with D^acartami / or pills of iera picra. But if it hath overmuch heat then
purge it with Electuarium de sucro rosarum / in the morning / with a
peasebreth. And after two or three hours give him yet peasebroth that is not
salted nor savoured / and let him walk / and not lye down if he have so much
strength. Ye may also eat grene ginger against a slymy stomach / the same
warms it / and makes digestion. Or else make a potage of young Nettels /
the same warms the stomach / and consumes evil humours in it / and causes
good digestion. Grene Calmus doth likewise eaten in the morning and evening /
and purges the stomach.

But if it is in winter / then eat in the morning and evening Anis sede upon
bread / dipped in wine / the same cleanses the stomach from slyme / and makes
good digestion. S. Ihons beries called in Latin Berberis / slake thyrste /
specially that comes of Colera or the gal / and stop the flixe / and make
appetite to eat and drink: they be good for the quavering heart / refrain
vomitinge / and are good eaten against blusters or reed pustuls / against the
pestilence / specially when they are ripe / stamped and strained through a
cloth / and sodden to the thycknesse of a pap: keep this through the whole
year / and take thereof a Walnut shell full at ones.

When a man can not sweat / or else sweateth overmuch / howe that may be
caused / or refrained.
Of svveatinge.
SOme men sweat much / and when they sweat not / then are they evil disposed /
and find none other grefe nor disease anoynge the. This sweat must be
wythstande / or else makes it the members feeble / and dries him without his
knowledge. He that doth so sweat / be sure that it is a token that he is full
of evil humours / wherwyth he is chafed and warmed / that he must needs sweat.
Cure.
The same ought to be cured of this wise: he must be purged / after that ye
perceive his complexion: and when he is in purgynge / make him a bath / to
draw furth such humours of th^s wise:

Take a pound of Gentiane roots / slyce them as small as grotes / put them
into a little bag / put thereto two vnces of salt / and eight quarts of water
/ and let the Gentian be well sodden: and if thou need more water / take more
of the first water. In this bathe let him bath six hours in the morning
fresh and fasting / or according as he can suffer it. And if he would gladly
eat or drink / let him boldly eat a sup / and drink ones / to make him
strong. When he hath now bathed enough / then let him lye down to bed / and
rest or sleep well: and if a sweat came upon him / without procuringe / that
were very good for him / and that he might even so rest or sleep a little. Then
let him eat that / where his mind stands best / whether it be Chekens or
Pollets sodden or roasted / Ryss potage and other good potages. He must be sober
in eating and drinking / lest he take a surfeit / and the stomach be stopped
/ whereof is caused a lothsomnesse to his meat / and consequently the yalow
iayndes or other disease / for the which he needs not to bath any more.

Of sweating.
ONe manner of sweat is natural / the other unnatural. Two manner of svveates
natural and unnatural.
The natural sweat comes by it self / so that a man sweateth over all his
body / and se that his nethermost parts are warm / and that his sweat is
warm / and that man waxes not faint of it / ye he rests better after it /
and is lighter than before. This is a token / that that man hath many humours
with in him / and that his nature is so strong / that it can expel and drive
out the same humours / and therefore is sweating for such one. They are also
natural sweates / when a man goes in hot houses that are not over whore /
and that man doth than begin to sweat: or else when one batheth in waters
that are not over hot / and that he begins then to sweat about the head
and even. This ought not to be refrained / for it is wholesome. Or else is it a
natural sweat / when a man labours measurably / and is not so sore chafed
therewyth. All these are good and wholesome / for they drive away from man the
superfluous humours.

The unnatural or euell sweat is it / that comes toward the evening / and
is cold / and waltereth only about the heart. The same though it be not good /
yet is it not so greatly to be wythstande. But when a man hath a great
disease or feblenesse / and a cold sweat breaks out only about the nose
/ that is a very deadly sign / specially when the nostrils open and close
fearcely / and the nose waxes sharpe. Tokens of death.


But when he sweateth only about the heart / that is sometime a token that a
man is very contrary to his nature / and that the heate is inward in his
body / and nature out of frame / and the pories (which are the issues of the
sweat) stopped / whereby nature is not strong enough to drive out the sweat
through the skin. Beside this are those natural sweates / when men sweat
much every day: and that comes thereby / that men have overmuch moystnesse
or humours within the / and that must be abated then and let.

These things cause to sweat without danger: The flowers and herb of
Camomille / or else Malowes / put them into a close tobbe / and make a bath so
/ that the vapor may stryke up into the. Things causing to svveat
And such a bath is good for them / that will not gladly wet their fete. Like
virtue also hath Fenell / Penyreal / the flowers of Hoppes / Branck vrsyne the
toppets of the flower / Saluye or Sage with the flower / Smalage / and wild
Clarye / called otherwise Oculus Christi.

A good bathe for them that have taken cold.
Of this wise ought they be bathed dry / which have taken cold / before
they do bath in water: Take Mugworte / Sauge / Fenel / Penyreal / of each a
hand full / chappe them small / and put them into two bags / seth them well /
also make a sweating therewyth w^en ye will bath. And when ye will bath / then
wet a long cloth in cold lye / wring it well out / and tie it about thy
head. Then put the water that the herbs have ben sodden in / into a to^ / and
set thy fete therein / as hot as ye can suffer it / and lay one of the bags
under you / and sit thereon / and lay the other upon your stomach /
retchynge down till your privy members: but look ye bathe not to hot.

Flowers causing to svveat
These flowers cause sweating also: The flowers of Almondes / Cheris / Violets
/ Langedbeiff / White poppy / White lyllyes / Benes / Cocles / great Malowes /
or Holy hockes / Filbertes / Blewlyllyes / or Appels. Of these flowers may ye
seth some in water / to make a sweating bath / or else seth them in a bag /
and press it well out / and lay it as hot upon your body as ye can suffer
it / and tie an other bag about thy fete / for that shall cause you to
sweat so much the sooner and without hurt.

Svveatig herbs hot of coplexio
These herbs following are of warm complexion / and cause him that is cold of
complexion to sweat lightely: Take Penyreal / Lavender flowers / Mustard
flowers / Cousloppes / Sauge / Mugwort / the flowers of Elecampane / the leaves
of Lorel or Bay / Selandine or the flowers of it / and Fitches: all these / or
part of them may ye seth in half water half wine / and may provoke sweat
therewyth / as is said.

Herbs causinge to svveat lightely.
These herbs cause to sweat lyghtely: Malowes / Holyhockes / Brankvrsine /
Hounds tongue / the rotes of white lillies / Longeworte growing by Okentrees /
Louage / Pelitory of the wall / Millefoyle / the herb of Violettes / Lettis
and the flowers of Hathorne.

To svvet easily.
This following causes to sweat easily / another needs a man to be covered
therefore the more: Take the leaves and flowers of Elder tree / the leaves of
Lilies / of each two handful / put the same under the patients shites / and
let him lye upon his back upon the herbs / if he fall a sleep there on / he
shall sweat.

An ointmente to cause to svveate.
This following causes to sweat also: Seth Nettels in oil of nuts / anoint
him well therewyth at night / that it may strike in through ye skin / and
after his sleep toward the morning shall he fall in a sweat. Also if a ma takes
Rue or herb grace / Salt and vinegre / and rub the patients hands inwardly /
and the soles of his fete / when he will go to bed / in the morning after his
sleep shall he fall to sweating.

This also causes to sweat: Take a white and harde dogs dounge / bray and
syft the same through a cloth / of that take as much as a Filberts shell can
conteyne / put to the same as much Oetmeel as two eggs can hold / and a
dish full of Vinegre / and four times as much water: make of this a thynne
broth / and give it the patient to sup to bedward / and he shall sweat
continently: and that sweating is sovereign good for them that have fervent
heate / as in a pestilence or fervent ague.

A bath to make fruitful.
If ye will make a good natural bath / that chafeth and warms well / and
warms also baren women / that they become fruytefull: Take three quarts of
the roots of Sloes / or six good handfuls / cut them small / and seth them
until the water waxes read: put thereto a pound of Alume / and half a
pound of Brimstone beaten to powder / but let these be put or tied in a
cloth.

Ye must know also / that if a woman were sore cold / then take twyse as
many roots / nether must any other water be put thereto / then the same
that is sodden with the three forsayde things. It is good also to put three
hand full of salt into the kettel where they are boiled. And she must beware
of taking cold / and use meates that warm.

If the man be cold of complexion / then must he bath therein also / for the
woman becomes so much the more fruytefull: for when a man batheth with a
baren woman / they wax so much the more abler / and she the more fruytefull.
It were good to take the foresaid roots of Slo^s / as much grene flax with
the roots chapped small / and bound together in a bag / and than lay that
bag behind upon the womannis back / as warm as she can suffer it: and when
the bag waxes cold / to warm it again in the forsayde water / and lay it
again to her body in the bath. This must be done oft / for there with is
her matrice or mother chafed / and made apt to conceive and be fruytefull.

Howe a man may be restored again that hath lost his strength by sycknesse.
IF a man were become very weak and feeble by reason of a lunge sycknesse /
even that he seems to be consumed / A restoringe of mans natural strength
nether can recover / then take twenty old cocks / dress and dighte them as
though they should be eaten / seth them in the third part of a tonne of
water / stamp them in a mortar / so that the bones be al to bruised and make a
bath therewyth / and let him bathe therein. When he hath bathed enough / lay
him to bed / and rest.

Or else bath him in Fern or brake / for that restores ye senowes to their
former strength / and comfort the patient. The Fern ought to be chapped
small / and put into a bag / and to a mean basket full / must ye take the
third part of a tonne of water.

This bath following is good for them that have ben lunge sick / or whose mary
in the bones is corrupt / or else their blood in the veins is corrupt and
become nought / by reason of cold: Another restorige bath.
for it is a strong bath / and is the bath of Master William of Vallis.

Take Sauge / Rue / Wormwoode / Betonye / Reed mynte / the roots of Nettels /
Wild Mergerum / Mugworte / the herb of Strawberryes / the sede of Nettels /
Louage / Juniper / whereon are many berries or corns / of each a hand full.
Chappe all these small / and put them in two bags / put to them half a pound
of Bayeberyes / and a pound of beaten Brimstone / part them (I say) into two
bags / and seth them well in water / as much as is convenient / and bath
three days therein / nether put any more water thereto / and bath in the
morning fasting / so lunge as ye can endure it. After that sees the other
bag also / and do as before: the same strengtheth the lymmes / and gives them
force.

A good drink that strengtheth the hart and all the members / if a man drink
half an eggs shale full in the morning and evening / with as much good
wine.
A drink to strengthen a man.
TAke the best Aqua vite that ye can get / take also a piece of fine gold /
make it gloynge whote ix. times / and quench it again / the more ye quench
it / the stronger waxes the water and better / put into the same Aqua vite half
a quarter of an uncle of saffro / and a quarter of an uncle of Cinnamon both
beaten / let them stand four days well stopped / and steer it every day ones
/ but when thou wilt take it / then let it stand still vnstered / that it may
be clear. This water warms the cold stomach / gives strength to all the
members / specially to aged folk / that have ben overlong sick / whose
strength is consumed: for it coforteth and strengtheth the hart out of measur.

Another drink comfortinge the body and purging.
A drink cofortig the body
TAke two vnces of Aqua vite / nisynge powder a quarter of an uncle / let them
stand fourten days. After that press it out through a fylte / and take
thereof evermore fastinge a quarter of an uncle with an uncle of wine.

But if ye will refresh the body / then take a quarter of an uncle of iera
picra / and lay it in Aqua vite as before / and drink thereof fasting three
drops / and take a little in your hand / and put and rub it into your nose
/ and draw the sent there of up into your head. The water of Buglosse drunken
/ is good for them that be sick at the heart / or else the water stilled with
an old hen / the same give him to drink that hath lain long sick / and is
feeble: for it gives him good strength / and it must be taken in the morning
and evening.

These meates strengthen well the forsayde diseased / namely / Hearts fete /
Does fete / Bulls fete / or any ruder beasts fete. The elder these beasts be
/ the more do they strengthen / and they must be sodden so long / till the
bones fall from the flesh / and strowe beaten Saffron upon them.

Item a good bath and natural / for it draws furth evil heat / and
strengthens well.
A bath to draw out evil heat and to strengthen.
TAke Heeth or Ling / Penyreal / Wormwood / Sauge / Fenel / of each a handful
/ put it into a bag / and lay it into a kettel that it may be thorough hot.
And when ye bathe / than sit upon the bag: howbeit ye need not to put it
again into the kettel / for the water should wax to strong.

A very wholesome confection to strengthen a diseased of the foresaid sycknesse.
TAke the best Grapes that ye can get / put them into a kettel / stamp them
/ and make wine of them: A confection to stregthe.
seth that well about an hour / steer it / and strain it through a copper
strayner / after that strain it through a fyner strayner / and seth it again
/ that it wax as thycke as a thyck pap / and steer it till it be cold /
cut it than to small pieces / and put it into a pot that is glased / and
then is it made ready. The staler it is / the better is it / and may be eaten
what time a man will.

Kowe mylcke and Rice sodden together / strengthens very well / or else a
thycke potage made of grene Persely and flesh / or else with Perselye and a
good Hens broth: the same strengthen very well: Meates stregtheninge.
Likewise doth the mary of Hertes / Roes or rudder beasts / drawn out of the
bones / sodden and eaten.

If a man were wholly febled and abated / and could take no manner of
sustenance / it were good for him to drink warm woman milk / or else to
suck a woman / specially in the morning: Another to strengthen.
the same doth strengthen and comfort the heart very sore and all the members /
and causes good blood: But if he could eat flesh dighted with the flowers of
Borage / that were a sovereign thing.

Or else take an old Hen / let her be dressed as is convenient / put her
into a pottel pot of tynne well closed or stopped / put a goblet of wine
thereto / and half a quarter of an uncle of beaten Saffron well beaten and
steered with the wine: set the pottel pot in a kettel with water / and lay a
stone or some weight upon the pottel pots lydde / and let it seth two hours
continually. Then look whether the hen be fallen a sunder / for then is it
enough: if not / let it seth better. This savours very well / and gives
great strength. If the hen be little / put so much the less wine and
Saffron to it.

If any man hath lain long sick / whereby he is waxen cold / let him take a
hand full of Buglosse / and seth it well in a quart of wine / strain that
juice through a cloth / and drink thereof in the morning and evening:
the same gives natural warmth / and comfort the heart very well.

He that hath his legs cold by reason of lunge sycknesse or age / let him
take halffe a bushel of Ootes / and sees that well with two quarts of water /
and one quart of wine / till it be halffe consumed / and wax browne in the
kettel / steer it well / lest it burn. A Stouig or bathig of cold legs.
Put this into a soft sack or pilow bier / half an elle lunge and broad /
and wrap his legs and fete therein / as warm as he can suffer it: do this
in the morning and evening and none: of this wise may he be chafed again in
three days / and without danger.

Of all accidents of the Liver.
MAny diseases come from the Liver / as Stopping / Rottinge / Diseases caused
by the liver.
Inflammation / the Yalow iaundis / the Dropsy comes also there by / that the
Liver can not digest / and that blood that she should send into the members /
is turned to water: the members are out of their frame / and have no due
operation / by reason of the Livers disease / that is / that the veins
coming from the liver to the stomach / do give euell heate: The same heate
dries or seereth the stomach / so that he gets lust to drink cold water
/ and that causes the stomach to digest evil / and causes dropsey. For the
lust of cold water / weakens the digestion wholly / and the blood that the
liver should send to the vrines / is mixte with cold water / by reason of the
indigestion / and so is parted through out al the members / and thereof swells
man / and gets the dropsey.

Of the Spleen.
Otherwise comes this disease of the Spleen / that it can not digest the
substance / which the Liver hath ministered and sent to him / and that is
Colera nigra: the same blood doth mix it self farther into the other members
/ and thereof swells a man.

Of the kidneys.
Sometime is it occasyoned of the Kydneys / or that a man bledth to much at the
nose / or sometime that a man is to much bound in his belly / and can have no
sieges.

Sometime of superfluous blood / which lies hardened and vndigested in the
liver / the same doth mix it self into all the members / and causes them to
swell.

Remedy for the liver.
He that is diseased in the Liver / help him of this wise: Let him beware of
all meates chafynge or whote of complexion: for chafynge meates to scaulde the
liver / and bring it out of his complexion. Wherefore it is requisyte to set
the Liver again into his former digestiue power / with medicines competente to
it: that is / that she be purged of Colera / Blood / and black Colera. A
confection to mollifye diseases.
It is reason and requisyte in all diseases / to mollifye the disease / with
this syrop or confection / before a purgation be ministered to him.

Take the roots of Fenel / Percelye / of each a handful: the herb and roots
of Walworte and Valeriane / of each an uncle: the sedes of Fenel and Anis of
each half an uncle: water two or three quarts. Bruise the roots / and let them
all stand stypinge a night / and give the patient to drink there of in the
morning and evening / at every time three vnces / mixte with water of the
flowers of Eldren or Boure tree / and after that purge him with Dia prunis
laxatiuo / an uncle at ones / and that should be ministered to him after his
first sleep / and he may sleep safely there upon.

Item to purge one easily / without danger / that hath a hoate disease / in a
chafed Liver of a whote ague or other disease / give him in the morning half
an uncle of Electuarium de succo rosarum / three quarters of an uncle Cassie
fistule extract / water of Endiue / the water of Colander or Maidens heir /
of each an uncle and an half: mix them together / and give him it in the
morning / but he may not sleep there upon.

Give him for a confortatiue Diarrhodon abbatis.

Walwort drunken refrayneth the waterish moisture in the belly.

Nothing is better in the world for the Dropsye / then to drink the juice
of Blewlillies roots an uncle or an half / with two vnces of why: or else the
root sodden with wine / and droncke in the evening and morning / the same
enlarges the breast / and takes away fetching of the breath with payne /
wherwyth they that have the dropsy / are pained.

Of the yalow iaundis.
ICtericia is the yalow Iaundis / and alteration of ye natural color of the
skin into a yalow colour. Of the yalovve Iaundis and the causes thereof.
The same comes sometime from the Liver / sometime from the Gall / sometime from
the Spleen. The iaundis coming from the Liver / is caused two ways: ether by
mistemperatnesse of heate / or by stoppynge in the liver. The iaundis caused by
mistemperaunce of heate / is of two sorts: sometime with apostemacion / sometime
without apostemacion. But if the iaundis comes by a waysting with
apostemacion / then are the signs in a man strengthynge / trembling and a
payne in the right side / a consumpcion of the whole body / and minishynge of
the strength and the digestion / the water is as read as blood.

The iaundis without apostemacion hath no consumpcion / streyngthynge / nor
trembling / and they have also the commune token of yalownesse in their eyes /
the face yalowe / pale or grene / the water read and bloody.

First ought medicine to be given for the apostemacion / if the iaundis is
with an apostemacion / that it be first taken away / after that shall be taken
away the waystinge coming by the heate.

A true medicine for the Iaundis.
TAke a handful of Cherye leaves / sees them in a pint of milcke / that it
boyle well / strain it / and drink a good draught thereof to beddewarde and
in the morning fasting / and the iaundis shall avoid from you by siege. Or
else drink in the morning and evening this following: Take the wood of Berberis
/ pyll the upper shell with the leaves from it / and take the second shell
that is yelowe: put thereof as much as a walnut in a cloth / and seth it
with a pint of water / that it be well boiled / and let it cool / and then
drink it. This hath ben experimented / put thereof also in thy drink.

Against the desperate iaundis.
TAke two handful of the root of blew Lilies / cut them small / and sees
them in three quarts of water four hours lunge: and when he will go to bed /
wet a fine shete therein / that it be well wet / fold it together / and
wind it all over and over the patients body / even the head also / when he
goes to bed. If he sweat / then draws the iaundis into the shete / and
waxes yalowe.

Him that the yalow iaundis takes / is well perceived by his eyes / hands /
soles of the fete / and the yalow colour of the whole body.

Against the iaundis that is rooted.
TAke Celidony both the herb and root / chappe it small / and when ye have a
pottel thereof / sees it in water / and let it be well covered / that no vapor
may go out / and make therewyth a sweating bath / and if ye sweat well /
the iaundis shall avoid by it.

Another true and hurtless science for the iaundis.
TAke the sede of Ancolie or Accolie beaten to powder / a quarter of an uncle /
put thereto beaten saffron a penny weight / and an uncle of vinegre / and two
vnces of water of Celidony / steer them well together: the same should be
drunken fasting or to bedward / and drink not after it. The same drives out
the iaundis by the urine harmless. In the morning draught put sugar /
that makes it good. It may also be mixte with as much Southisteen water / as
may be droncke at ones: or take the flower of Cichore and roots / and seth
them in half wine / half water / and drink thereof fasting / and at even.

Yet another medicine for the iaundis that is rooted / or else hath infect the
eyes and skin.
TAke the herb of holes / burn it to ashes / and of them make a lye / and
wash thy therewyth: wet also a cloth therein / and wind it warm about thy
head to bedward: do this eight days continually / and the iaundis shall be
drawn into the cloth through the head.

Another true medicine for the iaundis.
BEat the carnels of Peaches small / put vinegre thereto / so much that it
wax a thynne broth / drink that what time ye will / specially fasting / or to
bedward / but ye may not drink after it: that breaks the iaundis /
likewise do the carnels of wild Almondes.

Iaundis with cos^ifnesse.
If one had the iaundis / and were so bound in his belly / that he could have
no sieges / then make him this solutorye. Mark whether he have a heate / then
give him to bedward half an uncle of Viol syrop / with as much cold water /
and give him in the morning half an uncle of Electuarium de succo rosarum /
tempered with a warm Hens broth / or a broth of Calves flesh / or else a
broth of white Peasen / and let him drink a good draught after that.

But if the heate nor bitterness wold go away / then give him fasting a
quarter of an uncle of Rebarbara / with an uncle and an half of water of
Moulberryes / and the next day let him blood in the Liver vein / and let him
beware of all meates that warm. Give him sometime warm water into his mouth /
to wash it there with / and afterward cold water / to rensche it: do this in
the morning / and let him wesh his hands likewise. Or else let him drink
distilled water of Hertes tongue / or the herb sodden in water / the same is
good drunken against the iaundes / for the heat of the liver. Or else take the
powder of Ancolye sede / and beaten saffron / of each a penny weight / and half
an eggs shale full of wine / and as much water / and as much vinegre: mix
these v. together / and drink that to bedward / and in the morning fastinge:
this helps very well / and is experimented.

A good powder for the iaundis.
TAke the skin of a Hens maw / wash it fair with wine / dry it / and
make it to powder. A powder for the iaundis.
And when thou wilt rise from the board or supper / then sup a piece of bread
in wine / and put of that powder thereon / and eat it to bedward / and in the
morning fasting: this is a sovereign thing for the iaundis in the stomach.

Or else take earth worms so much as half a walnutt / cut them small / and
bray them with a little wine or water / so that ye may swalow it: drink the
same fasting / and hold a slyce of bread tosted with salt warm before thy
mouth / and drink Endiue water thereupon: mix wine also and water of Endiue
together / and drink that to bedward.

He that hath the iaundis upon the tongue / or that his tongue were dry or hot
/ let him take Psyllium / that is to say Fleewort / as great as a Filbert /
let him put it in a fine cloth / and lay it in warm water three hours long:
after that let him struck his tongue therwyth otherwhyles / the same draws out
the evil heate / cools the tongue / and takes away the bitterness.
Likewise doth Sauge laid in cold water / and lays always a fresh leaf
thereof on it. A Plantayne leaf laid in cold water / and so laid wet upon
the tongue / do likewise: for it cools the mouth / and takes away the
bitterness. But if it were winter / and ye could not have the herbs: then
take little flynte stones / lay them in water / and do as is said before.

He that hath the iaundis so fervently and sore / that he can nether tayste nor
drink wine or good drink: let the same drink Barley water at all times / for
that alayeth the heate of the iaundis and gall / and nourishes well. And if he
can eat no meat / yet let him eat a pap of Barley sodden with water and
butter / and let him use that / until he can eat other meat: and let him
drink also water of Lillies / or Isop / or Buglosse.

There is an herb called Herb of iaundis / it is so right grene as grass /
and hath a lunge stalk / and lunge leaves / fashioned like Esula / save that
it hath no milcke / as Esula doth. Of this herb take a hand full / and a quart
of water / seth them well: of this water let the patient drink in the morning
and evening / and temper his drink therewyth: the same breaks and drives
away the iaundis sore without grefe / so that it is perceived in the urine. Or
else take the sede of Ancolye or Accolye the weight of twinty wheaten corns /
mixed with two eggs shalesfull wine / drink the same fastinge in the morning /
and as much to bedward: the same drives the iaundis strayghtwaye from you in
the urine.

If the iaundis were rotted in a man / and had therewyth heat / thyrste a
stiche / then take his shyrte or smoke / and wet it in his oune urine or
chamberly / wring it well out / put it on him again / lay him again to
bed / and cover him warm: then draws the iaundis out into his shyrt or
smoke / and his skin and smoke shall be as yelowe as a quench: and this must he
do thryse. This may be done also / if the liver were inflamed.

It is good also for the iaundis / to struck the weast of the hands very well
with warm wine / in the morning / at none / and evening: for it draws the
iaundis from the stomach.

Of the diseases of the Liver. Of inflamacion of the Liver.
Inflamacio of the liver.
Sometime is the Liver diseased of his oune fault or vice: sometime also by other
members. When it is diseased of it self / that is sometime of heat or cold /
sometime of superfluous moisture / or else of dryenesse or drought / where of
the liver and bladder get great hurt. When it is so diseased / then let the
patient at the liver vein in the arm: or else let him blood in the small
toe of the right foot. But if he hath eaten / then let him blood by the
little finger upon the hand / and give him to drink barley water. Let him eat
no flesh / nor chafynge or inflamynge meat / no salt meat / none old baken
bread / no eggs / nor none vndigestible meates.

A good powder for the hot liver / hot stomach and for the hot ague.
A powder for invvarde heate.
TAke five vnces of beaten or ground barlye / mixte with Endiue water / put
thereto an uncle and an half beaten Coriander / stiped before in Vinegre / and
a quarter of an uncle of Anis sede beaten / four vnces of sugar: the same must
be eaten with bread / dipped in wine in the morning fastinge / after meat /
and to bedward: it causes also an appetite.

Ye may give him also ^onfect of Cherries in the morning / and let him fast
thereon six hours. Give him Sorel juice to drink / the same cools / and
alayeth the heat of the liver and thyrste / or else give him water distelled of
Sorrel / the same cools and alayeth the thyrste without danger.

When the Liver is inflamed.
Inflamacio of the liver and the remedy thereof.
When the liver is inflammed / take Oken leaves / make thereof square pyllous /
as great as a head / and lay one to the right side: and when the same waxes
hot / take it away / and lay an other that is fresh thereon. This may ye
do day and night / and that draws the euell heate out / cools the liver
naturally. Or else wet a cannefas in Endiue water / wring it out / and lay it
upon the liver. Eat also the Lyuerworte that grows in moystye marshes or
standing waters / and drink of it. Ye must beware of anger and sorrow / and
when ye will eat or take of refection / then rub your tongue and teeth /
and after that wash them well with cold water. In the morning / none and
evening set your fete in warm water and warm them therein: after that put
them suddenly in cold water / and then lay you down with the soles of your
fete uncovered / for then draws the evil heate after the cold / and
comfort you.

He that hath a diseased liver of a cold complexion can eat much better /
then he that is diseased of a warm complexion / yet can not he digest it. He
hath great stiches in his right side / and his face changes sore: Mark
this.
his lips and tounges wax white / and he waxes pale under his even / his
blood minisheth / his urine is pale / clear or white / and a little scomminge.
It is good to purge the same with Rebarbara / and to anoynte his liver wi^h oil
of Nardus / and oil of Dyll / of like quantity. Or else give him to eat
raysins / and such meates as chafe him: but let him beware of sweet meates /
for they hurt the liver and spleen. Set his fete also in warm water /
wherein Camomille is sodden / let him warm them well therein / and beware for
taking cold: for that doth hurt.

Wormwoode in meat coforteth and warms the stomach and liver / and causes
lust to eat / it heals also the stoppinge of the liver / as in the yalowe
iaundis and dropsye. For this use may ye dry it / make it to powder / and
eat thereof in the morning / at none and at evening / at every time so much
as a chest nutt. Let him eat Rice potage / and Ciche peasen sodden / that
the ^uske be taken away. Let him also eat the broth of a pollet / wherein
white bread is stiped.

Sometime is the liver diseased of overmuch moystnes / the same doth his Spleen
swell / his urine waxes as white and clear as water / he hath also payne in his
loins / and specially in the left side: Liver diseased of overmuch moistness
and the tokes of it.
he is not a thyrst / he is heavy minded / his stomach wambleth by reason of
stopping of his liver.

Sometime is the liver stopped by reason of dry blood / which can not flow
nor have course through the other veins / as it should do: because of his
grosnesse and thycknesse.

It is stopped also by other humore / that are gross and slymye / of the which
it hath gotten their nature and quality.

Sometime is the liver stopped by reason any member hath not his due course /
because it is cut of or mamed / the blood passing through the same from the
liver / is stopped / and so remains it in the liver. Those that be so
diseased / ought ye to purge with pills of Iera pi^ra / and let him blood in
ye liver vein in the arm: and after eight days / upon ye right hand between
the little finger and the next / and give him to eat meates that cool / drink
small drinks. He ought also at the first to be let blood in the Median in the
arm / and give him to eat sugar of Roses.

Sometime is the liver of a woman stopped / when her flowers draw upward /
before it is due season.
SHe that is in such a case / that her liver is stopped / because her flowers
are stayed before time convenient / the same ought to be let blood
continently at both the fete / and to purge her all manner of ways / as it
perteyneth women / whose flowers are stopped / as it is showed hereafter. Give
her pills of iera picra / the first night three / the second night five / the
third night seven: this is the best recept for them / for they purge her well.
And this should be ministered to them furthwyth: for if it be delayed / then is
it grievous to aid them / which nevertheless is easy at the first.

Of Apostemation of the Liver.
Apostematio of the liver
Sometime grows an aposteme in the Liver / by reason a man is fallen / beaten
or stricken upon it: sometime because a moisture is gathered in it: sometime of an
evil heate / that is gathered in the stomach of vndigested meates.

The diseases or apostemes of the liver / are sometime upon it / and then rises
a swelling upon the liver. But when the apostemacion is under the liver / then
gets a man great payne in the right side: and this is fa^the^ known thereby
/ that when he eats / he waxes cold / or else when he ^weth his breath / that
doth grieve him between the shulders and liver.

If the apostemacion comes of heate / then hath the patient a sore ague and
great thyrste / and his tongue is at the first read / and afterward black:
and it that goes from him is first Colera / and becomes grene after that.

A good drink for the Liver / howsoever she is diseased.
Cure of the liver with drikes and othervvyse.
TAke four roots of Cicory / but if they are great / take but twain / wash
them clean / cut of the herb / seth them in a quart of water / until the
third part be sodden in / or a little less. Let the same water cool / and
drink it fastinge / howsoever ye will: yet not to much at ones: the same doth
purge the liver / and heals also.

But if the disease is under the liver / then give him also pills of Iera
picra / and take heed / lest the apostemacion wax harde. If it waxes to hard
/ it can be remedyed with no medicine / for the dropsey follows it. Yet are
some things / where with it may be helped / that are / Liver wort and the
juice of Smalage / sodden in wine or water / if he hath no great heate. If the
apostemacion is comme of heate / then give him to drink the juice of Fenel /
the juice of Smalage / oil of Almondes with Oxizacara. If the apostemacion is
come of a fall or brusynge / then give the patient a quarter of an uncle of
Rebarbara with milk.

He that hath is liver fauty or vnclene / let him take Santali wood / Endiue
water and Cheruel water of each an uncle and an half / mix them together / and
part it in three portions / and drink thereof three mornings fastinge / at each
time one portion / and he shall be whole / and it is experimented and proved.

Of diseases of the Lights or Lunges.
OF evil and corrupt air / that a man hath drawn into him / come diseases
into the Lights / and be so fervent / that a man dies thereof. Diseases of
the lights or lunges.
For the lunge or lights lies upon the heart / and gives air to the heart:
and when the corrupt or venomous air comes to the heart / it infects it /
and causes otherwhyles the death of a man.

Sometimes also fortunes a man to have an aposteme in the lights / whereof is
caused another to disease / called Asthma / when the breath is short / that by
reason the condutes of the lights are stopped. Asthma.
Sometime also gets a man a disease in his lights or poulme / that he is
costumed to eat unnatural and unkind meates / as fruits / sour and salt
meates.

Such diseased must be kept from all meates / that are not good of digestion /
and from sour or salt meates. Also from al manner of fruit / except raysynes
and plummes: for they cool and lose the belly. Let him absteyne from Pigeons
or Doves / and from all manner of foul that dwells in waters: for they are
evil of digestion.

For the disease of the poulmon or lights / make this plaster: A plaster for
diseases of the lights.
Take the croume of white bread three vnces / Terpentine two vnces / Anise two
vnces / Cumine three vnces / Honey four vnces: all these seth in white wine /
let them seth / until the wine is near hand sodden away: make a plaster
hereof / and lay it upon his poulmon / as warm as he can suffer it / and the
payne shall be swagged. The same plaster is good also laid upon other grefes /
and it is good also for the breath.

If the disease of the lights were come upon one of a stinking or venomous
air / then must ye give him within three days a purgation / namelye three
mornings the one after the other a penyweyght of fine Tyriakle in a draught of
warm wine. After yt anoynte him with this salve: Take Terpentine / Aqua vite /
of each an uncle / Dialthea three quarters of an uncle: mix these together / and
struck it upon his breast. He that hath this disease / it is necessary that he
be continently helped / for he might lightely dye of the infection. This drink
following is a special medicine for him every morning and evening taken two
vnces. A drink for the infect poulmon or lights*
Take Licoris an uncle and an half / Brake of the wall an uncle / the midst
pyll or shell of Ground pine called in Latin Chamepitis three quarters of an
uncle / Figs / Raysins / sede of Malowes / of each three quarters of an uncle /
Maiden heir / Isope of each a handful / Barley an uncle / water a pottel: Bray
them that are to be brayed / seth them with the water / that the water be
sodden away two finger breadth / then let it stand so al night / and in the
morning strain it / and then drink thereof as is said before.

Item they yt consume sore / whose eyes wax deep in their heads / they cough
much / and have payne in the left side / and about the breast / them may ye
help of this wise: For a cosumpci^
Give them Diapenidion or Diagragantum / make them this drink: Take three vnces
of Licorise / Anis sede / and Isope / of each a handful / seth these all in a
quart of water / strain it through a cloth / and put thereto at the lest
half an uncle / or three quarters of an uncle of Sugar. Mark also whether they
have any heate / for then give them mylk to drink. Make them also
suppositories of honey and salt. If they cough their blood be evil / then let
them blood upon the hand or in the arm. Their meates may be hogs fete /
chykins / motton / new baken bread / and stale drinks.

Item when a man can not well draw his breath / then help him of this wise:
Take Syropum de Sticados four vnces / Syropum de Calamenta / and Syropum de
Hyssopo / of each two vnces / mix them together and use it.

A good barlye water for all diseases of the Poulmon or Lights.
A special barley water for many diseases.
TAke half a pound of fair Barley / a galon of water / half an uncle of
Licorise / Fenel sede / Violettes / Persely sede / of each a quarter of an uncle
/ Read roses a quarter of an uncle / dry Isop / and Sauge of each a penyweyghte
/ six leaves of Hearts tongue / a quarter of an uncle of Figs or Raysins:
sees all these in a new pot / that the water be sodden away two finger
breadth / and set the pot in cold water / and then strain the clear from
it / and drink it. The same cools the liver and all the members / drives
away all evil heate / slakes thyrste / causes to caste out much / purges
the lights / the spleine and the kidneys / the bladder / and causes to make
well water / is specially good for all agues / that come of heate.

Howe to help a man that hath a disease or a stiche in his side / or an euell
spleen / or an aposteme with in upon his rybbes.
Payne or stiche in the side and the tokens of it.
PAyne in the side comes of evil stinking moystnesse / which causes an
imposteme in the left side upon the ribs. If the aposteme comes upon the
ribs / then dies a man lyghtely within three days of the stench of the
aposteme / strikinge to the heart / without a spedy remedy be sought. First
ought he to be well letten blood in the Median in the right arm: and if the
aposteme is in the right side / the ought he to be letten blood in the left
arm. And before all is it to be known says Galen / whereby the aposteme is
occasioned / before ye ministre ought to him / and also in which side the
disease is. If it is in the right side / then comes it of the liver: If it is
in the left side / then comes it of the spleen: and therefore have Hipocrates
and Auicenna said / that he that hath this disease / should be letten blood in
great quantitye / after that his strength is.

If the disease is in the left side / than doth his heart shake and beat / and
hath great payne in his left side / hands and fete are cold / payne in the
reins / strong and fervent agues / and great stichynge when the ague comes
upon him: the disease is come of Flegma and black Colera.

But if the disease is in the right side / then comes it of the liver and of
superfluous blood / and therefore is it requisite to minishe a great deal of
the patients blood at the beginning / after that he hath strength. And he
that hath this disease / the same hath febres acutas / and great payne in the
forheade / and all his members do ache. He hath also in his sleep many
imaginacions and dreams / and thyrsteth: all sweet meates are contrary to him
/ and lists after sour meates and eager / he hath also great heate in the
liver. His face and eyes also are read / his nose continually sharpe and
seer or dry: the second day after that the disease leaves him / than
changes his face / and the nails of his fingers become white. These
foresaid tokens are not good / for they signify the death of the patient
within three days. If the patient in the beginning of this disease doth list to
drink wine / then ought the Physician to beware how to counsel him.

When a man hath a stich in his side / then give him to drink water of Morsus
diaboli / (that is an herb / whose root is as it were bitten of) ether
distilled or sodden. Likewise also doth Saffron drunk. Or else take honey milk
of a Cow of each half a pint / let the be well warmed together / wet a linen
cloth of half an elle lunge and broad therein / and lay it so warm thereupon
/ and the stiche will straight way be allayed.

Howbeit I have always put thereto wheaten meel three quarters of an uncle / and
two penny weight of beaten saffron / straked upon the cloth / and laid warm
upon it like a plaster. But in summer did I lay the leaves of white Horehunde
/ chapped small / and put in a bag / sodden in milk / pressed out / and
laid warm upon the side / the same swagged it. I have sometime also used it
seer.

Or else take a fine lynnen cloth / and fold it so / that it be a span long /
wet it in the pacients urine / while she is yet warm / press it out a little
for dropping / and lay it where the stiche is. And when it is dry / then
wet it again therein: the same draws the humours out / and alayeth the
stiche furth with. Though this science doth not so wholly aid / yet doth it
not hurt / though it were a woman in chyldes bed. Or else take a cold flint
stone or pauing stone and hold it upon the sore place / and the blood draws
back / and the patient is healed.

The barks of an Ash tree / sodden in wine / and droncken of him that hath a
harde spleen / the same doth weaken it without dout: This may ye prove of this
wise: Give a swyne the same barckes to eat nyne days one after the other / and
when it is slain / loke after the spleen / and ye shall not find it half.

He that hath payne in his side / let him take a kake of beaten Linesede / seth
it in water / and wet a linen cloth therein / and lay it warm upon the side /
and it shall fayde strayghtwaye. When a man hath a payne in his side / and
specially in the left side / then take a quart of white wine / the sixte
part of a quart of honey / a hand full of Percely / or else two vnces of the
sede thereof: sees the same in a new pot / the sixte part away / give him
the same to drink when it waxes cold / both in the morning and evening /
and he shall wax whole doutlesse. Or else if a man hath great stiches and
payne in his side / I toke half a pound of milcke / two vnces of honey / an
uncle of wheaten meel / a pennyworth of Saffron / and laid it warm thereon.

Of all diseases of the belly / and his parts annexed.
ANis sede / howsoever it is used / drives out winds / that be strayenge in
the guts / and combre the stomach / and chafe the liver: it makes also good
digestion / and is good against belkinge or breaking up of sour winds / of a
cold and vndigested stomach.

If any person / ether man or woman had a grepinge in his guts / specially
the fretting in the great guts / and he or she were poor: let him take a
little wax candle / and make thereof a cross upright / upon a piece of papir /
the bigness of a groat / festened or clyued upon the belly / and lightened /
and a little glass set thereon: the same draws the payne to it. Or else take a
bondel of raw hemp thread / and seth it in water where are many ashes / and
lay it so warm upon the belly.

If ye have no hemp thread / then do as I did when I was called by a woman /
that was at the point of trauaylinge / and had so great payne in her belly /
that the child leapt up and down / so that all they that were about her /
were astonnyed / nether durst any man minister ought to her: I band both her
legs above the kne hard and fast with a band / and let it so always an Aue
Maria / and then losed it again a little space / and band it again so oft /
till the payne was holy taken away.

Auicenna saith / that a man may well drink hot water in Colica passide /
that is grepinge in the great guts / and also when the spleen rises and
swells.

If any man were mistempered and hard in his body / another could make water /
then take two hand full of Wormwood / cut it small / and put it in a bag a
quarter of an elle lunge and broad / seth the same in half water / half wine
/ strain it out a little / that it drop not / lay it upon his body as warm
as he can suffer it half an hour lunge / and let him eat twelve carnels of
Peaches. And when the bag waxes cold / then let him warm it again in the
former water and wine / and this shall he do in the morning / at none / and in
the evening: of this wise shall the mistemperaunce of the body and hardness
be allayed / and he shall well make water.

Or else take bran and water Crosses / of each alike / about two quarts /
chappe the water crosses very small / make a bag large a quarter of an elle /
and as lunge / that it may well reche about your loins / then put the water
crosses and bran therein / steer them well / lest they cluster / seth it well
in a kettel with water / anoynte the loins with Meye butter / or other butter
so big as an egg / and it that is left of the butter / lay upon the navel /
and cover it with a little dish: then press the back a little out / lest it
drop / and wind it about the patient as warm as he can suffer it: do this
in the morning / at none / and to bedward / let it lye an hour or more at
every time / after that he is strong and can suffer it. Let him lye upon his
back for the most part / for that mollifies the body well / takes away the
mistempering and the payne / and causes to make well water: but before any
thing loke he have sieges.

Dryenes of the digestion.
Sometime doth it fortune also nature to become so dry and seer / that the
meat can not void for great drought / whereof he hath so great pain / that he
even swells. If the disease is of a swelling / that shall ye know thereby /
that he is swollen and hath payne / so that he can nether night nor day have
any rest / but cries continually. The same may ye help of this wise: Take
Cotton / old or stale butter / vinegre / salt / of each three vnces: put
the same in a pan / stere them together / seth them without burning / until
they wax a little thick: then take a fylt or thyck woollen cloth / upon the
same sow a piece of sustein or other linen cloth / and thereon struck this
foresaid confection. And when the patient doth demand it / or hath need of it /
then warm it by the fire / and anoynte him well with oil of Camomille and
oil of ^ilye well warmed / where he hath the greatest payne / and then lay the
plaster thereon as warm as he can suffer it. This shall ye do in ye morning
/ at none and evening / and it shall ease him both of the swellynge and payne.
Mark also / that if there be to little salve upon the plaster / then struck
more thereon / or else if it fall of with the warmth: for she ought to be a
finger thick at the least. It were good also he did bath in water / wherein a
basket full of Malowes are sodden / as warm as he can suffer it / and ye must
take heed that he have good sieges / and give him to eat meates of light
digestion / as are sheep or calves heads / chekins / and such like. But if he
can have no sieges then give him a quarter of an uncle of Electuariu rosarum /
with the weight of five barley corns of Diagridion: mix the well together with
warm wine / give him it before day / if he will / let him drink again
thereupon: and if he can / let him walk upon his drink / for that is good: if
not / let him beware of sleep. And if he ca have no sieges thereof / then be
sure / that he is bound and swollen within / and therefore must he be helped
strayghtwaye with suppositories of Alume: but if they will not help / then set
him a clister therewith: Take milk and half an uncle of Frakincense / put
the same into a new pot / wherein are put hot koles: put the same under a stole
with a hole / and set the patient thereon / that the vapoure may go up into
him as hot as he can suffer it. But before ye set the pot with the coals
under the stool / lay an hour or twain this plaster upon the patients
body: Take Malowes with the roots / wash them clean / chap them small / seth
them in water until they wax weak: then press the well / and fry them in a
pan / in a pint of butter or fat / till it wax a little dry / and then let it
cool: And when it is so dressed / than put it into a fine linen bag / like
a cussin: And the sack must be a quarter of an elle broad / and sowed together
and laced / like a pillow. And when ye have need of this kussin / then put it
into a kettel with water / and seth it / till it waxes hot: the press it
out that it do not drop / and lay it about the patients body / as warm as
he can suffer it: and set him there with upon a stool / and set the pot
there under / as is said before: this weakens the swelling with in and
without / and causes an easy siege without hurt. This were good for them that
have harde sieges / and have the matter burnt within them / whereby they void
it with payne. To such ought to be ministered in a draught a syrope of
Violettes / and in the morning half an uncle of succus Rosarum: If the same
doth not work within a hour / then lay the foresaid plaster thereon / and
set him upon the stool with the pot under it / as is specifyed before / and
then shall he have sieges without any smart.

To cleanse the guts.
TAke half an uncle of meel of Fenugrecum / seth that with a pint of water /
and pour of the clear / mix to the same an uncle of honey / and drink thereof
in the morning and evening.

For them whose guts are gnawen or wounded.
Fretting of guts
The same shall be marked thereby / in his sieges issues blood also / and that
happens by two causes / the one is outward / the o^her inward. The inward
cause is by reason of an vnclene and pearsynge moystnesse / caused by a salt
Flegma / and the same woudeth or frets the guts. But the outward cause is
/ some great labour / which a man doth / and strayneth him sore / so that the
guts are thereof so fretted / that the blood follows thereafter.

If ye will know whereof it is / then take heed to the matter / that issues
from him with the blood: If it be reed / then is it of Colera: but if it is
as the vnclennesse of the nose / then is it of Flegma. After that must ye take
heed whether the blood comes of the upper guts / or of the nethermost
guts / or else the middelmost guts. If it comes from the uppermost guts
/ then hath he payne above the navel: if it issues from the nethermost guts
/ then hath he payne beneth the navel.

When now the blood comes from the vpyermoste guts / then give the patient
his medicine into his mouth. Is it of the reed Colera / then give him gum
Arabic with the juice of Porcelen / with a syrop of Mirtill / and give him
syrop of Roses / and give him bread styped in Almondes beaten / and give him to
drink water sodden with small rasins.

But when the blood comes from the nethermost or middelmost guts / and that
of the reed Colera / then give him a clister with these things: Take Roses /
yolks of Eggs / Porcelene / and pilled Barley sodden in water / and make a
clister hereof.

Restraite in the small guts, and the signs of it.
Sometime happens a restraint in the small guts / by reason the slimy matter
strayeth / because she can not void beneth / and then rises it up toward the
throat with perbreakinge. This disease happens sometime of an hot aposteme in
the stomach. It comes also of a cold humour / that is gathered in the
stomach. The restraynte caused by an aposteme / is known thereby / that the
belly is swollen / and he draws wind or breath vneasely: he gets also an
ague and great thyrst. But if the restraint were of a cold humour / the same is
not swollen in the belly / and he is without an ague or thyrste: his hands
and fete are cold / he is heavy and wakes much / another can rest in one place
/ sometime will he have this / sometime that. He that is thus diseased / dies
lightely the third day / and he is painful to heal.

If ye will take in hand to heal such a disease / then take heed first / where
of such restraynte is caused. If it is caused by an aposteme / then give him
Cassia fistula with Iera picra / tempered with oil of Violettes. If the sickness
is strong / the let him blood in the liver vein / and make him a clister with
Malowes / Barley / Lentils / and oil of Violettes. But if the restraint is
come by cold humours / the cleanse the patient Benedicta / with Iera picra /
the same do expel / and make him a clister of Dill Fenegreke / Oil of Camomille
/ and oil of Holder. Or else take the flower of Fenegreke half an uncle / and
honey a quarter of an uncle: mix the same together with warm water / so much as
need is / and give him the same to drink fasting to bedward: the same purges
the guts of the superfluous slyme / whereof is caused sometime great payne and
grepinges.

But for the greping as in the great guts / take ye bladder of a Swine / and
put it full of warm wine / lay it upon the navel as hot as ye can suffer it
/ do it oft / and it shall take away the payne / the same hath oft ben
experimented and proved. Or else take a black Hen / and lay her warm upon the
navel / cut it in two pieces or sliced quick. Against any manner of other
grepinge / take the heart of a Wolffe and the guts / dry them / make powder
of them: put the same into a box. In that powder grow little worms / let
the same therein / when ye will use the / take the one after the other / bray or
break the with wine / and give it him to drink.

Or else take half an uncle of oil of Benedicta / oil of Camomil / oil of
Melissa or Baume / of each a quarter of an uncle / mix them together / bid the
patient lye upon his back / and put four or six drops of the oils in to
the patients nose / as warm as he can suffer it with a feather or other
thing: lay a what cloth upon it / and let it lye still. Do this oft / and let
him beware of cold things in his meates or drinks.

Or else take white cattes dounge / brayed and made fine to powder / stere that
with whyt wine / and give it him to drink three times. Or else take reed nettels
that have reed flowers / with the roots a good handful / seth them well with
a pint of good wine / cool it / and give him it to drink.

Howe to drive away the worms in the belly.
THe worms called Lumbriciin Latin / growing in the body / shall ye know of
this wise: Lubrici, that is, vvormes in the belly.
the patient hath payne about the navel ye guts / sometime do they void beneth
or above. When they are found / howsoever they are engendered / ye shall help the
patient of this wise: Take a quarter of an uncle of Herteshorne / as much salt /
seth it with four spounfuls of water / and give him the same to drink: do this
oft / and they shall all dye.

This is also a noble medicine and oft proved: Take yolks of eggs / a little
chalk / four spounfull of strong vinegre: give the same the patient to drink
in the morning fasting / and do this three mornings one after the other / and
they shall dry without dout. After that give him a quarter of an uncle of Esula
/ and the same drives away from him all the worms and fylthynesse.

This is also a sure and proved medicin: He that hath worms in his belly /
the same shall drink water sodden with honey / that shall he do twyse or three
times fastinge / that the worms may be drowned therewyth. After yt shall he
drink the juice of Wormwood / Fumiterre / Peaches / leaves of Beans: hereof
must they all dye: Or else take ij. vnces of the juice of Wormwood / an uncle of
Oxes gall mixte together / straked upon the belly. And if ye put half an uncle
of Aleopaticum Euphorbium / then helps it so much the better: howbeit the
gall of an Hare were better then of an Ox.

Against the worms in the belly take onyons and pyll them / cut or slyse them
small / power springing water over them / let it stand so all night / in the
morning drink that water / and it drives away al worms. Pour the same water
upon the earth where worms are / within half an hour shall they crepe out of
the earth.

Likewise if one eat garlic fastinge / it kills drives out worms out of
the body Or else drink distilled water of knotgrasse or shauegrasse / the same
kills worms also: howbeit it works more in yonge then old folk.

If a man had no sieges and were stopped.
To make sieges.
ARe they of middel age / than give the three quarters of an uncle of Diacarthami.
But if it is a man of a great strong body / then give him half an uncle of it
half an hour before day / and walk well upon it / if he can / another eat
nor drink before he have had sieges.

But if he can not walk for sycknes / then let him be carried / or sit upright
in his bed / and let his back / body and legs be softly rubbed: and if he is
so strong / let him turn him self from the one side to the other. Let him
fast iij. or iiij. hours at the least after that he hath taken it.

But if it were to hard / then let him drink a good draught of warm water /
the night before: that helps very well / that it may work so much the
better in the morning. And if the patient were of a very hot and dry
coplexion / and that his sieges were harde / then give him two nights two
mornings before / every morning a good draught of syrop of Violettes to
drink / specially the night before he will take the comfecte. But if ye have
no syrop of Violettes / then drink a good draught of whaye of milk blood
warm / and anoint the navel with creme / the same soffteneth well. But I have
sometime taken for poor people only the Gall of an ox / and swynes fat or
greece of like quantity / molten together / and straked their navel well
therewyth / and laid thereon of it as big as a walnut / covered a dish upon
it. But if he was cold / then toke I butter in stead of swynes greece / and
did as is specified before / the same mollifyeth very well. Give him also in the
morning half an uncle of Electuarium de succo Rosarum / mixed with a broth of
fresh Byfe / that is not to fat: give him a good draught of ye same to drink
/ as hot as he can brouke it: the same drives ye matter out / and makes her
apt to void. But if he can have no whaye / then give him a good broth of
white vnsalted Peasen in the evening / in stead of the whaye: and in stead of
the flesh broth / take an vnsalted broth of whyt Peasen / without any
fatness. If ye will have it to mollifye yet more / put thereto the third
part so much of roots of Malowes / as is of the Peas broth: this shall ye use
in stead of the syrop of Violettes. When he hath taken the purgation in the
morning / if he is strong / then let him walk well thereupon: Against
perbreakinge of cofections take.
if not / let him sleep thereupon / but it were better not.

Some men there are / which when they take ye Electuaries or cofectios / do
perbreake / by reason of their sweetness: wherefore ye may give them half an
uncle of Diaprunis laxatiui / the same is sour / and hath the same operation /
and drives out very easily.

But if such a siege did tarry until the evening before it did work then seth
him a water with a little Licoris / and a little Honey / and when he goes to
bed / let him drink a good draught of this water / blood warm: the same
mollifyeth very well / that it may void / and he may have a siege without
any harm and uncase / and after that give him nyne Pyllulas communes.

But if it were a fish day when he would take it / then give him a peas broth
in stead of a fleshbroth / as is specified before.

He also that hath a rambling in his stomach / or doth lightely perbreake /
when he hath taken ought: Vvablig of the stomach of purgacions take*
let the same hold a piece of tosted bread before his mouth / as warm as he
can suffer it. For as soon as the stomach perceives the savour of the bread /
then doth the wamblinge alaye.

If a man had taken ought / to cause him to have sieges / and it would not
wide nevertheless / and him thought he should do his easemente / and yet
could not: then take Brenne / Malowes / both the herb and roots of like
quantity / chappe the herbs small / and seth these well in water ^ and set the
patient in that water until the navel / as warm as he can suffer it / and it
shall weaken in a man / that he shall have sieges. But if he will not bath /
then put the Bran and herbs together / and put them in two small bags like
in kussins or pylowbeers / and lay the one of them before upon his belly and
navel / and the other behind upon his loins / as warm as he can suffer them.
The same mollifyeth him well / that he may have sieges without hurt.

If a man had taken a medicine laxative / and it were to strong for him / so
that he must do his easement to often / whereof he might get a grepinge or other
inconvenience: Restraite of overmuch sieges or greping.
then make a little shete warm / and lay it upon his belly and loins / as
warm as he can suffer it: and let him lye upon his back / and cover him warm
/ and lye still a good while / and the grepynge shall go away without hurt.

When the gut (where through the ordure passes) goes out / howe to set it
in again.
When the last or nethermost gut / through the which the ordure voydeth from
man / goes out of the body also / which comes of a siege / and if that
doth hap oft / it must be forsene / or else doth it bring to a man great
inconvenience. Help him of this wise: Of goig out of the gut vvyth sieges.
Take the herb called in Latin Ononis / or Resta bonis / both herb rote /
chappe it small / seth it well in water / till it wax soft / put it into a
little bag / sit upon it while it is warm: do this three times in the day /
and when it waxes cold / warm it again in the former water: of this wise
remains it soft and thynne. Or else bake him a little cake with this foresaid
herb / or with his read flower like to a peas flower: or if ye will / give
him the same with a slyce of bread / and this hath ben experimented and found
true. This must be used eight days lunge. But if ye can not have this herb /
take twelve hand full of meel or powder of Oken barks / put the into a bag /
seth them as before / and sit thereon / and it goes in again.

An other true and proved science / when the basse or last gut issues or is
swollen.
TAke worms / chap them small / and bray them well / and put so much oil of
roses thereto / that it become as a thick broth: stere it well struck it upon a
linen cloth / the thycknesse of a finger / let the cloth be soft / and a
hand broad. Lay this upon the sick place as warm as the patient can
suffer it: and when it is cold / then lay straight way another thereon /
the same helps well and continentlye. It is good also to wet a soft cloth
in milk / and lay it upon the sick place / where the gut is gone out: and
when the same is cold / take it away / and lay another warm in the stead of
it. If the place is swollen or waxed hard / the gut shall return into the
body by little and little without any harm. Yet is it better to seth Malowes
in goats milk till they be weak / and lay them warm upon it: the same
mollifye it without any hurt / that the gut enters again easily*

Tow dypped in the juice of Sloes / is very good for him / whose basse gut is
issued: for laid upon it / drives it in again without any hurt. Or else take
the powder of burnt eggs shales / warm and strew it upon it / and lay a warm
cloth upon it / and that helps.

When a man hath to many sieges / howe that may be let.
SIeges that are overmuch / are diverse. The one is / that the stomach doth
digest the meat and drink of a man the better / because he hath a faut in the
power retentive. An other is by reason of superfluous moisture in ye stomach or
guts: or else the power retentive hath force in the stomach / so in the guts
/ by reason of fylthy moisture / that is hot and pricking.

If the disease is in the power retentive / which should retain the meat in
the stomach / then must it be considered / what moisture or humours be gathered
in ye stomach / whence they come. If the disease comes of evil complexion /
then must the patient be demanded / whether he feleth any heate in his stomach
/ whether he hath great thyrst / whether he have a bulkinge or breaking of
wind: for thereby may it well be guessed / whether the siege be of overmuch
heat or not. If he have no thyrste / and eats well / but digests slenderly:
then is his siege caused of cold / and therefore doth the stomach digest evil.
He that will staye that siege assuredly / must eat and drink little / and use
two or three days nomore but one kind of meat / and be still: by that shall
the stomach be satled / and also the fundamente / and also the running
staunched without hurt or danger.

These meates do bind a man in his belly: hard eggs / and Payst made with
eggs / baken in the herth / roasted Peers / bake meates / Rice made with
almode milk / potages of barley / Barley water / Beans / Peers dried in an
oven / Amilum / Meddlers / Sugar of roses. Or else take the stones or carnels in
the grapes / beat them well / put them in a cloth / lay them in reyne water
or springing water a day and a night / then strain the water well out / and
drink a good draught thereof fasting in the morning and at even to bedward:
the same stops the hot flux very well. Or else eat Sloes / that stops
sieges whether they be of heate or cold. Or else eat Moulberies dried /
the same stop sieges. Likewise also do Bremble beries not fully ripe / and
dried and eaten / stop all manner of sieges / caused of great heat.

A plaster for sieges.
TAke a quart of Akornes dried and made to powder / mixte with the white of an
egg and vinegre in manner of a plaster upon a cloth / and laid about the
loins. But it were better to lace ye plaster upon the belly under the navel /
and so about ye body / as warm as he can suffer it: and when it is dry / then
refresh it again with ye white of an egg and vinegre / as is said before /
and powder it fine again. This may be done three times.

A good science for the bloudye flixe and other sieges or flixes / of what
cause soever they be / and it stops very^ well.
TAke a Turtel / put it in a pot / and cover it / set it in an oven / till it
be burnt all to powder: and if any man hath a flixe / let him take an egg /
warm it well by the fire / open it / and put away the white: then take of the
powder / as much as a chest nut / mix it with the yolke / and eat it
fasting / do this three mornings / and it shall be staunched / and it is
specially good for all manner of bloody flixes. Or else seth the Turtel with
water / salt her not to sore / but let her be well sodden with a broth / and
give it the patient / and it stops him.

Disenteria is a bloody flixe / coming sometime from the guts / sometime from
the liver / sometime from the stomach. If it is from the ^iuer / then hath he
payne in his right side / then can he scarsely be helped. But if it is from the
stomach / then hath he payne in the holowe of the heart / that is deadly: for
the small guts are nearehande rased and gnawen through. But if he hath pain
beneth the navel / then comes it from the great guts / and he may be yet
well helped. Ye must also mark / that the bloudye flixe must not be staunched
so suddenly / till ye evil matter is voided / ye guts be cleansed. After that
help him thus: Give him why of Goats milk and barley water of each like much
/ put a little honey in the barley water / and seth the together / and skomme
them. After that put the whey thereto / and stere them together / and then take
it from the fire / and give the patient always thereof to drink blood warm with
milk / both in ye morning / none and evening* this heals the guts
inwardly. Likewise also doth water of Waybrede drunk in the morning / at none
and evening.

Against the bloody flixe / take a quarter of an uncle of Sanguis draconis /
made to powder / drink it in a potage or broth / or else eat in a weak or
soft egg: the same is experimented that it stops: or else give him Knotgrasse
to eat upon a sop / or in some potage / or else howsoever he can eat it / or
else in an egg as is said before / and that stops the blood / both above
and beneth.

A true medicine for the bloody flixe.
TAke the tappettes or slouringe of Walnuts and Filberts when they flourish /
new gathered after that they be fallen from ye trees / and put them into a
basin / and dry them in the Son or in an oven / that they rot not: beat them
to powder / and he that hath the bloody flixe / give him a quarter of an uncle
thereof in an egg roasted with oil / till it be harde: and eat three mornings
so much thereof at every time / and fastinge. And if it will not be staunched
/ then give him half an uncle of this powder in an egg.

Yet another for the bloudye flixe / which comfort the stomach / and
seasons the mouth if it is unseasoned: for surely it cools him and slakes
thyrste / and drives away the heate of the liver. Take sugar of Roses as
much as a chest nut / and a quarter of an uncle of Sanguis draconis made to
powder / and give him a good draught of reyne water to drink upon it / or else
conduit water / or yet barley water. And if ye can have nether of these / then
seth well crosted brown bread in water: the courser the bread is / ye better
is it: Let the water be a good pint / and the crostes as much as a fist / and
let him eat thereof oft in the day / and specially to bedward / at night /
and in the morning. It were good also that he had sometime pylled Almondes /
that have lain lunge in cold water / or else to give him a slyce of bread
styped in cold water / the same cools and stopped very well. Or else take two
flint stones / and a piece of stile / and make them glowynge whote / and lay
them than in milk of a Cow / and thereof drink fastinge a good draught blood
warm. Do this three mornings / and it shall avoid. Ye may also heate
flyntstones and stile / and lay them in milk / drink thereof in the morning
and at evening. Or else take the rotes of Burs as much as a penny loaffe /
chappe them small / and seth them in a new pot with good wine / let the
patient sit over them / that the vapor may go up into him: do that oft / and
the flixe shall stanch / whereof soever it be. It stops also the flowers
of women / when they have the to sore. Also take Peers dried / and seth them in
water / and drink thereof / and it shall stanch / and after a laxative / doth
it stop the sieges continently.

Binding meates.
These meates ought they to eat / that have sieges: roosted Pygeons / and all
meates that dry / as are Lentilles / Rice / Amilum / pared or shaven
Herteshorne / or else Beenes sodden with vinegre until they pearche / and give
him these to eat three days continually / nether give him any other meat.

How the flixes may be known.
When the bloody flixe comes from the vppormost bowels / the issues from
man pure blood / with digestion of the filth of mans body / and thereof gets
a man great payne in the vpperpart of his body or navel. Him may ye help of
this wise: Flixe of the uppermost bovvels.
Take Hepsede / bray or beat the same well / put a little water upon it /
strain it through a cloth. Then seth two eggs / yt they remain very soft /
put of the Hepsede milk thereto / as much as al the eggs be / beat the well
together / take ye fasting: the same stops the flixe / avoids the pain. Or
else seth ye roots of Burs or the sede in water / or them both / and drink
it fasting: but it were very good to seth the sede in reyne water.

If it comes of the middelmost bowels or guts / than is the siege or flixe
coloured black with blood / or else grene with the same. Flixe fro the middelmost
bovvels.
To cure the same is make a vaporacio beneth with Rames grease or fat / wax /
pitch Cumin each of like quantity / put the in a new pot / cover it close /
set it upon a fire / till it wax thorough hot / and do smoke sore: than set it
under a stole with a hole / and set the patient thereon / as hot as he can
suffer it.

But if the blood comes of the nethermost bowels / then is the siege yt
issues therewyth yalow / black / pale / or else of a grene deadly colour.
Flixe of the nethermost guts or bovvels.
The same may be helped of this wise: Give him roasted Rames flesh to eat / old
hens sodden / and specially the fete / and barley water to drink. Item
Almonde milk with water / the same comfort the heart.

But if the siege be by reason a man hath eaten ought that is vnholsom / then
ought he not be staunched so soon.

There is also a flixe / called the white siege / in Latin Lientery / the same
is / when the meat is voided vndigested. Lientery, and the causes of it.
The same siege comes sometime of slymy matter lyenge in the stomach / and that
is known by the heuinesse of the stomach.

Of payne in the Loins.
The same comes sometime of heate / sometime of cold. When it comes of heate /
then vanishes all te patients moisture / his urine becomes reed / or else
yalow as an Orange appel. Payne in the Loins.
He yt hath that disease / give him the milk of a So with Dragagatum / and
Malowes / make a potage therewith and he must beware of all such things as
chafe or warm him / of salt meates / and give him all cooling meates / or
else give him potages made of barley and Spinach / that cools well / or else
give him a Barley potage with butter / for that cools mollifies him well: If
he hath the power and is able / give him Triasandali.

Payne in the loins and back comes sometime by overmuch companyenge with
women. The same help of this wise: Payne in the back and loins.
Let him beware of women / and if he hath heate or thyrste / then give him
sugar Candye / and let him beware of all hot things. But if he hath no
heate / then give him such things as do warm him moderately / and let him go
to some bath / and eat meates of good digestion.

Item if he have any fault in his liver / let him take heed thereto / for the
must he not bathe / before his heate of the Liver be swagged.

But if the payne in the loins comes of cold / then hath the patient no
lust upon women / and his back doth ache very sore / and also his thyghes: his
urine is whytysh as water. Let him beware of oil / or any fat meates / whether
it be flesh or fish / and of all such things as cool the stomach. Make
also this plaster / and lay it upon his back and loins / as warm as he can
suffer it: Take Fenel and Smalage alike much / chapped small and beaten in a
mortar / take of each as much as mans head / and put thereto Dyll sede / oil
of Mastix / Befe suet / of each two vnces and an half: put these into a pan
/ and when it waxes hot / then cast the herbs in also / fry them well
together / and lay it between two fine clothes / and lay it about his loins
/ as warm as he can suffer it: and when it is cold / warm it again in the
pan / and lay it up again. Let him do this three days / and it shall avoid
without any harm or payne / and doth soon help.

Cure general.
If this disease overtakes young folk / that be between twenty and fyfty years
/ they may well be helped. They must be let blood before all medicines. But if
this disease takes aged folk / that be above three score years / the same can
scarsely be helped / or not: their urine is sometime yalow dim coloured / and
when it hath stand a while / then hath it a cloud as it were a cobbe weble or
white cloud: the same are pale under their syghte and lean.

A true medicine for payne in the loins caused of cold.
TAke a quart of flowers of Camomille / sees them in half wine / half water
/ and pour out the liquor or water / and bray ye flowers in a mortar / till
they be all to bruised. Then put them again into the water / and seth them till
the water be clean sodden away. After that put them into a clean linen cloth /
a quarter of an elle lunge / and half a quarter of an elle broad / and lay it
as warm upon the patients loins / as he can suffer it. And when the loins
be well chafed therewyth / then take it away / and dry them with a cloth /
and anoint them with this ointment: Take a quarter of an uncle of Oleum
benedictum / oil of Camomill / oil of Spicanardi / of each a quarter of an
uncle / oil of Bay half an uncle / Dialthea / Aqua vite / of each a quarter of
an uncle. Put all these into a vessel / and set it by the fire / that it wax
warm: then anoynte the loins therewith: after that lay the flowers thereon
warm as before / when they be warmed again in the foresaid wine and water: Do
this in the morning and evening.

Cure of a vvoma vvyth child.
But if a woman were pained in her loins of a cold / when she is with child /
it were good she were girded in her flanks / that the vapor did not stryke up
into her to the heart / and let her then sit upon the pot / wherein the bath is
/ that the vapour may stick up into her back / as whote as she can suffer it
/ and let her set her fete in the tobbe / where in the same water is / and so
cover her self with a mantel or lunge goune / that were good for her.

Take Garleke / Coriander of each two vnces / seth them with a quart of wine /
till the third part be sodden in: drink that in the morning and evening.

If a man hath payne in his loins of heate / then seth Fenel r^o^e^ with water
/ and drink that in the morning and evening. Or else take Cheruel chapped
small / as much as a gouse egg / seth that in a pound of clarifyed wine:
Drink that to bedward / and eat the herb also fastinge.

Against payne in the loins.
TAke Veruayne / Sauie / Lavender / Wild mint / of each two handful / seth
them well in a great pot / with three quarts of white wine / well covered and
stopped: put that into a tob / and sit upon it / let the vapor go up into thy
back / until ye be well warmed. Then cause the sweat be wyped from your back
/ till ye be dry. After that a joint your back with Befe suet molten / when ye
will go to bed / do this three nights together. This takes away payne in the
loins / and specially caused of cold.

Or else take honey and milk of like quantity / put the same into a new pot /
set it by the fire upon a treuet / seth it well / and lay it as warm upon thy
loins / as ye can suffer it: the same draws out the payne. And when it waxes
cold / then warm it again.

Another science for payne in the loins / that helps very well without
harm.
TAke Mullen / called Tapsus barbatus / distilled / struck the same well in to
his loins by a fire / in the morning / at none and to bedward / and do that
nyne days continually.

Sometime grow apostemes in ye loins of humours that are waltering and strayeng
in the body / wherwyth doth come sometime a sore ague / the patient hath his
members so heavy / that he thinks they do hang: Apostemes i the loins and
the signs thereof.
and the apostem in the loins doth lightely become soft and so ripe / that i^
runs.

If the aposteme is in the right side / then let the patient lye upon ye left
side. But if it is in the left side / then let him lye upon the right side.
After that mark whether it be of a hot humour / for then hath the patient
great thyrste / his urine is reed / and happily a great moisture withal. But
if it is of a cold humour / then is the ague easier / and his urine coloured
like water.

If it is of a hot humour / then is his urine reed / and he hath a duselynge.
Give him this medicine: Take the juice of Nightshade or Morel / the juice of
Fenel seth and strain them / and put under them Cassia fistula and oil of
Almondes / and give him this.

But if he hath a restraint / that he can have no sieges / then make him a
clister / and thereto take oil of Violettes / Barley / Malowes / oil of Roses
/ of each like quatitie / give him meates yt be moist good of digestion /
cooling. A restrait or bindynge vvyth apostemacion.
He must beware of all meates yt warm / of women / be very still and quiet
without mouinge. Take also Coleworts and Fenigreke of each like much / make
the to small powder / mix them together / lay it upon his loins where the
payne is. But if ye aposteme doth break / then bid him drink of an Ass. Take
also Barlye meel three vnces / Figs two vnces / six vnces of Malowes / mix
them well together / and wet a sponge therein / and bind it upon the aposteme
/ and make him this clister: Take half a pound of Kowe milk / four vnces
oil of Roses / beat them well together / and set him a clister with it. The
second day after make him a bath / wherein are sodden a peck of barley brayed
/ three bushels of the leaves of Malowes: let the same be well sodden / and bath
therein / that mollifies the aposteme well / that it may break out and
run. But if the aposteme or matter were to thycke / that it could not well
run out / than take ye juice of Fenel / Smalage and Wormwood / of each like
much: these ought to be sodden strained / and give him half an uncle of them
with an uncle of milk of Asses / beat them well together / and let him drink
it fastinge / the same mollifyeth the aposteme / that it may run and void
well: after that heal him with players and salves / and cleanse him well.

But if his aposteme is come of cold / then give him meat of good digestion /
and warm moderately / bid him rest always / and keep him as is said before.

Howe a man shall be helped that pisseth blood.
Pissinge of blood
Sometime doth pass a hot humour through the loins / and lies there so lunge /
till it waxes slimy / and raseth or scrapeth them / yt the urine becomes
read or bloody. When that happens / the lay this bathing sponge upon the
loins: Take oil of nuts and warm water like much / of each half a pound
/ beat them well together / then wet the sponge well therein / and lay it
upon the place / where the payne is. After that make him a plaster hereof upon
his loins / that be half an elle lunge / and a quarter of an elle broad: Take
the leaves of Roses well brayed / the meel of Lentils / mix them well together
/ that it become like a plaster / lay that upon his loins.

When it is dry / then put more of the foresaid oil thereto / and moyste it
enough therewyth / and lay it up again: the same takes away ye payne well /
and give him this drink fastinge / the weight of a quarter of an uncle: Take
the sedes of a Gored made to powder / Cumin beaten / and the sedes of Malowes
of each like much / so that they be together a quarter of an uncle / seth them
in two vnces of milk of Asses in a new pot. If ye can have no milk of Asses
/ then take in stead thereof milk of a Kowe or Neet / the same is good also.

It is to be known / that milk is wholesome for all them that have this disease
/ drunk in the morning / and eaten in the day. Give him also to eat suppes
of Almonde / and the yolks of soft eggs potched in hot water.

When a man pisseth blood.
Pissinge of blood and his causes and signs.
The same comes sometime from the bladder / sometime of the liver / or else of the
veins that are in the back. If it comes of the bladder / then stinks the
urine / and is troubled / and the blood is coloured like matter / and a man
hath payne about his preuye members. But if it comes from the liver / then
is the blood very thynne / he hath payne in his right side. But if it comes
fro his loins or reins / then hath he payne in the back and reins. And if it
comes of superfluous blood / then are his even great / and then let him
blood in the liver vein in the right arm. But if it comes from the loins
/ then let him blood by the ankle above ye foot / if it is a woman: but if it
is a man / let him blood under the foot.

Sometime fortunes it / that the veins that pass between the flanks bladder
/ do break or remove out of their place / so yt a man pisseth blood thereof /
the same may ye help of this wise: Ye must first let him blood in the liver
vein upon ye right hand / the patient must beware of women: for it is not good
/ might bring him to farther inconvenience: let him beware of all chafing
meates / but eat cooling meates that are good of digestion.

It happens sometime also that a man pisseth blood / when he hath taken
strong medicines for the stone / specially when he hath taken the wings and
head of Cantarides / (which are grene worms / sheninge with a gloss like
gold / and a scale like a bittel.) To the same give fresh Akornes made to
powder to drink with wine.

When a man pisseth matter.
IF ye will know / whether it be of the gravel or stone / then gather a deal
of the urine in a vessel / let it satle six hours. Pissinge of matter and his
cure.
After yt streyne it through a linen cloth / and that remains in the cloth /
take with thy finger / and if ye find ether stone or gravel / then is the
matter also of the gravel or stone. Such a diseased must ye help of this
wise: Take yt less Shaving girss / called also Cattes tail / and Earth yuy /
of each two handful / and two vnces of Akornes beaten to powder / half an
uncle of the husk whereby they hang at the tree / and as much of eggs shales
burnt till they be while: seth these with three pintes of wine / and a pint of
water / till the fourth part is sodden away. Drink thereof in the morning /
after diner / and at night / at each time two eggs shales full / and do it so
lunge till the paciet be whole. And if ye have not enough / then make more. And
if he hath ought / or is diseased with the freting or briseling stone withal /
then give him at every time as much of Ciche peasebroth withal / and let him
drink them together.

When a man can not peace / how the bladder ought be purged of her superfluous
slimishnesse.
When a man is diseased in his bladder / then hath he these signs: Disease of
the bladder and the signs of it.
He thinks he is satisfied of meat or drink / another hath lust to eat / and
the meat bullketh up again / sometime is he over hot / sometime over cold /
nether hath any quiet sleep / the urine strayneth him: in his belly is he also
/ as though he were swollen. Help the same of this wise: Take Fenel sede /
karnels of Persely / Radice / Louage / the roots of Cariottes / seth them
very well in water / strain the through a cloth: then put whyt wine thereto /
seth the same with pepper / put this to the first broth / and seth it again /
and put it into a pot / and drink thereof fastinge seven mornings one after
ye other / and ye shall be whole without hurt.

This following causes to peace easily.
TAke Horse radice as much as two eggs / slice it small / and seth it in a
pint of water very well: To peace easily.
strain it through a cloth into a pot / and put as much honey thereto / as is
the rote: this may he drink when he will. Or else take Horse radice / as much as
two fists / slice it small / stamp it / put thereto three times as much course
bran: then put two quarts of water to it / and seth it till the water be
sodden in. Then lay the patient upon this with his belly dounward / as warm
as he can suffer it: then warm it again with the water / and of this shall he be
caused lightely to make water.

If a child had the gravel or stone / might not therefore make his water /
then take a handful of Akornes / and bray them a little / seth them with a
quart of water till the third part be consumed: The gravel or stone of a
child.
then strain it through a cloth / and when that waxes cold / give it the
child to drink / as much it will / and it shall help him.

This doth also make lightely peace and easily: Take the rotes of Persely the
herb of Dasye / and seth them in water / and give him thereof to drink in the
morning and evening. Or else put thereto distilled water of Radice / that may
he drink when he will. Or else give him the eyes of Crabs made to powder to
drink with wine. And if it is a child / that it can not peace for the stone /
then give him it with milk to drink.

Another to make easily peace: Take Persely / Smalage / Fenel / of like
quantity / chap them / and bray them small / and seth them a little: put butter
thereto / lay it upon his privy membre and loins / as warm as he can suffer
it: of that shall he make his water easily.

Or else take Smalage chapped small / as much as two fists with ones as much
course bran / and seth that with water / till it wax dry: lay the same
upon the bladder. The same is good for him / yt makes his water pain fully /
and thinks that his belly be swollen: and is specially good for them that are
grossly stopped in the bladder / for thereby do they peace.

For to peace easily / and for the stiche and smartynge / and for the Brisynge
stone.
TAke two slices of a Garlyke head / pill them / and bray them well: the take
a good handful of Malowes with the roots / wash them fair / chappe them
small / put them together into a new pot / put a quart of wine thereto / seth
it well half an hour / scomme it well / and beware that it do not run over
/ strain it through a cloth into a pot / and put thereto two vnces of sugar:
and when it is cold / then drink thereof when need requires / specially in ye
morning evening / at each time a good draught / hold a piece of tosted bread
before his mouth / lest he perbreake.

This foresaid drink is specially good for the / whose bladder is unclean or
stopped / ether of the gravel / stone or unclean slimy matter / wherefore he
can not make his water: for this drink mollifies it / opens the condute /
and makes soon to peace.

But if a man were sore vnclene / that he had ben long without making of his
water / thereof had he gotten a greping or sore / or were febled / or else had a
rambling and perbreaking / the same help thus without payne: Make him a bag
of soft linen cloth a quarter of an elle broad / that it may reach about
his body / from the navel till the privy members / and take ij. quarts of
brann / water crosses chapped small as much / put the together in to a bag
lay them in water: but let the back be quilted / lest the bran cluster / and
seth it well. After that take the bag out / and let it drop well / and lay
it as warm upon his loins / as he can suffer it* yt takes away ye griping
and payne anon. If ye can get no water cress / then take the bran alone. Or
else take ij. ryles full of yarme / seth the well with water ashes / lay the
yarme as warm about him as he can suffer it. Or else take a shirt seth it in
ashes / hold it before him / and wind it about his body loins / that is good
and helps him well: yet is the first yt best. After that set him upon a
stole with a hole / and take a pot / and put two stones gloynge hot / as big
as a fist / set the pot under in the stole / sit thereon / so yt the vapour
may go no where out / pour always a dish full of water thereon / let that
vapour stryke up into the / as warm as ye can suffer it. And if the stones be
not hot enough / then take more stones / yt they may cast heate enough / yt
ye may sweat thereof. If it is a man / then may he take yt foresaid drink made
with the garlyke before the bath / and bind the bag about his loins / for
that helps very well. This may also be well used alone / for it doth help
alone also / and lightely to peace without hurt.

But if a man can not make his water / or else pisseth very little / then take a
new brickstone / that never was wet / and make it gloyng hot / and seth
Cumin in good wine / and pour the wine and Cumin upon the hot stone / and set
it under the / and let the vapour stryke up into the / the warmth and pissinge
shall come again to the.

Or else take water Crosses sodden in wine in a new pot / sit upon it as
warm as ye can s^fre it / the same causes to make water well / and is also
experimented.

Or else take a good handful of the roots of the herb called Ononis or Resta
bouis in Latin / and seth them in a good quart of wine / and give him thereof
to drink in the morning / at none / and to bedward. But if it is winter / that
ye can not have the roots / then take the toppet of an onion / and put the same
into the mans yard: or else take the innermoste heads of onyons / and gather
them together / and put him then into the yard. But if ye have not that another
/ then take two or three lice / so great as ye can get / and put them into the
yard / into the innermost hole / that goes into the bo^ye / and put a little
cloth therein / that they may crepe in / and he shall make water very well.

When a man hath the Stranguria / that is difficulty to make water / or when
one pisseth in his bed in the night.
Against the Stranguria take Malowes / Garlyke / of each a handful bruise them /
seth them in a quart of wine / till the third yart be sodden away / drink
thereof three times in a day. Or else eat yt kernels of P^aches and Akornes made
to powder of each a like / mix that with wine / and drink it: if he be not
healed therewyth / then hath he the stone.

When a yonge body doth peace in his bed / ether oft ether seldom / if ye
will help him / take the bladder of a Goat / dry it / that it may be made
to powder / the same powder ought to be give to drink with wine. Or else take ye
beans or hinderfallinges of Goats / bray the to powder / give him of ye
powder in his meat in ye morning evening / a quarter of an uncle at every
time: Or else give him a quarter of an uncle or more of Agrimonye / with a little
wine or broth saith Bartholomeus de Montagnana: Or else give him Hedghogges or
Orchens made to powder at eve to bedward in a draught of wine this flesh is
also wounderfully good eaten against that.

Or else take the powder that Montagnana sets in his Antidotarius / namely:
Take half an uncle of the inner skin of a hens maw / yt ashes of a burnt
Hedghogge three quarters of an uncle / an uncle of Agrimony / steer them together
/ and give the patient thereof a quarter of an uncle with a little wine or broth
when he goes to bed.

When a man gets the Stranguria or difficulty to make water / the anoint
him his navel with suet warmed no more / it avoids very shortly.

Meates coueniet for him that hath the Stranguria.
Such diseased must beware of salt meates smoked / as Hearing / Ling / Coddes /
grene Places / smouth fishes / as Isles / Lapriles / Barbels / Teches: also must
he beware of fat meates as baco / pasteys or pies / fat chese / raw milk: But
they may well eat Pykes / Perches / Troutes such like fishes / breding in
running waters. Let him also eschew all water foals / both wild and tame. Let
him eat the flesh of kids / potage of great Peasen / the roots of Persely /
Fenel / the herb or sede of Smalage / beaten barley. He must also not eat his
fill / and beware of fruits. He may also make a bath of the flowers of
Camomille / Water crosses / Malowes / Betony / Cinckfoly / of each a handful:
seth these well close / bath therein until above the navel.

If ye will make it yet better / the put thereto the herb of marrish Malow or
Holyhoke / Cinckfoly / Fern / seth of each a handful / and boyle it with ye
first bath. This bath is very good for the Straguria / causes to peace well.
Let him beware of overmuch heat / let him drink good white wine / sodden sweet
wine to bedward / in the morning an hour before breakfast / temper it a little
with water / wherein is sodden a quarter of an uncle of Lettuse sede / beaten
Licoris half an uncle / a handful of ye leaves of Hertes tongue: seth these in
three pintes of water / until the third part be sodden away.

Of the stone / howe he that hath it / may be healed with convenient
medicines.
Sometime doth the stone engendre in the bladder / sometime in the loins.
Sometime doth it engendre of vnclene slymy matter / that is gathered in the
stomach / and is congeled together with an vnclene slymy heate / and so waxes
a stone or gravel / which causes great payne and grefe.

When the stone grows in the loins / then aketh his back and loins / and be
sometimes as dead. But if the stone is engendered in the bladder / the hath he
pain in ye forpart of his body / he can not well make his water.

Sometime comes the stone of heat / then is his urine read / in the bottom
of the chambre pot or vrinal lies much gravel or sand / if it stand an hour
still: and that gravel or sand is read and hard when it is touched. Such a
patient must beware of all hot medicines.

But if the stone is engendered of cold / then doth the patient perbreake oft
/ and the sand synkinge in the bottom / is white. His urine is sometime clear /
and somewhat yelowe / as the whey of chese: and to such one are hot medicines
good.

This disease is cured sometime by cuttinge Surgeons expert in that thing.
But that the gravel or sandy stone may be voided fro a man / that he may be
rid of the payne or smart / or yet the perbreakinge: ye must first se that
the patient be purged of the vnclene slymy filth / and yt he have good sieges /
give him this syrop to drink: Take the roots of Smalage / Fenel Persely / of
each four in nombre / of their sedes an uncle / Grummel two vnces / small Trifle
an uncle a quarter / yt sedes of Chiches Popones of each an uncle / an uncle of ye
sede of ye sharp Burs or Clotes / the herb of Pink nedle or Cranes bill /
Colonder or Maidens heir / of each a handful / six vnces of ye rotes of Brak
of yt wall or Polipody: chap al ye rotes herbs small / seth the in a quart of
wine / a quart of water to the half: after that streyne it through a cloth /
and deal it in two parts / to the one part put a pound of honey / and seth it
always to the half / and to the other part put a pound of sugar / a quarter
and a half of an uncle of Cantarides without heads and wings / made to
powder / and seth this the third part away. Of this give to the patient at
every fourth day an uncle and an half / with three vnces of water / wherein are
sodden ye roots of Smalage Persely / of the first syrop made with honey / give
him every morning an uncle and an half / mixed with four vnces of water made of
the rotes before specified: and of the other syrop / at every fourth day an
uncle and an half / mixed with iiij. vnces of the foresaid water / then
recovers he. And if he can not be healed there with / and that the stone were
great and hard: then were nothing better / then to cut it / if weakness did
not hinder it.

He that hath had payne of the stone a great season / or else an vnclene bladder
/ whereof he hath had a payne or shutting in his coddes: or else hath a swelling
above his preuye members: if ye will help the same / then bath him as hot / as
they be costumed to be bathed / which are grieved of the stone. After that take
milk / and sees the same with eggs / and drink the same blood warm in the
morning and evening / ye shall perceive very vnclene filth to avoid from you /
both in the sieges / and urine: Do this a fourten night / and it shall avoid.

If ye will break spedelye the stone / that he do bruise / take the Goats
blood / put it into a glass / and set it in the son to dry: after that
bray it small to powder. Take every evening to beddeward of the same powder
a quarter of an uncle with wine: and of this shall the stone be bruised / that it
may avoid without hurt. And when it avoids now from him / then let him eat
both in the morning and evening upon a slyce of bread the sede of Persely / and
Grummel or Gray mill made to fine powder: but the bread must be dipped or wet
before in wine. Herewyth is the stone hindered to grow any more / for it
drives it out and bruises it. Like operation hath also the blood of an Hare /
and specially when he is drowned in vinegre.

A confection for the Stone.
TAke the powder of an Hare / burnt in a pot with skin and here / so yt
nothing be taken from it: A confection for the stone
of this powder take an uncle and an hal^e / and vi. vnces of honey / of this
make a confection. Hereof take every morning evening as much as a chest nut /
and ye shall find yt the stone shall break avoid fro you. But if the rubbel
or shards of the stone do put the to pain / then use that bath / whereof I have
spoken before.

Take the rotes of Persely and herb / the herb of Fenel with the rotes / Dyll
with the roots / Smalage with the roots / of each a handful / and of each
sede a handful: chap the rotes and herbs small / and put them altogether
into a small fine linne bag / seth the well in water yt space of an hour /
make a bath thereof / bath therein. Then lay the bag a while upon the back /
as warm as ye can suffer it / after that upon the belly likewyse: after that
sit upon the bag also as warm as ye can suffer it. And of this wise bath in
the morning three hours / at after none two hours / and at night to bedward.
Do this three days / and use to eat the rotes of Persely / and the sede of
Smalage / and the sede of Persely / of each an uncle / make powder of the / put
thereto two vnces of sugar / when thou wilt depart fro the table / then dip a
slice of bread in wine / strowe as much of this powder thereon / as a chest
nut. Eat this also in the morning fasting / to bedward: thus shall the stone
avoid fro thy without any smart or payne / ye shall make water easily. But
beware of all things that engendre the stone.

A good commune bath for the stone.
TAke a bushel of Walwurt chapped small / put it into a bag / and seth it in
water / bath in the same water nyne days / and the stone shall soon break. But
if the stone is in the bladder / then let him lay the bag before him under
his navel: if it is in ye loins / then lay the bag behind at his back / or
else where the stone grieves him: this doth ease without hurt.

A bath to break the stone.
TAke six buckettes of water / put thereto two pound of Wild or Horse radish
rotes sliced small beaten / put the into a bag / seth the well in water in a
kettel or pot / then put altogether to the other water: but ye may not bath to
hot / another let the water pass your hart / or else should ye wax faint. It
were good also he did drink water of Horse radice / when he bateth / and also
before and after the bath: for that also drives out the stone.

This following is also good for the stone.
Take a kidney of an Hare / burn it to powder / bray it small / and drink
thereof in the morning and evening / at each time half a quarter of an uncle
with Persely water / or else water of Horse radice rote. Or else take the rotes
of Horse radice cut checkerwyse / like to dice / the weight of four vnces /
pour over them a good quart of the best wine yt ye can get / and let it
stand a day and a night: after that drink thereof in the morning and
evening / at each time four vnces. The same drives out the stone in the
bladder raynes / preserves a man from payne of the bladder and raynes /
withstands perbreaking. Some do dig a pot in the ground / with the Horse
radice root / the depth of a kne Or else take commun radice rotes / let them
stand in the earth / but pare of the uttermost croune next to the herb / and
make it holowe / then lay the croune again upon the root. If a water be
gathered therein / take and use the same: for it is very good for the Stranguria
/ for them that do make their water with difficulty and dropping / but
specially for the stone in the bladder.

A good true medecin for the stone / which is good and approved for commune
people.
TAke the berries of Ivy / beat them to powder / and drink thereof in the
morning and evening / at each time a quarter of an uncle with an uncle and an
half of wine. This hath driven from women stones as big / some as a dowes
egg / some as Walnuts / some as chastnuttes / some as fylberts or smaler /
and that with pain and trauayl.

Another true science for the gravel / when one drinks thereof in the morning
and evening at each time an uncle / or an uncle and an half.
TAke the husks wherein Beans have grown / and burn them to ashes: of
the same ashes make a lie / and drink it as is said before.

Planteyne sodden in wine / and drunk / draws out the stone / and avoids
the disease of pissinge / called Dysuria / being sod in a little bag / and
laid warm upon the belly.

Of Agues / and first howe he may be cured that is overtaken with Ephemera.
Ephemera is a fever so called / because it is apt to be cured in one day /
but if it is not regarded / turns to sundery kinds of agues or fevers. This
disease happens sometime of the Son heate / whereby the head waxes hoter
then any other members. Sometime comes it of excess of cold / and then
becomes a man redish under his even / his body waxes cold outwardly / the
head heavy. Sometime comes it with surfettinge with meates or drinks that be
hot or cold / and thereof waxes his urine reed. Sometime happens it of
anger / then waxes his face reed / and his even draw forward / and turn
very swyftlye in his head. Also doth it happen by heaviness and great
perplexitye and adversity / and then do his even syncke in his head / and
looks grimly / and his body waxes feeble / and his pulse beats fayntly.

When the ague comes by the Son heate / then set the patient a little in a
blood warm bath the second / or at the last the third day / that he do sweat
therein: After that set him in a cool place / and there strowe leaves
branches of Wylowes / and stype Myrte beries in oil of Violettes / and struck
the same oil into his nose thrilles / and take oil of Roses and vinegre of
like quantity / beat them well together / anoynte his temples for head
therewith / the wrestes of his hands fete. Give him to drink milk of Poppy
sede / made of this wise: Put water to ye sede / then beat it / mix it with
water / yt it become like an almond milk / strayn it through a cloth into a
glass / give him it to drink when he will go to bed / in the morning in the
day time a good draught. Ye must also cool him first: and when he is
otherwhyles thyrsty / give him bread stiped in cold water to eat / and he must
beware of all such things as may chafe him / if he drinks wine / let him
alaye it well / or let it be sour.

If the ague comes or is caused by cold / that the patient begins to
consume / then set him above a tobbe with hot water / wherein are sod
Camomille flowers / Dyll Basil: put also of that water into a pot / let the
patient receive the vapour of it into his body beneth at the mouth. Or else set
him in a tobbe with the foresaid herbs / that were better for him: Or else make
him a bath with the forsaid herbs / and let him warm himself well / after
that anoint him well with oil of Dyll / for the same is good and convenient for
him.

If the ague comes by heuynesse or morning / or a dry occasio / then set
his fete in warm water / until his knees / wherein is sodden Camomill and
Dyll / of each two handful / and cover the tobbe well / that the vapoure may
stryke well into his body / as is said before / and through the mouth. Let his
legs also be rubbed dounwarde / for that doth him much good / after that let
him walk / or use some other convenient exercise: he must also beware for
taking cold / eat meates yt warm him moderately / be good of digestion / he
must also beware of eating and drinking immeasurably.

If the ague is caused of hot meates or drinks / then give him Oxizacra with
milk of Poppysede or Sorrel.

When the ague begins to fail / then give him the second or third day to
drink water distilled out of ye roots of broad Planteyn / three mornings one
after another / at each time an uncle and an half / or two vnces / and make him
an Epithema / that is a medicine upon the liver of this wise: take two vnces of
Endiue water / an uncle of water Cicory / and half an uncle of water of Roses /
mix these together / and dip tow of Hemp therein / and lay it upon the
liver. Let him also eat meates of good digestio as are yonge Mottons / Lambs
/ Chyckens / Hogs fete / and such like. Let him eschew salt meates / and be
sobre in eating and drinking: and after meat let him use moderate walking or
stearing / where good air is / and so shall he recover easily and well.

If the ague is caused of heaviness or great adversity or distress / then
must the grefe be taken away with frendlinesse good conversation with mirth
and such pastimes and recreations / as may rejoice him / and not lunge remain
in one place / but let him abide where good air is / use to bath sometime. After
yt he hath rested / will cloth him / then anointe him with oil of Roses or
oil of Violettes. Let him wash sometime in warm water / when he will cloth him
/ then anoint him as before. Let him also be chaste / his meates drinks of good
digestion / that do also mollify cool him. He may not use strong drinks /
but Barley water to bedward / the same mollifies and cools him: hot meates do
hurt him.

Of the hot and fervent ague / called Causon.
FEbris caustica is / when the Colera perishes in the veins that are near
the heart / and them that are above in the stomach / liver and lights or
poulmon. It is caused of a fervent heate / and the patient hath exceeding heate
and thyrste. This disease is of two sorts: ye one is of a single Colera / the
other overtakes most chefelye ionge folk / when their body is dry. When
their urine is scommy / then be sure / that they are costiffe and bound about
the hart / and get a great disease and payne in the head. The urine of them
both is reed / and they wax feeble. Ye must purge and cleanse them with pills
or laxatine / but they must be mollified before with syrups of Violettes / or
syropus acetosus / and with Electuariu de succo Rosarum / or Diaprunis
laxatinus / so yt they be strong enough / or yt ye age do not hinder the / if
he hath much vnclene matter in him. If he be greatly thyrsty / the give him
otherwhyles Pogranates or sorel to suck / to bedward give him to drink syrups
of Violettes or Roses / with as much cold water: like wise do at none in ye
morning / he must beware of such things as chafe him: he must also be let
blood in ye liver vein. Let him drink wine / alaye it well with water. His
meat must be meates of good digestion and cooling / another eat more then
need requires.

If his belly is bound / then lose it with Cassia fistula / syrups of
Violettes / Endiue water: make him a clister with ye juice of Branke vrsine /
Trifle / herb of Violettes Malowes / without the age / the time / the strength
or the region or country do hinder the.

If he hath pain in ye head / the make him this sointment / anoint his teples
forehead therewith: take oil of roses / the juice of Porcelain / vinegre / of
each an uncle / beat the well together / when ye will use it / beat it again /
and make him a plaster thereof upon the forehead and temples.

Take read Saunders / Roses / Barley meel of like quantity: put thereto as much
Rose water / that ye may mix the other things therewith / make a past thereof
/ put the juice of Gourd thereto if ye can get it: This alayeth the payne soon
and well. Or else take Poppye sede / and beat it very well / temper it with
water / and give him always a little thereof to drink / and specially in the
night: and wet a linen cloth therein / and bind it upon his forheade.

But if he can not sleep / the take Lattice sede beat / Almondes beaten / ye
juice of Lattice / of each an uncle / water of Roses / oil of Roses / of each
half an uncle / mix these very well together like a plaster / bind it about
his head: and when it is dry / then wet it again / and he shall fall to
sleep. And if the payne go away / then give him to eat Gourdes Porceleyne /
when he will go to bed / then let him wash his fete in warm water / and rub
his legs well beneth dounwarde / and afterward renche them in cold water.
After that let him lye down / and leave his fete uncovered / and so draws
the heat out dounwarde: Let him do to his hands likewise.

If he waxes faint in the night for heat / then take water of Roses / and
half so much vinegre / in the same wet two clothes / each so much as a fist /
and give him the in his hand / till they wax hot: the same draws out al the
heate. Rub the soles of his fete therewith also his wrestes / for it gives him
good strength. Give him confecte of sugar in his mouth / or else confecte of
Cheris / or of sour Plummes / the same slake his thyrst.

If a woman were diseased hereof / were big with child / the forsaid medecin
might be given her well enough without danger. But if one were thus diseased /
and a yexing toke him / or a gout / and it lasted four twenty hours or more
/ that is a sure token of death.

Of chylderen diseases.
MOrbilli and Variole is a disease that noyeth children greatly / called Pockes
and Masers. They that have the Pockes / if ye give them water wherein Few or
Herb grace is sodden with Fumitorye to drink / it doth help them without
dout. Great inconvenience get children with these diseases / and specially the
Pockes: for they straye over all the body / and the eyes also / and when their
even do itch / they wax lightely blind thereof. If ye will save them that they
ware not blind / hang the roots of Few and Scabiose at their neck / and
they shall be safe.

Of the daily ague or fever quotidiant.
THe ague or fever that takes a man every day / is caused of Flegma / when
it falls into the blood and veins / the doth the ague shake one / and the
cold is great. But when it is without the veins / then hath the patient cold
every day / and the shaking nor frost is not so great. This ague have most
communly aged folk / and such as are cold or moist of complexion. It takes
them also chefely / that are idle / and use excess / and specially them / that
eat or drink out of season / wherewith engendre within them many cold humours.

When the patient is very thyrsty / and his body is dry / then is his ague
caused of salt flegma / wherefore give him such things / as draw out moystnes
/ and set his fete in warm water / wherein are sodden Dill and Camomille: and
when his fete are dried again by themselves / then take salt and oil of
Violettes / of like quantity / and rub the soles of his fete therewyth. He
must be purged also with such medecines / as purge flegma: for if the paciet is
diseased by the flegma / then is the disease more durable.

He that hath the daily feuor or ague / another can be quit of it / the same is a
token / that he hath corrupt blood in his back. To ease the same / were it
good to set horseleches to his back / his legs arms near to his hades.

A good drink for the daily fever.
TAke the barks of Miscelden growing upon oaks half a quarter of an uncle /
give him yt beaten to powder to drink with a quarter of an uncle of Aqua vite /
while the shaking is upon him: A good drink for the Quotidian or daily fever.
the same drives away ye iaundis fro him / also the whirling in the head.
Wherefore saith Hipocrates: he yt makes Miscelde to powder / takes it with Aqua
vite / the same drives away ye daily fever / or else ye iaundis / ye whirling
in ye head the fever Hectica / that is / asatled fever or ague / wherewith men
do whyrle and be dismade.

The Tertiane or third days fever comes of the heat of the liver / the
Quartain or fourth days fever comes of Melancholy / ye colour of his urine is
like water and clear. But the colour of the Quotidiane or daily fever is most
part reed and clear. The colour of the Tertiane urine is reed thyck.

These vrines have most part a little some in the circle like Percely: But the
some of the Tertiane / yt comes of ye liver / is something yalowe / because it
comes of the heat of the gall. His mouth is bitter / and his face reed
coloured / his urine is thin. Anoynte his head with oil of Roses and vinegre
mixte together.

This following is also very good against ye daily fever: Take Euphorbium made
to powder the sixtenth part of an uncle / tempered with an eggs shell full of
Aqua vite / give the patient this three days together to drink in the morning
fasting: the same purges the slyme / whereby the ague hath his nurture. This
slyme may be voided of this wise also: Take the rote of an Elder tree / wash it
well clean / then pare the upper shell softly from it / after ye shave of yt
other shell until ye wood or hardness / a quarter of an uncle / bray yt small /
beat it with an eggs shell full of Aqua vite / give it ye paciet. Or else seth of
the inner shell or barcke of Elder tree a hand full in a quart of ale or bier /
till the half be sodden away and drink that / this is experimented.

He that hangs the root of Valeriane grene at his neck / if she wax sere /
then goes the ague from him.

He that fears / he shall get the ague / let him swalowe in three corns of
Coriander fastinge / and it shall go away: and let this be done before the
ague fall upon him.

If he shall have cold with it / then is it good also to take three roots of
Veruayne / and three leaves of it / sodden in wine / and drunk before the cold
do overtake him / and he shall be quit of it.

He / whose fever comes of Melacoly / his urine is first whyt / afterward
black / when nature begins to digest. He yt hath this disease / let him eat
fresh meates / and purge him self twyse every weke with leaves of Sena tree
made to powder / and taken in the morning and evening at each time a quarter
of an uncle with a peasebroth. Give him also to drink of this syroppe following
as oft he will: Take a handful of Cicory roots / and a hand full of Cicorye
flowers / and two leaves of Hearts tongue / seth them with a quart of water till
the third part be sodden away: the streyne it through a cloth into a pot / and
put an uncle of sugar thereto. This syrop is very good in summer / for it
cleanses the blood / and slakes thyrste / and cools well / it mollifies
also the harde matter / that is gathered about the hart of congeled blood /
whereof do sometime grow apostemes or consuming coughs: it drives away iaundis
also / and mollifyeth sieges that a man may the easier have the. But if his
head would ache / then give him pills that purge the head / as pillule de
iera picra / or pillule Cochie.

An approved science for the ague / it riddeth a man oft in three days.
An approved science for the ague.
TAke the rotes of Celendine / chappe them small / and bray them while they be
grene. Take as much thereof as a walnut / steer them with a dish full of
warm milk or wine / or with a dish full of warm peas broth: this ought to
be done in the morning fastinge / and refrain from eating and drinking /
four hours after: and if he can go / let him walk upon it. The next day
give him Diacartami / half an uncle or more: but if he hath great heate / then
give him Diaprunis laxatiui half an uncle or more / and if his strength can
bear it / give him half an uncle Electuarij de succo rosarum.

Signs of an ague come of Flegma.
If the fever is come of Flegma / and the patient is aged / and the season dry
/ or yet cold and moist / and his pulse in his arm beats slackly / and his
urine is much and white / he also is greatly thyrstye: these are signs of
the ague that comes of Flegma. Give to that patient the juice of Clarye / the
juice of Smalache / the juice of Fenell made like an Electuary. Let not the
patient eat nor drink / while he hath cold or heate. After that give him a
little meat / that warms measurably: the next day give him some meat good of
digestion / as small birds / and such like / let his drink be clean wine.
Or else give him Diacartami half an uncle or three quarters.

Item suppinges of Amilum made with cow milk / a little saffron comfort nature
/ give a good colour / and strengthen the patient. Likewyse may ye make him
Rice potage. If he is sore cooled and febled / the seth him a dish full of
Cumin / with a yolke of an egg / the same may he drink cold or warm / that
strengthens him very well.

For the Iaundis.
HE that hath the iaundis / must beware of all meates or drinckes that cool
him / for they hurt him. But if the iaundis doth grieve him / then make him
this drink: Take a penny weight of beaten Saffron / and a penny weight of
Ancolye beaten also / put them into a porenger or with vinegre / and steer
them well together / put also a little wine and water to them / that it may be
thynne enough: then let it be drunk fasting / and it breaks the iaundis
without hurt.

But if the disease would differ / and the iaundis would not void / whereby
the paciet could have no stomach: if he be strong enough give him Rebarbara
made to powder / temper it with a fresh Peasebroth / and let him drink it
against the day break. If he hath strength / then let him walk after it /
and hold a tosted piece of bread before his mouth / and fast two hours upon
it. This purges Colera an Flegma / whereof come the ague and the iaundis: or
else wydeth it the stomach above / whereby the stomach is cleansed of slyme and
the iaundis.

But if he could not do it / or that it did yrke him to take the Rebarbara /
then give him half an uncle of Diasene / the one half at night / the other
half in the morning / and let this be beat with a Peasebroth / or else
swalowed in with a roasted apple or sour thing / the same purges also.

But if his head did ache of cold / then anoynte his head / forheade and
tempels with oil of Camomille / and put into his nose oleum benedictum / and a
little into his ears also / and make him a foot bath with flowers of Camomille
/ the same chafeth the blood and head very well.

But if he hath a moist head / then cause him to nise / and let him take the
root of Piretrum / that is Walworte in his mouth / and chawe it: the same
draws out the moystnesse out of the head / and give him Cinamo / Coriander /
Zeduaria or Nutmegs to eat.

It is good also / that he that hath a cold ague / which hath lasted lunge /
wherewith a man is greatly cooled / that he (I say) be well anointed the back
/ the loins / and the belly with oil of Baize / and oil of Juniper of each
like much against a good fire / that it be well rubbed in. Do this in the
morning and evening / for it chafeth the veins and wythstandeth the ague.

Another true science against the ague.
TAke the grene branches of Elder / and pill the upper shell of / and take the
next grene shell / bray it well / put half so much good vinegre thereto /
mix that together / then strain it through a cloth / and drink half an
eggs shell full thereof fastinge three mornings: the same drives away the ague
without hurt.

An other proved science for the ague / that hath lasted lunge / specially
when a man hath gotten it of an euell stomach.
TAke also the branches of Elder / the former part / pyll the uppermost shell
sofftely of / after that shave of the grene / cut that small / and bray it
well in a mortar / put as much vinegre thereto / and bray it there with /
streyne it through a cloth in a glass / and give a patient thereof three
mornings fasting / at every time a spounful to drink / and let him fast
six hours upon it. This voided the stomach well of the agues occasions.

He that hath the disease that comes of hot blood / his head doth ache / he
is hot and heavy / his temples are swollen / and his even stand forward. He
is not thyrstye / and in the night appear before his even read things / his
pulse is swyft / and in his sleep do all his veins beat sore. He that is so
diseased / ought to be let blood in the liver vein in the arm / and the next
in the right hand upon the thombe in the vein of the head / and the sixth day
between the little finger on the right hand in the heart vein / and the nynth
day in both the fete without / above the ankles / another must he let to much
blood in any of the veins. But it must be considered whether he hath strength
enough / whether the age is convenient for it / and whether the season doth agree
to it.

If any thing should hinder the letting of blood / then must his blood be
cooled with these things / namely with water / wherein is sodden Psylium /
that is Flewurt / and with a little milk of Poppy sede / this ought to be
given him to drink. Give him also a syrope of Violettes / and water / where
in are sodden black Cherries.

But if his belly were to harde / then ought it to be mollified herewyth: Take
Barley a good handful brayed / and seth it in a pint of water / put there to a
little butter / and a little salt / and a little Saunder / mixte with a little
sugar / and give him otherwhiles a slyce of bread / that hath ben stiped in
that water: the same mollifyeth his body and blood / another ought he to drink
any other wine / then that be sower / and well mixte with barley water. Lay
otherwhyles upon his navel butter / as big as a bean / and lay a thin
dish upon the same / till the butter be saked in. And if strength can bear it
/ and that it doth not grieve him / then give him a purgation with a confecte de
succo rosarum / and give him the night before syrups of Violettes / that he
may be mollified before / and he shall have easy sieges.

But if he hath head ache / then anoint his head herewyth: Take half an uncle
of oil of roses / a quarter of an uncle of vinegre half a drame of Bolus
armeny made to powder / mix them well together / and anoint his forehead
therewyth / and his temples and throat. Then take a dish full of cold water /
and put therein as much vinegre / and wet a cloth therein / like a band of
three fingers / wring it out / and bind it about his forehead temples. And take
two clothes / each as big as a fit / and wet them therein also / and give
him always one in his hand / till it wax dry. Wet yet two clothes therein
/ and bind them about his fete: and when they are dry / then wet them again.
This cools the blood / draws out the euell heat / whereof comes the
headake. But if the headake will not go away / nor aswage / then mark by his
urine and all his beaucoure / whereof it comes him / and use theselfe toward
him / as is taught severally before of the head ache.

It is to be noted / that if the head ache comes of the stomach / then is he
more disquiet after meat then before: Him may ye help of this wise: Purge
his stomach with a laxative / after yt must he be measurable with eating and
drinking / according to his complexion. But if the headake be because the
patients brains are to moist / then is he more unquiet fasting then after
meat. If the moystnesse of the brains is of cold / then give him somthynge
that warms the stomach measurablye / and the patient must beware of all
things that cool / and must keep his head warm.

An experimented science for the fever quotidiane or daily fever.
TAke the best Aqua vite that ye can get / half a pound / put therein the
whytest ma^y of Walwurt that ye can get two vnces / lest it stepe there in
three days / and give the patient thereof to drink. But mark well / if it
would chafe him to much / then temper him the drink with a little other wine
/ or drink / and give him sometime Manus Christi.

A medecin for many kinds of fevers or agues.
First prepare such a draught: Take cleansed and washen Barlye two vnces /
black Ciche peasen an uncle / Licorice pared small an uncle / grene or seer
Fenell a handful / three or four leaves of Hertes tongue / two or three leaves
of Wormwood / two or three rotes of Pimpernell: let al this be sodden in three
quarts of water / till the barley doth swell / and if the water doth consume in
seething / then pour more water in to it / so that there remain about two
quarts and an half of water. After that streyne the water through a cloth /
and keep it. Of that water must the patient drink both day and night when he
is thyrstye / save only when he looks for the shaking: for then must he
nether eat nor drink / without great necessity constrain him. And when the
water is failed / then make more.

Howe a man shall behave himself that is thus diseased.
OF this wise must he guide himself that is diseased of this sycknesse: Howe
the diseased of a Fever shall behave himself.
he must beware of chese / milk / pork and fresh befe / of all fruyt new or
old. Let him eat potages made with Bethes / Spinach / Oetmeel / Barley / and
always put a few Almondes beaten thereto: on flesh days a quarter of an Hen
/ or Chikens sodden in water / with Percely / and four leaves of Lettis. He
must beware also for moist meates and surffettinge. On fish days let him eat
Crabs or Perches / sometime an egg potched in water. Let him drink no wine /
without it be at meal times / and that soberly / and mixte with ye aforesaid
Barley water / or clean water / if the made water were against his stomach: but
out of meal time let him drink none other water nor wine / then the aforesaid.

When a man knows that he shall have the ague / if it is at after none / then
may he eat somewhat in the morning about six of the clock / and tarry so /
till the heat hath forsaken him. If it shall come before breakfast / then let
him not eat / till the heat be past.

Some agues there be / in the which it were good to let blood after the third
day / according to the patients strength / and the season.

This is now spoke of the commune agues / and of the Tertiane or third days
fever / though there be many kinds of it.

If a man hath used such water / as is spoken of before / then let him beware
of excess of meat / and take fastinge the herb / or the herb made to powder
/ called Centaurea / in English Centory / the bigness of a walnutt or chest
nut / tempered with wine / and he may drink a little wine upon it / to tempere
his mouth of the bitterness. And thus may he remain that day. In the
morning / and the two days following / let him take thereof in the morning the
bicknesse of half a Walnutt / with three leaves of Rue or herb grace / and as
much Triacle / as a peas / and must drink upon it water of Celendine / mixte
with the water of white thistle / called in Latin / Carduus Marie / or else
water of Celendine alone two vnces. After the third day let him take of the
foresaid powder again / whether he be amended or not / and use it four days
continually / and behave him self in dietinge / as is said before: and it is
to be hoped that he shall recover / or else shall the agus turn to another
kind of fever.

Of the Quartain / that is fourth days Fever / which can scarsely be healed.
THe dietinge and ordering in eating and drinking specified before / must be
considered / and then mark what time the cold shall come: for the Quartain
comes not equaly / and vexes a man sometime more / sometime less / and then
doth it rest two days. When ye know the hour of the assaultinge / then take
of this drink following: Take Fenel a handful / three or four leaves of
Wormwod / seth these in half a pint of wine upon a soft fire / till the third
part be sodden away. Then take it from the fire / but let it remain warm.
And when a man perceives the assaultinge of the ague / then let him not rest
/ but ether walk / or cause him be led with the arms. In the foresaid wine
ought to be put half an uncle of honey of Roses / and then drink a little glass
full thereof / walk and steer him self without ceasynge / so long he can /
ye if need is with the staye of other / so long till the cold minisheth. Then
let him lye down / and be well warm covered / that he do even sweat / and
sleep if he can / which he might happily do with werrinesse and faintness.
When ye heate is gone then let him rise / and take meat if he lists: if not
/ and that he thyrsteth / let him drink of the foresaid water in the morning /
and he shall amend / get a stomach.

Communely when men have drunk the foresaid drink / then have they the ague
more fervently then before: but let no man be afraid therefore / nor desist /
before he hath taken it five times. For he falls to an amendment and
lightening / save the first day / without he do misguide himself / as is
said before.

A drink for the Quartain.
Take cleansed Barley half a pound / reed Chick peasen half an uncle / the herb
of Fenel and Maiden heir / of each a dram / ye leaves of Hertes tongue / Rue
and Wormwood of each a dram / Licoris a quarter of an uncle or a drame: seth all
these in a pottel of water / so lunge / till a pint is sod away. Then
strain that water through a cloth / and keep it. Secondely put three pintes of
water to the forsayde things / and seth them till the Barlye wax gross / and
then streyne it again. Thyrdly take again three pintes of water / and seth it
again till the barley do burst / strain it again as before: then put all
the waters together / and give the patient thereof to drink when / or howe
much he will.

Item three days ought he to drink every morning a little glass full of the
foresaid water / and a little Triakle / ether with or without the water / as he
can bes^ ^ake it.

If that will not help the patient / then take this following / and make him a
drink of it: Take the herb of Fenel half a handful / wormwod half so much
/ seth them in strong white wine / till the wine be half sodden away. Then
streyne it through a cloth / and put it into the same so much honey of Roses as
ye will. Of this wine ought the patient drink a little glass full / before the
ague comes upon him / and walk upon it as long he can. After that let him
lye down and cover him warm / that he may sweat. But he must beware that
he eat not four or five hours before the sickness do overtake him.

Auicenna in the fourth book de cura Fabrium / says generally / that him
that hath the ague coming of the gall / may be ministered cold water: A commun
rule for agues coming of the gall.
for it doth help to digest an consume the gall. But such water ought to be
ministered in due season / when he is in good temper / that is / nether to hot
/ nor to cold. Galen saith that a dram of Centory made to powder / and taken
with white wine three mornings fasting / causes good digestion. It is good
also for costyffnesse and old coug^es / as saith Platearius.
