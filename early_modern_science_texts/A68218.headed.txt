Prologus.
IN the name of ower saviour criste Iesu maker redemour of al makynd / I Laures
adrewe of ye town of Calis have translated for Iohnes does by / row book
prenter in the cite of And warp this psent volume divided in three parts
which was never before in no maternal langage prentyd till now / The natural
master Aristotell saith that every body be the course of nature is inclined to
here se all that refreshes quickens the spretys of man / wherefore I have
thus in this book folowige written the nature of many bestys on earth / fowls
in the air fish in the water / which be wonderful and marvelous to be
herd of / and how these forsaid be natured and formed which be figured at
every chapter. And first of all I will speak of man because he is most
worthiest to be spoken of / for he is created made like unto the similitude of
almighty god / and than of all things that is created of almighty god to the
behove of mankynde whereby he should be sustained preserved / of the which he
shall answer for at the dredfull day of iugemet before our redemour the right
wis Jug of all such thiges as he hath mysused that god of his infenyte grace
has made him lord of. c.

Ca. Primo. of the nature of man.
THe creator that has created all thing of nought our saviour master
cryste that is lord almighty has made upon the.vi. day our fore fader Adam
in the field of damasc^ of of red earth / there he gave unto him both life
^owle where thrugh he is become man figured like unto the symylitude of almighty
god / and than made him lord of all erthly things / and gave him grace thrugh
his glorious godhede shaped in him such wit sapience that there was never
erthly man that had the coninge that he had / And than did Adam give unto every
thing that is under heaven his perfyte name. When this was done than did he set
Adam in Paradys terrester there caused him to sleep / out of his side he toke a
rybbe there of he made Eua. Also god hath made ye planetes and sterres of the
fire / the wyndes fowls of ye air / ye fish of the water. and man of earth
/ wherefore when man beholds ye things made of the water than shall he find
himself very simple / but whane he beholds yt that is made of the air tha
shall he find himself much more sympler / yett when he beholdith yt that god
hath made of the fire / tha is the most symplest of al / and man shall not like
himself to heuely things no^ accept himself better tha an erthly thing / for
that he finds and the bestis also / and this is to be understand of ye body of
man / which body was first named Adam / whane that our lord ^ ^ous godhed / he
gave unto him incontinent a couenyent and perfyte rule law which he should
hold keep / and this it was. That he in all thoughts / words / and works /
never should think or wish of any other worse in no manner of wise than he
would that of him should fortune / Than should he keep the way of rightwisnes
and egalite. When he had received this commandment of the heuenly king / he
stood up naked before the hye Lord of might sang thus / O my lord my god
that has with thy heuenly hands made me a natural body of vile earth and
knet in methe humanite of fleshly nature with bones senewes to go on the
grownde wherefore I beseech the lord remember that thou haste made me give me
that life grace that thou hast ordained me to This our fader Adam was ye
comlyest / fairest and best made that ever was on grownde of al the mebres of
his body And our lord hath shed in hy so great abundance of graces / that no
man is to him comparable / fore he was illumyned with all the seven sciences.

He had also knowledge of all manner of erbis / their properties and virtues of
trees / of metalles / of stones / birds / bestys / fish / serpentis / of
all other things on earth / and the fadere of heaven commanded alle these
forna / med to be of the world brought before him to thente that he should
know them and give them their names which they keep ever shall whylest ye
world endures. Clara preteres ^ xpi incarnatione et passione solves ass qui
comeruit. vt in supplemeto supplementi. Herfor was Adam made lord and
governor of the world / and all thingines therein pertaining should to him be
obedient Thus was Adam infenyt / and not of the condition of nature / but of
the benefits of grace. For the infenytnes comes out of the tree of life / and
the body should never have dyed if it had not synned. when man had synned than
was he roved from the tree of life Yet not withstandige the body is made of the
four elemetis as before it is specifyed / in that body be.ij.c.xlij. bones
great and small.

Of the making of manes ^*
THe Man is Lord and ender of all thiges here on earth / and is also the most
perfitest and full made thing of all leuynge creatures that ever god created
as the scripture testefieth criste blew life into him and of a rybbe he made
him an help to the entente when they come roged through full power that he
them gave that they should engender. Exemplu when he said Cresite / wax and
multiply through thencreasinge of ye sede And thus he has created man woman
because they should bring forth of their sede / which sede is named sperma /
and is a profitable part of ye fode coming after the first disiestyon / and
that sperma is appointed to frutefull vessel is to the intent that our humanite
should contynewe the longer and not end / But he that sows tomoche of this
sede / that is to understand they that occupy tomoche with women they wex soon
feeble of lymes / and dye within short space / Wherefore Galienus saith he that
is gelded may live a loge season / and men that have but little conversation
with women may live longer than women / for they be hoter of nature.

Here after follows the. te^ ages of mankynde likened be ye ten divers bestis
as here is expressly showed / and how the n^ture of mankynde doth change from
ten year death come^ time of ^eth hi as a gose yt i^to luck ye friends (...) it
he in earth is ^ Sactus Augustin{us}.
^ upon the same that before is specifyed of the making of man in his mothers
womb.
AVgustinus saith of the making of manes body / when that sper^a is received in
the dew place of ye ^oders body / than is that sede formed ^efome or milk in
ye first.vi. daeys (...) in three days folowige it makes ^reparacyn of the
life in form of ly^pympels or bladders. Six days ^r that it chaugeth holy
into blode ^d.xij. days after that it is turned ^o flesh. Nyne days after
that / ye (...) is divided from the sholders and ^rmoste lymes of the body / as
ye sy^ the belly / till that it has his full ^ely shape of body lymes. withi
^es afte that is scene a full pro^ body / yet the pricypall lymmes be made first
/ as the heart / the liver brains / than the lymes that thereto belogeth / as
the nauyl / ye maw the codes / and after that such as be next / but last of
al be hands and fete made with the other lymes. And the bodij of man is made
of many diverse sorts of lymes / as senewes / veins / fat / flesh skin.
And also of the four moistours / as sanguyne / flematyke / coleryke /
melancholy. But all creatures has a sesonable time of ye year to bring forth
their fruit save only mankynde which is at the lest of body full made in his
mothers wobe the.xxxv. day. enters the mouynges of his body upon the.lxx. day
and that birth is in the seventh month. ^ day than the child geteth ^
the.lxxx. day / that birth is upon the eight month they dye oftentimes. If
the body be full made upon the.xlv day / than receives it life upon the xc.
day and is borne upon the nynth month. But the body of mankynde is commonly
full made upon the.xlv. day as before is specifyed. c. and that is the most
connenyent time. And when mankynde is borne / than he retoureth to the earth
ageyn of the which he was before created made.

Of the digestion of mete whereby the body is sustained.
THe lyf of man is pricypally set in humido radicali / that is in ye radical
moistour for when man lacks yt / than must he dye / and because ye na /
turall here is also in man the which here when it fideth nothige else to be
sustained of / tha it sustayneth him self of radycall moystour / because this
moystour should not be febled but kept in good manner / therefore ye nature ha /
the ordained mete to be eten / and yt to be brought to disiestyon / for when
it is thawed with the te^he ^ than ^ there is ye first disiestion there ye is
ertly divided frome ye clean ye onclene is sent down to ye fundament is
voided through the place of purgation / ye clean humour is sent to ye liver why
/ che is ye second disiestio / there is ye watery onclennes divided from ye
clean sent down to ye bladder tha voided at ye watery place / ye clean is sent
to ye hart yt is the third dysiestyon. and there is again the onclene sent or
divided frome the clean / and of the onclene comes the seed sperma in ye man
and the menstruum in the women / the clean become blod / and that is sent
thorough great waynes to all the places of the body / and that is again
divided the clean from the onclene / an the onclene gothe away through the
sweet and sweet holes / and is chaun / general in to the nails / and such like /
the clean changes himself into the substance of him that eteth the mete And
thus is the natural restored and strengthened if that they waste not ye
radical moystour wherein the life is laid. if the radical moystour be
mynished / than it is again into the other as before is testefyed. c.

Howe that man comes into the hows of death. Coleri^us.

The hows of death.

Flegmaticus

Sanguineus

Melancolicus


HOw that man comes unto the hows of death ye shall understand be three manner
of ways And first be the four elemetis whereof man is made / for the four
elementis fight together / and the one ouercometh the other and than must man
dye. if Adam had not synned the four elementis should never have varied / and
Adam should have had full power to have accorded and rule them. The second /
man dies because that humidum radicale forsakes him / that is the natural
moystour. if Adam had not synned god had set us the ire of life / we should
have ben fre of all sekenesses / moist of nature never dyed / but bidden ever
lusty fresshe as a yonge man. The third man dies of that he hath ben hurt with
wepens within or without or with burdens lifting or bytinges of bestis. c. If Adam
had not sinned all thing should have been to him obediet nothing to him
contrary. these three manners of dethes be cotained in the four coplexcions of man
/ as in the saguyne / colerike / flematike / melacoly The sanguyne waxes
oftetymes so old through god gouernauce / that he must occopy spectacles live
lunge or humidu radicale depart frome him / but than he dies. The colerike
comes oftentimes do death be accidetall manner through his hastines for he is
of nature hot dry. The flematike comes often to death thorough great excess
of mete drink or other great labours doing / for his nature is cold and
moyste can not well disiest. And melacoly is heavy / full of care heuynes /
whereof he engenders much evil blode that causes great sekenes which
brings him unto death. Thus go we al unto the hows of death / the one thrugh
ensuynge of his coplexcion / the other through the ordenances of almighty god.
The third through the planetis signs of the firmamet.



Here after ensues the perfyte knowledge of the x. wits / in what place of
the heed that they lay / that is to vnderstade the v. interyall wits / the
five wits comune as it stadeth in the figure of the heed.
MAnkynde is shapen ordained to enheryt ye celestial kingdom / to be a ruler
of all erthly things / that none ertly thing should rule him as bestis /
serpentis / worms / monsters / or such like / for they bear their head is
down towards the groude / desire nothing but erthly thiges / as mete /
drink and sleep. And mankynde bears his heed upright towards the heuens
kingdom to thetente that he should optayn the riches gifts of grace that God
has ordained in him / which be his natural wits / they be x. in nober and
first there be five intery al wits as these. Fantasy that layth before a hye
in the heed. Imagination laith before a lowe in the heed. Cogitacyon layth
above in the midst of the heed Estimation lays benethe in the midst of ye
heed: Memoria or remebras layth behind in the heed. Euyn before in ye heed is
a little place wherout issues the five wits comune as it is expressly scene i
the figure / and these be they. Saying in the iyen / Smelling in the nose /
Tastinge in the tongue / Heringe in the ears / Felinge over all the body.

Of the dremis of mankind inclined to ye nature of coplexcion.
AS now the common (...) five wits uttermost be stopped through sleep / than
fortunes the sleper often times to dream of such things as he was waking
dilygently occupied^ besy with in his mind / for when the wits doth sleep /
than ouerthynketh he the same again oftetymes / that he desired or longed for
when he wakened he thinks in his sleep yt he sees it or has gotten it. The
melancholy saith that he has scene foul things fer^ forms o^ lykenesses
offends yt fortunes often when the body is troubled or meued with medicynes
or bathes. The choleric dremeth of fire / of water / of manslaghter. c. The
flematike dremeth often that he sits in the water or in the snow / o^ that
he eteth honey / or such other like of moystnes which causes oftentimes
sweet flemis to fall upon their tongues. The sanguyne dremeth often times through
ouermoche influece of blode that he sees spretes as the fairs ^obyn god
fellow or such like. c. And the natural masters say yt it is a warning or
manner of to coming payne or disease named Apopleria. wherefore it is couseyled
to all such that they shall abstain them frome to much etynge or drynkinge /
And specially to abstain them frome such metes and drinks as here be
expressed / That is to understand flesh eggs and wine / and also from all
other metis that cause great influence of blode.

Many one dremeth lainge in his bed that he stands upright and pysseth
against a wall / as the yonge childeren do yt dream of their play done be day
in the street. Sometime nature labours so sore in the sleep for to purifye ye
kydne is that the sleper dremeth of lechery concupiscens of the flesh / as
kyssinge / helsinge / on lawful handelynge / which is very inordinate.

The operation of mankynde.
Auicenna saith that fastinge specyll kills the scorpyon / temper camfer with
spetyll that kills the itch named Impedigo if it rubbed upon it. Spetyll
dropped in the eere where as a worm is in / whether it be dede or quick it
shall bring it out. Eer sweet or eer wax is god to be laid to the heed that
is pained with the migrane It is also god to be striked over clove lyppes for
that heleth them.

The vryne or water of mankynde will heal such itches as breketh out if it be
washed therewith / it preserves from the crepynge itch and also other dry
itches / and from al other to coming sores in the joints. Vryne drunk with
water cicer water honey / is god for the yelowe iawnes. The dregs of the
vryne laid to Colerica apostumacion named Heresipila it heleth it. Diascorides.

The donge of man laid to a would preserves it fro swellynge. the douge
pressed the wet of it laid to a swellynge of the throat or any other
swellynge or impostume or old sore / and it heleth it.

Of the Lame. Cap. {per}mo.
IN the beginynge we have the Lame because he is the most mekest best leuinge
for it offedeth nobody / and all that he has on him is god / ye fles / she
for to eat the skin to make parthemet or ledder the donge for (...) the
field / the claws horns be mede cinable / he dredeth the wolf sore / he
knows his dame best be her bleting though she be among many sheep.

The Operation.
The Lame that soucketh his dame hath his flesh very slymie not lowable / and
it will not be digested principally of them that have cold stomachs lames of a
year old be better lighter to digest / they make god blode / and specyally
they be god for them that be hot dry of complexcyon dwell in a hot and
dry land / lames flesh is very god for one that is hole lusti but for
them yt be seek it is very evil though it lightely digest and descend out
of the maw / yet it is evil for other parts of the body / for it makes slimy
humours. Auicena saith that the blode of a lame mengyd with wine is god for
the falling sekenes. The roncell of the lame heleth the bytynges of venymous
bestis Albertus saith that the mary of a lame melted with nut oil and sugar
mengid together distilled in a stilletory named an El / dren tree / and than
drunken breketh the stone in the bladder / and it is god for them that have
payne in their yard coddes / and kidneys / also for them tha peace blode. Nota
the gall of a lame enoynted upon a cacred sore / helps expressly. Also he that
will help morayn among sheep / take vetremariets / and sethe that with wine
and me^ge it with water and put that in the drink of the sheep / and they
shall therewith soon be helped.

Of the Rame or weddr Ca. iijo.
YSydorus saith that the rame or wedder is the lodysman of other sheep / and he
is the male or man of the oy and is stronger than the other sheep / he is also
called a wedder because of a worm that he hath in his heed / when that
begineth for to stir than will he tucke and feght / and he fereth naturally
the thonder as other sheep doth. For when a sheep is with fruit hearing the
thonder she casts her fruit and brings it dede to the world. and the
wedder in the time that he be spryngeth the oy than is it in the time of love
among the sheep / and the Rame or wedder will feght boldly for their wives one
with another.

ysaac saith that ye weder / ye buck / other such like bestes have each by
theselfe an indifferet found of their voice in calling of their wives in ye tie
/ me of engendrige love / they yt drink than salt water / they be wackened or
styred to engendrynge sooner than other be before their time coming. when ye
old wethers begin to engeder before ye yonge wethers / that the yonge keep
their due time yt is a good sign in that year / but when the yonge begin
before the old that is a toke of tocomyge morayne or death among the sheep

Esculapius saith. When an oliphant sees a ram or whether / he is thereof
afraid and gothe from him

The Operation.
The flesh of a young whether that is gelded is much better than any other
motton / for it is not so moyste as other motton and it is hoter and when it
digests well it makes god blode / but the flessh of an oled rame will not
lightely digest that is very evil.

Auicena saith that rames flessh burned brayed to powder strewed upon the dry
lepory named morpheus is god / for the bytynge of a serpent or scorpion /
mengyd with wine it is god for the bytinge of a mad dog. The lunges of a
whether is god to heal the skyn that is broken on the heal when it is laid
thereto. Escul^pius saith the lunges soden in a pot / when they be enough in
the drawing out of the pot / that yt drops of the longues he^eth the
ter^ian / payne in the kydnees. Haly saith the gall of the whether is god for
the pains in the eres that comes of cold.

Of the bore. ca. iiij.
THe Bore is an angry and an on tame best is very cursed when he companyeth
with the sow / for the wild bores when they accompany the with their females
than be they ever ready for to fight / and they make their skins harde / for
they ron to rub they against the trees and than to lay in foul dirt and
mire the which they late dry on them that makes their skins very harde /
and both the bores be much like of codicions / when they mete commonly they
will feght if they be in copany of their females / so lunge till that the one or
both of them be slain / and the wild bore is comoly blake and he stiketh
with his lunge crooked teeth as harde and sharpe as it were iron. And if the
bore be hu^ted on the morning or he have pissed / tha is he lightely weary /
but if he have pyssed or he be huted or while he is on hutinge / than will he
not lightely be ta / ken. Also though he be weary he will not lightely yield
him but sets hy on his hinder loins to defend him against the huter / but
he shall not come be the hunter to hurt him nor to byte him till he be first
wounded himself of the hunter / and without the hunter give him a dethes
wound / without doubt he will put the hunter in ieo{per}dye of his life except
he be nigh to a tree that he may climb upon for his succour The bore hears
better on the right side than any best.

The Operation.
Plinius saith the bores blode brains also is god for the bits of ye
serpents / the liver dried mengyd with few drunk with wine that is god for
the nivenemige of serpetis His brain with the blode of his coddes is god to be
laid to carbucle sore / in the liver of the sow be little small stones that be
god to be braid asonder donke for the gravel the stone / ete the lights of
the bore it shall put from ye al dron benes / his gall megyd with rosen ceruse
heleth the crepinge sores or boils the ashes of his jaws heleth all crepinge
sores His bladder with peace al hanged in ye smoke dried that putt in mete so
taken heleth ye stone in the bladder takes away the totominge payne also a
little of the bladder or vryne mengyd in drink is very medecynable for the
dropecy / his dirt tempered in warm wine is god for the flixe / his yard
soupleth / warms / purifietythe limes that be stifened of cold or werynes /
the dirt that is warm and fresshe is very medecinable to stanch the blode
at the nose.

Of the ass. ca. v.
THe ass is a rude dull best of little understading / onclne slothful / he
has a cross upon his back there is he wekest / but on his hinder parts he
is strong / he has a great heed and lunge ears he loves thistellis better
than any other mete but he hath a lothly cry / and though he have gone a way
oftentimes yet he canat find it again / nor he will not exchewe the way for
nothing that meteth him / and he engenders with his female when he is.xxx.
months old She bears her yonges a hole year. the ass is cold of nature /
and he can abide no cold / Therefore be not the Asses cast in no cold lands
or contrees. The ass is very soon afraid / and he has no gall / and he
eteth grass and other erbes of the groude / and the more water that he driketh
the better fode has he of his mete / the a^the oftentimes a disease named
(...) / much ordour roneth out of his (...) / it fell on his lights he should
dye of it.

The Operation.
Auicenna saith the Ass has great virtue for they that sit in the water
that the ass is soden in / it heleth them of lepry the cramp or dry shroked
senewes / the flessh is god for the to be eten / the lever roasted etyn in the
morning fastinge is god for the puletis his flesh li^er or hove bret to
ashes men gyd with oil is god for the disease named scrofulas / the vryne of
the ass is god for ye payne in the kydnes Galienus saith the vryne of a
wild ass is god for the stone in the coddes / and it helps also
marvelously well the ronnynge or crepynge sore / The milk of an ass is god
for the drying coghe and also for them that spette or spew blode / the mylte
of an ass brayed with clean water and laid unto a woman's breast draws the
milk unto it outwardes / the milk of an ass doth swag the great styffe
belyes / also milk of a ass taken in the mouth of one that has weke gomes
and teeth doth strengthen them very well the liver of a tame ass eten / is
god for the epulentis which is the falling sekenes / the dounge of the ass
is very medecinable to stanch the blode at the veins or of any other wounds
the water of the donge dropped in the nose thrilles / staucheth the blode there
Plinius saith that if a ring be made of the hove or of the bone of ye asses
leg where as no black is on that p^ (...) on the finger of one that hath th^
^ge sekenes / they shall be preserved and not fall / Make a smoke of longues of
an ass in a house though there were never so many serpentis adders or snakes
or other venymous crepinge bestes / they should flee as fast as they could from
that place.

Of the Achame. ca. vi.
AChame is a best as great as an heart / and contrary the nature of all other
bestes he has his gall in his ear / and it is a cursed angry best.

Alches is a best that is in the forest of Hircinia and is very much like a
got / but it is somewhat bigger and it has crooked jagged horns / and they
have no joints in their legs as other bestes have / and when the huters will
have that best they follow him be the foot stepe to know where he rests be
night / for he stands and sleeps against a tree / and they louse the tree be
the rote and so dig it up or ellis they saw it a sonder / for he sleeps
fast and leneth sore against the trees wherewith he is oftentimes deceived and
falls to the ground / and so they take him or ellis they should never take
him for he is to dangerous to come by / and he is to swyft in conynge / but
when he is down he can not ryle.

Of the anabula. ca. vij.
ANabula is a best in Ethiope it hath a neck like a man fete like a horse /
legged like an ox / heded like a kamell / hath a goodly shinynge skyn mixed with
white spots the which conforteth the sight / it is right d^re sold. Aptalos
is another best like a little got very stinking no ma may come nigh him /
his horns be sharpe crooked like a sickle ^aged like a saw / when this best
hath thirst he gothe to the river of Eufrates and when it hath drunk than it
goth to a field where as much brosshe bramles be there he plays wallows so
long that he i^ that brush is warred so that he can not arise / than he
gives a load cry / and the hunters he ring him come incontinent and kyl him
/ his horns be so sharpe strong that he overthrows therewith great trees to
the ground. Aucinor is a best like a yonge graihoude and has better
vndestadinge when it is yonge than when it is old.

Of afferatos. ca. viij.
AFferatos be springynge and flyenge little serpents that hyde them in the
trees / and when there comes any body be those trees on the ways / than they
fly out with their venymous stings and they be red of colour they be so
marvelously hot of nature that whosoever be hurt with them must nedis dye / for
the bytt is so venymous that it roneth thorugh all the body the cure of it is
like as of the serpentt vipera. Affudius and Sabryne be ij. gray serpetis and
black vnd their heed with white spots / they have a slothful pace / and
their hole yt they bide in is black of their / foul venym / of their bit or
sting is on tempered all a mans body / for of all ye places of the body ye
blode spryngeth out the belly sweleth / the brethe shorteneth ye speech fails
/ ye lymes retcheth out styffeneth / the memory or onderstandynge is lost / the
teeth fall out / the {per}soon dies And this serpentis cure is like the cura
of the vipera.

Of the Amphibena Ca. ix
AMphibena is a serpent yt hath a heed a bouen and another at the tail / and
it goes with both the he / des togyger / and his body turned woude like a
cable / and it takes great though for her eggis for always when the one heed
slepith ye other wakens Armena is a serpent / and his operation is much like
to the basiliscus For this serpet kills not only with his bytt or stynge but
also with his sight and eke with his bast or blowing ^ for whosoever hears this
serpet blow must needs dye / and what best that he comes by can live no
longer and it is about ye length of.iij. quarters of a yard / for this strong
venyn is no cure nor help / but some say that there is help thereto that should
be with popy sede and castoreu / that is the stoues of a beaver. et^et.

Of Aspis. Ca. x.
THe Aspis is a venymous best or serpet / the which kyleth a man at the first
bit / and it is somewhat lass than the serpent vipera And there be many manner
of Aspis / as Dypsa / Ypnalis Prester / Seps. Aspis is a grene serpent and
has very lunge teeth like a bore / this serpetis abiding is in dry places
where as there comes no water /

(...) who so is bitten of this serpet aspis change their colours war defe have
great cold / their head swells their iyen swell they wax very slepy to the
venymo{us} bit or sting of this serpet is no remedi but make a plaster of
lyme honey / oyie. It is often taken with enchantemetis or sorcerye thorugh the
strength of this enchantmet he is soon wa^e of it / lays his one ^er to the
ground stops the other with his tail / he is sore desired for a precious
stone that is in his heed / and thrugh thenchantement this serpent is obedient
unto man / without any bytinge or venym casting they be taken and entreated as
a man list with out any payne.

(...). ca. xi.
THe spyner or spider is so named because it spinneth a great del of wel^e or
thread / it works always / when it has all done with a blast of wind it
tereth asonder and all the labour is lost that it hath do / the spider has
many fete at the lest vi. or viij. it sitteh i the midst of the web ready to
take such flies vermyn as comes in it / their moistour they suck thereby they
love / when they engender the female lies under with her belly upward / they
lay eggs of those eggs come yonge spynners the which spin incontinent.

The operation.
Plini{us} with Diascorides testefieth that the white and pure web is very
sovereign to many things / specially to be laid to a fresshe wound for it
stauncheth the blode / it kepeth it from swelling / frome filynge / it
conforteth the wound.

Plinius for the king o^ (...) of the spinner is god the brain of a capon with

THe Drago is ye grettest of all ser / pentes bestes / as Ysidor{us} saith in
Inde in Ethyope be many / he grows till he be.xxvi. cubits of legthe more /
when he is come to his full age or strength tha lives he lunge with out mete / but
when he begins to ete he is not lightely suffysed. Augusti. ye dragon
dwells in deep caves of the ground / and when he feleth any reyne coming
out of the air than comes he out of his cave or dene fleethe in to the air
bethe^ i the air in such wise that it seems to be a great tempest in ye air

heed but and he be dede or the stone be cut out than it is nothing worth for
than it leases his virtue / but they that will have ye stone ordain her^es
(...) him to eat yt he should sleep to th^ (...) that he should betaken / that

maidens or gentle women / and some hold that they be of those serpetis or
such like as Eua was begyled with of the devil for Beda saith that ye serpent
hath a maidenly visage / therefore the devil showed vn^ such a fair visage to

more desire to their engendrig than any other bestes on earth / for it is writ
that no best after that it hath received ye nature of fruit will have ado
more with his male or female / save only ye woman and ye mare / the horse may make
ye generacio till he be.xxxv. year old / and ye mare may bear here fruit till

womb.

these bestes ware wont to do god sruice in time of war for they be so strong
that they may fell down great stone walls / and they may bear a marvelous
great weight When the male will engender with the female than do they go
together towards the Orient parties as far as they can / And there they find
anherbe named Mandragora and thereof they ere both / but the female eteth first
/ and when they have eten thereof than they come by each other and engenders be
the way of nature when she shall cast her yonge than gothe she to a great water
casts it thereupon for fear of the dragon that is her ennemye wayteth to
destroy her and her young also for the which cause tother never departs
frome her till she be quite of her burden / the Olyphant lives iij.c. year.

hath a round foot like an apple / wherefore when he rests him he leneth to a
great strong tree and so reposes him and sleeps on his fete standige because
that his legs be so stiff and will not bow / the huters yt will have him do
mark the tree that he rests to / when he is gone these / than they get a saw
saw a sonder leueth it so stading / ye next time that he comes for to rest
him leneth to the tree / down comes ye tree and he together / and than he can

agreed / before honde that ye one shall stryke him the other defend him / have
a box or other vessel therein is red colour or wine / and that he yt is ye
defendour is all bespylt or sprinked with the same as if he hath shed his blode
for the ^liphate / when the oliphat spies that ye last man hath shed his blode
for him he follows him mekly is true obedient unto him in all his besynes
unto the death / and will not follow the other hunter which is unto us wrec^ed
^reatures a worthy esample for our lernyng / wherefore late us think in our
minds that we be the Olyphantes an think in our hertes what love this
onresonable best shows unto man for his good will yt he hath redeemed hy /
which was but a feigned matter / what ought we sinful ^reatures to think yt
the very son of god is descended frome his godhed and hath taken upon him the
nature of man for to feght against the first hunter that chased us that was
our mortal ennemye the devil of hell. O lord god there thou shed thy
most precious blode for our redemp^ion losed us from the bades of everlasting
dampnacion / where fore give us grace thate we may observe and keep thy
preceptis and commandementes / and that we may humble our self to laud and
thank the fore thy glorious wounds and passion that thou suffreddest and for
thy most precious blode that thou shed for the redemcyon of all mankind

The Operation

If a woman sytt over a vessel with fire and that there be of the grese of the
olyphant cast therein so that the smoke stryke upwards to her she shall nate

Thus is ended the first part of this present volume wherein we have treated to
the lawed and praise of almighty god of ye bestis and worms on earth with
their properties virtues / And now I shall treat to you of the birds of the
air and of their nature and properties the which be created of our saviour
cryst Ihu whom I call to my help in all my besines that he will give me grace
to treat of this matter a right.
Of the generation of the birds in the air.
Daily to us is showed ye graces of almighti god whereof we ought to give laudes
thanks to his glorious godhed for his Infenyte goodness and understanding that
he hath shaped in mankynde to have a parfyte ready knowledge of all erthly thiges
as it is to be perceived be this present volume and second Book where as we
find written of the generation of the birds or fowls of the air as here
after ensues. Ye shall understand yt divers Birds lay their eggs but ones
in the year / as birds that leave be ^ ^kes Go^hawkes Fawcons and such like.
Some there be that lay their eggs divers times / and bredeth often as downs
or hows henes / and those leave often times but a short season this is the
cause / for the mete that they ere is most part changed or turned into
sperma or nature / and of the sperma of the henes be formed the eggs / whereof
the moystest part is changed to the white of the egg / and the driest or
erthy part becomes yelowe and rownde / and lays in the midst of the egg
and is the yolke. And thereto doth the cock give the semynall or ye frutfull
spretes / and without the company of the cock the eggs be on frutfull / For
diverse times the henes doth lay eggs without to doing of any thing / or
bespringinge of any hene or kyssinge or smelling of any cock / or blast of
the Sothern wind / and all those be but wynd eggs and on frutefull. And the
hene desires not so much conversation as the cock doth / and therefore is one
cock sufficient among many hens Nota.

The white of the egg is moyste warm / and therein is repeded the fruteful
sprete of the cock thrugh the hete when the hene sits on the eggs / it is
changed on the third day or there about / For in the white of the egg be the
sharp end seems a drop of blode and thereof is made the hart of the cheken /
withi x. days al the lymes be made thereof is the heed greets / And in the
other x. days be the lymes stretched and expressly ordained and begins to
quicken bear life thrugh the grace of almighty god ^ in the shell it has the
heed upon the right foot / the right wing covers the heed / But they come
first into the world with the fete out at the sharpe end of the egg / And
out of the lunge eggs come the cocks / And out of the ronde eggs come the
hens.

Ambrosi{us} saith in exameron in ye fifte book xxij. chapter. That nature
gives to some bird shar{per} sight the one tha the other as unto the grypinge
birds / because that they a far of should se know their mete. And they that
fl allow be the ground have darker sight / they be nearer to their mete / the
birds have no teeth / therefore nature has given them nebbes. And the
grypinge fowls have crooked bills crooked claws to tear the flesh a sonder.
And ye water fowls have broad bills to take the fishes in the water / and
broad close fete for to swyme. And they occopye their wings to fl / and their
tail to stere them where as they will be / the birds do never pysse / For they
do drink but little / and it turns into their feders / There be divers
manner of birds that be unknown and also that be not in the memory.



Of the three parts or regions of the air.
HErause that we should show here of the birds of the air I will first write
unto you of the pleases or regyons of ye air and howe many regions there be
wherein they be suported. Ye shall understand that the air is divided in three
parts or regions of the air / As first the highest / the mydel most / and the
lowest. The vpermoste Region of the air is be the course and elemet of the
fire / is warm of the firye elementis and the sterres / that element is pure
like the fire / and in that highest regyon it is very styll there is nouther wide
nor rain as it has be proved of the that has been on mountains that
reched into the highest Element or Re / gion of the air / and on the highest
place of one of those moutaynes they wrote letters in the sonde went their way
and come again at the years end found those letters as perfyte and full comely
made as they were at the first hour yt they were written in ye sand.

Of the second element or Region of the air.
THe mydelmoste Region is very far frome the firye Regyon or element so that
it can take no hete of it And it is also to far frome the earth so that it
can take no hete of the radies or some beams / and it is a place full of
darkness tempest / And also a dwell / ling place of a part of those fendes
evil spretis that fell with Lucifer out of the kingdom of heaven / and there is
engendered the watery impressyous as snow / rain / hayle / such like.

Of the third element or Region of the air.
THe lowest region or part of the air is laid be the water and be the earth /
and that part is lighted and warmed through the bright shining of the soon /
and that fortunes more ye one time than the other according to the seasons of
the year.

THe Egle is a bird with sharpe talentis / yt which hath a sharpe sight / he
flies of a mighti heght above the watery clouds so hye that no man can se him
/ yet when he is at his most heght than sees he the fishes i ye water / as
soon as he spies the / tha descends he as swyft as an arowe out of a bow
grips that fisshe out of the water and bringheth it upon ye stronde / when he
is in his nest tha looks he in the radies or son beams teaches his yonges
to loke upon it also / And they that cane not loke upon it / them he puts
frome him with great on worthiness out of the nest / and he kepeth always one nest
/ that makes he upon ye highest tree yt he can find for fear of evil bestis /
serpetis / other fowls that might do the harm whilst they be young he
defends the till they be able to defend themself / when ye egle a far of
sees the serpete than she descends rashly festeneth with his ta / letis

here flees he in a cold water / and there he baptyseth him self.iij. times
in yt water / from thens flees he up to his nest by his yoges / and than he
plucks out all his feders and his yoges fetch him mete and fedeth hy till
that he be renewed and his feders again grown / and when the eggle has
brought up her yonges that they can flee get their leuynge than he drives
them away from him as far as he can / because they should not let him of his

watere to here the melody than they have among them an instrument of iron ye
which they feste in to the harde skine the weght of it synketh downward in to
ye fatagrese / suddenly with that al ye instruments of music be styll and ye
